   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>II.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>WIFE</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>"For the married woman is bound by the law to her husband while he is living; but if the husband dies, she is discharged from the law regarding the husband.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>So then if, while the husband is living, she is joined to another man, she will be called an adulteress; but if the husband dies, she is free from the law, so that she is not an adulteress, though she is joined to another man.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>So then, my brothers, you also have been made dead to the law through the body of Christ so that you might be joined to another, to Him who has been raised from the dead pay attention to this phrase , that we might bear fruit to God" Rom 7:2-4 .</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The Bible not only tells us that we are a widow in the world; Romans 7 also says that every Christian is like a wife.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>I wonder if we know the difference between a widow and a wife.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>A widow does not have a husband; she has nothing to rely on.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>A wife has a husband and someone to rely on.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Who should bear a family's financial responsibility?</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>It is the husband, not the wife.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>It is not normal for a husband to rely on his wife to support the family.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>A widow has lost her support in the world.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>A wife, however, receives all of her supply from her husband.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Brothers and sisters, do you know that our relationship with Christ is one of a husband and a wife?</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>All our needs are supplied by Him.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>We do not have to worry about how we can receive our supply for the month.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>We can receive all of our supply from Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>We may have a bad temper.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>We may be proud and cannot forgive others.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>We may be weak in our work and have no burden to pray or any taste for the Word.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>But, brothers and sisters, let me say that all these problems can be solved by Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Through the power of His resurrection, we can bear fruit.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>It is a universal custom that as soon as a woman is married, she immediately uses her husband's name.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>I wonder who can use Brother Chang's name.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Not his brothers, his children, or even his parents can use his name.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Only his wife can have the same name.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Many Christians do not see the preciousness in the words "in My name."</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>We do not realize how much blessing there is in the phrase "in My name."</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>We can receive whatever we ask in His name.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>We can cast out demons in His name, anoint patients in His name, forgive sins in His name, and preach in His name.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>What does this mean?</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Who can use the Lord's name?</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Some may think that when they cast out demons, all they have to do is say the Lord's name, and the demons will be chased away.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Others may think the name is used only as a formality when they perform baptism.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Let me ask: Can we go to the bank and draw money in the name of Brother Chang?</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>This name is his, not ours.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>We can only use our name.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>But praise and thank God that every Christian can do things in the Lord's name because we belong to Him, and all that He has is ours.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>He is the Christ, and we are His people.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Brothers and sisters, every Christian has the right to use His name.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The day we believed in the Lord, we were united with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Therefore, His name is ours.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>This is why we can pray in His name.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>We can do things in His name because we have been joined to His resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>There is nothing that we cannot acquire from God.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Just as a husband loves, cherishes, supplies, and supports his own wife, Christ does the same for us.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Let us remember that with respect to the riches of Christ, we are not a widow, but a wife.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>III.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>VIRGIN</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>"For I am jealous over you with a jealousy of God; for I betrothed you to one husband to present you as a pure virgin to Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>But I fear lest somehow, as the serpent deceived Eve by his craftiness, your thoughts would be corrupted from the simplicity and the purity toward Christ" 2 Cor 11:2-3 .</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>The Bible not only tells us that our attitude toward the world is one of a widow, and that our position with respect to the riches of Christ is that of a wife, but it also tells us that in waiting for the Lord's return, we are a virgin.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>This means that we need to keep ourselves chaste while waiting for His return.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Paul said, "For I am jealous over you with a jealousy of God."</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>We know the meaning of jealousy.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Because of Christ, Paul was jealous over the fact that some others had won their hearts.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>We belong to the Lord, and no one should snatch us away.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Suppose I have a friend who is engaged to a girl.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>While he is away, his fiancee turns her love to someone else.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>As his friend, I would surely become jealous.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>She should not have done this to my friend.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>For my friend's sake, I would become jealous over the fact that someone has taken away her heart.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Paul was afraid that their hearts would be corrupted from the simplicity and purity toward Christ, just as the serpent deceived Eve by his craftiness.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Every Christian should have an undefiled heart, one that has not been touched by anyone else.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Let us check ourselves today before God and see if we have lost the simplicity and purity toward Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>If there is a believer whose desire is not Christ but his own enjoyment, his Lord will not be pleased.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Brothers and sisters, today we need to say, "Lord, I am Yours.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>May You preserve my garment, my heart, my thoughts, and my everything as undefiled and pure.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Oh, may I be touched by nothing."</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>This is like the words in the Song of Songs, which say, "A garden inclosed is my sister, my spouse; a spring shut up, a fountain sealed" 4:12 .</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>The words "inclosed" and "sealed" are used again and again because no one should get into our garden.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Our garden is opened to our Beloved only.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>None can draw water from us and be satisfied.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>None can draw water from us and quench his thirst.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>The well and the spring within us are kept for Him.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>Brothers and sisters, day by day we ought to maintain such an attitude.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>We are for the Lord, and no one should touch us.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>Paul said, "Henceforth let no one trouble me, for I bear in my body the brands of Jesus" Gal 6:17 .</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>Oh, we bear the marks of the cross, and no one should trouble us anymore.</S>
