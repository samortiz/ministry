   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>LIFE-STUDY OF EXODUS MESSAGE FIFTEEN GOD S FURTHER TRAINING OF MOSES</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In this message we shall consider God s further training of Moses 6:1 7:7 .</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>After the first conflict with Pharaoh, Moses felt that he had failed.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>God had sent him to speak His word to Pharaoh.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>However, instead of hearkening to this word, Pharaoh became even more evil in his treatment of the children of Israel, and the people complained to Moses.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Moses, feeling defeated, complained to the Lord, saying, Wherefore hast thou so badly treated this people?</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Why is it that thou hast sent me?</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>For since I came to Pharaoh to speak in thy name, he hath done evil to this people; neither hast thou delivered thy people at all 5:22-23, Heb .</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Moses reaction indicated that he needed further training.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>God would not send him to Pharaoh again until he had received more training from Him.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>We have pointed out that God s calling of Moses in chapters three and four of this book is the most complete call in the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>At the time He called Moses, God spent much time with him, and Moses received both revelation and instruction.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>He took God s word and did all that God had charged him to do.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>However, things did not turn out as Moses expected.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>To his surprise, he was defeated, Pharaoh was victorious, and the children of Israel suffered all the more.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>This was the reason he complained to the Lord about the situation.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>In His further training of Moses, the Lord sought to impress him with His name and His covenant.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>He reminded Moses that He is Jehovah, the One who was, who is, and who will be.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>He also reminded him of His covenant with Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob regarding the good land.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>He told Moses that He had lifted up His hand to give the land to their seed.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>In speaking to Moses about these two matters, God was training him to know His person and His faithful word in His covenant.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>In addition to speaking to Moses regarding His name and His covenant, the Lord gave Moses further training concerning six other matters.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The first of these matters was God s word of assurance.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>We must pay attention to God s word of assurance, the word that He speaks to us again and again.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>If we would follow the Lord today to carry on His testimony in His recovery, we must learn to regard God s repeated word of assurance.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>But not many servants of God recognize such a word when it comes.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The second matter was the unbelief of the children of Israel.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>According to our natural concept, those to whom we are sent should be like the household of Cornelius, properly prepared and ready to receive our word.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>We think that if God sends us to speak to people in a certain place, their hearts will be open to receive whatever we may say.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Nevertheless, due to their unbelief, the children of Israel did not hearken to Moses.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Instead of being encouraged by the children of Israel, he was distracted, discouraged, and disappointed by them.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>There is a lesson for us here.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>If we are appointed by God to lead certain people, we should not expect them to be positive toward us.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Suppose God establishes you as an elder in a particular church.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Do not think that those in that church will be positive toward you or will believe everything you say.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>On the contrary, be prepared to face the unbelief of those to whom you are sent.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Thirdly, Moses had to be trained in relation to Pharaoh s stubbornness.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Pharaoh was not easily subdued.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>If we had been Moses in that situation and had had to confront the stubbornness of Pharaoh, we would no doubt have been very discouraged.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>In the fourth place, Moses had to be trained regarding his natural concept.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>This is seen in his cleaving to his uncircumcised lips and neglecting God s assured word.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>In 6:12 Moses asked the Lord, Behold, the children of Israel have not hearkened unto me; how then shall Pharaoh hear me, who am of uncircumcised lips?</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>This question caused the Lord to give Moses a lengthy word of assurance.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>But, even after that word was given, Moses still said, Behold, I am of uncircumcised lips, and how shall Pharaoh hearken unto me? v. 30 . This indicates that Moses was cleaving to his natural faculty and neglecting God s word of assurance.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>We have seen that neither the children of Israel nor Pharaoh hearkened to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Here we see that not even Moses hearkened to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>In His further training of Moses, God also spoke to him strongly concerning His ordination of him.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Moses had been chosen by God and commissioned by Him to be His representative.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Finally, God trained Moses concerning His strong hand and His great judgments 7:4 .</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Thus, the last item of God s training is God s hand, which backs His name, His covenant, and His word of assurance.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>It is this strong hand that defeats Pharaoh and the Egyptians and that convinces everyone, including the children of Israel, that God is Jehovah.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>On the positive side, God s further training of Moses covered five things: God s name, God s covenant, God s word of assurance, God s ordination, and God s strong hand.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>On the negative side, this training covered three matters: the unbelief of the children of Israel, the stubbornness of Pharaoh, and Moses natural concept.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>As sent ones, we all must know these five positive things and three negative things.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>We need to learn that God s chosen people are full of unbelief, that the enemy is stubborn, and that we are natural.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Nevertheless, we have God s name, God s covenant, God s word of assurance, God s ordination, and God s strong hand.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>After the further training given to Moses in chapters six and seven, Moses did not receive any additional training.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>It seems that Moses had graduated from God s training at the end of chapter four.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>However, he did not have any experience.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Due to this lack of experience, he had to undergo further training.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>In chapter seven Moses truly graduated from God s training school.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>In order that we all may learn from the further training given to Moses, let us now consider one by one six aspects of this training covered in 6:1 7:7.</S>
