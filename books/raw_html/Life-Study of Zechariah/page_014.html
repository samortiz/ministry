<H1 CLASS=SERIES>LIFE-STUDY OF ZECHARIAH</H1><H1 CLASS=MSG>MESSAGE FOUR</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>THE VISIONS OF CONSOLATION AND PROMISE</H1><H1 CLASS=PAREN>(3)</H1><H1 CLASS=SCRIPTURE>Scripture Reading: Zech. 3</H1><P>In this message we will consider the vision of consolation and promise in Zechariah 3. This vision is for the strengthening and assuring of the returned captives regarding the rebuilding of the temple of God in their distress.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>IV. THE VISION OF JOSHUA<br>THE HIGH PRIEST PERFECTED, ESTABLISHED,<br>AND STRENGTHENED BY THE ANGEL OF JEHOVAH<br>WITH ZERUBBABEL THE GOVERNOR OF JUDAH</H2><P>In the first four chapters of Zechariah, the Angel of Jehovah is taking care of five visions. This implies that Christ as God's sent One is always with God's people taking care of them. In chapter three we have a vision showing us that Joshua the high priest was perfected, established, and strengthened by the Angel of Jehovah with Zerubbabel the governor of Judah. Joshua, a most important leader among God's people, was under the care of the Angel of Jehovah. The way the Angel of Jehovah took care of Joshua was to measure him. Thus, the measuring in chapter two is continued in chapter three. Christ came to measure Joshua and thereby to take care of him.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>A. The Angel Showing Zechariah<br>Joshua the High Priest</H2><P>The Angel showed Zechariah Joshua the high priest (v. 1a). Joshua typifies Christ as the High Priest sent by God to His people (Heb. 3:1; 4:14-15; 7:26). Joshua represents and signifies Israel as a nation of priests (Zech. 8:20-23; Isa. 2:2-4a).</P>
