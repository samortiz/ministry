<P>The elders have to spend a great deal of time to stir up the brothers and sisters to have a heart to learn to prophesy. The elders must also learn to prophesy. If you have never learned, how can you teach others? In one locality, some of the Chinese-speaking sisters have been burdened to teach some of the other sisters to prophesy. They encourage the sisters to compose their daily inspirations into a prophecy. The sisters then present their compositions for correction to the other sisters teaching them. Sometimes their compositions are too long, or the point of their prophecy is not very clear. One sister who is more than eighty-eight years of age has asked another sister who is a little over thirty years of age to correct her prophecy. Once her prophecy has been corrected, she comes to the meeting and anxiously waits for an opportunity to speak. She likes to be the first one to speak. Whether or not her prophesying is so good or so rich, I do not care. What I care for the most is her spirit. If all the brothers and sisters in the different localities would have such a spirit, the meetings would be very high.</P><P>Today, however, most of the saints do not have a strong sense of the need to prophesy in the church meetings. They may come to the Lord's Day meeting for the Lord's table and the prophesying meeting, but they are very relaxed with little exercise of the spirit. Do you not believe that such a situation is an offense to the Lord? If anyone comes to meet with the Lord in the meeting without exercising his or her spirit, this is wrong. The elders' responsibility is to stir up the saints by telling them that it is altogether an offense to the Lord to come to the meeting in a loose way without exercising their spirit.</P><P>I have rarely seen a place where the elders promoted, adjusted, and improved the spirit, attitude, and preparation of the saints in coming to the meeting. In order to do this, the elders themselves must take the lead to be prepared. Their spirit must be high and ready. Then they will have the standing and the qualification to edify others. The elders should come to the meetings early. The way they sit in the meeting, their gesture and attitude, should be right. Because we are meeting with the Lord, we should not be so loose.</P><P>The elders must also bear the responsibility for the attendance in the prayer meeting. In some places, the attendance on the Lord's Day is one hundred, but the attendance of the prayer meeting is less than thirty. This percentage is typical throughout the churches. The elders must say something. The elders must struggle and strive. No crop will grow without plowing, sowing, and watering. The farmer's duty is to labor diligently. The elders must labor diligently in the same way.</P>
