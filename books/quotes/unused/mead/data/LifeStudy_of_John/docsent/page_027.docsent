   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>LIFE-STUDY OF JOHN MESSAGE SEVEN LIFE S PURPOSE II.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>LIFE S PURPOSE TO BUILD THE HOUSE OF GOD</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>It is quite interesting to see that in John chapter two we firstly have the case of changing water into wine 2:1-11 and then, following that, the case of dealing with the temple 2:12-22 .</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>We must believe that both of these cases were recorded for the purpose of signifying something beyond the mere account of historical events.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Why does the dealing with the temple follow the changing of death into life?</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>It shows that life is for God s temple.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>In other words, life is for God s building.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>In the incident of the Lord s changing water into wine, we saw the principle of life, that is, to change death into life.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Now, in the case of the dealing with the temple, we see the goal, the purpose of life, that is, to build the house of God.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>A. Jesus Cleansing the Temple</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>John 2:12-22 shows two aspects of the Lord s dealing with the temple the cleansing aspect and the building aspect.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Satan, the enemy of God, is always trying to damage or to frustrate the temple of God.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>He attempts to defile it with many sinful things.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>This is the reason that the house of God needs cleansing.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>1.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The Passover Was Near</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Jesus cleansed the temple at a time when the Passover of the Jews was near 2:13 .</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The Passover at that time was a remembrance of God s salvation Exo 12:2-11; Deut 16:1-3 through which remembrance the Jews worshipped God in their temple.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>But, when the Lord Jesus went up to Jerusalem, their temple was filled with oxen, sheep, doves, and money-changers.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>So, the temple needed a cleansing, and the Lord Jesus did it.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The Passover was a prefigure of our remembrance of the Lord 1 Cor 11:24-25 .</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>And we are the temple of God 1 Cor 3:16 .</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>It is very possible that when we come to the Lord s table to remember Him, we are filled with earthly things.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>So, we also need a cleansing that we may be the proper temple of God.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>2.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The Cleansing of the Temple a. With a Whip of Cords Made of Rushes</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Let us read John 2:14-16.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>And He found in the temple those selling oxen and sheep and doves, and the money-changers sitting there.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>And having made a whip of cords, He drove them all, both the sheep and the oxen, out of the temple, and He poured out the coins of the money-changers and overturned the tables; and to those who were selling the doves He said, Take these things away; do not make My Father s house a house of merchandise.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The Lord dealt with the house of God by cleansing it with a scourge or a whip made of cords.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The King James Version says that the Lord made a scourge of small cords, but some versions say that the Lord made a scourge or whip out of rushes, which are inexpensive and ordinary.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The Lord made a scourge or whip of ordinary things, of rushes, and used it to cleanse the temple.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>He drove out the oxen, sheep, doves, and coins.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>That signified the casting out of all earthly occupations.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>We are the temple of God, yet we are not filled with God.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>We are filled with so many things other than God.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Although we, as the house of God, should be filled with God, yet the fact is that we are filled with merchandise, money, and tables of the money-changers.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Therefore, the Lord must make a whip of cords to drive these things out of us.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Often, the Lord uses the ordinary and common things, such as the rushes, to cleanse us.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Sometimes He uses someone common to purge you such as your wife or husband, your parents or children, your employer or employees.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>We all have experienced the whip of cords which the Lord has made of common persons or ordinary things to purge us.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Sometimes the Lord comes to interfere with our lives by turning things upside down.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>He comes to cast out the sheep, oxen, and doves, and to overthrow the tables in order to bring confusion into the whole situation.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>For example, last year you gained a lot of money in business, but this year you lose everything this is a scourge that the Lord uses to purge you.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>With every seeking Christian there is always someone or something purging him.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Generally speaking, a wife who is a seeking child of God always longs for her husband to be spiritual and to love the Lord, but it sometimes turns out to be just the opposite.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>A husband who loves the Lord always looks to the Lord that his wife might be spiritual and love the Lord, but it is sometimes contrary to his desire.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Also parents who sincerely seek after the Lord and pray daily for their children sometimes suffer to see their children going astray.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>The scourge you experience is made by the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>If your husband or wife is quite spiritual, the Lord would have no scourge to purge you.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>If your sons are like Peter and John and your daughter is like Mary, there would be no rushes available for the Lord to make a scourge.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>If your parents are like Abraham and Sarah, nothing would purge you.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>On the one hand, you may daily enjoy the Lord as a feast, but, on the other hand, the Lord will send a scourge a number of times to purge you.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Many times the Lord will even use the brothers and sisters in the church as a whip of cords to purge away the merchandise and the money-changers that exist within you.</S>
