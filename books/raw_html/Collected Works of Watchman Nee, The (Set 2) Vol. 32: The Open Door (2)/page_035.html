<h2 class="head1">NEWS OF THE CHURCHES</h2><h2 class="head2">Tsinan, Shantung Province</h2><p>By the Lord's grace, I am forwarding X dollars for The Open Door, X dollars for the Lord's work, and X dollars for taking care of the needy saints. Please direct it as the Lord leads. May the Lord bless this little offering. May the grace and love of the Father be with you all the time. May the Lord bless and grace your work.</p><p>Brother Wang Bao-guang, July 9<br />[Address omitted]</p><h2 class="head2">Lung-Ju-Tsai, Shensi Province</h2><p>Dear brothers and sisters in the Lord:</p><p>During the past few years I have been working around Kansu and Tsinghai provinces. The Lord has been very gracious to me, and there is nothing I can say except to thank Him with full satisfaction. Two years ago I left the interior of Tsinghai and went to the area around Liang-Chow in Kansu province and have frequently witnessed the Lord's wonderful power. Last May I arrived at Lan-chou from Liang-Chow, and from there I went to south Kansu. I spent about a year in south Kansu. In April of this year, the Lord directed me to come to Shensi. Unfortunately, I am not that useful; my faith is not that strong, my love is cold, and my spiritual condition is dry. What a pity. Please pray for me.</p><p>Yet I treasure all the brothers and sisters I see along the way. I went to Sian on June 6 of the Chinese calendar. The Lord has been protecting me all the way, and I am safe. The meetings in all these places are under the Lord's blessing, and we thank the Lord for this! While I was in Sian, I read The Open Door and received all the news. It has indeed refreshed my heart. Please send me two copies of The Open Door from now on. If possible I would like to have back issues starting with Issue No. 3. Greetings to the brothers and sisters in the Lord.</p><p>Brother Hu Tien-en, June 28 of the Chinese calendar<br />[Address omitted]</p><p>(This brother is the co-worker of Duan Chai-ju. Thank the Lord that a few of them are zealously preaching the gospel in the provinces in Kansu, Tsinghai, and Shensi&mdash;Editor.)</p><h2 class="head2">Chuenchow, Fukien Province</h2><p>Thank the Lord. Despite the difficulty in the environment, we have received every issue of The Open Door. The news makes us feel that the Lord's love is ever deepening. Thank the Lord that through Him we can stand in the present grace by faith. In the past He has caused us to look forward to His coming with joy. In tribulation He has caused us to rejoice all the more. He wants our tribulation to beget endurance, our endurance to beget hope, and our hope to not be put to shame. May the Holy Spirit pour out His love in our heart so that we can feel His love and love Him. The brothers and sisters here are all under the Lord's protection and are living peaceably. May glory and praise be to our gracious Lord. We are forwarding X dollars to be used for the expense of The Open Door. Please accept it. In the future please send us thirty copies. There are many brothers and sisters who are scattered in inland regions, and if they ask for it, we can then send them a copy.</p><p>Brothers meeting in Chuenchow,<br />Yang Shi-chao and Wu Ren-jieh, July 16</p>
