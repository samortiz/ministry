   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>WHAT TO DO WHEN GOD SEEMS UNRIGHTEOUS</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>While our opposer is persecuting us, it seems that our God is not righteous, for He allows His children to be unrighteously persecuted.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>For example, John the Baptist was beheaded, Peter was martyred, Paul was imprisoned, and John was exiled.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Throughout the centuries, thousands upon thousands of honest and faithful followers of the Man-Savior have suffered unrighteous persecution.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Even today we are still undergoing unrighteous mistreatment.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Our God seems to be unjust, since He does not come in to judge and vindicate.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Often we have prayed for God to vindicate us.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Yet, many of our co-workers, faithful ones, have been imprisoned and even put to death.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Where is the living, righteous God?</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Why does He tolerate this situation?</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Why would He not judge those who persecute us?</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Because of this situation, the Man-Savior in 18:1-8 uses an unjust judge to signify God who does not seem to do anything on behalf of His persecuted people.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>What shall we do in a situation when we are persecuted and it seems that our God is not living, present, or just?</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>From this parable we learn to be a bothering widow, one who prays to God persistently.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Many times I have become tired of praying for the Lord to vindicate His recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>It seems that the more I pray for the Lord to vindicate, the less vindication there is.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Apparently, the Lord is not present or does not care.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>It seems that He is not righteous.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Nevertheless, I have learned that we need to bother God in prayer, that we should pray to Him persistently without losing heart.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>THE PERSISTENT PRAYER OF THE MARTYRED SAINTS</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>In Revelation 6:9 and 10 we see that this kind of persistent prayer is carried out by the souls of the martyred saints: I saw underneath the altar the souls of those who had been slain because of the word of God and because of the testimony which they held; and they cried with a loud voice, saying, How long, O sovereign Lord, holy and true, will You not judge and avenge our blood on those who dwell on the earth?</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>In figure, the altar is in the outer court of the tabernacle and the temple, and the outer court signifies the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Hence, underneath the altar is underneath the earth, where the souls of the martyred saints are.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>This is in the Paradise where the Lord Jesus went after His death Luke 23:43 .</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>It is the comfortable section of Hades Acts 2:27 , where Abraham is Luke 16:22-26 .</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Here we see that the souls of the martyred saints are crying out, How long, O sovereign Lord?</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>They seem to be saying, Lord, how long will You be silent?</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>How long will You apparently be unjust?</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>You are the righteous Judge.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>How can You tolerate the unrighteous persecution that is still taking place on earth?</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>How long, O Lord, how long?</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>This is the prayer from the unseen realm, the prayer from the martyred saints in Paradise.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>PRAYING PERSISTENTLY TO THE SOVEREIGN LORD</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>In Luke 18:1-8 we see the prayer from the visible realm.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>This kind of prayer is related to our enjoyment of the jubilee.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Often the children of those who are faithful followers of the Lord ask their parents why they are suffering persecution.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>They may ask, Since we love the Lord Jesus so much, why must we suffer?</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Usually the parents do not know how to answer.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>It seems to the children that the Lord whom their parents follow is not righteous.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>We also may wonder why we suffer, since we love the Lord and follow Him.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The parable in 18:1-8 answers our question.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>When our Husband is apparently absent and we are left on earth as a widow, temporarily our God seems to be an unrighteous judge.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Although He appears to be unrighteous, we still must appeal to Him, pray persistently, and bother Him again and again.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>We need to be careful in understanding a parable such as the one recorded in 18:1-8.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>We should not try to understand it in a natural way.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>On the one hand, this parable indicates that the Judge is sovereign.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>This means that whether or not He judges is up to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Seemingly without reason, He may either listen to the widow or not listen to her.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>This parable reveals that He is the sovereign Lord and that He judges whenever He chooses.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>On the other hand, this parable indicates that we need to bother the Lord by praying persistently.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>We need to say to Him, Lord, praying is up to me, not up to You.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>You never told me that I should not pray.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>On the contrary, You charged me to pray.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Therefore, Lord, I am praying now for Your vindication.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>The significance of this parable is profound, and we all need to know God as He is revealed here.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>We also need to see that the kind of prayer described here helps us to enjoy the jubilee.</S>
