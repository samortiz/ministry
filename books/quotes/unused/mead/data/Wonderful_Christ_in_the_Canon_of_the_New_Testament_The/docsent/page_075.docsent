   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE PROPER ORGAN, OUR HUMAN SPIRIT</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>If we argue with our mentality, we miss the mark.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>This is not the organ we should use.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>For the church we must use our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The church is a matter of the divine Spirit in the human spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>You could never hear my voice with your eyes.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>That is the wrong organ.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>You must use your ears.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The church is spiritual and mysterious.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>It can only be substantiated in our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>If there is an odor in the air and we exercise our eyes to see the odor, we will not see it.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Neither can we listen to the odor with our ears.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>This does not mean that there is no odor.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>It simply means that we did not use our nose.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>We did not use the proper organ to substantiate this substance.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Every kind of substance needs the proper substantiating organ.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>To substantiate a noise, we need our substantiating ears.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>To substantiate all colorful things, we need our substantiating eyes.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>If we lose our sight, we cannot substantiate any color.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>We all must learn to turn to our inward nose, our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>We need our spirit for the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>In Old Testament days no one with a flat nose could serve as a priest Lev 21:18 .</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Everyone serving God must have a keen nose.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>This kind of spiritual nose is a beauty appraised by the Lord S. of S. 7:4, 8 . Many people speak to me, but they cannot cheat me.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>I have an inward smelling nose.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>They may say Yes to me, but in the spirit I know that the tone is No. Where is our spiritual nose? We must learn to turn to our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>God is Spirit, and we must learn to worship Him in spirit John 4:24 .</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Even the words of the Lord Jesus while He was here on earth are spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>It is the Spirit Who gives life; the flesh profits nothing; the words which I have spoken unto you are spirit and are life John 6:63 .</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>We do have a spirit, and our spirit is where we have been born again.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>That which is born of the Spirit is spirit John 3:6b .</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>We must learn to use our regenerated spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The church life needs our spirit!</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The Lord Jesus was with His disciples for over three years, and they appreciated Him greatly.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>When He told them that He was going to die, they could not bear it.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>But He explained to them that His going was His real coming back.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Before His death and resurrection He could only be among them.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>He could not enter into them.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Therefore, He needed to take a further step that He might come into them.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>His going to die was not His going away; it was His coming back.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>It was only in this way that He could come back as the Spirit of reality to dwell in them forever.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>IN SPIRIT AND WITH SPIRIT</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>We must all realize that the Christian life is altogether a matter of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>It is not a matter of any doctrine or teaching, even from the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>I respect the Bible, but if the Bible is not taken in spirit and with spirit, it is just dead letters.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>I am not against the sisters covering their head.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>But whatever we do, we must do it in spirit and with spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Otherwise, it is just a dead form of godliness.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>When we touch the Bible in the church life, we must do it in spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>If there is no spirit, it is deadening.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>We simply kill ourselves and others.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>In like manner, we should sing hymns in spirit and with spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Otherwise, we should not sing.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Everything we do should be in spirit and with spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>THE LIFE-GIVING SPIRIT</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Today we are in the age of Revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Whatever we do must be under the seven eyes of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Then we are no longer in religion with doctrines, but in Christ, with the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>After Jesus accomplished His incarnation, crucifixion, resurrection, and ascension, He became the life-giving Spirit 1 Cor 15:45 and came back to His members in a mysterious and hidden way.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Now He dwells in us in such a hidden way Gal 2:20 , but it is more than real.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>From within He is going to transform us, replacing all our fallen elements with Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>This is His work and it takes time, but today He is doing it.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>This work is to build up the Body-Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>By resurrection, in resurrection, and with resurrection Christ was made the life-giving Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>He is not only God, the Redeemer, and the Savior, but also the life-giving Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Andrew Murray, John Darby, and M. R. Vincent, in their interpretation of the Bible, all admit that Christ is the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>How can you reconcile this?</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>I do not know.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>But it is a fact in the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>First Corinthians 15:45 says, The last Adam became a life-giving Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Second Corinthians 3:17 says the same thing: Now the Lord is that Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>John Nelson Darby in his New Translation of the Bible puts verses seven through sixteen of 2 Corinthians, chapter three, into parentheses.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>By this he is saying that verse seventeen is a continuation of verse six.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>The last part of 2 Corinthians 3:6 says, But the Spirit giveth life.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>This is then continued by 2 Corinthians 3:17, Now the Lord is that Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>By these two verses it is clear that the Lord is the Spirit that gives life.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>Thus Darby agrees that the Lord is the Spirit that gives life.</S>
