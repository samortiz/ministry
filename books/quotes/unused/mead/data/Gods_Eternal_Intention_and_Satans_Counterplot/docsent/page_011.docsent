   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>THE TWO LAWS</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Every life is a law.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Every tree is a law.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>The law comes from the tree.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>When the tree of life enters into us, it becomes a law.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>The tree of good and evil also becomes a law within us.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Since we have two trees growing within us, we have two laws, not as commandments but as set-up principles.</S>

   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Digestion is according to law, not activity.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>There are two laws working within us.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>One is Satan, called sin by Paul.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>"For the good which I will, I do not; but the evil I do not will, this I practice.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>But if what I do not will, this I do, it is no longer I that do it but sin that dwells in me" Rom 7:19-20 .</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>He is using the term sin in a personified sense here.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Like a person, sin can deceive v. 11 , kill v. 11 , dwell within vv.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>17, 20 , and do evil contrary to one's will v. 20 . This is Satan in our nature, in our flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>This sin is a satanic life within a satanic nature.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>It is a law, the law of sin and of death.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>It works within us by law unto death.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>But we have another law!</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>This law is the Triune God, after being processed through incarnation, crucifixion, resurrection, and ascension.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>He is now the Spirit indwelling our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>He is a law, the law of the Spirit of life, working within us not by activity.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>If a building has no electricity, we can have light only by an activity.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>Once electricity has been installed, however, it works by law.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>We do not need to beg the power plant to give us light.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>All we need to do is turn on the switch.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>Electricity is complicated, but once it is installed it is easy to apply and practical to use.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>The two trees in Genesis are the two laws in Romans.</S>
