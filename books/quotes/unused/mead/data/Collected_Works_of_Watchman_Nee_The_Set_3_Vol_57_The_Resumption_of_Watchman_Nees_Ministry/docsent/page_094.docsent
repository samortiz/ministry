   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Knowing How to Live in Abundance</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Taking Only What One Needs</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Chang Kwang-yung: Sometimes after I deliver a message, I feel hungry, and good food is placed before me.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>If I eat too much, it would be embarrassing.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>What should I do?</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>After working in a place, when I am about to leave, others try to give me gifts.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>What should I do?</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>If I do not accept them, the host is offended.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>But if I accept them, should I give something in return later?</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Watchman Nee: We have to know how to live in abundance.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>However, to live in abundance does not mean to enjoy abundance.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>I know when to eat and when not to eat.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>A person who is careless in eating is one who has never been restricted before God.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>If I really need a chicken, I can eat a chicken every day.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>If I do not need it, I could refuse if five chickens were served in front of me.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>In principle I eat only the portion served to me.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>When Satan sinned, he craved for the throne.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>When man sinned, he craved for food.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>It is not a matter of eating much or eating little, but a matter of eating what is placed in front of you.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>I will not make additional requests on top of what others are serving me.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>When we live among others, we should maintain our standing.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Otherwise, we will give others a bad impression about the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>When many young workers are about to be sent out for some work, I invite them to a good meal.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>That one meal determines whether or not a worker will go out.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Perhaps this is not a good thing to say, because the next time it will not be an easy thing for me to invite anyone for meals.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>CONCERNING RECEIVING GIFTS Accepting in Love and Sharing with Others</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Concerning the matter of receiving gifts, I can tell you a story.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>In 1937 I was in Manila.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>At the end of my stay, the brothers and sisters sent me away on a ship with a crate of fruit.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Inside the crate were one hundred eighty to two hundred pieces of fruit.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>If I spread out the fruit in my cabin, I could have almost started a fruit store.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>But by the time I left the ship and went on shore, I did not have one piece of fruit left; I had given it all away to the attendants.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Although they were not poor with regard to money, they were poor with regard to fruit.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>If I went home with two hundred pieces of fruit, what would others think?</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>They would say what a scene that a preacher would come back with so much fruit.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>No Need to Give Others Gifts in Return</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>If others give us gifts, we cannot give gifts to them in return.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>If we do, this kind of thing will never end. We cannot turn down the brothers' and sisters' love.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>But I would rather share with the poor such love.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>If others invite me for a meal, I would rather eat five bowlfuls and send the other five bowlfuls to the poor outside the door.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>TESTIMONY AND EXHORTATIONS</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Hsia Hsi-ling from Tientsin: The church in Tientsin began in 1936.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>By the grace of the Lord, we have been in one accord for the last twelve years.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>As long as there are two or three who are faithful, the testimony can be maintained.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Four major events happened during these years.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The first was the political turmoil, the second was the flood, the third was the war in Asia, and the fourth was the so-called North China Christian Alliance.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Presently, we have about one hundred people breaking bread.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Among them, two or three brothers are particularly living and fresh.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>The responsible brothers are Hsia Hsi-ling and Lee Pi.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Presently, we use the meeting hall for prayer, and the place is too small.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Watchman Nee's word of exhortation: We hope that Brother Hsia can leave his job and be free from the bondage of money.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Money should only help us in the gospel; it should not hinder the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>In assigning the co-workers we should take the most economical way.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>We must see that God is moving before we move.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>The work in Tsingtao should face west along the railway line.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>The work in Shanghai should face the direction of the Yangtze River.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>The work in Tientsin should face the east as well as the west.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>What we have at present should be strengthened.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>If some brothers feel clear to go, we should release them to go.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Brother Mak from Swatow: I began to learn to come into the service in 1940.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>I stayed in Sian for six years.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Presently, I am in Swatow.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>There are about three hundred saints who are in fellowship with us.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>We are short of brothers who can give messages.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Watchman Nee's exhortation: The Gospels contain the story of the woman with an issue of blood.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>There were many people at that time.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>The object of their touching was the same, yet the result of their touching was not the same.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Everyone was touching Christ, but the woman's touching was different from the others'.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Others may have touched His back or His arms.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>They may even have torn His garment, but there was no result.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>The same kind of people may be praying in tears; the same kind of people may be touching the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Everything may be the same, but the result is not the same.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>We have to see that there is another world behind the visible things.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>If we are not careful, we will become the crowd that was pressing against the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>There were many who were following the Lord and many who were touching Him.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>But only one person's touch resulted in a change in life.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>Outwardly, everyone was touching Him, but if one were to dig deeper, he would discover that there was another world.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>The woman touched the Christ whom no one else had touched.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>Even though others pressed against Him, the Lord ignored them all.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>The touching of others did not bring about anything, but this woman's touch brought about something.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>Today the Christians who are pressing the Lord will not be saved.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>Only those who are touching Him in a real way will be saved.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>Whether or not you have someone to give messages is not the main thing.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>Today many people who give messages are merely causing people to press against the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>What we need are those who are willing to pay a serious price.</S>
