<h2 class="head1">THE LEADERSHIP IN THE LORD&rsquo;S MOVE</h2>
<p>Now let us consider Apollos. There is not a long record of Apollos in the Bible. He was not dissenting, but he somewhat remained in another flow (1 Cor. 16:12). There is no hint that Apollos intended to carry on another flow, but whatever he was and whatever he did gave people a different impression. This is why after he worked in Corinth some could say that they were of Apollos (1 Cor. 3:4), and some were puffed up on behalf of Apollos against Paul (4:6). Apollos was not wise. If he had been wise, he would have never behaved in that way.</p>
<p>By the Lord&rsquo;s mercy, I can declare that in those eighteen years when I was involved in the work on mainland China, I was wise. I never caused anyone to think that they could be puffed up on behalf of me against Brother Nee. There was no such thing. Whatever the saints saw of me, my behavior, my way of living, my actions, the way I worked, my messages, and my speaking, they all considered to be absolutely one with Brother Watchman Nee. I did not leave any loopholes for anyone to think that I was different from Brother Nee. I believe that was the Lord&rsquo;s wisdom through His mercy given to me. Our history since that time speaks a great deal. Among so many co-workers of Brother Nee, where is the recovery? I did not have any kind of thought to be the one to carry on the Lord&rsquo;s recovery. Even when I went to Taiwan, I was definitely sent. That was Brother Nee&rsquo;s proposal to the co-workers. I never had the thinking or the feeling that I was going to be the leader. Even when I came to the United States, I did not have the thought of being the leader in the western world of the Lord&rsquo;s recovery. But where is the recovery today and under what kind of leadership? Some of the so-called co-workers claim that they were so close to Watchman Nee, but nearly not one church has ever been raised up by any of them.</p>
<p>It is altogether not wise for you to remain in the recovery taking this ministry on the one hand, and yet on the other hand to say something else. This is not wise. It is not profitable to yourself or to your future. You may say you have a ministry, but this is not profitable to your ministry if you have one. You can never profit your ministry in the future in this way. Rather, you have dispensed your future in a cheap way. The wise way is to stay, without any opinion, with the recovery which is unique.</p>
<p>I want to be faithful and frank, and I want to make the situation clear to all of you. I do not believe that my being here is altogether of myself. Rather, I believe that my being here is of the Lord. I want to see many of you rise up to be able to do the same thing that I am doing. I would never be jealous. I like to see this and I am for this!</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE ARMY<br />
AND THE CITIZENS</h2>
<p>Now you understand my standing, my heart, and where I am. Brothers, we need to be wise. We are an army formed by His mercy and grace to fight the battle for the kingdom of the heavens! The island of Taiwan has to be evangelized and truthized by this army within the next four years. For the fulfilling of this purpose, I would not tolerate any kind of dissenting thought. To be a citizen of the United States is one thing, but to fight in the United States Army is another matter. When Gideon was called to take the army to fight the battle for Jehovah, the Lord told him that he had too many (Judg. 7:4). Eventually, the Lord chose three hundred men and told Gideon to send the others home. This does not mean that whoever went back home was no longer an Israelite. He was still an Israelite, but he had nothing to do with the fighting army.</p>
<p>You may be a member of a local church and yet have nothing to do with the ministry to fight the battle for the Lord&rsquo;s interest on this earth. All of you are the elders, the co-workers, and the apprentice elders, the leading ones, in the recovery. I am speaking to you all as the soldiers in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery, not to the citizens. I am speaking to the soldiers of the army. Are you going to remain in the army? You have to realize what the army is and what the army would do. The army has no capacity to take your opinion. There is no time for the army to fool around. The situation is quite urgent. The intention of this heavenly army is to evangelize and truthize Taiwan first and then the United States.</p>
<p>One brother recently asked me if I could come to his part of the world to labor in a conference. His fellowship with me gave me the feeling that he is not fighting with us. My burden is to take Taiwan first and then the United States second. I do not care for any particular region on this earth. I am for the Lord&rsquo;s recovery and I have the view to make this strategy. To my observation the best strategy is to take Taiwan first. If you are only for your part of the world this may disappoint you, but if you are for the Lord&rsquo;s recovery you&rsquo;ll say, &ldquo;Amen!&rdquo; You may even have the burden to send some soldiers to join the army to evangelize Taiwan!</p>
