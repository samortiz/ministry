Concerning Dealing with the Lord</H2><P>Proverbs also speaks of dealing with the Lord.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD4>a. Fearing the Lord</H2><P>The reward of humility and the fear of Jehovah are riches and honor and life (22:4). Do not let your heart envy sinners, but live in the fear of Jehovah all day long (23:17). Blessed is the man who always fears, but he who hardens his heart will fall into calamity (28:14).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD4>b. Seeking the Lord</H2><P>Evil men do not understand justice, but those who seek Jehovah understand all things (28:5).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD4>c. Waiting for the Lord</H2><P>Do not say, "I will recompense evil"; wait for Jehovah, and He will save you (20:22).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD4>d. Trusting in the Lord</H2><P>Proverbs 22:19 says, "So that your trust may be in Jehovah,/I have made them known to you today, even to you." A greedy person stirs up contention, but he who trusts in Jehovah will prosper (28:25). The fear of man brings a snare, but whoever puts his trust in Jehovah will be exalted (29:25).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD4>e. Taking Man's Spirit as the Lord's Lamp<br>to Search All Man's Innermost Parts for Him</H2><P>The spirit of man is the lamp of Jehovah, searching all the innermost parts of the inner being (20:27).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>25. Concerning Dealing with Parents</H2><P>Whoever curses his father or his mother, his lamp will go out in deep darkness (20:20). In 23:22 the writer says, "Listen to your father who begot you,/And do not despise your mother when she is old." Whoever robs his father or his mother and says, "It is no transgression," is the companion of a man who destroys (28:24). Proverbs 23:25 says, "Let your father and your mother rejoice,/And let her who bore you exult."</P><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_031.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_033.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Life-Study of Proverbs, Ecclesiastes and Song of Songs &nbsp; pg 32</div><br></body></html>
