   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER FIFTY-FIVE HOLDING THE HEAD Scripture Reading: Eph 1:22; 4:15-16; Col 2:19 ONE</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In order for God to establish Christ as the Head over all things, He must first make Christ the Head of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>God must first make Christ the Head of the church before this headship can extend to include all things.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The future position of Christ in the universe has much to do with His position in the church today.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>God must first secure Christ's headship among His children, that is, in the church.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>This is why it is a crucial matter for Christ to be the Head of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Christ is the Head of the church, and the church is the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The whole Body is headed up under the Head.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Nothing in the Body can exist apart from the Head.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>If the Body is detached from the Head, the only result is death.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Every movement of a human body is governed by the head.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>If the head is injured and loses its function, the activity of the whole body will cease, and the body will not be able to survive.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The head is the hub of the life of the whole body.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>God's Word tells us that those who have the Son of God have life.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>A Christian receives life from the Lord, yet this life is never detached from the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Those who have the Son have life, yet this life is still in the Son.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>This life is never for a moment apart from the Son.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Without the Lord, we cannot live.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Brothers and sisters, God does not give us a piece of Christ; He has given us the whole Christ so that we may be tightly joined to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The power of our existence comes from Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>If we lose our fellowship with the Lord and if we move away from Him, we will immediately become lifeless.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>A Christian receives life from the Lord, and the life he possesses is still in the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>It is true that we have received life, but this life cannot be separated from the Head.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>After we have received Him, we must still abide in Him and trust in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Therefore, we cannot be independent in anything, because only the Lord is the Head and only He is the source of our life.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>TWO</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Christ is the life of the Body; He is also the authority of the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Since life is in Him, authority is also in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Since He is our life, He has authority over us.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Whenever we submit to His authority, we have life.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Every move of our body is governed by the head.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>For Christ to be the Head means for Him to have the authority in the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Brothers and sisters, if we see what the Body is, we will spontaneously come under the control of the Head.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The Body cannot move freely; it can only move at the direction of the Head.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Without direction from the Head, the Body cannot move.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The Body is under the authority of the Head; it cannot propose anything on its own.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The power to direct the Body rests with the Head.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Where life is, there is authority.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>In fact, true authority is life.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Since the Lord governs our life, He has authority over us.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Those who say with their mouth that they understand the life of the Body need to ask themselves further whether or not they are under the authority of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Whether we are under the authority of the Head determines whether we know the life of the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Toward God's Word, some have the attitude: "Although the Lord has said this, yet..."</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Who has given us permission to say "yet"?</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>What authority do we have to say "yet"?</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>In the world anyone who disobeys the command of his superior is lawless.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>If Christ is the Head, then we cannot be the Head and we have no right to disobey Him.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>What does it mean to follow?</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>To follow means that someone else decides your footsteps and destiny.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>This is the meaning of following.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>To follow the Lord means that you have no right to decide your own way.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Have you ever said to the Lord that He is the unique authority and that you do not have any choice of your own?</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>The only responsibility the Body has toward the Head is submission and obedience.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>If you want to live the life of the Body of Christ, you must cover your head and not have any opinion, proposal, or thought of your own.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>You can only submit to the Lord and allow Him to be the Head.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>If the Lord is the Head, no one else can be the head.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>You cannot be the head, nor can anyone else in the church be the head.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>The Body can only have one Head and can only submit to one Head.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Only Christ is the Head, and therefore, you must submit to Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>However, many times there are too many heads in the church.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>There are many human leaders, methods, and ordinances in the church.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Man wants to be the head.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Christ is the Head in heaven, and man wants to be the head on earth.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>When the "head" on earth agrees with the Head in heaven, there is obedience.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>But when the "head" on earth does not agree with the Head in heaven, there is disobedience.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>How wrong this is!</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>In the church only Christ is the Head; there is no other head.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>As long as Christ is the Head, no one else can be the head.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Brothers and sisters, have you ever said to the Lord, "Lord, You are my Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>I have no right to make any decision, and I have no right to choose anything.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>May You deliver me from being my own head and from taking anyone else as the head"?</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Brothers and sisters, we must all learn to receive orders from God.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Christ is the Head, and no one can walk according to his own will.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>It is a basic Christian experience to surrender to the Lord and submit to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>Acts 2 shows us Peter's preaching of the gospel: "God has made Him both Lord and Christ, this Jesus whom you have crucified" v. 36 . The minute he opened his mouth, he spoke about Christ as Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>Christ is not only the Savior but also the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>We all need to have the Lord as our Lord, and since we have all sinned, He must be our Savior.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>Consider Paul's experience when he was saved on the way to Damascus.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>The Lord shone His light on him, and he asked the Lord, "Who are You, Lord?"</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>9:5 .</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>Paul first saw Him as Lord and then believed in Him as the Savior.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>Brothers and sisters, if our eyes are opened, we will say, "Lord, I am through.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>From now on, take control of me; be my Lord."</S>
