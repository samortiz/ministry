   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>The Condition of the Meetings</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>When we first began meeting, to avoid being identified with all the other churches, either great or small we were only half a mile away from a denomination , we called ourselves the Bible Study Place.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>But this was slightly in error because our meeting should not be called by some local names or be named after a method.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Such a name was not really appropriate.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>In order to obey the truth, we took down and destroyed the sign that said, "Bible Study Place."</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Previously the Lord's Day morning meeting had a definite person to lead our worship.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Because the brothers were mainly immature, we had someone who was temporarily responsible.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>We no longer do this because we are afraid that it would become our habit to have a meeting in a person's name!</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>We used to have a Bible study meeting on the Lord's Day afternoon, but for several months we have changed it to a table meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>There are difficulties with meeting in the evening.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The word "to him who knows to do good and does not do it, to him it is sin" operated within us; therefore, we had no choice but to obey.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Thank the Lord!</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Recently there are two who desire to break bread with us, but because they are not clearly saved, we have not allowed them to join us yet.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Now there are twenty people in the meetings regularly, with fourteen who break bread together.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>There used to be only one offering box.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Now there are two.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>One is for the meetings, and one is for the work.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Those who have received the grace to be elders collect the offerings for both the meetings and the work, and they work with those who have the grace to be deacons to determine how to spend the money.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>We do not have to ask or check what they do.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>We also thank God that in October 1932 at 10 South Kuan a Bible study meeting was started on Tuesday afternoons.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Up to this year it has never stopped, no matter how busy the autumn harvest has been.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Now there is a meeting near the South Gate in Yuan Ling Shu's house Yuan Ling Shu is now in Anhwei Su County for the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>In the north of the city at the Tsue family farm and at the South Gate and South Kuan, there are home meetings every evening.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>South Kuan also has two evenings for prayer meetings Monday and Saturday .</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>On the Lord's Day, we all meet together in the Lord's name.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>There are hymns or teachings according to the leading of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>We worship God freely.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>We can all prophesy one by one, so that all can learn the truth and be encouraged.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>It is not in confusion but in quietness with temperance.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Hallelujah, praise the Lord!</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>He causes us to obey Him in all these matters, so that we may please Him.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>With Regard to the Work</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>We used to place much emphasis on the visitation work, but recently we have put equal emphasis on the gospel work.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Recently, we have gone to the Yu Family Farm.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>This is a small village with a strong denomination.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>There are many who belong to it.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>There are two deacons and one clerk.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>It is eight miles from the city.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Some people there received the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The most enlightened ones are Yu Bao Min and his father Hsiou Cheng.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Yu is free from prejudice or position, and he is about the same age as Ching Chou.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The meeting is in their house.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Although Bao Min has not been baptized, he is definitely a believer because he deeply believes the Bible and gladly receives all truth.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>In this village, there are those who have left the denomination and those who want to leave the denomination because they do not want to make donations or attend the Sunday worship.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>We have spoken with them and feel that the situation is generally good.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Ching Chou also visited the Hsueh's home about eight miles to the east of the city.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>According to flesh, they are relatives, but they are unbelievers.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>However, his cousins were receptive and learned to pray and give thanks before eating.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>There was a teacher in the village who was from Li Kuan Village.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>His name is San Min Tzu.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>He is twenty-two years old and is an unbaptized believer.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>He received the truth like Yu Bao Min.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Chin Chou was introduced by a cousin to Li Kuan Village this village is close to the Hsueh's home .</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>He went to his own relative's home and preached the gospel; then he went into San Min Tzu's house.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>It was a believing home, but they had been forgotten by the denominations.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>There was also a sister in the Hsueh's home that had been forgotten by the denominations.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Then he went to Nieh Hsien Village, which is a place we visit often.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Its condition was not very good because not many obeyed the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Then he went to Zao Wang Village, and many people received the truth, but unfortunately they received it almost as if it were a kind of philosophy.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Wang Ts'un Shu, who lives thirty miles to the east at the small rapids, has been reading the Bible by himself for three years.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>He has never been polluted by the denominations, and very few people have contacted him.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>He really is like a lily of the valley.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>In the villages of Chu Liang and Tuan Town these two villages are very close together with many women believers about thirty-five miles to the east of town are two people, Wei Ch'un Fang and Wang Hou T'ing, who were leaders of the denomination.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Because they entered the Pentecostal movement, they were rejected by the denomination.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>But Messrs.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Wei and Wang both received the truth to the uttermost.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>They came to the city and stayed for two or three days talking with us before they were clearly saved.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Thank the Lord for this.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Three miles south of the city in Nan Ma Fang, Chia Fu Ch'in twenty-four or twenty-five and his father, Wen Meng, both desire the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Chia Fu Ch'in was baptized when he was a teacher in Kao Mi County, but he does not understand anything.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>They have contacted us.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>There are a few people in their village who have also begun to desire the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Thirty-five miles to the west of the city in Pei Kao Yang, there are a few people who have believed the word for many years but who are just now beginning to understand salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>There are also the villages of Wu T'ai, Shih Fen Kuan Village, and Mao Chia T'un.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>Some there have just begun to seek, and some have believed in the Lord for many years but do not understand.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>Nieh Tao Hung is in Mao Wang Village to the west of Kuang Jao.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>He is now home.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>We do not know him but have heard Yuan Ling Shu mention his history.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>A few days ago we sent a letter to him.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>When we receive something from him, we will tell you more about him.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>In the area of the work, we feel that the harvest is great, but the workers are few.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>The sisters are even fewer.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>We also feel that we should not argue with those who do not believe the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>We should treat the older ones in the denominations as if they were our fathers, lest we place a stumbling block before them and deprive ourselves of the authority to preach the gospel to them again.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>We can now go in and out of the parish of the denomination freely and are welcomed by all the laity those without any position .</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>We only hope there is more prayer for the meeting and work here so that more people will be raised up to bear the burden, preach salvation, worship God, and remember the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>May honor and glory be richly given to the Lamb until eternity.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>Amen.</S>
