   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>PRACTICING THE DIVINE RIGHTEOUSNESS A Charge to All Believers</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In 2:28 John says, And now, little children, abide in Him, that if He is manifested, we may have boldness and not be put to shame from Him at His coming.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>This word is addressed to the little children, that is, to all the believers 2:1 .</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>This charge begins 2:28 , continues 3:6 , and ends 3:24 with abide in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>If we abide in Him, we may have boldness and not be put to shame from Him at His coming, at His parousia.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>This means that at His coming back we shall not be put to shame from His glory.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>But if we do not abide in the Triune God, continually living the divine life, then at the Lord s coming back we shall suffer shame, which will be a kind of discipline exercised upon us.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Then we shall be kept away from His glory.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Knowing and Practicing</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>In verse 29 John continues, If you have known that He is righteous, you know also that everyone who practices righteousness has been begotten of Him.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The first mention of the word known in this verse is the translation of the Greek word eidete, from oida, which means perceive with a conscious knowledge, a deeper inward seeing.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>We need to know in such a way that God is righteous.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>If we perceive this, then we shall know that everyone who practices righteousness has been begotten of God.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Practicing righteousness is a matter that is habitual and unintentional as a common daily life.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Hence, to practice the divine righteousness is to do righteousness habitually and unintentionally as our daily living.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>However, if we do righteousness intentionally with a purpose, that is not a matter of our common daily life.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Rather, it is to behave in a political way.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Someone may do righteousness with a purpose of gaining a position or a name for himself.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>That is to behave in a political way.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>But we Christians, as children of God, should be saturated with the righteous God so that spontaneously we live a life that practices righteousness habitually and unintentionally.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Instead of doing a particular act of righteousness for a certain purpose, we practice righteousness as our common daily life.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>This is an issue of the fellowship of the divine life and the anointing of the Divine Trinity.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Furthermore, this is an expression of the righteous God.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Through abiding in the righteous God, we are infused and saturated with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Then our living becomes an expression of the righteous God with whom we have been infused and saturated.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>This righteous God then becomes our righteous living, our daily righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>This practice of righteousness is not merely outward behavior, but the manifestation of the inward life.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>As we have pointed out, this is not an act done for a purpose; it is the flow of life from within the divine nature of which we partake.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Seeing What Manner of Love</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>the Father Has Given to Us</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>First John 3:1 says, See what manner of love the Father has given to us, that we should be called children of God; and we are.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Because of this the world does not know us, because it did not know Him.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>This verse is included in the passage which goes from 2:28 through 3:3.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>This passage is one paragraph on the righteous living of God s children.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>In 3:1 John refers to the divine birth and to the begetting Father.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Of the Triune God implied in 2:29, the Father is particularly mentioned.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>He is the source of the divine life, the One of whom we have been born with this life.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The love of God is manifested by sending His Son to die for us so that we may have His life and thus become His children 4:9; John 3:16; 1:12-13 .</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The sending of His Son is for begetting us.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Hence, the love of God is a begetting love, particularly in the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The word children in 3:1 corresponds to begotten of Him in 2:29.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>We have been begotten of the Father, the source of life, to be the children of God, the Owner of the children.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>We partake of the Father s life to express the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>In 3:1 John says, Because of this the world does not know us, because it did not know Him.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The Greek word rendered because may also be translated on this account or for this reason.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>For the reason that we are the children of God by a mysterious birth with the divine life, the world does not know us.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The world is ignorant of our regeneration by God; it does not know us, because it did not know God Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>It was ignorant of God, so it is also ignorant of our divine birth.</S>
