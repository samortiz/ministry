   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>BEING CONCERNED FOR THE LORD S RECOVERY</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>AND NOT FOR OUR OWN WORK</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Our full-time training should not have a purpose to keep the trainees in Anaheim to do a work in Anaheim or in Southern California.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>We should send them back to the places from which they came.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Recently I heard certain ones complaining that they spend much labor to gain people, and they send them to the training for four terms at a great cost, but eventually the trainees do not come back.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>They are retained in Anaheim.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>We should not convince the trainees to stay in Anaheim after their four terms.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>This is to be ambitious, to get people for our work and not for the work of the Lord s recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>I am not for this.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>I am for the Lord s recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The training I set up has the intention to train people from all the nations.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>I have strongly said that all the foreigners should go back to their country after being trained.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>A number of trainees from New Zealand wanted to stay, but I encouraged them to go back to New Zealand.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Some like to keep more people on the campuses in Southern California, but what about the campuses in other countries?</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Something wrong is hidden here, and some have complained about it.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Do not think that I have the intention to keep the trainees here.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>If I have such a concept, I should be condemned.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>This would mean that I am ambitious to get all the best ones to come to Anaheim.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Be careful; do not keep people for your campus.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The enemy does things subtly, so the Lord says, Watch and pray that you may not enter into temptation Matt 26:41 .</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>We are short of watching and praying, so the subtle one has come in to deceive us.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Some like to keep the good ones in their own city, and they complain that the training assigns too many good ones to the other cities.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>You may say, We are keeping the trainees so that we can gain more people.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>However, to the Lord every place is the same.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Whether He gains people in one place or in another is the same.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Why do you want to keep people in your place?</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>It is simply for yourself.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>This is ambition; it is something hidden.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Do not think that I do not love the church in your place.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>My heart is for the recovery, and by the recovery I mean the Lord s move on the whole earth.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>I am for the churches, not merely for one church.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Therefore, when I see these things, my heart aches.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>You must learn to condemn and reject your self to the uttermost and simply take care of the Lord s interest, of His recovery, and not your work.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Then the Lord will honor you.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>You do not need to go out to advertise.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>To the Lord money does not mean anything.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>If we afford Him a way, He will provide.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>After the Gulf War in 1991, we were ready to afford the Lord a way for His move in Russia, so right away He put His blessing upon us.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Where did the saints come from who went to Russia?</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Many simply wanted to go.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>This was the Lord s doing; it was not my doing.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>I did not go out to convince anyone to give, to go, or to pray, but many prayers were poured out for this move.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Now we can see the result.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Thousands of the leading cities in Russia, some with over one million people, have been reached by our publications.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>I have read some of the responses of the Russian people.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>They ask for more books by Brother Nee and myself.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>They realize that we are one, and they do not want others writings.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>As of this time we have sent seventy Americans and sixty Chinese, and about seventy Russians have been raised up locally and trained to serve with their full time.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>This is the result of the Lord s move, not the result of my work.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>I am not able to do this much.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>The Lord has done it.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>I have received many letters to which I did not reply, because I knew your concern was merely for your district.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>This is for your work, and I am not for that.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>The Lord is spreading widely throughout the world and around the globe.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Therefore, I would like to see that all of you are for the concern of the Lord s recovery, not for the work in your district.</S>
