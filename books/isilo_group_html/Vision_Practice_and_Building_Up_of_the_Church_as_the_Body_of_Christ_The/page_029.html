FOR THE BUILDING UP OF THE CHURCH</h2>
<p>The second main point in Ephesians 4 is concerning the gifts, that is, the gifted persons. The purpose of all the gifted persons ultimately is the building up of the Body. This thought can be found even in the Old Testament. Ephesians 4:8 is a quotation of Psalm 68:18, which says, &ldquo;You have ascended on high; You have led captive those taken captive; / You have received gifts among men, / Even the rebellious ones also, / That Jehovah God may dwell among them.&rdquo; Darby&rsquo;s New Translation reads, &ldquo;Thou hast received gifts in Man,&rdquo; that is, as man, in connection with mankind. When Christ ascended to the heavens, He was still a man, and in man and as man He represented man. As the representative of man, He received gifts from God, even the rebellious ones, so that Jehovah God may dwell among men. Even in the Old Testament there is the thought that the gifts which Christ received from the Father and gave to the church are for the purpose of building up a dwelling place for God. Christ in His human nature as a man, representing man, received gifts of men, and He gave them to His church that God might have a dwelling place.</p>
<p>All the gifts are for the building up of the dwelling place of God. The reason that many sects, divisions, and denominations have come into existence is that the gifted persons were not clear about this purpose. If we observe the situation and read the history of the church, we will find that most of the time, where there was a gifted person, a division was created. I do not like to criticize D. L. Moody, for example, because he did not carry out his work for a denomination. Today, though, we can still see a so-called Moody church. Many gifted persons were not clear that their gifts, or they themselves as the gifts, were not for their own work but for the building up of the church. Consider the situation today. Almost every gifted person has a certain kind of work. Their ministry is for that work, and that work becomes the center of their ministry. This is wrong. The center of the ministry must be the local churches.</p>
<p>According to the New Testament, the apostles did not carry out any work for their own ministry. Whatever they did was for the building up of the local churches. Some gifted ones may argue and say, &ldquo;We too are building up the church, not the local churches but the universal church.&rdquo; This is too much &ldquo;in the air.&rdquo; If we do not have the local church, how can we have the universal church? Is the universal church not on the earth? We cannot practically see the universal church. To build up the church is to build up the church in Ephesus, the church in Smyrna, the church in Thyatira, or the church in some other locality (Rev. 1:11). We do not find in the New Testament that the apostles built up only the universal church. What they did was to build up the local churches. If we pay our attention to work for the local churches, not our own ministry, then all divisions will disappear. This is not a small matter. Are you working for the local churches, or are you working for your ministry?</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE GIFTED PERSONS PERFECTING<br />
AND RAISING UP THE OTHER MEMBERS</h2>
<p>The third point in Ephesians 4 is that the gifted members do not build up the church directly. Rather, they perfect the saints for the building up of the church. We may think that we know how to work, but we may not know how to perfect the saints. It seems that we know how to preach the gospel, and it may be easy to teach the Bible, but as evangelists and teachers we may not know how to perfect others. I have seen a gifted person working in one place for thirty years, but not one person was perfected by him. For thirty years not one young co-worker or elder was produced. The one brother simply served as a &ldquo;pastor,&rdquo; not knowing how to perfect others.</p>
<p>The gifted ones need to raise up some elders and perfect them. A brother may be good &ldquo;raw material&rdquo; for being an elder, but a certain kind of work must be carried out on this raw material to perfect him to become an elder. In order to work as gifted persons, we must learn how to perfect others. If a gifted person notices that a certain brother is good material to be a deacon, he needs to perfect him, just as a carpenter works on his material to perfect it to become an item of furniture. However, not many gifted persons work in this way today. This is why a group may meet together for fifteen years under a single worker, without producing even one useful person. This is wrong. Consider the history of the apostle Paul. The more he worked, the more young ones were produced as his co-workers and the more local elders and deacons were established, trained, and perfected.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Putting Matters into the Hands of the Saints</h2>
<p>A brother may be sent by the Lord to work in a certain place. After two or three years, however, there may be only a group of people meeting around him. He may say that he has brought people to meet around the Lord Jesus, but in fact they are meeting around him. It may also be that not one elder, deacon, or deaconess has been produced. Eventually, this will cause a division, because the more that brother works there, the more the work is not for the perfecting of the saints and the building up of the Body but for his own work. In that case, that meeting will not be a proper church. It will be merely that brother&rsquo;s work. This may seem clear now, but after a brother works for two years, this may no longer be clear to him. There may always be the excuse, the pretense, that he cannot trust the saints. Because they do not know how to carry out things, he may feel that he has to do them. He will not be able to put matters into their hands, because he will fear that they will damage them. Therefore, he will keep everything in his hand, thinking that only he is the right person. In one sense, he may do this with a good motive, but he is wrong nevertheless.</p>
<p>We need to let the brothers do something. If they do it wrongly, they will learn the lessons. If someone has a small child, he should not say to him, &ldquo;You do not know how to walk. Because you cannot walk as well as I can, I will walk for you.&rdquo; Rather, he should simply let the child walk. We sacrifice many things for our children. Children break things and make mistakes all the time. However, to let them do things is worthwhile for the sake of their practice. In the same way, we should be willing to sacrifice things in the church life. We must consider the church to be a family with persons of every kind&mdash;old ones, young ones, babyish ones, stronger ones, and weaker ones. The church is not a college with a single high standard. If anyone is not up to the standard of a college, it will not receive him. We are not a &ldquo;college church.&rdquo; If we become a &ldquo;college church,&rdquo; we will be the strictest sect.</p>
<p>Some may say that if all the members function, the church will be a mess. Homes with children are often a mess. The more children we have, the bigger the mess is. This is not a bad thing; it is good. A brother may go to work in a place for two years. When we visit there, we would see a mess but we would say, &ldquo;Praise the Lord!&rdquo; This means that there is much practice and learning in that place and that the brother working there knows how to raise up and perfect the saints. After five years he will have the peace to leave that place, because a local church will have been built up there. This is the right way.</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_028.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_030.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>The Vision, Practice, and Building Up of the Church as the Body of Christ &nbsp; pg 29</div><br></body></html>
