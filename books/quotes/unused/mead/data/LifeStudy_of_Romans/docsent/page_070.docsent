   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>LIFE-STUDY OF ROMANS MESSAGE EIGHTEEN HEIRS OF GLORY 1</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In this message we come to the matter of glorification.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>What is the goal of glorification?</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The goal of glorification is the full sonship of the children of God.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Condemnation requires justification, justification is for sanctification, sanctification is for glorification, and glorification is for the full sonship of the children of God.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>I. THE BLESSINGS OF SONSHIP</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Before 8:14 the terms children of God and sons of God have not been used in the book of Romans.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The concept of children of God is only brought in at this point, proving that Paul wrote the book of Romans with a deep purpose in view.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Starting with 8:14 Paul begins to speak about the sons of God and the children of God.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>However, the ultimate concept of the section on glorification 8:14-39 does not concern the children or the sons, but the heirs.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>We may be a child of God without the growth of a son of God, or a son of God without the qualification for an heir.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Thus, Paul s ultimate concept in this portion of Romans concerns the heirs of glory.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Romans 8:14 says, For as many as are led by the Spirit of God, these are sons of God.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>This verse is a continuation of the foregoing portion in which Paul tells us that we must walk according to spirit v. 4 . In a sense, to walk according to spirit is to be under the leading of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Thus, verse 14 continues Paul s thought by saying that as many as are led by the Holy Spirit, or by the Spirit of God, are the sons of God.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>By means of this short sentence Paul turns the whole concept from that of the sanctified ones to that of the sons of God.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>At the end of verse 13 the thought was on the sanctified ones, the ones who were condemned, justified, reconciled, identified, and eventually sanctified.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>With verse 14 Paul introduces the concept of the sons of God.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>How are we sanctified?</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>By walking according to spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>In a sense, walking according to spirit means to be led by the Spirit of God, and as many as are led by the Spirit of God, these are sons of God.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>In this way Paul turns us from sanctification to sonship.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Now we have come to the matter of the sons of God.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>We need to approach the subject of sonship in the spirit, not in the letter.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>If we are in the letter, we will have difficulty.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Why?</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Because according to the letter all the sisters are excluded.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>How can sisters be sons?</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Paul did not say, As many as are led by the Spirit of God, these are the sons and daughters of God.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>However, we all, brothers and sisters alike, are sons of God.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>We must read the Bible not merely in letter, but in spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Although we are males and females, brothers and sisters, in spirit we are all sons of God.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>In eternity there will be no daughters, only sons.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>One day the Sadducees came to the Lord Jesus, arguing with Him about resurrection Matt 22:23-33 .</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>They thought that they were quite wise.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>They told Him about the case of a woman who, in succession, married seven brothers.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>After they all had died the woman also died.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Then the Sadducees asked Him whose wife she would be in the resurrection since all seven had been married to her.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The Lord said that they were wrong and knew neither the Scriptures nor the power of God.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The Lord said further that in the resurrection we would neither marry nor be given in marriage, but would be as the angels of God.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>We shall be wonderful persons with no difference between male and female.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>We shall not only be justified and sanctified, but also glorified.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>We shall all be glorified persons, the eternal sons of God.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>If we walk according to spirit, there is no difference between male and female, for we are all sons of God.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>However, we must not forget that we are still in the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>In the flesh we have male and female, husband and wife.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>We must not apply something that will be true in resurrection to the situation today.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>If we do that, we will have trouble.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Nevertheless, we all, brothers and sisters alike, are sons of God.</S>
