[1]  I have never met a servant of the Lord so balanced as Brother Watchman Nee.
[2]  The messages on the spiritual side are principally concerned with the matters of spiritual life, while those on the practical side are absolutely concerned with the practice of the church life, i.e., the way to practice the church life.
[3]  May we see the vision unveiled in the last seven epistles of the Lord to His church and hear what the Spirit speaks to the churches, that we may not join the Catholic Thyatira, nor stay in the Protestant Sardis, neither fall into the Brethren Laodicea, but absolutely remain in the brotherly-love Philadelphia, which is the church that has returned to the orthodoxy of the apostolic church.
[4]  CHAPTER ONE INTRODUCTION Scripture Reading: Rev 1 3; 22:7, 18-19
[5]  The apostle John's writings, whether his Epistles or his Gospel, were always the last in each category.
[6]  The Gospels of Matthew, Mark, and Luke were written regarding the behavior of the Lord Jesus on this earth, while the Gospel of John speaks of "He who descended out of heaven, the Son of Man, who is in heaven" 3:13 .
[7]  Revelation also shows us what pleases the Lord, what the Lord condemns, and what the Lord's way is for the church, when the outward appearance of the church is extremely confusing.
[8]  Indeed, the confusion on the earth does not affect the spiritual reality.
[9]  But the church in her outward appearance, at least, is confused.
[10]  John was the one who was closest to the Lord, because he leaned on the Lord's breast John 21:20, 24 .
[11]  The Son is in the bosom of the Father, and John was in the bosom of the Son.
[12]  Yet the day he saw the Lord, he fell at His feet as dead, because He is the Judge.
[13]  In the New Testament there is a fundamental principle: All of the children of God are priests of God.
[14]  In Exodus 19:5-6 God called unto the people of Israel, saying, "Now therefore, if ye will obey my voice indeed, and keep my covenant, then ye shall be a peculiar treasure unto me above all people: for all the earth is mine: and ye shall be unto me a kingdom of priests, and a holy nation."
[15]  God ordained in the beginning that the whole nation be priests, but the incident of worshipping the golden calf occurred not long after.
[16]  May God open our eyes that we may see more and neglect nothing.
[17]  How terrible were the persecutions suffered by the church in Smyrna!
[18]  But no matter what happens, life always revives after it has died.
[19]  The Jews spoken of here do not refer to the Jews in the world but to the Jews in the church, just as the "people" we saw before in connection with the Nicolaitans did not refer to the people in the world but to the laity in the church.
[20]  The Jews also have laws and regulations for their daily life God only uses the law to make men know their sins .
[21]  Whoever is a Jew must keep the Ten Commandments.
[22]  But the Lord Jesus says clearly that even if you have kept the Ten Commandments, you still lack one thing Luke 18:20-22 .
[23]  The purpose of the Jews in serving God is that they may reap more wheat from the fields and that their oxen and sheep will not drop their young but multiply manyfold, just as in Jacob's case.
[24]  But the first promise to the church is that we must take up the cross and follow the Lord.
[25]  The church does not teach how much we shall gain before God, but how much we will be able to let go before God.
[26]  The church in Ephesus was the church at the end of the apostolic age, the church before the apostle John passed away, the church which John himself referred to as in the last time, and the church spoken of in 2 Peter and 2 Timothy.
[27]  Then we saw in the preceding chapter, the age wherein the church was persecuted, which is the prophecy of the church in Smyrna as shown to us by the Lord.
[28]  In the previous chapter we read that the church of Smyrna was the church of suffering and that the Lord had nothing to say against her.
[29]  "But I have a few things against you, that you have some there who hold the teaching of Balaam, who taught Balak to put a stumbling block before the sons of Israel, to eat idol sacrifices and to commit fornication" v.
[30]  Balaam was a Gentile; we do not know why God also called him a prophet.
[31]  Immediately following Revelation 2:14, the Nicolaitans are mentioned again.
[32]  "In the same way..." these words especially form a link with the preceding words.
[33]  The Lord shows His disapproval of the teaching of Balaam; in the same way the Lord disapproves of the teaching of the Nicolaitans.
[34]  It shall not be so among you; but whoever wants to become great among you shall be your servant, and whoever wants to be first among you shall be your slave; just as the Son of Man did not come to be served, but to serve and to give His life as a ransom for many."
[35]  I believe this matter is what the Lord hates the most; therefore, we have to pay special attention to it.
[36]  Here I must especially emphasize that Ephesus came forth after the church in the apostolic age had passed away, and after Ephesus, Smyrna, and after Smyrna, Pergamos, and after Pergamos, Thyatira.
[37]  The church during the apostles' time has passed, the age of Ephesus has passed, the age of sufferings has passed, and the period of Pergamos has also passed.
[38]  In church history there were persecutions by the Roman Empire, and there were also persecutions by the Roman Catholic Church.
[39]  When the Roman Catholic Church in Spain persecuted the children of God, we do not know how many she killed.
[40]  We have seen that during the time of the apostles there was the behavior of the Nicolaitans.
[41]  But there is a good point here: In Thyatira we see the judgment of Jezebel, the casting of her into a bed that she may not move; we also see that her followers will one day be killed.
[42]  In Sardis the Lord says that His name is "He who has the seven Spirits of God and the seven stars: I know your works, that you have a name that you are living, and yet you are dead" Rev 3:1 .
[43]  The Reformation did not bring the church back to the condition of the beginning; it only caused the world church to become state churches.
[44]  Thyatira is condemned for putting the church in the world; likewise, Sardis is condemned for putting the church in the states.
[45]  On one hand, there is revival praise the Lord!
[46]  On the other hand, it must be rebuked before the Lord because it is never returned to the beginning.
[47]  The Protestant churches have revivals continuously, but the Lord says they are not perfect, they have not gone back to the beginning.
[48]  CHAPTER SEVEN THE CHURCH IN PHILADELPHIA Scripture Reading: Rev 3:7-13; Matt 23:8-11; John 20:17; 1 Cor 12:13; Gal 3:28
[49]  Although Ephesus was a church which had already slackened, it is on the same straight line, since the Lord acknowledged that the church in Ephesus continued the apostolic church.
[50]  To the church in Smyrna the Lord said, "That you may be tried" Rev 2:10 , while to the church in Philadelphia the Lord said, "I also will keep you out of the hour of trial, which is about to come on the whole inhabited earth, to try them who dwell on the earth" 3:10 .
[51]  Moreover, I have indicated how they represent a class of priests.
[52]  During this time there was a clergyman in the Anglican Church by the name of John Nelson Darby who was very dissatisfied with the position of his own church, believing that it was not scriptural.
[53]  He also met frequently with the brothers, although at that time he still wore the uniform of the Anglican clergy.
[54]  He was a man of God, a man of great power, and a man willing to suffer.
[55]  Walking one day with a brother as we were passing down Lower Pembroke Street, he said to me: "This I doubt not is the mind of God concerning us we should come together in all simplicity as disciples, not waiting on any pulpit or ministry, but trusting that the Lord would edify us together by ministering as He pleased and saw good from the midst of ourselves."
[56]  It would be a counterpart to Romish unity; we should have the life of the church and the power of the word lost, and the unity of spiritual life utterly excluded...True unity is the unity of the Spirit, and it must be wrought by the operation of the Spirit...No meeting, which is not framed to embrace all the children of God in the full basis of the kingdom of the Son, can find the fulness of blessing, because it does not contemplate it because its faith does not embrace it...Where two or three are gathered together in His name, His name is recorded there for blessing...
[57]  Because our table is the Lord's table, not our table, we receive all whom God receives, all poor sinners fleeing to the Lord for refuge, not resting in themselves, but only in Christ.
[58]  M. Panton said, "The movement of the brothers and its significance is far greater than the Reformation." W. H. Griffith Thomas said, "Among the children of God, it was they who were most able to rightly divide the word of truth." Henry Ironside said, "Whether among those who know the brothers or those who do not know the brothers, all those who know God have received help from the brothers directly or indirectly."
[59]  We thank the Lord that the problem of the church is solved by the movement of the brothers.
[60]  Paul says that in Christ there is neither Jew nor Greek, slave nor free, male nor female Gal 3:28 .
[61]  The church does not stand on distinction but on brotherly love.
[62]  In Revelation 3:7, as in the beginning of the other epistles, the Lord refers to Himself: "These things says the Holy One, the true One, the One who has the key of David, the One who opens and no one will shut, and shuts and no one opens."
[63]  I met a certain believer once on a train who asked me what kind of Christian I was.
[64]  "I come quickly; hold fast what you have that no one take your crown" 3:11 .
[65]  The Lord says, "I come quickly"; therefore, this church is to continue until the Lord comes back.
[66]  Thyatira is not gone, Sardis is not gone, and Philadelphia is not gone.
[67]  Since the Brethren did not pay enough attention to the fact that the church has the locality as her boundary, the "Exclusive Brethren" demanded unified action throughout in every place, resulting in breaking the boundary of locality and falling into the error of the united church; while the "Open Brethren" demanded independent administration of every meeting, the result of which is that there are many places that have many churches in one locality, thus falling into the error of the Congregational Church, which makes each congregation an independent unit.
[68]  The "Exclusive Brethren" exceed the boundary of locality, while the "Open Brethren" are smaller than the boundary of locality.
[69]  They forget that in the Bible there is one and only one church in every locality.
[70]  The words spoken in the Bible to the church are spoken to this kind of church.
[71]  God's Word clearly reveals that one locality can have only one church, and there can only be one church in one locality.
[72]  "He who overcomes, him I will make a pillar in the temple of My God, and he shall by no means go out anymore, and I will write upon him the name of My God and the name of the city of My God, the New Jerusalem, which descends out of heaven from My God, and My new name" Rev 3:12 .
[73]  We have seen the Roman Catholic Church, the Protestant churches, and the movement of the brothers.
[74]  Here the Lord speaks of Himself as "the Amen, the faithful and true Witness, the beginning of the creation of God" Rev 3:14 .
[75]  "And do not know that you are wretched and miserable and poor and blind and naked" v.
[76]  The Lord also speaks of buying "eyesalve to anoint your eyes that you may see" Rev 3:18 .
[77]  Buy eyesalve to anoint your eyes this is the revelation of the Holy Spirit.
[78]  In the Old Testament there are very clear prophecies concerning Judah.
[79]  So we should learn that regardless of the condition the church, whenever any church has a problem, if we are faithful before the Lord, we will discover what we must do.
[80]  Regarding what we have seen concerning the things of the seven epistles, we must understand that we are arguing concerning the problem of the system.
[81]  Please remember, all of the things in these seven epistles are related to the Lord.
[82]  If we know the Lord, we will condemn God's people who walk according to their own wishes; if we do not know the Lord sufficiently, we will tolerate their walk according to their own desire.
[83]  Our lack of faithfulness to the Lord is due to the fact that we still do not have revelation to know the Lord who condemns this as sin.
[84]  In this age God shows us four different churches.
[85]  We may put it in this way: There are the Roman Catholic Church, the Protestant churches, the brothers who love one another, and the Brethren Assemblies.
[86]  If at any time there is a brother saved in Chungking, yet the church in Chungking says he is not a brother, then the church in Chungking has become a sect.
[87]  Brotherly love means that we must love all the brothers.
[88]  If one has some weakness, that is another matter.
[89]  I say that all the children of God must be baptized by immersion, but I cannot say that because one does not do it this way, he is not a brother.
[90]  I do not know how you feel, but today there is one thing that makes me very happy: God did not cause me to be born during the age of Thyatira, a period of almost 1,400 years.
[91]  God also did not cause me to be born in the age of Sardis.
