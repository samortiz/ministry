   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Using the Recovery Version of the Bible</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>and the Life-studies</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In 1974 I received a burden to write footnotes for all the twenty-seven books of the New Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>I added footnotes to verses that, according to my own experience, were difficult to understand, difficult to expound, and profound in terms of the revelation of truth.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>At the same time, I felt that I should give messages to present the main points of each book as they related to the experience of the divine life.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Since 1974 we have conducted bi-annual trainings in the United States to release messages on every book in the New Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>These messages have spread throughout the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>After eleven years and twenty-two trainings, in 1984 the translation of the twenty-seven books of the New Testament was completed and published with footnotes, outlines, and cross references.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>In addition, Life-study messages of each book have also been published.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Over the past one thousand years, many books related to the New Testament have been published, and we have spent much time studying the important books; nevertheless, many of the published books do not provide much help.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>We have gathered together the main points from the important books and, using simple words, included them in the footnotes of the Recovery Version of the New Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Hence, as long as a person reads the footnotes and the Life-study messages, all the riches we have received will be displayed before his eyes.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>It is easy to understand the New Testament with the footnotes and Life-study messages.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The whole set of the Life-study of the Bible has approximately one thousand two hundred messages, and each message is about ten pages long.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Altogether, there are over twelve thousand pages, and it is quite profitable to read them.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>I hope that all the churches would utilize the Recovery Version of the Bible and the Life-studies to teach the truth to the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>I often tell others that if I could have been introduced to the Recovery Version of the New Testament and the Life-study of the New Testament sixty years ago, I would have spent much time to enter into them.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>If you are willing to spend eight hours a day for pursuing, you will be able to read the New Testament very thoroughly in two years.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>If you do not have eight hours, it is all right to spend four hours.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The brothers and sisters who are consecrated as full-timers must spend fours hours a day to fully get into the Recovery Version and the Life-studies.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>In this way, after four years you will enter into the revelation of the New Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Then everyone will be able to teach others and speak with inspiration for God to others, that is, to prophesy.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>With so many prophets and teachers, the churches in all the localities will be in a glorious condition.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>SMALL GROUP GATHERINGS BEING</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>IN THE NATURE OF HOME NURTURING</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Small group gatherings are in the nature of home nurturing.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The number of people who can gather in a home is usually not very large, and it is always sweet to get together.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Therefore, we have a burden to establish the small group gatherings.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>We should learn from the Lord s way and have a maximum of twelve in a group.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>When there are more than twelve in a group, they should be divided into two groups.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Since the number of people in a small group gathering is small, the nature of the meeting should be to nurture the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Rather than emphasizing the truth, the focus should be on nourishing, fellowshipping, shepherding, supporting, caring, and bearing one another.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Both educational and nurturing meetings are necessary.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>THE ARRANGEMENT OF EDUCATIONAL</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>AND NURTURING MEETINGS Joint Meetings for Education Supplying Life by Releasing the Truth</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The educational aspect of a joint meeting can be carried out with two kinds of meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The first kind supplies life by releasing the truth, and the second kind teaches the truth by expounding the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The first aspect of education can be accomplished by nourishing the saints with a life message at least once a week.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Such a message cannot be without foundation; it must be a living message, based on the pure word of truth, and be full of the light of life and the supply of life.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>All the saints will feel very satisfied after such a meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>According to my experience over the past decades, the best time for such a meeting is from 10:00 to 11:30 A.M. every Lord s Day morning.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Today in countries throughout the world, Sunday is a day of rest schools have no classes, factories are closed, and many commercial businesses are not open.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Thus, the brothers and sisters have time to listen to this kind of message.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Therefore, we should have ample time for a meeting on the Lord s Day morning.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>If the starting time is too early, it will create difficulties for the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>It also should not be too short so that there will be ample time for the release of the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Moreover, there should be time for the saints to share and give testimonies.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>All these matters should not be carried out in a hurried atmosphere so that every saint will receive help, light, and the life supply.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>These meetings cannot be conducted in a small group gathering; they should be held in the various meeting halls, and the messages should be released, in rotation, by brothers who can minister the word.</S>
