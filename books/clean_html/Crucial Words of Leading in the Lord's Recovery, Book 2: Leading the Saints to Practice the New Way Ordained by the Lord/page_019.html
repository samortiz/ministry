<h2 class="head1">NEEDING TO VISIT PEOPLE<br />
FOR GOSPEL PREACHING TO GAIN NEW ONES</h2>
<p>In the past few years of experimenting, we have discovered several factors that are important and effective in regard to preaching the gospel. The first factor is door-knocking. Compared to the traditional way of preaching the gospel, door-knocking requires us to pay a higher price. In the past, when we preached the gospel, all we needed to do was make a few phone calls to invite people. Now we need to go out personally to knock on people&rsquo;s doors. The experienced ones know that it is difficult to knock on the doors of strangers. Even if a stranger welcomes us into his home, it is not easy to begin a conversation. This requires that we pay a price; nevertheless, paying the price to knock on doors is guaranteed to be effective.</p>
<p>A team of three saints may visit people by knocking on doors. On average, out of twenty homes, they will be able to baptize at least one person. This is certain. Suppose that there is a church with one hundred saints meeting regularly. If twenty-five of them are divided into eight teams that consistently visit people for two hours every other week, they will be able to spend twenty-six weeks per year visiting people. If every team gains an average of one person each time they preach the gospel, they will gain two hundred eight people within one year. This would be wonderful! When a person engages in business, teaching, or a profession, he cannot succeed if his labor is inconsistent and intermittent. To be successful one must be regular, consistent, and continual.</p>
<p>In the process of door-knocking, we should not aim at being fast. Sometimes the Lord may be merciful to us and give us a son of peace, one who has a very good response, at the first door we knock on. In this case, we should not leave too quickly but should talk with him for as long as two hours. We can talk with him about heaven, earth, God, the Spirit, the Savior, or any other matter. As long as we do not annoy him, we should talk with him earnestly. According to the saying, we should &ldquo;strike while the iron is hot.&rdquo; We must grasp the opportunity to work. Our experiments have produced fruit; this is why we have the assurance to endeavor to go on.</p>
<h2 class="head1">NEEDING TO HELP THE NEW ONES<br />
BY ESTABLISHING MEETINGS IN THEIR HOMES</h2>
<p>If a team of three gains one new one every week, the team should take care of these new ones. It is easy for three people to take care of a home meeting. After a second week, they may gain another one. Then there will be two new ones. A week later they may gain another one, and thus there will be three new ones. As they gain more and more people, there will be a need for them to bring other brothers and sisters with them, who can begin to take care of the home meetings. In a church of one hundred people, twenty-five may knock on doors, and another fifteen to twenty-five may go with the door-knocking ones to take care of the home meetings. This should be easy for the saints to do because the price is relatively small. Moreover, since a home meeting has a fixed time and place, the saints simply need to join themselves to those who have been door-knocking.</p>
<p>After those who knock on doors have gained a good number of people, they should then bring some brothers and sisters who can take care of the home meetings. In this way they can have face-to-face fellowship with the new ones who need the care. The door-knocking saints can introduce their brothers and sisters to the new ones by saying, &ldquo;These are our brothers and sisters in the church. We three have gained many people through door-knocking, and we cannot take care of everyone. As a result, we have asked these brothers and sisters to help us. We want to introduce you to them. They will take care of you from now on.&rdquo; In this way, those under their care will be handed over to others. This is truly feasible.</p>
<p>One matter we need to pay attention to is that the first home meeting should be longer. If possible, within the first month we should have ten home meetings with the new ones; we may visit them every three days for ten times. These ten visits will be truly effective. After the first month, we may be able to reduce our visits to once a week; then after approximately three months, they will be brought into the church life. If three months are not enough, half a year may be sufficient. The new ones should first be brought into the home meetings; then through the small group meetings, they may be brought to the district meetings. This can be done within half a year.</p>
<p>We need to realize that if we are able to bring a person into the church life within half a year, this will have a very positive impact on the church life. In this way we will save much manpower so that many can continue to knock on doors and gain many more people. Based on these figures, if we are consistent, we will reap a hundredfold increase; that is, we will double our number within one year. Even if we do not double our number, a thirtyfold increase would be very good.</p>
