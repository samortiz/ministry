<h1 class="title">PREFACE</h1>
<p><em>Crucial Truths in the Holy Scriptures</em> was originally published in Chinese as a six-volume set containing sixty topics of basic truths in the Bible. The topics and verses were selected and arranged by Witness Lee, and these books were greatly used by the Lord in the early spread of the local churches throughout the Far East. Volume 3 contains topics 27 through 33. These messages have been translated from the Chinese.</p>
<h1 class="title">PREFACE TO THE CHINESE EDITION</h1> 
<p>In order for the children of God, especially new believers, to receive a greater supply of the Word, we, by the Lord&rsquo;s grace, wish to present some crucial truths in the Holy Scriptures so that the children of God may receive a foundation in the Word of God.</p> 
<p>These crucial truths, originally presented as forty-two topics, were studied by Witness Lee with the brothers and sisters in Chefoo. Later, in the autumn of 1949, Brother Lee studied them again with the brothers and sisters in Taipei and added eighteen topics for a total of sixty topics in all. Chapters 1 through 16 cover the condition of a sinner to the time of knowing his salvation. Chapters 17 through 60 examine various matters a believer should know and pursue after his salvation, with chapters 17 through 33 specifically covering ten matters a believer should practice after his salvation.</p>
<p>The purpose of these crucial truths is to make the matters of the Lord&rsquo;s salvation clear to those who lack an understanding of their salvation. Furthermore, they lay a foundation in the various aspects of fundamental biblical truths for believers who are clear about their salvation. The purpose is specific, but the messages are diverse.</p>
<p>The notes on these crucial truths contain much light that is precious and urgently needed by the children of God. We look to the Lord to inspire every brother and sister to read and study these notes carefully. We believe this will enable them not only to receive a foundation in the Word of God but also to receive manifold help in knowing the Bible.</p>

<h1 class="title">BEING FILLED WITH THE HOLY SPIRIT</h1>
<p>Being filled with the Holy Spirit is a great topic in the Bible, and it has been the subject of much debate throughout the past centuries. Thus, it requires careful explanation. We look to the Lord for His special grace to bring us into the truth concerning this matter through the Spirit of reality who indwells us. We need to pray for this, and we need to prepare our spirit and our mind. If we desire to understand and receive the truth, we need an open spirit and a clear mind. We must use our spirit to receive the truth because truth is received in our spirit, but truth must first pass through the understanding of our mind. If truth does not pass through the understanding of our mind, it will not be possible to receive it in our spirit. Thus, we need a clear and adequate train of thought. However, it is not enough to simply use our mind to understand God&rsquo;s truth. We must also use our spirit to contact the truth to touch spiritual reality. In addition to understanding truth with our mind, we must also receive the reality of God&rsquo;s truth with an open spirit in order to gain the life supply.</p>
<p>There is also a distinction between objective knowledge and subjective experience in regard to every truth. The significance of this distinction is great, particularly as it relates to the matter of being filled with the Holy Spirit. In the past and even now, some emphasize objective knowledge of this matter whereas others emphasize subjective experience. Those who emphasize the objective aspect place too much emphasis on the doctrine of being filled with the Holy Spirit. They use their mind to study the filling of the Holy Spirit, but they do not pursue the experience of being filled with the Holy Spirit in their spirit. Conversely, those who emphasize the subjective aspect pay too much attention to the experience of being filled with the Holy Spirit, but they completely neglect the doctrine concerning the filling of the Holy Spirit. They seem to use only their spirit, not their mind. Those who emphasize the objective side are rich in Bible knowledge but lacking in spiritual experience; consequently, they fall into emptiness and death. Those who emphasize the subjective side have an abundance of spiritual experience but lack Bible knowledge; consequently, they fall into instability and error. Therefore, we beg the Lord to have mercy on us so that we would place equal emphasis on both knowledge and experience to avoid the emptiness and death that come from being too objective and the instability and error that come from being too subjective. For this, we must exercise not only our mind to understand the doctrine and truth concerning the filling of the Holy Spirit but also our spirit to pursue the experience and gain the reality of being filled by the Holy Spirit.</p>
<h2 class="head1">TWO ASPECTS OF THE HOLY SPIRIT</h2>
<p>The Bible clearly shows that there are two aspects of the Holy Spirit in relation to us. People who have been greatly used by the Lord, such as Andrew Murray, C. H. Mackintosh (the author of <em>Notes on the Pentateuch</em>), and others, acknowledge this matter. If we want to accurately understand the filling of the Holy Spirit, we must understand what the Bible says about these two aspects.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Expression of the Two Aspects</h2>
<h2 class="head3">In</h2>
<p><strong>1. &ldquo;The Spirit of reality...shall be in you&rdquo;</strong> (John 14:17).</p>
<p>In this verse the Lord clearly said that when the Holy Spirit came, He would be <em>in</em> us.</p>
<h2 class="head3">Upon</h2>
<p><strong>1. &ldquo;The Holy Spirit comes upon you&rdquo;</strong> (Acts 1:8; see also Luke 24:49).</p>
<p>On the one hand, the Lord said that the Holy Spirit would be in us, and on the other hand, He said that the Spirit would be <em>upon</em> us. Being upon is outward, and it is absolutely different from being in. Therefore, the Lord&rsquo;s expressions show that there are two distinct aspects of the Holy Spirit in relation to us: an inward aspect and an outward aspect.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Promise of the Two Aspects</h2>
<h2 class="head3">The Lord&rsquo;s Promise of the Comforter&mdash;<br />
before His Death</h2>
<p><strong>1. &ldquo;I will ask the Father, and He will give you another Comforter...even the Spirit of reality...and shall be in you&rdquo;; &ldquo;But if I go, I will send Him to you&rdquo;</strong> (John 14:16-17; 16:7; see also 14:26; 15:26).</p>
<p>The Lord spoke these words to His disciples before His death. Before He left, He promised that He would send the Holy Spirit as the Comforter.</p><h2 class="head3">The Father&rsquo;s Promise of Power&mdash;<br />
Promised by the Father in the Old Testament<br />
and Restated<br />
by the Lord after His Resurrection</h2>
<p><strong>1. &ldquo;I send forth the promise of My Father upon you; but as for you, stay in the city until you put on power from on high&rdquo;; &ldquo;Wait for the promise of the Father...You shall receive power when the Holy Spirit comes upon you&rdquo;</strong> (Luke 24:49; Acts 1:4-8).</p>
<p>The Lord spoke these words after His resurrection and before His ascension. He repeated the Father&rsquo;s promise in the Old Testament concerning the Holy Spirit to His disciples, promising to pour out the Holy Spirit upon them as power when He ascended to the heavens. The aspect of the Holy Spirit as power is different from the aspect of the Holy Spirit as the Comforter. As the Comforter, He enters into the disciples, but as power, He comes upon them. Therefore, the Lord&rsquo;s promise before His death and His promise after His resurrection relate to the two aspects of the Holy Spirit.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Fulfillment of the Two Aspects</h2>
<h2 class="head3">The Lord&rsquo;s Promise concerning<br />
the Comforter Being Fulfilled<br />
on the Evening of the Day of Resurrection</h2>
<p><strong>1. &ldquo;It was evening on that day, the first day of the week...Jesus came and stood in the midst...He breathed into them and said to them, Receive the Holy Spirit&rdquo;</strong> (John 20:19-22).</p>
<p>Most people think that the Lord&rsquo;s promise concerning the Comforter was not fulfilled until the day of Pentecost. However, the Bible shows that the Lord fulfilled His promise on the evening of the day of His resurrection. On the day of the Lord&rsquo;s resurrection in John 20, the Lord came, stood in the midst of the disciples, breathed into them, and told them to receive the Holy Spirit. This fulfilled His promise concerning the Comforter. This was not the fulfillment of His promise concerning power, because that promise was spoken after this event but before His visible ascension in Acts 1:9-11. Some may ask, &ldquo;How could the Comforter come so soon? The Lord said that if He did not go, the Comforter could not come, but on the evening of the day of His resurrection the Lord still had not ascended.&rdquo; Those who say this have not read the Bible carefully. John 20 tells us clearly that the Lord ascended to the Father on the morning of the day of resurrection. When He appeared to Mary in the morning on the day of resurrection, Mary wanted to touch Him, but He said, &ldquo;Do not touch Me, for I have not yet ascended to the Father; but go to My brothers and say to them, I ascend to My Father&rdquo; (v. 17). He did not let Mary touch Him because He had not yet ascended to the Father. He could not be touched by anyone before He placed the freshness of His resurrection before the Father in His ascension. Eight days later, however, He allowed Thomas to touch Him (v. 27), which indicates that He had ascended to the Father on the morning of His resurrection. Consequently, He could give the Holy Spirit as the Comforter to the disciples on the evening of the day of His resurrection, fulfilling the promise that He made to them before His death.</p>
<p>Furthermore, John 7:39, which says, &ldquo;The Spirit was not yet, because Jesus had not yet been glorified,&rdquo; also proves that the Lord could send the Spirit after His resurrection, because He was glorified in His resurrection from the dead (Luke 24:26). He rose from the dead through the Holy Spirit, through which He was designated the Son of God in power (Rom. 1:4) and through which His disciples were regenerated (1 Pet. 1:3), making them His brothers and the Father&rsquo;s many sons. He was able to send the Holy Spirit as the Spirit of the Son into the disciples so that we could call His Father our Father (Gal. 4:6; John 20:17).</p>
<p>Thus, according to the Bible, the Holy Spirit as the Comforter came on the day of resurrection, not on the day of Pentecost. The Lord&rsquo;s promise concerning the Comforter was not fulfilled on the day of Pentecost but on the day of resurrection.</p>
<h2 class="head3">The Father&rsquo;s Promise concerning Power<br />
Being Fulfilled on the Day of Pentecost</h2>
<p><strong>1. &ldquo;As the day of Pentecost was being fulfilled, they were all together in the same place. And suddenly there was a sound out of heaven, as of a rushing violent wind...And they were all filled with the Holy Spirit&rdquo;</strong> (Acts 2:1-4).</p>
<p>This verse refers to the descending of the Holy Spirit on the day of Pentecost. This fulfilled the Father&rsquo;s promise concerning the Holy Spirit of power whom the Lord spoke of before His ascension. On the day of Pentecost the Holy Spirit descended in His aspect of power, not in His aspect as the Comforter. This was different from the day of resurrection. On the day of resurrection, the Holy Spirit descended as the Comforter. On the day of Pentecost, the Holy Spirit was poured out as power.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Function of the Two Aspects</h2>
<h2 class="head3">The Comforter Being for Life</h2>
<p><strong>1. &ldquo;Another Comforter...He abides with you and shall be in you&rdquo;</strong> (John 14:16-17).</p>
<p>This verse says that the Holy Spirit as the Comforter abides with us and is in us. This speaks of the Holy Spirit in His function as life. Therefore, the Comforter is the Holy Spirit in the aspect of life for our inward life.</p>
<p><strong>2. &ldquo;The Comforter...will teach you&rdquo;</strong> (John 14:26).</p>
<p>The Holy Spirit as the Comforter teaches us how to live before God. This is a function in the aspect of life.</p>
<p><strong>3. &ldquo;When the Comforter comes...He will testify concerning Me&rdquo;</strong> (John 15:26).</p>
<p>The Lord Jesus was the first Comforter sent by God (the Greek word translated as &ldquo;Advocate&rdquo; in 1 John 2:1 can also be translated as &ldquo;Comforter&rdquo;). He went back to the heavens and sent the Holy Spirit as another Comforter, the second Comforter. In reality, the Holy Spirit as the Comforter is the transfiguration of Christ. He is Christ in another form coming and living in us. He testifies to us concerning Christ, reveals Christ in us, and makes Christ known in us as our life. All these items are related to the Holy Spirit in the aspect of life; they are functions according to the aspect of life.</p>
<p><strong>4. &ldquo;The Comforter...will convict the world...He will guide you into all the reality&rdquo;</strong> (John 16:7-13).</p>
<p>Since the Holy Spirit as the Comforter is for our inward life, He will convict us and guide us into reality. Therefore, the Comforter&rsquo;s convicting and guiding into reality are also the functions of the Holy Spirit in the aspect of life.</p><h2 class="head3">Power Being for the Work</h2>
<p><strong>1. &ldquo;You shall receive power when the Holy Spirit comes upon you, and you shall be My witnesses&rdquo;</strong> (Acts 1:8).</p>
<p>The Holy Spirit descends upon us so that we may receive power to witness for the Lord. This clearly shows that the function of the Holy Spirit as power is not related to the inward life we receive from the Lord but to the outward work we do for the Lord.</p>
<p><strong>2. &ldquo;Proclaimed in His name to all the nations...I send forth the promise of My Father upon you; but as for you, stay in the city until you put on power from on high&rdquo;</strong> (Luke 24:47-49).</p>
<p>When the Spirit of power promised by the Father descends upon us, we receive power from on high and are able to preach the gospel of the Lord to the uttermost parts of the earth. Since the Spirit as power enables us to preach the gospel, it is obvious that His function in the aspect of power is for work.</p>
<p>The Holy Spirit as the Comforter is the Spirit of life within us. He is a person within us to be our Lord, the One whom we should obey. The Holy Spirit as power is the Spirit of power outside of us. He is outside of us as our power, the One whom we can employ. For our inward life God gave us the Holy Spirit as the Comforter so that He could be the Revealer, Leader, Supplier, and Maintainer of life within us. For our outward work, God gave us the Holy Spirit as power so that He could be the power, authority, ability, and skill of our work. The Holy Spirit whom God has given to us is truly complete.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Symbols of the Two Aspects</h2>
<h2 class="head3">Breath</h2>
<p><strong>1. &ldquo;He breathed into them and said to them, Receive the Holy Spirit&rdquo;</strong> (John 20:22).</p>
<p>When the Lord came to His disciples on the evening of the day of His resurrection, He breathed out from Himself and breathed into the disciples. This signifies that the Holy Spirit as the Comforter came out from the Lord and was imparted into the disciples. Breath is for life and signifies life. Therefore, breath is the symbol of the Holy Spirit as life.</p>
<h2 class="head3">Wind</h2>
<p><strong>1. &ldquo;A rushing violent wind...And they were all filled with the Holy Spirit&rdquo;</strong> (Acts 2:2-4).</p>
<p>On the day of Pentecost the Holy Spirit fell upon the disciples as power while they were in the upper room in Jerusalem. In this aspect, He was not breath as on the day of resurrection when the Lord breathed into them. Instead, on the day of Pentecost the Holy Spirit was like a rushing violent wind that blew upon them from the outside. This signifies that the Holy Spirit as power blew upon them outwardly. Wind is powerful; it symbolizes power. Thus, wind here is a symbol of the Holy Spirit as power, which is different from breath. When breath is mentioned, we think of life. When wind is spoken of, we think of power. We receive breath into us to maintain our life, but no one receives wind into him. Wind is a motivating power outside of us.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Record of the Two Aspects</h2>
<h2 class="head3">In the Gospel of John</h2>
<p>The promise of the Comforter is recorded by John in his Gospel (John 14:16-17, 26; 15:26; 16:7-15) and is also fulfilled in his Gospel (20:19-23); John speaks of the Spirit of <em>life.</em> The ministry of John concerns the word of <em>life</em> (1:4). He shows that the Lord came so that man could have life. He came to be man&rsquo;s life. The Lord gives the Spirit as the Comforter so that He can get into man as the Spirit of life and cause this life to become richly flowing rivers of living water. Thus, John speaks of the Spirit of <em>life,</em> according to the line of life. He also speaks of the promise of the Comforter and of the fulfillment of this promise. The promise and the giving of the Comforter are recorded and fulfilled in his Gospel. The events written by Luke in Acts are not related to the promise of the Spirit in the aspect of life.</p>
<h2 class="head3">In the Gospel of Luke and Acts</h2>
<p>The promise of power, which is recorded by Luke in his Gospel and in Acts (Luke 24:49; Acts 1:4-8), is fulfilled in Acts (2:1-4); Luke speaks of the Spirit of <em>power.</em> The ministry of Luke concerns the word of repentance and the forgiveness of sins (Luke 24:47). He tells us that the Lord came to redeem man from sin and to be man&rsquo;s Savior. The Lord caused the Spirit to descend so that He could be the Spirit of power upon man to cause man to repent, believe, and receive salvation for the forgiveness of sins. Thus, Luke speaks of the Spirit of <em>power,</em> according to the line of power. He speaks of the promise of power and of the fulfillment of this promise. The promise of power is recorded in the Gospel of Luke and in Acts, and it is fulfilled in Acts. The descending of the Holy Spirit recorded by Luke fulfilled the promise of the Holy Spirit in the aspect of power. The events written by Luke are not related to the promise of the Holy Spirit in the aspect of life. Many do not pay attention to this fact; consequently, they confuse the records of Luke and John to the point that they do not discern any difference between the aspect of the Holy Spirit as power and the Holy Spirit as life. Thus, in their knowledge of the Holy Spirit, they fall into error because of this confusion.</p><h2 class="head2">The Experience of the Two Aspects</h2>
<h2 class="head3">The Lord Jesus</h2>
<p><strong>1. &ldquo;Begotten...of the Holy Spirit&rdquo;</strong> (Matt. 1:20; see also Luke 1:35).</p>
<p>The Lord Jesus was conceived and born of the Holy Spirit. No one can doubt that the life in Him was fully of the Holy Spirit. Before He was baptized at the age of thirty, He was filled inwardly with the Holy Spirit. He was full of the Holy Spirit; thus, He was able to live for God and to be occupied with the things of God (2:49).</p>
<p><strong>2. &ldquo;He saw the Spirit of God descending like a dove and coming upon Him&rdquo;; &ldquo;The Spirit of the Lord is upon Me, because He has anointed Me to announce the gospel&rdquo;</strong> (Matt. 3:16; Luke 4:18).</p>
<p>The Lord was conceived and born of the Holy Spirit and His inward life was fully of the Holy Spirit. Although He was filled with the Holy Spirit inwardly, the Holy Spirit did not descend upon Him until His baptism. At the time of His baptism, the Holy Spirit descended upon Him. Prior to His baptism, He lived before God, but He was not yet working for God in His ministry. After the Holy Spirit descended upon Him, He began to work for God on the earth. These verses clearly show that there are two aspects of Lord&rsquo;s experience of the Spirit, an inward and an outward aspect. On the one hand, He inwardly received the Holy Spirit as life at the time of His conception and birth. He was filled with this Holy Spirit of life so that He could live before God. On the other hand, He outwardly received the Holy Spirit as power at the time of His baptism at the age of thirty so that He could work for God. Since the Lord Himself experienced the inward and outward aspects of the Holy Spirit, should we not as well? It is a pity that many have not seen this point and confuse the two aspects.</p>
<h2 class="head3">The Apostles</h2>
<p><strong>1. &ldquo;While the doors were shut where the disciples were...Jesus came and stood in the midst and...He breathed into them and said to them, Receive the Holy Spirit&rdquo;</strong> (John 20:19-22).</p>
<p>On the day of resurrection, the Lord breathed into the disciples, saying, &ldquo;Receive the Holy Spirit.&rdquo; The disciples certainly received the Holy Spirit at that time. The Lord&rsquo;s speaking was surely not an empty promise nor was the Lord&rsquo;s breathing into them merely a lifeless demonstration. The Lord truly caused the disciples to receive the Holy Spirit. After this event, the living of the disciples before the day of Pentecost was different, proving that the disciples had inwardly received the Holy Spirit of life and reality as the Comforter. Before the Lord&rsquo;s death they argued about who would be the greatest; after the Lord&rsquo;s resurrection and before the day of Pentecost, they met together and prayed in one accord for ten days (Acts 1:14-22). Furthermore, these Galileans were able to keep the Lord&rsquo;s commandments, staying in Jerusalem, a place full of opposition and threatenings, far from their homes and relatives. They had no concerns or fears. They simply waited single-heartedly for God to fulfill His promise. They could not have done this without being inwardly filled with the Holy Spirit of life. In addition, Peter, who rarely understood the Lord&rsquo;s words and could not clearly speak of them, was able to understand the Bible and to explain it very clearly even though he had not received the Holy Spirit in the aspect of power at Pentecost (vv. 16-22). This proves that he had the Holy Spirit of reality as the Comforter within him. The record in Acts 1 concerning the disciples&rsquo; experiences in the upper room in Jerusalem proves that they received the Holy Spirit as the Comforter and as the Spirit of life and reality before the day of Pentecost.</p>
<p><strong>2. &ldquo;You shall be baptized in the Holy Spirit not many days from now&rdquo;; &ldquo;You shall receive power when the Holy Spirit comes upon you&rdquo;; &ldquo;As the day of Pentecost was being fulfilled...they were all filled with the Holy Spirit&rdquo;</strong> (Acts 1:5, 8; 2:1-4).</p>
<p>Although the Holy Spirit entered into the disciples on the day of resurrection, the Holy Spirit had not descended upon them. Although they had the Holy Spirit of life inwardly, enabling them to have the Lord&rsquo;s life and the supply and sustenance of the Lord&rsquo;s life, they did not have the Holy Spirit of power outwardly, which would enable them to testify for the Lord and preach the gospel. Although they could live in the Lord&rsquo;s life and understand the Lord&rsquo;s word because the Holy Spirit of life and reality was in them, they were unable to release the Lord&rsquo;s life to others or preach the word of the Lord. For this, they needed the Holy Spirit to descend upon them outwardly as the Spirit of power. Therefore, at the time of His ascension the Lord commanded them to wait for the experience of the Holy Spirit of power, even though He had already given them the experience of the Holy Spirit of life on the day of His resurrection. They experienced the Holy Spirit of life inwardly, but they had to wait to experience the Holy Spirit of power outwardly. Even though they had the Lord&rsquo;s life within, they still needed to testify and work for the Lord outwardly. Their inward life was not enough to enable them to testify and work for the Lord outwardly; they needed outward power. They received this power on the day of Pentecost. On the day of resurrection the Holy Spirit entered into them to be their life, and on the day of Pentecost the Holy Spirit fell upon them to be their power. On the day of resurrection they experienced the Holy Spirit of life. On the day of Pentecost they experienced the Holy Spirit of power. Thus, their experience of the Holy Spirit also reveals the inward aspect of life and the outward aspect of power. This is very clear in the Bible. We should not confuse these facts.</p><h2 class="head3">The Samaritan Believers</h2>
<p><strong>1. &ldquo;Philip went down to the city of Samaria and proclaimed the Christ to them&rdquo;; &ldquo;They believed Philip, who announced the gospel of the kingdom of God and of the name of Jesus Christ&rdquo;; &ldquo;In whom you also, having heard the word of the truth, the gospel of your salvation, in Him also believing, you were sealed with the Holy Spirit of the promise&rdquo;</strong> (Acts 8:5, 12; Eph. 1:13).</p>
<p>God works according to principles. Ephesians 1:13 speaks of God&rsquo;s principle involving man&rsquo;s receiving the Holy Spirit based on faith. Once a person believes in Christ, he receives the Holy Spirit according to God&rsquo;s principle of faith. The Samaritan believers heard the gospel and believed in Christ. Therefore, according to Ephesians 1:13, they must have received the Holy Spirit. The sealing of the Spirit in Ephesians 1:13 refers to the aspect of life. Since the Samaritan believers received the Holy Spirit, they received the Holy Spirit of life inwardly.</p>
<p><strong>2. &ldquo;When the apostles in Jerusalem heard that Samaria had received the word of God, they sent to them Peter and John...so that they might receive the Holy Spirit...Then they laid their hands on them, and they received the Holy Spirit&rdquo;</strong> (Acts 8:14-17).</p>
<p>Although the believers in Samaria experienced the Holy Spirit entering into them inwardly as life through faith, they did not experience the Holy Spirit falling upon them outwardly as power until the apostles came and laid hands on them. Those who do not see the difference between the inward and outward aspects of the Holy Spirit with respect to the believers think that these verses show that the Samaritan believers had not received the Holy Spirit at all. They think that even though the Samaritans believed in the Lord&rsquo;s name, they did not receive the Holy Spirit until the apostles came and laid hands on them. This view is not correct. Since the Samaritans heard the complete gospel from Philip the evangelist and believed in this gospel and in the Lord&rsquo;s name, they must have received the Holy Spirit inwardly. To think in any other way is not logical. The Holy Spirit entered into them when they believed according to God&rsquo;s principle of faith. When the apostles came and laid hands on them, they had a further experience of the Holy Spirit falling upon them. This caused them to experience the outward aspect of the Holy Spirit as power.</p>
<h2 class="head3">The Ephesian Believers</h2>
<p><strong>1. &ldquo;In whom you also, having heard the word of the truth, the gospel of your salvation, in Him also believing, you were sealed with the Holy Spirit of the promise&rdquo;</strong> (Eph. 1:13).</p>
<p>Ephesians 1:13 was written to the Ephesian believers, and it says that when a person believes in Christ, he is sealed with the Holy Spirit. This clearly proves that these believers received the Holy Spirit of life when they believed in the Lord.</p>
<p><strong>2. &ldquo;Believe...into Jesus. And when they heard this, they were baptized into the name of the Lord Jesus. And when Paul laid his hands on them, the Holy Spirit came upon them&rdquo;</strong> (Acts 19:4-6).</p>
<p>The experience of the Ephesian believers was similar to the experience of the Samaritan believers. When the Ephesians believed into Jesus, the Holy Spirit entered into them, but the Holy Spirit did not come upon them until Paul laid his hands on them. We must pay attention to the phrases <em>fallen upon</em> in Acts 8:16 and <em>came upon</em> in 19:6. These phrases are very specific expressions; they do not refer to the Holy Spirit entering into the believers in Samaria and Ephesus as the Spirit of life. They refer to the Holy Spirit coming upon them outwardly as the Spirit of power.</p>
<p>Paul, when he was known as Saul of Tarsus, first experienced the Holy Spirit inwardly and then experienced the Holy Spirit outwardly three days later (9:5-18). When he was enlightened by the Lord and received the Lord on the road to Damascus, he surely received the Holy Spirit of life. He received the outward filling of the Holy Spirit, however, three days later when Ananias came and laid hands on him. According to the record of the Bible, those of the household of Cornelius were the only ones who simultaneously experienced the inward and outward filling of the Holy Spirit (10:43-48). When they heard Peter say, &ldquo;Through His name everyone who believes into Him will receive forgiveness of sins,&rdquo; they immediately believed in their hearts. Therefore, the Holy Spirit fell upon them at that moment. In order for the Holy Spirit to fall on them, the Holy Spirit must have entered into them. Thus, they simultaneously experienced the inward and outward aspects of the Holy Spirit.</p>
<p>These examples in the Bible show that there are two aspects of the Holy Spirit; the first aspect is related to inward life, and the second aspect is related to outward power. Our experience of the Holy Spirit, therefore, is related to these two aspects. For example, we often meet believers who have the Holy Spirit inwardly but not outwardly. Even many who love and pursue the Lord do not have the Holy Spirit outwardly. They are very good in the aspect of life. They are holy and godly with a proper human living and a careful manner in doing things, but they lack much in the aspect of power. When there is a need to testify for the Lord, they become fearful and withdraw, and they are not released and have no power to testify for the Lord. Other believers, however, who are released and bold and who seemingly preach the gospel with power, are lacking in the inward life. It is possible to pay attention to life and neglect power, and it is possible to focus on power but neglect life. We should place an equal emphasis on both aspects. We should not pay attention to just the inward aspect of life and overlook the outward aspect of power. Neither should we emphasize the outward aspect of power but overlook the inward aspect of life. We must emphasize both aspects equally, paying attention to both the inward and the outward, pursuing both life and power. In this way, our condition will be proper and normal.</p>
<p>Twenty years ago in northern China, many Christians received the outpouring of the Holy Spirit. Those who received the outpouring began to teach that if a person did not receive the outpouring of the Holy Spirit, he had not received the Holy Spirit. They overemphasized the outward aspect of power but overlooked and even denied the inward aspect of life because of ignorance. Consequently, their life was immature and shallow. They also made many mistakes despite the fact that they were burning, bold, and seemed to have much power. At this same time, a group of pious believers who loved the Lord began to oppose this teaching. They said that a believer needs only to obey the Holy Spirit in order to be filled with the Holy Spirit because a believer receives the Holy Spirit when he believes in the Lord. Thus, they said that there is no need to pursue the outpouring of the Holy Spirit. They considered the teaching about the outpouring of the Spirit as a false doctrine. These brothers overemphasized the inward aspect of life and neglected and even opposed the outward aspect of power because of ignorance. Therefore, they lacked zeal and power and did not obtain many positive results in their work for the Lord even though their living was holy and their faith was pious. The first group accused the second group of keeping dead doctrines. The second group accused the first group of preaching an erroneous, even a fanatical heresy. When viewing their actions according to the light in the Bible concerning the two aspects of the Holy Spirit, each group emphasized only one aspect. This should be a warning to not overemphasize either aspect. We must pay attention to the aspects of life and power as they relate to the Holy Spirit. We should check to see if we are lacking in either aspect, and if we are, we should pursue this lack in order to be balanced.</p><h2 class="head1">THE INWARD FILLING</h2>
<p>Since there is an inward and an outward aspect in the Holy Spirit&rsquo;s relationship with the believers, there is an inward and an outward aspect to being filled with the Holy Spirit. The different aspects of the filling of the Holy Spirit are even referenced in the New Testament with different words in Greek. These words were chosen by the Holy Spirit. In Greek two different words are used to speak of the Holy Spirit&rsquo;s inward filling and the Holy Spirit&rsquo;s outward filling. When the Bible speaks of the inward filling of the Holy Spirit, it uses the word <em>pleroo.</em> The original meaning of this word is &ldquo;to fill,&rdquo; as when water or air fills a vessel. Therefore, it refers to the Holy Spirit&rsquo;s inward filling.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Lord&rsquo;s Commandment</h2>
<p><strong>1. &ldquo;Be filled in spirit&rdquo;</strong> (Eph. 5:18).</p>
<p>This verse speaks of the Holy Spirit&rsquo;s inward filling. According to the Lord&rsquo;s commandment in the Bible, the believers are charged to <em>be filled</em> in spirit. When we are filled with the Holy Spirit, we are following the Lord&rsquo;s commandment. If we are not filled inwardly, we are disobeying the Lord&rsquo;s commandment. We should pursue the inward filling of the Holy Spirit.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Inward Filling of the Holy Spirit<br />
Being for Spiritual Living and<br />
Causing Our Spiritual Life to Mature</h2>
<p>Being filled inwardly by the Holy Spirit is for spiritual living, and it causes our spiritual life to mature. This is the spontaneous function of the Holy Spirit&rsquo;s inward filling. If we are not filled with the Holy Spirit inwardly, we cannot have a daily life that is according to the Spirit, and it will be impossible for our spiritual life to mature. Both a spiritual living and spiritual maturity depend upon our being filled with the Holy Spirit inwardly.</p>
<p><strong>1. &ldquo;The disciples were filled with joy and with the Holy Spirit&rdquo;</strong> (Acts 13:52).</p>
<p>The early disciples were filled with joy and with the Holy Spirit. Joy comes out of life, and it is expressed through living. Therefore, the filling of the Holy Spirit in this verse refers to the inward aspect of life, which is for life and living.</p>
<p><strong>2. &ldquo;Look therefore carefully how you walk...Understand what the will of the Lord is. And do not be drunk with wine...but be filled in spirit,...being subject to one another in the fear of Christ&rdquo;</strong> (Eph. 5:15-21).</p>
<p>The conditions spoken of in these verses, including walking carefully, understanding the will of the Lord, not being drunk with wine, fearing Christ, and being subject to one another in the fear of Christ, are all part of a spiritual living. Therefore, there is an aspect of being filled with the Holy Spirit that is related to our spiritual living. We must be filled with the Holy Spirit inwardly, allow the Holy Spirit to have the authority, and receive the discipline of the Holy Spirit so that we can have a spiritual living that is pleasing to God.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Being Full of the Spirit after Being Filled<br />
with the Holy Spirit Inwardly</h2>
<p><strong>1. &ldquo;Jesus, full of the Holy Spirit...was led by the Spirit in the wilderness, while being tempted for forty days&rdquo;</strong> (Luke 4:1).</p>
<p>After we are filled with the Spirit inwardly, we are full of the Holy Spirit. <em>Fill</em> is a verb, and <em>full</em> (<em>pleres</em> in Greek) is an adjective. Thus, filling is the process, and being full is a condition that results from passing through the process. To be filled is to go through a gate, but to be full involves maintaining a condition constantly. We need to be filled with the Holy Spirit to arrive at the level of being full of the Holy Spirit, and we need to maintain a condition of being full of the Holy Spirit. The Lord Jesus was filled inwardly with the Holy Spirit and full of the Holy Spirit. Therefore, He could be led by the Holy Spirit and also victoriously pass through Satan&rsquo;s temptations.</p>
<p><strong>2. &ldquo;Look for seven well-attested men from among you, full of the Spirit and of wisdom&rdquo;</strong> (Acts 6:3).</p>
<p>In the early church after Pentecost all the possessions of the believers were common to them (4:32), so there was a need for some to oversee the daily dispensing (6:1). They chose seven men who were full of the Spirit and of wisdom. Overseeing the daily dispensing requires not only wisdom but also a proper living. Therefore, the men who were chosen were full of the Holy Spirit. They were not filled with the Holy Spirit for a short period of time; they were constantly full of the Holy Spirit. As a result, their life was rich and full of wisdom. This enabled them to bear the burden of the very difficult matter of overseeing the daily dispensing for many people.</p>
<p><strong>3. &ldquo;Stephen, a man full of faith and of the Holy Spirit&rdquo;</strong> (Acts 6:5).</p>
<p>Stephen was constantly full of the Holy Spirit inwardly; he was not one who was filled for only a short period of time. Thus, he had a rich life and the wisdom to oversee the daily dispensing of food for many people and also a victorious life and faith to stand firm for the Lord even unto death.</p>
<p><strong>4. &ldquo;Being full of the Holy Spirit, he looked intently into heaven&rdquo;</strong> (Acts 7:55).</p>
<p>Stephen kept himself in a position of being full of the Holy Spirit. His persecutors were exasperated with him and gnashed their teeth, but he was full of the Holy Spirit. He was able to be faithful unto death and to be martyred for the Lord because he was full of the Holy Spirit.</p>
<p><strong>5. &ldquo;He was a good man and full of the Holy Spirit and of faith&rdquo;</strong> (Acts 11:24).</p>
<p>This verse refers to Barnabas, who, as a person full of the Holy Spirit, was also a good man and a person full of faith.</p><h2 class="head2">The Expressions of Being Filled<br />
by the Holy Spirit Inwardly</h2>
<h2 class="head3">The Overflow of Life</h2>
<p><strong>1. &ldquo;Out of his innermost being shall flow rivers of living water. But this He said concerning the Spirit&rdquo;</strong> (John 7:38-39).</p>
<p>The Holy Spirit within us is the Spirit of <em>life,</em> and the inward filling of the Holy Spirit produces a maturity in life. Therefore, one of the expressions of the inward filling of the Holy Spirit is a rich overflow of life. The Lord promised that those who believed into Him would overflow with the fullness of life. John then indicated that the Lord&rsquo;s words referred to the Holy Spirit, whom those who believed into the Lord were about to receive. This shows that those who believe into the Lord can receive the Holy Spirit to such an extent that they richly overflow with the waters of life. An overflowing of the waters of life is an expression of the inward filling of the Holy Spirit.</p>
<h2 class="head3">The Fruit of the Holy Spirit</h2>
<p><strong>1. &ldquo;The fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, long-suffering, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, meekness, self-control&rdquo;</strong> (Gal. 5:22-23).</p>
<p>The fruit that the Holy Spirit bears within us is also an expression of being inwardly filled with the Holy Spirit. This is spontaneous. Since the Holy Spirit within us is the Spirit of life, He will bear these nine beautiful fruits of the spiritual life within us if we give Him the opportunity to fill us. These nine fruits can be divided into three groups. Love, joy, and peace are the first group. If we have love, we will have joy. Once we have joy, we are at peace. Long-suffering, kindness, and goodness comprise the second group. Only a long-suffering person can be kind, and only a kind person can be good. Faithfulness, meekness, and self-control are the final group. Initially, it does not seem as if faithfulness and meekness are related, but our practical experience tells us that faithfulness causes us to be meek. If we are not faithful, we can easily be short-tempered. Therefore, true meekness is an issue of faithfulness. Just as meekness comes out of faithfulness, self-control comes out of meekness. Self-control implies the ability to rule ourselves. Only a person who truly is meek can rule himself. The order in which these nine fruits are listed is different from the order of the eight steps in 2 Peter 1:5-7. The order in 2 Peter is according to the steps in the growth in life. The order in Galatians is according to the experience of the fruit of life. These nine fruits of life are all expressions of being filled with the Holy Spirit inwardly in our living.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Way to Be Filled<br />
with the Holy Spirit Inwardly</h2>
<h2 class="head3">Applying Our Co-death with Christ on the Cross</h2>
<p><strong>1. &ldquo;The flesh lusts against the Spirit, and the Spirit against the flesh...They who are of Christ Jesus have crucified the flesh with its passions and its lusts&rdquo;</strong> (Gal. 5:17, 24).</p>
<p>The first step toward being filled inwardly with the Holy Spirit is to deal with our flesh by applying our co-death with Christ on the cross. The flesh lusts against the Spirit and the Spirit against the flesh. Everything of the flesh, whether good or bad, is contrary to the Holy Spirit. The greatest enemy, the greatest hindrance, and the greatest problem encountered by the Holy Spirit in us is our flesh that lusts against Him. Therefore, if we want the Holy Spirit to rule in us, to have a place in us, and to fill us, our flesh must be dealt with by the cross. We must apply our co-death with the Lord on the cross to our flesh, putting our flesh and all that is of the flesh to death. When we put our flesh and all that is of the flesh in a position of death in Christ&rsquo;s death on the cross, not allowing the flesh or the things of the flesh to have any ground in us, the Holy Spirit will gain the position in us to completely possess and fill us.</p>
<p>The cross must deal with our flesh and all the things that are of our flesh. It needs to deal with our inward parts until they are empty, enlarging them so that the Holy Spirit can fill us inwardly. The flesh, the world, and sin that fill us must be dealt with by the cross in order to make room for the Holy Spirit. The extent to which we are filled with the Holy Spirit inwardly is the extent to which we have allowed the cross to deal with these things. When our dealing is complete, we will be completely filled with the Holy Spirit. When we are thoroughly cleansed through this dealing, we will be thoroughly filled with the Holy Spirit. When we do not allow our inward parts to be occupied by the flesh, the world, and sin, the Holy Spirit can immediately possess and fill them.</p>
<h2 class="head3">Consecrating Ourselves to the Lord Completely</h2>
<p>After receiving the dealing of the cross, we must consecrate ourselves to the Lord completely. Receiving the dealing of the cross removes the barriers and the things that occupy us. Consecrating ourselves to the Lord allows Him to come in and possess us. We need to let the cross deal with our flesh, the world, and sin so that we can be holy and spiritual but, even more, so that we can return to the Lord to be used by Him. If we let the cross deal with everything and give ourselves back to the Lord for His use, the Lord will come through the Spirit to possess and fill us. Once the Tent of Meeting was prepared and consecrated to the Lord, the Lord&rsquo;s glory immediately filled it. Once the temple was built and given to the Lord, the Lord&rsquo;s glory again came in and immediately filled it. If we truly deal with everything and offer ourselves to the Lord as His dwelling place, the Spirit of the Lord will come and fill us.</p><h2 class="head3">Believing in the Inward Filling of the Holy Spirit</h2>
<p>Once we receive the dealing of the cross and consecrate ourselves, we must believe. Our believing is related to two points.</p>
<p>First, we should believe that the Holy Spirit <em>will</em> fill us. The Holy Spirit is within us and desires to fill us; He is only waiting for us to give Him more ground in our being. After receiving the dealing of the cross and offering all of our inner being to Him, the Spirit will certainly fill us even more.</p>
<p>Second, we should believe that the Holy Spirit <em>has already</em> filled us. Since the Holy Spirit is desiring and waiting to fill us, we should believe that He not only <em>will</em> fill us but that He <em>has already</em> filled us after we empty our inward parts and consecrate to Him. When we empty ourselves and offer ourselves to Him, the Spirit immediately fills us. This is like air filling a cup that is emptied of water. Being filled does not depend on our feelings. It does not matter whether we have some specific feelings. Genuine Christian experience is based on faith, not feelings, and even if there are some feelings, faith takes precedence. Once we empty ourselves and consecrate ourselves to Him, we should believe that the Holy Spirit <em>has already</em> filled us inwardly.</p>
<h2 class="head3">Minding the Holy Spirit</h2>
<p><strong>1. &ldquo;Do not walk according to the flesh but according to the spirit. For those who are according to the flesh mind the things of the flesh; but those who are according to the spirit, the things of the Spirit&rdquo;</strong> (Rom. 8:4-5).</p>
<p>After dealing with our flesh, consecrating, and believing, we must mind the Holy Spirit. Since we consecrate ourselves to be filled by Him and believe He has already filled us, we should simply mind Him. Indeed, we must mind Him and His things and not mind the flesh or its things. The more we mind the Spirit, the more He gains the ground in us to possess and fill us.</p>
<p><strong>2. &ldquo;Walk by the Spirit&rdquo;</strong> (Gal. 5:16, 25).</p>
<p>If we truly follow the Spirit, we must walk by the Spirit. When we do not follow the lusts of the flesh or rely on the power of the flesh, we will be constantly full of the Spirit, not just momentarily filled by the Spirit.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE OUTWARD FILLING</h2>
<p>When speaking of the outward filling of the Holy Spirit, the Bible uses the Greek word <em>pletho.</em> The record in Acts 2:1-4 concerning how the early disciples were filled by the Holy Spirit illustrates the biblical meaning of the word <em>pletho</em> as it relates to the outward filling of the Holy Spirit. Verses 2 and 4 speak of &ldquo;a rushing violent wind&rdquo; that &ldquo;filled [<em>pleroo</em>] the whole house where they were sitting...and they were all filled [<em>pletho</em>] with the Holy Spirit.&rdquo; In this short record, two different words, <em>pleroo</em> and <em>pletho,</em> are used to describe two different kinds of filling. <em>Pleroo</em> is used in the depiction of the Holy Spirit as a rushing violent wind that filled the house where the disciples were. <em>Pletho</em> is used in reference to the Holy Spirit filling the disciples who were in the house. The rushing violent wind that filled the whole house where the disciples were sitting was the Holy Spirit, or the power of the Holy Spirit. The house was filled (<em>pleroo</em>) with the Holy Spirit, or the power of the Holy Spirit. This filling refers to an inward filling because the inside of the house was filled. When the room that the disciples were sitting in was filled with the Holy Spirit, the Holy Spirit inwardly filled (<em>pleroo</em>) the room but outwardly filled (<em>pletho</em>) the disciples. With respect to the room, there was an inward filling of the Holy Spirit, but with respect to the disciples, there was an outward filling of the Holy Spirit. This outward filling is what we call the outward filling of the Holy Spirit. When the Bible uses the word <em>pletho</em> to speak of the filling of the Holy Spirit, it is referring to the outward filling of the Holy Spirit upon us.</p>
<p>The meaning of the word <em>pletho</em> can be illustrated with baptism. When we are baptized, water fills (<em>pleroo</em>) the baptismal pool inwardly, but it fills (<em>pletho</em>) the person being baptized outwardly. Thus, with respect to the baptismal pool, there is an inward filling, but with respect to the person being baptized, there is an outward filling.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Baptism in the Holy Spirit</h2>
<p>The Bible clearly associates the outward filling of the Holy Spirit with being baptized in the Holy Spirit. God wants us to pay attention to this great and important matter in the New Testament, so we should not only study it well but also pursue it deeply.</p>
<p>Many believers, even very spiritual ones, are not one hundred percent according to the light in the Bible in their view of the baptism in the Holy Spirit. This causes difficulties among the children of God regarding this matter. It has even caused error and confusion. Thus, we must put aside our views and prejudices and those of others and return to the Word of God carefully and earnestly, seeking God&rsquo;s light of truth in this matter. For this reason, we want to look at this matter carefully.</p><h2 class="head3">The Prophecies<br />
of the Baptism of the Holy Spirit</h2>
<p><strong>1. &ldquo;He Himself will baptize you in the Holy Spirit&rdquo;</strong> (Matt. 3:11).</p>
<p>In the Bible the first person to speak of the baptism in the Holy Spirit was John the Baptist. Before the reality of the baptism of the Holy Spirit, God sent John to baptize people in water as a symbol of the coming baptism of the Holy Spirit. When John the Baptist baptized people in water, he said that the Lord Jesus would baptize people in the Holy Spirit, indicating that they would receive the baptism in the Holy Spirit. In his prophecy the One baptizing was the Lord Jesus, not the Holy Spirit. The Lord Jesus carried out His spiritual baptism with the Holy Spirit as the power. In this regard, we may say that the Holy Spirit is the power in baptism. This is like the water which is used in a baptism. The water represents the means of the baptism itself.</p>
<p><strong>2. &ldquo;You shall be baptized in the Holy Spirit not many days from now&rdquo;</strong> (Acts 1:5).</p>
<p>The Lord prophesied concerning the baptism in the Holy Spirit to the disciples after His resurrection and before His ascension.</p>
<h2 class="head3">The Fulfillment of the Baptism of the Holy Spirit</h2>
<p><strong>1. &ldquo;You shall be baptized in the Holy Spirit not many days from now&rdquo;; &ldquo;As the day of Pentecost was being fulfilled, they were all together in the same place. And suddenly there was a sound out of heaven, as of a rushing violent wind, and it filled the whole house where they were sitting...And they were all filled with the Holy Spirit&rdquo;</strong> (Acts 1:5; 2:1-2, 4).</p>
<p>The prophecies of John the Baptist and the Lord Jesus concerning the baptism in the Holy Spirit began to be fulfilled on the day of Pentecost. According to the Bible, the fulfillment of the baptism in the Holy Spirit occurred in two stages. The first stage was fulfilled at Pentecost in Jerusalem and the second stage was fulfilled in the house of Cornelius in Caesarea. Although the fulfillment occurred in two stages and two places, it was one complete fulfillment. This is similar to a person writing a book. He may write two sections, and the first section may be written in Taipei, whereas the second section is written in Tainan. The two sections together, however, form one complete book. The baptism of the Holy Spirit was in two stages because the baptism of the Holy Spirit is not for individuals but for the church. The church was formed by joining two groups of people&mdash;Jews and Gentiles&mdash;together. In the eyes of God the people of the world are divided into two groups. God chose and called some from each group to form the church. Although the Lord wanted to baptize the church in the Holy Spirit, there was a separation between Jews and Gentiles that was like the wall of a fortress, which was the middle wall of partition (Eph. 2:14). This wall prevented Him from baptizing those who believed in Him, both Jews and Gentiles, in the Holy Spirit in one place at the same time. Consequently, He accomplished this matter in two stages and in two places.</p>
<p>The first stage was accomplished upon a group of believing Jews on the day of Pentecost in the upper room in Jerusalem. According to the environment and the conditions of that time, the Lord accomplished the baptism of the Holy Spirit upon this group first because He did not have a way to practically include the Gentiles in the baptism in the Holy Spirit with the Jews. Despite this limitation, the Lord could not wait. Therefore, He accomplished this matter upon the Jewish believers first and then brought the Gentiles into the church through the Jewish believers. He accomplished the first stage of this matter upon the Jewish believers and reserved the second stage until there was a proper way to accomplish it upon the Gentile believers.</p>
<p>We must pay attention to how the Bible speaks of this matter. The Lord&rsquo;s prophecy was that the disciples would &ldquo;be baptized in the Holy Spirit not many days from now&rdquo; (Acts 1:5). When this prophecy was fulfilled on the day of Pentecost, the disciples were outwardly &ldquo;filled with the Holy Spirit&rdquo; (2:4). This shows that the outward filling of the Holy Spirit is the baptism in the Holy Spirit. The baptism in the Holy Spirit is the outward filling of the Holy Spirit. The room in which the disciples were sitting was like a large baptismal pool. The Holy Spirit of power, like a rushing violent wind, filled the room in a way that water fills a baptismal pool. The disciples sitting in the room were spiritually baptized or outwardly filled with this spiritual water&mdash;the Holy Spirit of power, that is, the power of the Holy Spirit. Thus, the outward filling of the Holy Spirit is like baptism. It is outside of us, not within us. A believer does not go into the baptismal waters to drink the water. He is immersed in the water. He does not want to drink the water; he wants to be immersed in the water. He does not want the water to get into him; he wants the water to get onto him by being immersed in it. He does not want to be filled with water inwardly; he wants to be filled outwardly with water. Similarly, when we speak of being baptized with the Holy Spirit, our focus should be on our entrance into and covering by the Spirit, not on the Spirit&rsquo;s entrance into us. In this regard, baptism is not for the Holy Spirit to fill us inwardly but for the Holy Spirit to fill us outwardly. This outward filling of the Holy Spirit is symbolized by the baptismal waters covering us when we are immersed in the water.</p>
<p>The Jews who were baptized in the Holy Spirit on the day of Pentecost represented all the Jewish believers both past and present. In God&rsquo;s eyes all the Jewish believers were baptized in the Holy Spirit once for all on the day of Pentecost. This corresponds to the Lord&rsquo;s word to Peter in Matthew 16 about building the church upon Himself as the rock. The Lord gave Peter the keys of the kingdom of the heavens so that he could bring in the people whom the Lord needed to build the church. According to the Lord&rsquo;s word, Peter was charged with opening the door to the kingdom of the heavens for those who would believe in Him. If a Jewish person believes in the Lord today, does he need to go to Peter and ask him to open the door to the kingdom of the heavens? This is not necessary, because Peter opened the door on the day of Pentecost once for all for the Jewish people who believe in the Lord. When he opened the door on the day of Pentecost, it was opened forever. In the same principle, the Lord baptized all the Jewish believers, past and present, in the Holy Spirit once and for all on the day of Pentecost. His baptism accomplished this aspect of His work forever. However, the Lord accomplished the baptism of the Holy Spirit only upon the Jewish believers at Pentecost. This was the first stage of the baptism of the Holy Spirit. The second stage was accomplished at a different time upon the Gentile believers.</p>
<p><strong>2. &ldquo;As I began to speak, the Holy Spirit fell on them just as also on us in the beginning. And I remembered the word of the Lord...you shall be baptized in the Holy Spirit&rdquo;</strong> (Acts 11:15-16).</p>
<p>The second stage of the baptism in the Holy Spirit was accomplished in the house of Cornelius upon a group of Gentile believers who were representative of all the Gentiles, even those who believed before them, such as the Ethiopian eunuch. Cornelius was a centurion of the Italian cohort. His whole family was Gentile. The Lord opened the door for the Gentiles to believe in Him through those in the house of Cornelius. Therefore, Cornelius invited Peter, who held the keys to the kingdom of the heavens, to his house. Just as Peter opened the door for the Jews on the day of Pentecost, he opened the door for the Gentiles in the house of Cornelius. Today when a Gentile believes in the Lord, he does not need to ask Peter to open the door, because the door was opened in the house of Cornelius. The Lord confirmed this fact while Peter was speaking by causing the Holy Spirit to fall upon those in Cornelius&rsquo;s house, just as it fell upon the Jewish believers on the day of Pentecost. When Peter saw this, he remembered the Lord&rsquo;s promise concerning the baptism in the Holy Spirit. He realized that this was also the fulfillment of the Lord&rsquo;s promise of the baptism in the Holy Spirit. Thus, on that day in Cornelius&rsquo;s house the Lord baptized the Gentile believers in the Holy Spirit. Other than these two instances, the Holy Spirit did not fall upon man as He did on the day of Pentecost and in Cornelius&rsquo;s house. The Bible speaks of these instances as the Lord baptizing people in the Holy Spirit. According to the principle of representation, just as the Lord baptized all the Jewish believers, past and present, in the Holy Spirit on the day of Pentecost, He also baptized all the Gentile believers, past and present, in the Holy Spirit in the house of Cornelius. In the Lord&rsquo;s eyes all Jewish believers were baptized in the Holy Spirit on the day of Pentecost, and all Gentile believers were baptized in the Holy Spirit in the house of Cornelius. Just as the Jewish believers on the day of Pentecost represented all Jewish believers throughout the ages, the Gentile believers in the house of Cornelius represented all Gentile believers throughout the ages.</p>
<p><strong>3. The baptism in the Holy Spirit not being accomplished through the laying on of hands but by Christ, the Head, directly baptizing the church, the Body, in the Holy Spirit.</strong></p>
<p>The incidents on the day of Pentecost and in the house of Cornelius involved two stages of the baptism in the Holy Spirit, which together fulfilled the baptism in the Spirit. These two incidents did not occur through the laying on of hands. Instead, in both cases Christ, the Head of the church, directly baptized the church, His Body&mdash;including the Jewish and Gentile believers, both past and present&mdash;in the Holy Spirit. In this way Christ eternally fulfilled His promise of the baptism of the Holy Spirit. The baptism in the Holy Spirit was accomplished by the Lord on the day of Pentecost and in the house of Cornelius. Consequently, the Bible refers to only these two cases as the baptism in the Holy Spirit. Apart from these two instances, the Bible does not refer to any experience of the Holy Spirit falling upon man as the baptism in the Holy Spirit because the baptism in the Holy Spirit was completed on the day of Pentecost and in the house of Cornelius.</p>
<p><strong>4. &ldquo;They were all filled with the Holy Spirit...This is what is spoken through the prophet Joel: &lsquo;And it shall be in the last days, says God, that I will pour out of My Spirit upon all flesh&rsquo;&rdquo;; &ldquo;Having received the promise of the Holy Spirit from the Father, He has poured out this&rdquo;; &ldquo;The Holy Spirit fell upon all those hearing the word...On the Gentiles also the gift of the Holy Spirit had been poured out&rdquo;</strong> (Acts 2:4, 16-17, 33; 10:44-45).</p>
<p>These verses show that the baptism in the Holy Spirit, which was the Holy Spirit&rsquo;s falling upon people and outwardly filling them, fulfilled the promise of God in the Old Testament to pour out the Holy Spirit. The pouring out was a pouring upon. God poured out the Holy Spirit upon people outwardly. Pouring out does not refer to the Holy Spirit entering into the believers. In the New Testament the pouring out of the Spirit upon people is mentioned only in Acts 2 and 10. Chapter 2 speaks of the Holy Spirit being poured out upon the Jewish believers on the day of Pentecost, and chapter 10 refers to the Holy Spirit being poured out upon the Gentile believers in the house of Cornelius. The Bible refers to the baptism in the Holy Spirit only in regard to the events on the day of Pentecost and in the house of Cornelius. Thus, the pouring out of the Holy Spirit is the baptism in the Holy Spirit. This indicates that the baptism in the Holy Spirit involves an outward filling rather than an inward filling, as people generally believe.</p><h2 class="head3">The Fact of the Baptism in the Holy Spirit</h2>
<p><strong>1. &ldquo;In one Spirit we were all baptized into one Body, whether Jews or Greeks&rdquo;</strong> (1 Cor. 12:13).</p>
<p>When the Lord baptized the church in the Holy Spirit on the day of Pentecost and in the house of Cornelius, the baptism of the Holy Spirit upon the church became an accomplished fact. Consequently, when we believe in the Lord we partake of this accomplished fact whether we are a Jew or a Gentile. The Lord&rsquo;s death on the cross also is an accomplished fact; consequently, whoever believes in the Lord partakes of the Lord and partakes of the fact of His death. Just as the Lord&rsquo;s death is an accomplished fact, the baptism of the Spirit is an accomplished fact. Today people are joined to the Lord&rsquo;s death and partake of His death when they believe in Him. In God&rsquo;s eyes, according to the fact, they are already dead because they are joined to the Lord&rsquo;s death. In the same way, once a person believes in the Lord and is joined to the church, which is the Body of Christ, he also receives and partakes of the baptism in the Holy Spirit, which is upon the church. In God&rsquo;s eyes, according to the fact, he has already been baptized in the baptism of the Spirit which was poured out upon the church. If a family receives a large inheritance, a child who is born as a member of the family will be able to partake of that inheritance. He inherits because he is a member of the inheriting family. May we see that the baptism of the Spirit and our co-death with Christ are accomplished facts. Once we believe in the Lord, we partake of these facts. Just as we died together with the Lord Jesus, we also received the baptism of the Holy Spirit when the church received the baptism of the Spirit. All the Jewish believers in the church were baptized in the Holy Spirit on the day of Pentecost, and all the Gentile believers were baptized in the Holy Spirit in the house of Cornelius. When a Jew believes in the Lord, he partakes of the baptism in the Holy Spirit that the Jewish believers received on the day of Pentecost. When a Gentile believes in the Lord, he partakes of the baptism in the Holy Spirit that the Gentile believers received in the house of Cornelius. The entire church was baptized in the Holy Spirit in the baptism of the Spirit that was accomplished on the day of Pentecost and in the house of Cornelius. This is the reason that 1 Corinthians 12 says, &ldquo;In one Spirit we were all baptized into one Body, whether Jews or Greeks.&rdquo; Those who are in the church were baptized in the Holy Spirit as a whole, corporately, and once for all, not individually or separately. All the believers in the church, regardless of when they live or where they live, partake of this accomplished fact.</p>
<h2 class="head3">The Experience of the Baptism in the Holy Spirit</h2>
<p><strong>1. &ldquo;You shall be baptized in the Holy Spirit not many days from now&rdquo;; &ldquo;The day of Pentecost was being fulfilled...And they were all filled with the Holy Spirit&rdquo;; &ldquo;The Holy Spirit fell on them just as also on us in the beginning. And I remembered the word of the Lord...You shall be baptized in the Holy Spirit&rdquo;</strong> (Acts 1:5; 2:1, 4; 11:15-16).</p>
<p>These verses in the Bible show that the baptism of the Spirit involved an experience of the outward filling of the Spirit on the day of Pentecost and in the house of Cornelius. When we are outwardly filled with the Holy Spirit and the Holy Spirit of power falls upon us, we experience the baptism in the Holy Spirit. The experience of the baptism in the Holy Spirit involves receiving the Holy Spirit of power outwardly and being filled outwardly with the Holy Spirit.</p>
<p>The fact of the baptism in the Holy Spirit was accomplished once for all upon the church at Pentecost and in the house of Cornelius, but believers can experience the baptism of the Holy Spirit at any time and at any place.</p>
<p>The fact of the baptism of the Spirit was accomplished on the church once for all, but the experience of the baptism of the Spirit is not limited to one place or one time. Some believers experienced it nineteen hundred years ago, and some experience it today. According to the fact, all the believers who belong to the church were baptized in the Spirit at Pentecost or in the house of Cornelius, but according to experience, we all experience the baptism of the Spirit at different times and in different places. According to the fact, everyone was baptized together once for all in the Spirit, but according to experience, we can and should individually and repeatedly experience the baptism of the Spirit.</p>
<p>According to the fact, everyone who is saved and belongs to the church has partaken of the baptism in the Spirit, but according to experience some have not experienced the baptism in the Spirit. Some do not even understand the baptism in the Spirit. Partaking of the fact of the baptism in the Spirit is one thing; experiencing the baptism in the Spirit is another. Although we have partaken of the baptism in the Spirit, some have not experienced it. For example, a young boy may inherit a large fortune but not enjoy it or even know of his inheritance. In fact and in name, he has received an inheritance, but in experience he has not enjoyed it because he is so young. His older brothers, however, will not only receive the inheritance in fact and in name but also enjoy the inheritance in their experience. When the young boy grows up, he can and should enjoy the inheritance as well. Some believers are like this young boy in regard to the baptism in the Spirit. Although the fact is theirs, they are lacking in experience. However, when they see the glorious fact and remove any hindrance that prevents them from experiencing this fact, they can experience this fact by faith.</p><h2 class="head2">The Function of Being Filled Outwardly<br />
with the Holy Spirit</h2>
<h2 class="head3">Causing Spiritual Work to Have Power</h2>
<p><strong>1. &ldquo;You shall receive power when the Holy Spirit comes upon you, and you shall be My witnesses...unto the uttermost part of the earth&rdquo;; &ldquo;As the day of Pentecost was being fulfilled...they were all filled with the Holy Spirit&rdquo;</strong> (Acts 1:8; 2:1, 4; see also Luke 24:49).</p>
<p>Being filled with the Holy Spirit inwardly is for our spiritual living and causes our spiritual life to mature. Being filled with the Holy Spirit outwardly is for our spiritual work and causes our spiritual work to have power. Being filled with the Holy Spirit inwardly for life is good, but it is not adequate for the work. Peter and the early apostles were filled with the Holy Spirit inwardly before the day of Pentecost, but they were unable to work for the Lord because they had not been filled with the Holy Spirit outwardly to work for the Lord in power. When they were filled with the Holy Spirit outwardly by receiving the Holy Spirit as the Spirit of power, they were empowered to do a great and efficacious work for the Lord.</p>
<p>The Holy Spirit within us causes us to repent, to listen to God&rsquo;s word, and to know the Lord. The Holy Spirit upon us causes others to repent, to listen to God&rsquo;s word, and to know the Lord. Many who are saved and come to the Lord are unable to bring others to salvation and to the Lord because they lack the outward filling of the Holy Spirit. They have the Holy Spirit inwardly but not outwardly. They are lacking in zeal and courage. They are embarrassed and regard the preaching of the gospel as a difficult matter. They are not released and do not have power. They are restrained, they retreat, and they cannot testify for the Lord. Those who receive the outward filling of the Holy Spirit burn with zeal and have a double portion of boldness. When they preach the gospel, they are not embarrassed or afraid of difficulties. They are released and free, strong and empowered. They do not retreat but bravely testify for the Lord.</p>
<p>Many brothers and sisters read the Bible, pray, and truly love the Lord, but they are not released in their gospel preaching and are afraid to testify for the Lord. They even find it difficult to open their mouths in the meetings. This is because they have the Holy Spirit inwardly but not outwardly. If they pursue this matter, one day they will experience the outward filling of the Holy Spirit, and their spiritual condition will have a great change. They will be bolder, and they will become &ldquo;thick-skinned.&rdquo; They will testify to others and open their mouths in the meetings, and they will not have the slightest fear of preaching the gospel to a crowd or of speaking and singing on the streets. At Pentecost, those unlearned Galilean fishermen received the outward filling of the Holy Spirit upon them, and they were greatly released. They did not have the slightest concern. They were not afraid of the opposition or the threatenings of those in authority. They had great power and boldness to testify for the Lord, and they influenced thousands of people. If the brothers and sisters in our gospel groups were all filled with the Holy Spirit outwardly, people would be moved whenever we went out. I truly hope that every brother and sister in a gospel group would pursue the outward filling of the Holy Spirit in order to be empowered. Once we are filled with the Holy Spirit outwardly, we will be released and bold. We will not be afraid. We will know only how to testify for the Lord and how to treasure people&rsquo;s souls. When people meet us, they will be moved. If we want to testify and work for the Lord, we must seek the outward filling of the Holy Spirit. I hope that the brothers and sisters would pursue this matter in small groups consisting of a few saints. If we do not have the outward filling of the Holy Spirit, we will not have the power to work for the Lord. If we want to gain this power, we must pursue the outward filling of the Holy Spirit.</p>
<h2 class="head3">Proving the Ascension of Jesus<br />
Who Was Made Lord and Christ</h2>
<p><strong>1. &ldquo;Having been exalted to the right hand of God and having received the promise of the Holy Spirit from the Father, He has poured out this which you both see and hear...Therefore let all the house of Israel know assuredly that God has made Him both Lord and Christ, this Jesus whom you have crucified&rdquo;</strong> (Acts 2:33, 36).</p>
<p>The outward filling with the Holy Spirit not only gives us power to testify for the Lord but also proves Jesus&rsquo; ascension and exaltation. Furthermore, the outward filling of the Holy Spirit empowers us by bringing us into a heavenly condition. The Holy Spirit who fills us outwardly has been poured out by the ascended Lord; He has come down from the ascended Lord, bringing the heavens and the Lord&rsquo;s heavenly condition to us. When we receive the outward filling of the Holy Spirit, we feel as if we are in a heavenly condition. The exalted and glorified Lord Jesus upon His throne is before our eyes, enabling us to ignore every situation and difficulty on earth and to testify for the Lord in the heavens by the power from the heavens.</p>
<p>When the Holy Spirit falls upon us, not only do we feel our heavenly condition, but others can sense our heavenly condition. When the early apostles stood up on the day of Pentecost and testified of the ascended Lord, the listeners noticed their heavenly condition (v. 37). When the heavenly power was poured upon the apostles, others were affected by their heavenly condition. Thus, if we want to testify for the Lord in the heavens to enable people on earth to feel the reality in the heavens, we must be outwardly filled with the Holy Spirit in order to gain the heavenly power.</p><h2 class="head2">The Patterns of the Outward Filling<br />
with the Holy Spirit</h2>
<h2 class="head3">Peter and the Disciples</h2>
<p><strong>1. &ldquo;They were all together in the same place&rdquo;</strong> (Acts 2:1).</p>
<p>Peter and the first one hundred twenty disciples were filled outwardly with the Holy Spirit on the day of Pentecost. They pursued this matter together and received it together. When they received it, there was a sound out of heaven, as of a rushing violent wind, and the Holy Spirit filled the house where they were sitting. There appeared to them tongues as of fire that were distributed and sat on each of them. They were all outwardly filled with the Holy Spirit and began to speak in different tongues even as the Spirit gave them to speak forth. They were in such a released condition that people jeered and said that they were full of new wine as if they were drunk. They not only received the Holy Spirit at this point, but they continued to be filled outwardly with the Holy Spirit (4:8, 31).</p>
<h2 class="head3">The Samaritan Believers</h2>
<p><strong>1. &ldquo;Philip went down to the city of Samaria and proclaimed the Christ to them...They believed...And they received the Holy Spirit&rdquo;</strong> (Acts 8:5, 12, 17).</p>
<p>When the early Samaritan believers believed and were baptized, the Holy Spirit had not yet fallen upon them. They did not obtain the outward filling of the Holy Spirit until Peter and John came to lay hands on them. At that point, they received it, and when they did, others saw it.</p>
<h2 class="head3">Saul</h2>
<p><strong>1. &ldquo;As he went...a light from heaven flashed around him...Ananias went away and entered into the house; and laying his hands on him, he said, Saul, brother, the Lord has sent me...so that you may receive your sight and be filled with the Holy Spirit&rdquo;</strong> (Acts 9:3, 17).</p>
<p>Saul (who later became Paul) repented and believed in the Lord on the road to Damascus. Three days later Ananias was sent by the Lord to lay hands on him. Then Saul received the outward filling of the Holy Spirit. When he was filled outwardly, he recovered his sight. He did not receive the outward filling only once; rather, he continued to be filled with the Holy Spirit (13:9).</p>
<h2 class="head3">The Household of Cornelius</h2>
<p><strong>1. &ldquo;While Peter was still speaking these words, the Holy Spirit fell upon all those hearing the word&rdquo;</strong> (Acts 10:44).</p>
<p>While Peter was preaching the gospel to those in the household of Cornelius, they heard, believed, and received the outward filling of the Holy Spirit. When they received this filling, they spoke in tongues and magnified God. Peter and the Jewish believers who came with him were witnesses of this filling.</p>
<h2 class="head3">The Ephesian Believers</h2>
<p><strong>1. &ldquo;When Paul laid his hands on them, the Holy Spirit came upon them, and they spoke in tongues and prophesied&rdquo;</strong> (Acts 19:6).</p>
<p>Twelve of the early Ephesian believers were like the Samaritan believers who believed in the Lord and were saved, but who did not receive the outward filling of the Holy Spirit. When Paul came and laid hands on them, however, they received the outward filling. At that time they spoke in tongues and prophesied.</p>
<p>The five preceding examples occurred after the day of Pentecost. Peter with the disciples and those in Cornelius&rsquo;s house were the two groups of believers who received the outward filling of the Holy Spirit directly from Christ the Head. The rest were filled outwardly through the laying on of hands by those representing the Body of Christ.</p>
<h2 class="head3">Other Examples</h2>
<p>The New Testament gives three other examples of being filled outwardly with the Holy Spirit before the day of Pentecost.</p>
<p><strong>1. &ldquo;He will be filled with the Holy Spirit, even from his mother&rsquo;s womb&rdquo;</strong> (Luke 1:15).</p>
<p>John the Baptist was filled with the Holy Spirit from his mother&rsquo;s womb. Therefore, he was able to be a powerful witness who prepared the way of the Lord.</p>
<p><strong>2. &ldquo;Elizabeth was filled with the Holy Spirit&rdquo;</strong> (Luke 1:41).</p>
<p>Elizabeth, who was pregnant with John the Baptist, was filled with the Holy Spirit when she heard the greeting of Mary, who was pregnant with the Lord Jesus. For this reason, she could speak such a spiritual word in the following verses.</p>
<p><strong>3. &ldquo;Zachariah...was filled with the Holy Spirit and prophesied&rdquo;</strong> (Luke 1:67-79).</p>
<p>Zachariah, the father of John the Baptist, was filled with the Holy Spirit the day that John was named. Therefore, he could prophesy and utter high and spiritual praises.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Manifestations of the Outward Filling<br />
of the Holy Spirit</h2>
<h2 class="head3">Speaking in Tongues</h2>
<p><strong>1. &ldquo;They were all filled with the Holy Spirit and began to speak in different tongues&rdquo;; &ldquo;They heard them speaking in tongues&rdquo;</strong> (Acts 2:4; 10:46; see also 19:6).</p>
<p>The disciples on the day of Pentecost, those in Cornelius&rsquo;s house, and the Ephesian disciples all spoke in tongues when they were filled outwardly with the Holy Spirit. Thus, speaking in tongues is a manifestation of being filled outwardly with the Holy Spirit.</p><h2 class="head3">Prophesying</h2>
<p><strong>1. &ldquo;The Holy Spirit came upon them, and they spoke in tongues and prophesied&rdquo;</strong> (Acts 19:6; see also Luke 1:67).</p>
<p>When the Ephesian believers were filled outwardly with the Holy Spirit, they not only spoke in tongues but also prophesied. Thus, prophesying is another manifestation of being filled outwardly with the Holy Spirit.</p>
<p>Of the five examples of the outward filling of the Holy Spirit recorded in Acts, speaking in tongues is mentioned only in regard to the disciples on the day of Pentecost, those in Cornelius&rsquo;s house, and the Ephesian believers. The other two instances&mdash;the Samaritan believers in chapter 8 and Saul of Tarsus in chapter 9&mdash;do not mention the matter of speaking in tongues. This shows that the manifestation of speaking in tongues is not required as a proof of the outward filling of the Holy Spirit. What the Bible does not record is as meaningful as what the Bible records. Therefore, we dare not preach, as certain groups preach, that a person must speak in tongues in order to be filled outwardly with the Holy Spirit. This is not according to the record of the Bible in at least two cases in Acts.</p>
<h2 class="head3">Others Can See It</h2>
<p><strong>1. &ldquo;He has poured out this which you both see and hear&rdquo;</strong> (Acts 2:33; see also 8:17-18).</p>
<p>When the disciples at Pentecost and the Samaritan believers were filled outwardly with the Holy Spirit, others saw it. This is certain. When a person is filled outwardly with the Holy Spirit, there will be a heavenly, spiritual condition that others can see.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Way to Be Filled Outwardly<br />
with the Holy Spirit</h2>
<h2 class="head3">Repenting and Dealing with Sin</h2>
<p><strong>1. &ldquo;Repent...each one of you...for the forgiveness of your sins, and you will receive the gift of the Holy Spirit&rdquo;</strong> (Acts 2:38).</p>
<p>When a person repents for the forgiveness of his sins, he receives the Holy Spirit. Thus, if we want to be filled outwardly with the Holy Spirit, we must thoroughly repent and turn to God. We must confess all our sins before God and clear them up, dealing with them until we are clean. This is the first requirement.</p>
<h2 class="head3">Believing</h2>
<p>When we repent and turn to God, after we have dealt with and cleared up our sins, we must believe that we are baptized in the Holy Spirit. Since the baptism of the Spirit is a fact accomplished upon the whole church and we are part of the church, we have already participated in the baptism of the Holy Spirit. This should be our enjoyment and experience. We should believe in what the Lord has accomplished and what the Lord has spoken concerning this fact. Then we should use faith to receive what the Lord accomplished according to His word.</p>
<h2 class="head3">Obeying</h2>
<p><strong>1. &ldquo;The Holy Spirit, whom God has given to those who obey Him&rdquo;</strong> (Acts 5:32).</p>
<p>God gives the Holy Spirit to those who obey Him. Therefore, if we want to receive the outward filling of the Holy Spirit, we must obey God. We should obey and agree with what God wants us to do and with whatever He asks of us. Then we will be able to receive the outward filling of the Holy Spirit.</p>
<h2 class="head3">Praying with One Accord</h2>
<p><strong>1. &ldquo;These all continued steadfastly with one accord in prayer&rdquo;</strong> (Acts 1:14).</p>
<p>If we want to receive the outward filling of the Holy Spirit, we must pray individually, and we should pray together with one accord. The first group of people who were filled outwardly with the Holy Spirit on the day of Pentecost prayed together in one accord for ten days before they richly received the outward filling.</p>
<h2 class="head3">Meeting to Pursue</h2>
<p><strong>1. &ldquo;As the day of Pentecost was being fulfilled, they were all together in the same place...And they were all filled with the Holy Spirit&rdquo;</strong> (Acts 2:1, 4).</p>
<p>At times, we also need to meet together to pursue the outward filling of the Holy Spirit. The disciples on the day of Pentecost received the filling when they pursued in this way.</p>
<h2 class="head3">Through the Laying On of Hands</h2>
<p><strong>1. &ldquo;Then they laid their hands on them, and they received the Holy Spirit&rdquo;; &ldquo;Ananias...laying his hands on him...said...be filled with the Holy Spirit&rdquo;; &ldquo;When Paul laid his hands on them, the Holy Spirit came upon them&rdquo;</strong> (Acts 8:17; 9:17; 19:6).</p>
<p>These portions in the Bible show that the early Samaritan believers, Saul of Tarsus, and the Ephesian believers all received the outward filling of the Holy Spirit through the laying on of hands. When new ones believe in the Lord and become a part of the Body, a representative of the Body should lay hands on them so that the anointing on the Body can flow to them. This is because the Holy Spirit has already flowed from Christ, the Head, to the church, the Body. Under normal conditions, believers will receive the Holy Spirit when a representative of the Body lays hands on them. Therefore, we should ask the Lord to bring us into a normal condition of having those among us who could represent the Body and lay hands on the brothers and sisters so that the anointing on the Body could flow greatly among us, causing many to receive the outward filling of the Holy Spirit.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER TWENTY-EIGHT</h1>
<h1 class="title">PREACHING THE GOSPEL</h1>
<h2 class="head1">THE CALL FROM FOUR DIRECTIONS</h2>
<h2 class="head2">The Lord&rsquo;s Only Commandment at His Departure Speaking Forth a Call from the Heavens Above</h2>
<p><strong>1. &ldquo;Go into all the world and proclaim the gospel to all the creation&rdquo;; &ldquo;Go therefore and disciple all the nations&rdquo;</strong> (Mark 16:15; Matt. 28:19; see also Rom. 10:14-15).</p>
<p>The call to preach the gospel and save people comes from four directions. The first call comes from above, from the heavens. It is according to the Lord&rsquo;s command, which He spoke immediately before His ascension. Although the Lord&rsquo;s call was given while He was on earth, His command comes to us today from the heavens. With regard to geography, He wants us to go into all the earth. With regard to race, He wants us to disciple all the nations. From the day of His ascension, His call from above has never ceased. Throughout the ages, there have always been those who heard and answered His call. They have gone to every place under the sun to preach the gospel. According to His sovereign authority, the Lord effects changes among humanity that reflect the actions initiated by His calling. For example, the discovery of the new world by Columbus produced an east-west connection by sea that enabled many to answer His call to go to all the countries in the Americas, Africa, Asia, and the Pacific islands, following the Reformation brought in by Martin Luther. As a consequence, God&rsquo;s gospel of grace has been preached to every race. The Lord will continue to sound His call, calling some to bring the gospel to those living in every corner of the earth. May some among us hear and answer His call and go and disciple those who do not know the Lord.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Cry of the Rich Man<br />
Speaking Forth a Call from Hades Below</h2>
<p><strong>1. &ldquo;He said, Then I ask you, Father, to send him to the house of my father&mdash;for I have five brothers&mdash;so that he may solemnly testify to them, lest they also come to this place of torment&rdquo;</strong> (Luke 16:27-28).</p>
<p>These verses record the cry of the rich man who was suffering in the flames of Hades. His cry indicates that there must be many in Hades who have a desire that their relatives on earth would hear the gospel and be saved in order to escape the suffering of perdition. They are in Hades, and they are crying out concerning the need for their living relatives to hear the gospel. This is the second direction from which a call for the gospel comes. We should be moved by these pitiful cries and go to the living who still have a chance to repent to preach the gospel that can save them from eternal perdition.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Believers&rsquo; Pressing, Heartfelt Responsibility<br />
Speaking Forth a Call from Inside of Us</h2>
<p><strong>1. &ldquo;If I preach the gospel, I have no boast, for necessity is laid upon me; for woe to me if I do not preach the gospel. If I do this of my own will, I have a reward; but if not of my own will, I am entrusted with a stewardship&rdquo;</strong> (1 Cor. 9:16-17).</p>
<p>It is a marvelous fact that once we are saved, we spontaneously feel that we should preach the gospel. If we do not preach the gospel, we feel that we have let people down, that we owe them something, and that our heart is empty and without peace. Whenever we preach the gospel, our heart is joyful, satisfied, and peaceful. Furthermore, the more we preach, the happier, more released, and more comfortable we are because the Lord has entrusted us with the stewardship, or responsibility, to preach the gospel. When we receive His salvation, we also receive His commission and spontaneously feel a spiritual responsibility. This stewardship is in our innermost heart, and through the moving of the Holy Spirit, it becomes a burden, a pressing voice, that compels us to preach the gospel. If we do not preach the gospel, we feel like saying, &ldquo;Woe to me.&rdquo; Unbelievers think that Christians are zealous to preach the gospel, but actually this is a necessity laid upon us because we have an urgent, inward sense of responsibility. This sense of responsibility comes from within. It is the third direction from which a call for the gospel comes. This inward call is an irresistible call.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Desperate Need of People<br />
Speaking Forth a Call from Without</h2>
<p><strong>1. &ldquo;A certain man...was standing and entreating him and saying, Come...and help us&rdquo;</strong> (Acts 16:9).</p>
<p>Paul, who was zealous for the gospel and active in preaching throughout the Mediterranean area, saw a vision and heard a call for him to come to Macedonia. This is the fourth direction from which a call for the gospel comes. It comes from people, and it speaks of the desperate need of those around us. Today these kinds of Macedonian calls are numerous and pressing. Regrettably, we often ignore them or do not even hear them, because we do not have a strong desire to reach others with the gospel, and our sense is quite dull. We should ask the Lord to operate and increase our desire so that our inward sense can be sharpened, and we would feel the desperate need of people for the gospel. Then we would hear their pitiful cries and answer their thirsty needs by going to help them with the gospel.</p><h2 class="head1">FIVE EXPRESSIONS RELATED TO<br />
PREACHING THE GOSPEL</h2>
<h2 class="head2">Witnessing</h2>
<p><strong>1. &ldquo;You shall be My witnesses...unto the uttermost part of the earth&rdquo;; &ldquo;You are witnesses of these things&rdquo;</strong> (Acts 1:8; Luke 24:48).</p>
<p>According to the Bible, there are five expressions related to preaching the gospel. The first is <em>witnessing.</em> The Lord commanded His disciples to preach the gospel. On the one hand, He commanded them to preach the gospel to all creation, and on the other, He commanded them to be His witnesses to the uttermost part of the earth. Bearing the testimony of the Lord involves preaching the gospel. The best way to preach the gospel is to testify how the Lord saved us and how we experienced the Lord&rsquo;s salvation through His death and resurrection on our behalf. This is very effective.</p>
<p><strong>2. &ldquo;Go to your house, to your own people, and report to them what great things the Lord has done for you, and how He has had mercy on you&rdquo;</strong> (Mark 5:19).</p>
<p>The Lord spoke this word to a man who was set free from being possessed by demons. The Lord wanted him to witness to his own people and report to them the great things He had done for him and how He had mercy on him. Once we are saved, we should report the salvation that we received to our relatives and friends and should witness to them. This is a preaching of the gospel, and it can bring our relatives and friends to salvation.</p>
<p><strong>3. &ldquo;The woman left her waterpot and went away into the city, and said to the people, Come, see a man who told me all that I have done. Is this not the Christ?...Many of the Samaritans from that city believed into Him because of the word of the woman who testified&rdquo;</strong> (John 4:28-29, 39).</p>
<p>The Lord met a Samaritan woman by a well in Sychar. When she realized that the Lord was the Christ, she left her waterpot and went into the city where she lived and testified of the Lord. As a result, many believed in the Lord Jesus because of her testimony. A new believer should witness for the Lord because the witnessing of a newly saved one can easily move people to believe into Him. Therefore, newly saved brothers and sisters should visit their gospel friends. They can witness in a fresh way to the salvation that they received. This can move people to repent and believe in the Lord and help them to know the Lord&rsquo;s salvation.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Leading People to the Lord</h2>
<p><strong>1. &ldquo;Andrew...first found his own brother Simon and said to him, We have found the Messiah...He led him to Jesus...Philip found Nathanael and said to him, We have found Him of whom Moses in the law, and the prophets, wrote, Jesus...Come and see&rdquo;</strong> (John 1:40-42, 45-46).</p>
<p>The second expression for preaching the gospel is <em>leading people to the Lord.</em> When Andrew met the Lord, he went to his brother Simon and led him to meet the Lord. After Philip met the Lord, he went to Nathanael (probably a neighbor, relative, or close friend) and brought him to see the Lord. These instances show that once a person knows the Lord, he should lead others to the Lord, particularly his relatives and friends. Just as Andrew brought his brother to the Lord and Philip brought his neighbor, relative, or friend to the Lord, we should lead our relatives and friends to the Lord.</p>
<p>In leading people to the Lord, we should pay attention to two matters. First, we must have a burden in order to know whom we should lead to the Lord. Andrew had a burden for his brother, and Philip also had a burden. We should not go to people in a loose way. We must have a definite goal so that we can lead people to the Lord one by one. Second, we must lead people to the Lord so that they can see the Lord directly for themselves. Philip, however, did not introduce the Lord so clearly when he said that the Lord was a Nazarene. This made it more difficult for Nathanael to believe, because he responded, &ldquo;Can anything good be from Nazareth?&rdquo; (v. 46). Philip wisely did not try to explain. He simply said, &ldquo;Come and see.&rdquo; If Philip had said anything more than this, he could have made more mistakes that would have confused Nathanael and caused him to doubt. Then it would have been difficult for Nathanael to believe in Jesus. However, as soon as Philip brought Nathanael to see the Lord directly, Nathanael was able to know the Lord. Often our exhortations for people to believe in the Lord are not very clear or correct. New believers especially have this problem. Therefore, we must be careful not to explain too much, because this can confuse people. We need to learn to bring people to see Jesus. We need to say, &ldquo;Come and see.&rdquo; We need to bring them to the Lord to see Him directly. Once people see the Lord, many questions dissipate. People have questions because they have not seen the Lord. Therefore, we should not attempt to answer all their questions. We should simply bring them before the Lord and let the Lord Himself answer their questions. Once a person sees the Lord, all his questions are answered.</p><h2 class="head2">Sowing</h2>
<p><strong>1. &ldquo;He who reaps...gathers fruit unto eternal life, in order that he who sows and he who reaps may rejoice together...One sows and another reaps&rdquo;</strong> (John 4:36-37).</p>
<p>The third expression for preaching the gospel is <em>sowing.</em> The word of the Lord&rsquo;s gospel is the seed of life, and a person&rsquo;s heart is like a field of earth for planting. When we preach the gospel to people, we are sowing the seed of the Lord&rsquo;s gospel into the field of their hearts. When the seed of the gospel grows in their hearts, it can be harvested. Sometimes others sow, and we reap; sometimes we sow, and others reap. For example, a brother who is baptized today may have received a gospel tract which gave him an impression of the gospel five years ago in another place. Thus, the seed of the gospel, which was sown into him through the tract, was reaped and brought in by us five years later. Therefore, we should preach the gospel whenever we meet people and sow the seed of the gospel into their hearts so that there will be a harvest in due time.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Reaping a Harvest</h2>
<p><strong>1. &ldquo;The harvest is great, but the workers few; therefore beseech the Lord of the harvest that He would thrust out workers into His harvest&rdquo;</strong> (Matt. 9:37-38).</p>
<p>On the one hand, preaching the gospel is a sowing, but on the other hand, it is a reaping of the harvest. Sowing emphasizes preaching the gospel. Reaping emphasizes gathering in people&rsquo;s souls. Gathering in people&rsquo;s souls is like reaping grain and bringing it into a storehouse. Those whom the Lord wants to save are the harvest He wants to reap. Our preaching of the gospel is for harvesting these people. Thus, <em>reaping a harvest</em> is another expression for preaching the gospel.</p>
<p>In these verses the Lord spoke of the harvest being great, but the workers who preach the gospel to reap the harvest being few. Therefore, we should beseech the Lord of the harvest that He would thrust out workers into His harvest. If the harvest was great when the Lord spoke this word, the harvest must be even greater now. Therefore, we must beseech the Lord even more to thrust out workers into His harvest. If we want to reap the Lord&rsquo;s harvest, we must preach the Lord&rsquo;s gospel. Reaping a harvest requires the preaching of the gospel.</p>
<p><strong>2. &ldquo;Lift up your eyes and look on the fields, for they are already white for harvest...One sows and another reaps. I sent you to reap that for which you have not labored&rdquo;</strong> (John 4:35, 37-38).</p>
<p>According to the Lord, the fields are white for harvest. Brothers and sisters, if the fields were white when the Lord spoke these words, they are even whiter today. Speaking only of the Chinese people, there are many whose hearts are ripe for harvesting. But who is willing to go?</p>
<p>When we preach the gospel, we will harvest what has already been sown. According to the Lord&rsquo;s word, we should expect to reap where we have not labored. The seeds of the gospel have been sown on the earth by the church for two thousand years. Even in China many seeds have been sown over the last few centuries. Therefore, the harvest truly is ripe and waiting for us to reap. By the Lord&rsquo;s mercy, may we lift up our eyes and look on the fields, and by the Lord&rsquo;s grace, may we receive His sending to go and reap this ripened harvest.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Repaying a Debt</h2>
<p><strong>1. &ldquo;I am debtor both to Greeks and to barbarians, both to wise and to foolish; so, for my part, I am ready to announce the gospel to you also&rdquo;</strong> (Rom. 1:14-15).</p>
<p>Paul said that he was a debtor to every type of person. Therefore, he endeavored to preach the gospel to everyone. This word shows that preaching the gospel is the <em>repayment of a debt,</em> which is the fifth expression for preaching the gospel. According to this expression, preaching the gospel to our relatives, friends, and those to whom we are close is the repayment of a debt. Therefore, we should preach the gospel in order to repay our debt to the gospel.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE SPIRIT OF THE GOSPEL<br />
PRODUCING A PROPER ATTITUDE<br />
TOWARD THE GOSPEL</h2>
<p>When we preach the gospel, we must have the spirit of the gospel. When our spirit is full of burden, it becomes a power within us and causes us to be so driven that we cannot help but preach the gospel. This is the spirit of the gospel. This spirit causes us to be eager to preach the gospel, to be consumed with preaching the gospel to the point that we care for nothing else and fear nothing else. Our only care is for preaching the gospel, and our only fear is that people would perish. When we have such a spirit of the gospel, we spontaneously have a proper attitude toward the gospel outwardly. We should pursue and ask the Lord for such a spirit.</p><h2 class="head2">Being Fervent in Spirit</h2>
<p><strong>1. &ldquo;Being fervent in spirit, he spoke and taught accurately the things concerning Jesus&rdquo;</strong> (Acts 18:25).</p>
<p>The spirit of the gospel reflects a fervent spirit. If we want to preach the gospel, we must be fervent in spirit. Apollos was fervent in spirit, and he spoke and taught accurately the things concerning Jesus. If we want the gospel to be released and not be held back by us, we must be fervent in spirit. We must be fervent even to the extent that we appear to be crazy. We should become a &ldquo;fanatic of Jesus&rdquo; to the extent that we do not care for anything but announcing the Lord Jesus.</p>
<p><strong>2. &ldquo;His spirit was provoked within him as he beheld that the city was full of idols&rdquo;</strong> (Acts 17:16).</p>
<p>The spirit of the gospel involves not only a fervent spirit, but also a spirit that can be provoked when we see people sinning and perishing in darkness. When he was in Athens, the apostle Paul was provoked in his spirit because he saw that the whole city was full of idols. With his provoked spirit, he preached and released the gospel in the synagogue with the Jews and the devout and in the marketplace every day with those who happened to be there, as if he were crazy (v. 17).</p>
<h2 class="head2">Not Being Ashamed of the Gospel</h2>
<p><strong>1. &ldquo;I am not ashamed of the gospel, for it is the power of God unto salvation to everyone who believes&rdquo;</strong> (Rom. 1:16; see also 2 Tim. 1:8, 12; Mark 8:38).</p>
<p>It is quite strange that a person can feel glorious when speaking to others about a theory of science but be ashamed to speak of the Lord Jesus and the gospel. Without a doubt, this is the work of Satan to hinder people from preaching the gospel. However, if we have a spirit of the gospel, we will not be ashamed of the Lord and the gospel. On the contrary, the more we speak of the Lord and the gospel, the more glorious we will feel. If we want to preach the gospel, we must be &ldquo;thick-skinned&rdquo;; if we want to be thick-skinned, we must have the spirit of the gospel. With the spirit of the gospel and &ldquo;thick skin,&rdquo; we will feel glorious rather than ashamed when we preach the gospel.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Using Our Own Will</h2>
<p><strong>1. &ldquo;I preach the gospel...If I do this of my own will, I have a reward&rdquo;; &ldquo;I will most gladly spend and be utterly spent on behalf of your souls&rdquo;; &ldquo;I am ready to announce the gospel&rdquo;</strong> (1 Cor. 9:16-17; 2 Cor. 12:15; Rom. 1:15).</p>
<p>We must preach the gospel of our own will. This necessity comes from the spirit of the gospel and cannot be done without the spirit of the gospel.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Coming Down from the Throne of Human Dignity</h2>
<p><strong>1. &ldquo;Though I am free from all, I have enslaved myself to all that I might gain the more...To the weak I became weak that I might gain the weak. To all men I have become all things that I might by all means save some. And I do all things for the sake of the gospel that I may become a fellow partaker of it&rdquo;</strong> (1 Cor. 9:19, 22-23).</p>
<p>All people sit on the throne of their human dignity. Both rich and poor people have a throne because both have a sense of dignity. Married women and unmarried women have a throne because both have a sense of dignity. College professors have such a throne, but elementary school teachers also have a throne. Regardless of whether a person is a manager, doctor, nurse, college student, or just a common person, everyone has a throne of human dignity. This throne of human dignity in a believer can be a great barrier to the release of the gospel. Often a brother who is a manager is unwilling to preach the gospel to a clerk, or a sister in college is unwilling to speak about the Lord Jesus to a person who has little education. Thus, in order for the gospel to come forth from them, they must be willing to come down from their throne. This is a matter of the spirit of the gospel; it cannot be done without the spirit of the gospel. The apostle Paul was full of the spirit of the gospel, so he came down from his throne, discarded his human dignity, and became all things to all men so that he might save some. He enslaved himself to all in order to gain more people. For the sake of the gospel, he was willing to lower himself so that he might become a fellow partaker of the gospel. He was a person who came down from his throne, discarded his self-importance, and was full of the spirit of the gospel. Those who are according to the pattern of Paul can release the gospel to any person of any class or position. With them the gospel is completely unhindered and unrestricted.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Spending and Being Utterly Spent</h2>
<p><strong>1. &ldquo;I will most gladly spend and be utterly spent on behalf of your souls&rdquo;; &ldquo;What then is my reward? That in preaching the gospel I may present the gospel without charge&rdquo;; &ldquo;I am ready to announce the gospel to you&rdquo;</strong> (2 Cor. 12:15; 1 Cor. 9:18; Rom. 1:15; see also Matt. 10:8).</p>
<p>The pattern of the apostle Paul in the gospel shows that a person with a spirit of the gospel will spend and be utterly spent for others&rsquo; souls. In Greek <em>spend and be utterly spent</em> means to spend all we have and all we are. Paul presented the gospel without charge and was always ready&mdash;spending himself&mdash;to preach the gospel. A person full of the spirit of the gospel does not care for himself and loves money even less; consequently, the gospel can be released by him. Caring for ourselves and loving money are two great barriers to the release of the gospel. Only the spirit of the gospel can break through and overcome these barriers.</p><h2 class="head2">Not Choosing the Time or Place</h2>
<p><strong>1. &ldquo;Proclaim the word; be ready in season and out of season&rdquo;</strong> (2 Tim. 4:2).</p>
<p>The spirit of the gospel also causes people to preach the gospel in season and out of season without choosing a time or place according to their preference. D. L. Moody was in bed one night when he suddenly realized that he had not preached the gospel to anyone that day. He got up, put on his clothes, and went outside to find someone to whom he could preach the gospel. There was no one on the street because it was late at night. Nevertheless, he looked until he found a night patrolman. He told the patrolman that he must believe in the Lord Jesus and that if he did not believe, he would go to hell. Even though the patrolman was very angry after hearing this, he went to find Moody the next day. Moody then preached the gospel to him in more detail, and he believed. Moody&rsquo;s willingness to preach the gospel in season and out of season earned him the nickname of &ldquo;Crazy Moody.&rdquo;</p>
<h2 class="head2">Not Being Afraid of Sufferings</h2>
<p><strong>1. &ldquo;Suffer evil with the gospel according to the power of God&rdquo;; &ldquo;Striving together along with the faith of the gospel, and in nothing being frightened by the opposers&rdquo;</strong> (2 Tim. 1:8; Phil. 1:27-28).</p>
<p>Preaching the gospel will bring in suffering and persecution. However, when we have the spirit of the gospel, the fear of such things will not hinder us from preaching boldly.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Leaving Everything</h2>
<p><strong>1. &ldquo;There is no one who has left house or brothers or sisters or mother or father or children or fields for My sake and for the gospel&rsquo;s sake, but that he shall receive&rdquo;</strong> (Mark 10:29-30).</p>
<p>Our power in preaching the gospel is based on our ability to leave everything for the Lord and the gospel. We must do this in order to release the gospel with power. This ability is part of the spirit of the gospel, and it comes from the spirit of the gospel.</p>
<p>The most important point in preaching the gospel is not how well we can speak; the most important point is whether we have the spirit of the gospel. When we have the spirit of the gospel, the gospel can be released from us and can enter into others. The spirit of the gospel is the way of the gospel.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE LIFE OF THE GOSPEL</h2>
<h2 class="head2">Living Worthily of the Gospel</h2>
<p><strong>1. &ldquo;Conduct yourselves in a manner worthy of the gospel of Christ&rdquo;</strong> (Phil. 1:27).</p>
<p>In addition to the spirit of the gospel, we must have a life of the gospel. The emphasis of the spirit of the gospel is on power; the emphasis of the life of the gospel is on our living. Some have a great measure of the spirit of the gospel, but their life of the gospel is lacking. Their living is not worthy of the gospel. Our living must be worthy of the gospel that we preach. If it is not, the gospel will not find a proper outlet in us, even if we have a spirit of the gospel. A living that is unworthy of the gospel hinders people from accepting the gospel and from believing in the Lord.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Abiding in the Lord</h2>
<p>1. &ldquo;He who abides in Me and I in him, he bears much fruit&rdquo; (John 15:5).</p>
<p>According to the Lord&rsquo;s word, we must abide in Him if we want to preach the gospel and bear much fruit. To abide in the Lord is simply to fellowship with the Lord. When we fellowship with the Lord, we can bear much fruit and bring many to the Lord. Preaching the gospel does not depend only upon power; it depends also upon life. If we do not fellowship with the Lord and abide in Him, we cannot bear much fruit. Even if we bear a little fruit, it will be the fruit of an inferior life. It will not be rich and bountiful, because different kinds of fruit are produced by different kinds life. If we have a good life that comes from constant fellowship with the Lord, we will bear good fruit.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Being Pruned</h2>
<p><strong>1. &ldquo;Every branch that bears fruit, He prunes it that it may bear more fruit&rdquo;</strong> (John 15:2).</p>
<p>If we want to preach the gospel and bear much fruit, we must be pruned. This does not refer merely to being pruned of things related to filthiness and sin; it refers even more to being pruned of everything that is not proper before God. God prunes every branch that bears fruit so that it can bear more fruit. Pruning is not merely a washing but also a cutting. Everything that is not proper, everything that hinders the branch from bearing more fruit, must be cut away. Although we need to thoroughly deal with sin in order to eliminate all filthiness, we must also receive God&rsquo;s dealing in order to eliminate everything that hinders us from bearing fruit or from bearing much fruit.</p>
<p>Often we cannot bring people to salvation or bring more people to salvation because we have not received enough dealing from the Lord. The Lord desires to deal not only with our errors but also with our being. A person who tends trees must prune the tree&rsquo;s branches so that the tree can bear fruit or bear more fruit. Once the branches are pruned, the tree can bear fruit or bear more fruit. The fact that we have not brought anyone to salvation for a long time or that we have not brought many to salvation proves that we have not allowed the Lord to do a pruning work upon us. We should beseech the Lord to enlighten us and show us the areas that we need to allow Him to prune. The Lord wants to inwardly enlighten us through the Holy Spirit on the one hand and to outwardly deal with us through our circumstances on the other hand. If we receive the Lord&rsquo;s enlightenment inwardly and receive His dealing through our circumstances outwardly, we will be able to bring people to salvation or bring more people to salvation. A brother who comes to every meeting, reads the Bible, prays, and is irreproachable in his conduct may still not be able to bring anyone to the Lord. This does not mean that he has committed some sin; it may mean that he has not allowed the Lord to deal with him. Since the Lord wants him to bear fruit or more fruit, He may change the brother&rsquo;s circumstances. Perhaps He will cause him to lose his job, become sick, or have difficulties at work or at home. The Lord will deal with the brother through his circumstances in order to break him so that he can receive the Lord&rsquo;s pruning and cutting. After a new beginning he will be able to bring people to salvation. The number of people that we can bring to salvation depends on how much dealing we have received from the Lord. We have fresh power when we receive the Lord&rsquo;s fresh dealing. If we had power last year but not this year, we must receive fresh dealings in order to have fresh power to bear fresh fruit. We need to let the Lord prune what needs to be pruned and to break what needs to be broken in order to bear fresh fruit. We must receive the Lord&rsquo;s constant dealing in order to constantly bring people to salvation.</p><h2 class="head1">THE AUTHORITY OF PREACHING THE GOSPEL</h2>
<h2 class="head2">The Authority of Christ</h2>
<p><strong>1. &ldquo;All authority has been given to Me in heaven and on earth. Go therefore&rdquo;</strong> (Matt. 28:18-19).</p>
<p>To preach the gospel, we must have authority. Today the world has been usurped by Satan. All the people in the world lie under his hand (1 John 5:19). People do not receive the gospel, because of the work of Satan. Although many know that believing in the Lord is good and honorable, they simply do not believe. Even though they are not foolish, many do not believe, because the devil cheats and usurps them. The devil hinders them from believing and receiving the gospel. Since preaching the gospel results in demons being cast out, demons can have some ground in those who do not believe and receive the gospel. Casting out demons is not a matter of power but of authority. When a policeman stands at an intersection and raises his hand, cars stop because of his authority, not his power. According to the Lord, we must deal with demons by using authority, not power, and He has given us authority to overcome the power of demons (Luke 10:19). The Lord has given us all authority in heaven and on earth. He rose from the dead and received all authority in heaven and on earth. Consequently, He wants us to preach the gospel to the entire world. We should preach the gospel with His authority as our base. For this we need faith. The gospel that we preach is the gospel of the Lord who received all authority in heaven and on earth. It is the gospel of the One who ascended to the heavens and was made both Lord and Christ (Acts 2:36). He has given us His authority in heaven and on earth and commanded us to preach the gospel. We should apply His authority by faith to deal with all the demons who oppose the gospel, usurp people, and cause them to reject the gospel. We have been sent by the Lord of heaven and earth to announce the glad tidings of release to the captives by preaching the gospel of His salvation (Luke 4:18). We should stand in this position and announce His authoritative gospel by faith, casting out demons and forcing them to leave those whom they have usurped. When we preach the gospel, we must apply this faith. We must have faith. We must believe that Satan has been defeated and that the demons must leave. We must believe that the Lord has won the victory and that sinners should be saved. This faith is based upon the Lord&rsquo;s authority, which He has given to us.</p>
<p>When we go to preach the gospel, we should use this authority to deal with Satan, to deal with the storms and hindrances that he raises up in our path, and even more, to deal with the disturbances and opposition that he stirs up in our environment. When the Lord wanted to cross the sea with the disciples to cast out demons, Satan raised up a storm to hinder the Lord. What did the Lord do? He commanded the winds and the sea. He used His authority to deal with the storm raised up by Satan. The disciples, however, did not realize this, and they did not have faith (Mark 4:35&mdash;5:20). When the apostle Paul was in Paphos on the island of Cyprus, Satan stirred up a man called Bar-jesus to oppose him. In response, Paul used the Lord&rsquo;s authority to deal with him (Acts 13:6-12). Often when we are on the way to preach the gospel or are preaching the gospel, we encounter difficulties that require us not only to pray for a solution but also to apply the Lord&rsquo;s authority to deal with the power behind the difficulties. This requires faith. We need faith to pray and to apply the authority that the Lord has given us.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE POWER OF PREACHING THE GOSPEL</h2>
<h2 class="head2">The Outpouring of the Holy Spirit</h2>
<p><strong>1. &ldquo;Repentance for forgiveness of sins would be proclaimed...I send forth the promise of My Father upon you...Put on power from on high&rdquo;; &ldquo;You shall receive power when the Holy Spirit comes upon you, and you shall be My witnesses...unto the uttermost part of the earth&rdquo;</strong> (Luke 24:47-49; Acts 1:8).</p>
<p>When we preach the gospel, we must also have power. This power is the outpouring of the Holy Spirit. It is the Holy Spirit coming upon us as our power. Before the apostles preached the gospel on the day of Pentecost, they received power. The Holy Spirit promised by God came upon them and caused them to receive power from on high; then they preached the gospel. They received authority at the time of the Lord&rsquo;s resurrection and ascension, but on the day of Pentecost they received the power of the Holy Spirit so that their gospel preaching would be effective. The authority of Christ and the power of the Holy Spirit are interconnected. Authority is a matter of position, whereas power is a matter of condition. According to position, we have the authority of Christ; according to condition, we need the power of the Holy Spirit. We should confess and apply the authority of Christ by faith, and we should pursue and receive the power of the Holy Spirit by faith. We must have the authority of Christ and the power of the Holy Spirit so that our preaching of the gospel would be with authority and power.</p><h2 class="head1">SOME IMPORTANT POINTS REGARDING<br />
THE PREACHING OF THE GOSPEL</h2>
<h2 class="head2">Praying</h2>
<p><strong>1. &ldquo;In prayer and in the ministry of the word&rdquo;</strong> (Acts 6:4; see also 4:31).</p>
<p>There are some important matters that we must pay attention to in preaching the gospel. The first matter is prayer. In order to preach the gospel, we must pray. A person who preaches the gospel must be a person who prays. Merely preaching the gospel is not sufficient. Prayer must accompany the ministry of the word. Sometimes we cannot release the word of God through ministry, but we can release it through prayer; sometimes we cannot speak the word of God into people, but we can pray it into them. We must have sufficient prayer to lead, accompany, and follow our gospel preaching. We should not have many outward activities that have only a minimal amount of prayer behind them.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Following the Holy Spirit</h2>
<p><strong>1. &ldquo;The Spirit said to Philip, Approach and join this chariot. And...Philip ran up&rdquo;</strong> (Acts 8:29-30).</p>
<p>Philip preached the gospel to the Ethiopian eunuch in response to the leading of the Holy Spirit. When we preach the gospel, we should learn to follow the Holy Spirit as we move. We must follow the leading of the Holy Spirit concerning whom to visit and what to say. However, when the brothers and sisters preach the gospel, they often visit people in a loose way and say the same thing to everyone. This does not work. Those who receive our gospel speaking should be chosen by the Holy Spirit. The words of our gospel speaking should also be chosen by the Holy Spirit. When D. L. Moody was preaching the gospel in a certain place, a man came to him after the meeting. Moody had the leading to ask him if he had peace. He angrily said that he had peace. Moody said, &ldquo;My God says that an evil man shall not have peace!&rdquo; The man went home, and the Holy Spirit used this word to work in him. The more he considered his situation, the less peace he had. The next day he went to see Moody and said, &ldquo;Yesterday, when I told you that I had peace, I was lying. After I went home, I felt deeply within that I did not have peace.&rdquo; Moody then brought him to know the Lord and His salvation. The word that Moody spoke was not some customary word. He spoke the word that the Holy Spirit directed him to speak in that instant, so it was a living, powerful word. We should pay attention to, pursue, and learn how to be led by the Spirit in the matter of preaching the gospel.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Speaking the Word of God</h2>
<p><strong>1. &ldquo;Speak the word of God&rdquo;</strong> (Acts 4:31; see also Luke 1:37; Jer. 23:29; Eph. 6:17; Heb. 4:12; Isa. 55:10-11).</p>
<p>The word of God is powerful. It can burn and melt like fire, and it can break and conquer like a great hammer. It can pierce and divide like a sharp sword, and it can water and refresh like rain and snow. Wherever it goes, it never returns in vain; rather, it always accomplishes God&rsquo;s goal. When we preach the gospel, we must speak the word of God. Our message should be the word of God. The content of our message should include words from the Bible. This is effective. Charles H. Spurgeon once preached the gospel at the Crystal Palace in London. Before the event he tested the acoustics of the building by standing on the stage and shouting the words in John 1:29: &ldquo;Behold, the Lamb of God, who takes away the sin of the world!&rdquo; A carpenter who was working in the galleries heard the word, believed, and was saved. A. Paget Wilkes, who was much used by the Lord, once spoke at an outdoor gospel meeting in Japan. While he was speaking, he shouted 1 Corinthians 1:18: &ldquo;The word of the cross is to those who are perishing foolishness!&rdquo; A Japanese man heard this word as he was going past the meeting place to a bad part of town to engage in sinful things. His heart was moved, and he stopped to listen. Eventually, he was saved. There are many examples like this. Thus, in our gospel preaching we must learn to use the words from the Bible. We must become familiar with the words of the Bible in our daily living. Then we will be able to use them at the appropriate time.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Preaching the Lord Jesus</h2>
<p><strong>1. &ldquo;Preach...Christ Jesus as Lord&rdquo;; &ldquo;Taught accurately the things concerning Jesus&rdquo;</strong> (2 Cor. 4:5; Acts 18:25).</p>
<p>When we preach the gospel, we should preach nothing but the Lord Jesus Christ Himself. We should not preach Christianity. Christianity cannot save people; only Christ can. Christ should be the topic and the center of the gospel. We should preach Christ Jesus as Lord and tell others the things concerning Him. We should bring others to know Him, believe in Him, receive Him, turn to Him, and confess Him as their Savior and Lord of all.</p><h2 class="head2">Refusing Questionings</h2>
<p><strong>1. &ldquo;Foolish questionings and those arising from an untrained mind refuse&rdquo;</strong> (2 Tim. 2:23).</p>
<p>When we preach the gospel, we must avoid debating with people. Debating brings in questionings, which can cause people to reject us or become angry. Debating does not help.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Correcting Others in Meekness</h2>
<p><strong>1. &ldquo;Bearing with wrong; in meekness correcting those who oppose&rdquo;; &ldquo;Being always ready for a defense to everyone...yet with meekness and fear&rdquo;</strong> (2 Tim. 2:24-25; 1 Pet. 3:15-16)</p>
<p>When we preach the gospel, we will always meet people who mock, question, oppose, and accuse. We need to be meek in order to answer and correct them in meekness. We should not become angry, lose our temper, or fall into our flesh. No matter what someone else does or says, we should speak in meekness.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Loving Others</h2>
<p><strong>1. &ldquo;If I love you more abundantly, am I loved less?&rdquo;</strong> (2 Cor. 12:15).</p>
<p>In preaching the gospel we must have love toward others; that is, we must have a love for their souls. Having only methods, ways, doctrines, and exhortations will not work. We must have love. We must love people&rsquo;s souls from our heart. Paul loved the Corinthians. He spent and was utterly spent on their behalf. He spent his very being and all he had so that he could bring them to salvation. If we want to bring people to salvation, we must have a heart to love them.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE GOSPEL PREACHING OF THE CHURCH</h2>
<h2 class="head2">Fellowshipping</h2>
<p><strong>1. &ldquo;Your fellowship unto the furtherance of the gospel from the first day until now&rdquo;; &ldquo;Stand firm in one spirit...with the faith of the gospel&rdquo;</strong> (Phil. 1:5, 27).</p>
<p>The power of an individual who preaches the gospel is small, but the power of the church is great. On the day of Pentecost the church preached the gospel, so the preaching was powerful. In our localities we must pay attention to the gospel preaching of the church. The first thing that is needed in order for the church to preach the gospel is fellowship, participation. Brothers and sisters, everyone must have one spirit, one heart, and one will so that the power and blessing of the gospel can be brought into the church.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Striving Together with One Soul</h2>
<p><strong>1. &ldquo;With one soul striving together along with the faith of the gospel&rdquo;</strong> (Phil. 1:27).</p>
<p>When the church preaches the gospel, the brothers and sisters should not merely fellowship but also strive together with one soul. Fellowship, participation, is the consideration in our heart concerning the gospel. Striving together with one soul is our outward action for the gospel. Having only the consideration of fellowship is inadequate. We must also have the action of striving together with one soul. Those who can pray should strive to pray. Those who can offer money should strive to offer money. Those who can pass out tracts should strive to pass out tracts. Those who can invite people should strive to invite people. Those who can preach should strive to preach. Those who can lead in the singing of hymns should strive to lead in the singing of hymns. Those who can visit people should strive to visit people. Everyone should strive according to his ability, carrying out his function. This is striving together with one soul. If the church preaches the gospel this way, there will be a rich harvest.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE REWARD OF PREACHING THE GOSPEL</h2>
<h2 class="head2">Receiving a Reward</h2>
<p><strong>1. &ldquo;If I do this of my own will, I have a reward&rdquo;</strong> (1 Cor. 9:17).</p>
<p>There is a reward for preaching the gospel. If we act according to the Lord&rsquo;s will, we will receive His reward. We need to be faithful in this matter.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Reaping in Joy</h2>
<p><strong>1. &ldquo;Those who sow in tears / Will reap with a ringing shout. / He who goes forth and weeps, / Bearing seed for scattering, / Will no doubt come in with a ringing shout, / Bearing his sheaves with him&rdquo;</strong> (Psa. 126:5-6).</p>
<p>Those who sow the gospel in tears will reap with a ringing shout. Today we rejoice when we see people being saved and coming to the Lord as a result of preaching the gospel. In the future we will rejoice when we see the harvest that our gospel preaching has produced. Joy is a reward for preaching the gospel.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Receiving Wages&mdash;<br />
Gathering Fruit unto Eternal Life</h2>
<p><strong>1. &ldquo;He who reaps receives wages and gathers fruit unto eternal life, in order that he who sows and he who reaps may rejoice together&rdquo;</strong> (John 4:36).</p>
<p>The Lord promised that those who preach the gospel would receive wages, gather fruit unto eternal life, which is to gather saved souls into the heavens and keep them for eternity, and rejoice. These blessings are a reward for preaching the gospel. Many brothers and sisters are busy with the things of this world and do not pay attention to the gospel. They receive material wages, but they do not receive spiritual wages. They gather up much money on earth like a temporary night-blooming flower, but they do not gather up many souls in the heavens as fruit unto eternal life. They have an earthly joy today that brings only sorrow, but they will not receive the heavenly joy of glory. This matter is too important to ignore.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Having Joy and a Crown</h2>
<p><strong>1. &ldquo;My brothers...my joy and crown&rdquo;</strong> (Phil. 4:1; see also 1 Thes. 2:19-20).</p>
<p>Those whom we save are our inward joy and our outward crown, our glory. This is a reward for preaching the gospel.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Not Laboring in Vain</h2>
<p><strong>1. &ldquo;Always abounding in the work of the Lord, knowing that your labor is not in vain in the Lord&rdquo;</strong> (1 Cor. 15:58).</p>
<p>Our labor for the gospel is not in vain. Our fruit will be according to the extent of our labor. This fruit is a reward for preaching the gospel.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE IMPACT OF PREACHING THE GOSPEL<br />
ON THE BELIEVERS</h2>
<h2 class="head2">Providing Shoes for Our Walk</h2>
<p><strong>1. &ldquo;Having shod your feet with the firm foundation of the gospel of peace&rdquo;</strong> (Eph. 6:15; see also Luke 15:22; Rom. 10:15).</p>
<p>The Holy Spirit associates the gospel with shoes for our walk. Preaching the gospel is like shodding our feet with shoes. Shoes help us to walk, protect our feet from injury, separate our feet from the earth so that they do not get dirty from the dust of the ground, and enhance our beauty. If a brother or sister preaches the gospel often and well, their feet are shod from a spiritual point of view. This helps them walk in the Lord&rsquo;s way, protects them from being injured by the world, separates them from the world so that they are not dirtied by the filthiness of the world, and enhances their spiritual beauty. If a brother preaches the gospel to his associates at work, they will not ask him to go to a show or to gamble on the Lord&rsquo;s Day. Instead, they will say that he is a lover of Jesus and will not ask him to participate in sinful things. Thus, he will be separated from the world and not dirtied by the filth of the world. His spiritual walk will not be injured by the world; instead, he will walk in the Lord&rsquo;s way with a spiritual beauty. Preaching the gospel is an item of spiritual armor because it has such a strong effect on believers. It enables us to overcome the power of darkness. We must not despise the gospel or have a lack in this area.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE IMPACT OF PREACHING THE GOSPEL<br />
ON THE WORLD</h2>
<h2 class="head2">Ending the Age</h2>
<p><strong>1. &ldquo;This gospel of the kingdom will be preached in the whole inhabited earth...Then the end will come&rdquo;</strong> (Matt. 24:14).</p>
<p>The end of this age will come when the gospel is preached in the whole inhabited earth. Thus, the impact of preaching the gospel will result in the ending of this age.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Hastening the Lord&rsquo;s Coming</h2>
<p><strong>1. &ldquo;Until the fullness of the Gentiles comes in...&lsquo;The Deliverer will come out of Zion&rsquo;&rdquo;</strong> (Rom. 11:25-26).</p>
<p>When the fullness of Gentiles comes in, the Lord will return. Preaching the gospel hastens the Lord&rsquo;s coming.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER TWENTY-NINE</h1>
<h1 class="title">SERVING THE LORD</h1>
<p>Serving the Lord and preaching the gospel are related. Once a person is saved, he should preach the gospel and serve the Lord. Every normal Christian preaches the gospel and serves the Lord. Furthermore, the more a Christian receives grace, the more he will receive the Lord&rsquo;s leading and dealing and the more he will be able to serve the Lord in a proper way.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE MOTIVE FOR SERVING THE LORD</h2>
<p><strong>1. &ldquo;I love my master;...I will not go out free&rdquo;</strong> (Exo. 21:5).</p>
<p>Believers do not serve the Lord because of outward encouragement or pressure from man. We serve the Lord out of the inward motivation of our love for the Lord. Our love for the Lord inwardly compels us to serve the Lord. It urges us to serve Him. Our love for the Lord makes us unable not to serve the Lord. We love the Lord, so we must serve the Lord. This is typified in the Old Testament by the slave who loved his master. Although the slave could have been free and did not need to continue to serve as a slave, he did not want to go out free because of his love for his master. He willingly remained as a slave to serve the master whom he loved. This is our motive in serving the Lord. We become His servants and serve Him willingly because of our love for Him. Our service to the Lord comes out of our love for Him.</p>
<p><strong>2. &ldquo;I exhort you therefore, brothers, through the compassions of God to present your bodies a living sacrifice...which is your reasonable service&rdquo;</strong> (Rom. 12:1).</p>
<p>We love the Lord because He loves us. The Lord&rsquo;s love moves us and encourages us to love Him. The Lord&rsquo;s love for us produces our love for Him, making it impossible for us not to love Him. Therefore, the Lord&rsquo;s love causes us to love Him and serve Him. For this reason Paul exhorted the believers through the compassions of God to present their bodies a living sacrifice in service to Him. The compassions of God, the love of God, encourage us to love Him and serve Him. We serve Him because His love encourages us and stirs up a love within us for Him. This deep love is our motivation to serve Him, and it makes it impossible for us not to serve Him.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE MEANING OF SERVING THE LORD</h2>
<p><strong>1. &ldquo;Enslaved to God&rdquo;; &ldquo;Christ&rsquo;s slave&rdquo;</strong> (Rom. 6:22; 1 Cor. 7:22).</p>
<p>To serve the Lord is to be the Lord&rsquo;s slave. The word <em>slave</em> is not a very pleasant expression when it is applied to unbelievers in the world, because it often denotes an inferior status. However, the word <em>slave</em> is a felicitous and glorious expression when it is applied to believers because we are serving the Lord. To be a slave of the Lord is a glorious matter! To be a slave is the status of those who serve the Lord and the meaning of serving the Lord. Serving the Lord is not about doing a great work before men; it is about being a slave before the Lord.</p>
<p><strong>2. &ldquo;Live to the Lord&rdquo;</strong> (Rom. 14:8).</p>
<p>Since serving the Lord is a matter of being a slave, it is also a matter of living to the Lord. The entire being of one who truly serves the Lord is to the Lord. His whole living, his entire life, is to the Lord. Therefore, service is a matter of one&rsquo;s entire living. The call to serve the Lord is not limited to full-time workers and preachers. With the Lord&rsquo;s leading, it is possible to serve the Lord by maintaining respectable works in any career (Titus 3:8, 14). Colossians 3:22-24 shows that actual slaves were serving the Lord when they served according to the Lord&rsquo;s will. No matter what our career or job may be, we can serve the Lord as long as it is according to the Lord&rsquo;s will. It is not the Lord&rsquo;s intention that every Christian would leave his job or career to be a full-time preacher. The Lord&rsquo;s will is for every one of us to serve Him, but serving Him does not necessarily mean we must become a preacher. It only means that we live to Him in everything. There are many preachers today who do not necessarily live to the Lord. Similarly, there are many believers who love the Lord and truly live to Him, even though they have a career or job. They may not be preachers, but they are truly serving the Lord by living to the Lord.</p>
<p>According to the Bible, we are not called to make a profession out of preaching; rather, we are called to serve the Lord. This is our career. Any career or job that we have is a secondary matter. Our principal occupation is to serve the Lord; serving the Lord comes first. Our goal for living on the earth is to serve the Lord. We should make serving the Lord the center and goal of our lives. The only reason that we have a career or a job is to make a living and to supply the needs of the Lord&rsquo;s work. We also can contact people through our careers and jobs to preach the gospel to them. No career or job is more important than serving the Lord and preaching the gospel. We should consider our occupation only as something that we do on the side. Our focus should be on serving the Lord and preaching the gospel. Regardless of whether we are doctors, teachers, businessmen, or laborers, our career or job should be for serving the Lord and preaching the gospel. Doctors should serve the Lord and preach the gospel while practicing medicine. Teachers should serve the Lord and preach the gospel while teaching. Whatever our profession, we should serve the Lord and preach the gospel. Each of us should consider serving the Lord and preaching the gospel as our primary occupation and our careers and jobs as secondary occupations. This is the living of a normal Christian. This is the only way to live to the Lord and to serve Him.</p><h2 class="head1">HOW TO SERVE THE LORD</h2>
<p><strong>1. &ldquo;If anyone serves Me, let him follow Me; and where I am, there also My servant will be&rdquo;</strong> (John 12:26).</p>
<p>To serve the Lord, we must follow the Lord. When the Lord was on earth, He walked a path that we must follow in order to serve Him. We must take His way. We must be where He is. Just as He died to Himself and willingly chose the way of the cross in everything, we must do the same. Just as He refused His own will and lived according to God&rsquo;s will, we must do the same. In order to serve Him, we must follow Him and be with Him.</p>
<p><strong>2. &ldquo;David...served his own generation by the counsel of God&rdquo;</strong> (Acts 13:36; see also Heb. 10:7).</p>
<p>In serving the Lord we must serve those of our own generation. However, we must serve by the counsel of God, just as David did in his time. If we do not serve by the counsel of God, we are merely serving people, not serving God. Only what is done according to the counsel of God can be counted as service to the Lord.</p>
<p><strong>3. &ldquo;His master shall bore his ear through with an awl; and he shall serve him forever&rdquo;</strong> (Exo. 21:6; see also Isa. 50:4).</p>
<p>Because our service to the Lord is the service of a slave, we should act according to the Lord&rsquo;s will, not according to our own desires. Thus, in order to serve the Lord, we need to hear His word. We can know the Lord&rsquo;s will only when we hear His word. Those who serve the Lord must hear the Lord so that they can know His will and serve according to His desire in order to please Him. In the Old Testament a slave who wanted to serve his master forever would have his ear bored through with an awl by his master according to God&rsquo;s command. This is a type of a serving one who has ears to hear the word of the Lord in order to serve Him. Our ears must be bored through by the Lord so that we can hear His word and serve Him.</p>
<p><strong>4. &ldquo;They shall come near to Me to minister to Me; and they shall stand before Me&rdquo;</strong> (Ezek. 44:15).</p>
<p>Once we have ears to hear, we must come near to the Lord, minister to the Lord, and stand before the Lord. Then we will know what He wants us to do and how He wants us to do it. In this way we can serve Him according to His will, match His heart&rsquo;s desire, and be acceptable to Him.</p>
<p><strong>5. &ldquo;Serving God with fastings and petitions night and day&rdquo;; &ldquo;They were ministering to the Lord and fasting&rdquo;</strong> (Luke 2:37; Acts 13:2).</p>
<p>In serving the Lord we need to fast and pray to seek Him in addition to contacting Him and standing before Him. To fast means that we are willing to give up our rightful enjoyment and to suffer in order to seek the Lord&rsquo;s desire and accomplish the Lord&rsquo;s will. To pray means to ask the Lord to reveal His desire and to accomplish His will. We must not be lacking in prayer and fasting in our service to the Lord. Strong and proper service to the Lord includes both prayer and fasting.</p>
<p><strong>6. &ldquo;The faithful and prudent slave&rdquo;</strong> (Matt. 24:45).</p>
<p>We must also be faithful and prudent in our service to the Lord. Faithfulness must be accompanied with prudence. If we are faithful without being prudent, we will make a mess of our service to the Lord, and the result of our service will be the exact opposite of our desire in serving Him. Only faithfulness with prudence can fulfill our desire in serving the Lord.</p>
<p><strong>7. &ldquo;Let your loins be girded and your lamps burning, and you be like men waiting for their own master when he returns&rdquo;</strong> (Luke 12:35-36).</p>
<p>In order to serve Him, we must gird our loins, have our lamps burning, and wait for the Lord&rsquo;s return. Girding our loins means that we are not loose, having a burning lamp means that we live in the light, and waiting for the Lord means that we are watchful. Our service to the Lord must be according to these conditions.</p>
<p><strong>8. &ldquo;That I may finish my course and the ministry which I have received from the Lord Jesus&rdquo;</strong> (Acts 20:24).</p>
<p>We must be faithful to the end in our service to the Lord. We must not begin and then quit, leaving things half done. We must not be loose or light in the matter of serving the Lord. We must be clear about the ministry that the Lord has allotted to us and know the course that the Lord wants us to finish. Once we are clear about the course that the Lord has chosen, we must be faithful and endure, finishing the course and fulfilling the ministry that we have received from the Lord.</p>
<h2 class="head1">SERVING IN COORDINATION<br />
IN THE SERVICE OF THE CHURCH</h2>
<p><strong>1. &ldquo;There are distinctions of ministries, yet the same Lord&rdquo;</strong> (1 Cor. 12:5).</p>
<p>Although there are distinctions of ministries in our service to the Lord, every believer serves the same Lord. We may do different things in serving the Lord, but we all serve the same Lord together. Therefore, in the matter of serving the Lord, there is a need for coordination. We cannot serve the Lord individually or in isolation. We must serve together in coordination.</p>
<p><strong>2. &ldquo;The body is not one member but many. If the foot should say, Because I am not a hand, I am not of the body, it is not that because of this it is not of the body. And if the ear should say, Because I am not an eye, I am not of the body, it is not that because of this it is not of the body. If the whole body were an eye, where would the hearing be? If the whole were the hearing, where would the smelling be? But now God has placed the members, each one of them, in the body, even as He willed. And if all were one member, where would the body be? But now the members are many, but the body one. And the eye cannot say to the hand, I have no need of you; nor again the head to the feet, I have no need of you. But much rather the members of the body which seem to be weaker are necessary. And those members of the body which we consider to be less honorable, these we clothe with more abundant honor; and our uncomely members come to have more abundant comeliness, but our comely members have no need. But God has blended the body together, giving more abundant honor to the member that lacked&rdquo;</strong> (1 Cor. 12:14-24).</p>
<p>The church is the Body of Christ. Every believer has a part in the church and is a member of the Body of Christ&mdash;the church. We, the many members added together, are the Body of Christ. Each member has a function, and all these functions belong to the Body of Christ and are for the Body of Christ. Therefore, to exercise our function as a member, we must be in the Body of Christ and for the Body of Christ. Consequently, in the church we must coordinate with one another in the service with all the saints, our fellow members. This service in coordination with all the saints is the corporate service of the church, which is especially pleasing to the Lord. He particularly wants to gain this, and it is especially effective in bringing in the Lord&rsquo;s blessing.</p>
<p>If we want to serve in coordination with all the saints in the church, we must deal with our individualism in spiritual matters. We must deal with our independence in matters of service. We must also deal with our flesh, temper, disposition, self, and natural man. If these are not dealt with and broken by the cross, it will be impossible for us to serve in the church in coordination with all the saints, and it will be impossible for the Lord to gain the corporate service of His Body in the church. We must go through the dealing of the Holy Spirit and the breaking of the cross in order to have the coordinated service of the church. We must allow the Holy Spirit to use the cross to crucify our flesh, disposition, self, individualism, and independence so that we can coordinate with all the saints in the church to manifest the service of the Body of Christ.</p>
<p>Because we are members of the Body of Christ, our function is both of the Body of Christ and for the Body of Christ. According to the rule and principle, we must live in the Body of Christ, the church, in order to manifest our function as members. If we are not in the church, there will be a problem with our function. Our physical body is living, and every member that is attached to it can exercise according to its function. However, once a member becomes detached, it dies and loses its function. There is also a beautiful and lovable aspect to the living and functioning of any member that is attached to a living body, but as soon as a member is separated from the body, it becomes not only dead and functionless but also ugly and frightening. A living and functioning hand that is attached to our body is beautiful and lovable. When people see us, they even want to shake our hand. But if our hand is separated from our body, it will not only lose its function; it will also become something quite frightening to others. This is the condition of some believers before the Lord. They are separated from the church, they have lost their function as members, and they have become quite frightening to others. May the Lord have mercy on such brothers and sisters, and may He have mercy on us!</p>
<p>In the coordinated service of the church every brother and sister, every member, is necessary. Even the smallest member is necessary. In our body no member is so small that he does not have any function. Every member, no matter how small, has a function; therefore, every member is necessary. If we truly see the service of the Body of Christ and truly know the coordinated service of the church, we will realize that every brother and sister is necessary. The brothers and sisters need us, and we need every brother and sister. Everyone must exercise his function so that we can have coordination in the service of the church.</p>
<p><strong>3. &ldquo;God has placed some in the church: first apostles, second prophets, third teachers; then works of power, then gifts of healing, helps, administrations, various kinds of tongues&rdquo;</strong> (1 Cor. 12:28).</p>
<p>In the church God has placed all kinds of people with different functions for our coordinated service. Whether apostles, prophets, teachers, workers of power, those with gifts of healing, helps, administrations, or speakers of tongues; everyone is a part of the coordinated service of the church, and everyone is necessary. No one can replace the service of another, and no one person can fulfill all the service of the church. The service of the church is a coordinated service of the Body of Christ, and every member needs to participate according to his function.</p>
<p><strong>4. &ldquo;Out from whom all the Body, being joined together and being knit together through every joint of the rich supply and through the operation in the measure of each one part, causes the growth of the Body unto the building up of itself in love&rdquo;</strong> (Eph. 4:16).</p>
<p>The church is the Body of Christ, and Christ is the Head of the church. The life that we receive from Him makes us His Body. Therefore, the life within us is the life of the Body, and we all have this life. If we live in this life, we will not only abide in Him, being joined to and fellowshipping with Him, but we will also be joined and knit together with all the saints. Then the Body, through every joint of the rich supply and through the operation in the measure of each one part, will supply itself and grow unto the building up of itself in love. The Body grows and is built up through the function and the coordinated service of all the members.</p>
<p>A person who truly lives in the life of Christ is in the Body of Christ, the church. He is joined and knit together with all the members in a coordinated service. The life of Christ within us is the life of His Body, and it causes us to grow into His Body. If we act independently according to our own opinion in our service, our living will be in ourselves. However, if we live in the life of Christ, we will not act independently in our service to the Lord. The life of Christ requires us to coordinate with all the saints in the service in His Body&mdash;the church.</p>
<p><strong>5. &ldquo;Each one, as he has received a gift, ministering it among yourselves as good stewards of the varied grace of God. If anyone speaks, as speaking oracles of God; if anyone ministers, as ministering out of the strength which God supplies; that in all things God may be glorified through Jesus Christ&rdquo;</strong> (1 Pet. 4:10-11).</p>
<p>We must serve one another according to the gifts that we have received. We must use our gift as good stewards of the varied grace of God. We should not feel that our gift is too small and not participate in the service of the church. Even the smallest gift can be useful in the coordinated service of the church. In the service of the church many matters and many things are needed. Some require large gifts, and some require only small gifts. May we faithfully use our gifts, no matter how large or small, so that God can be glorified.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE REWARD FOR SERVING THE LORD</h2>
<p><strong>1. &ldquo;If anyone serves Me, the Father will honor him&rdquo;</strong> (John 12:26).</p>
<p>The first reward for serving the Lord is to be honored by the Father. This is a great matter. It should cause us to pursue serving the Lord.</p>
<p><strong>2. &ldquo;Blessed are those slaves whom the master, when he comes, will find watching. Truly I tell you that he will gird himself and will have them recline at table, and he will come to them and serve them&rdquo;</strong> (Luke 12:37).</p>
<p>Today we are slaves serving the Lord. When the Lord returns, we will receive the blessing of reclining at table and being served by Him. This blessing is a reward for our service to the Lord.</p>
<p><strong>3. &ldquo;Well done, good and faithful slave...I will set you over many things. Enter into the joy of your master&rdquo;</strong> (Matt. 25:21; see also 24:47; Luke 19:17).</p>
<p>If we are good and faithful slaves of the Lord today, we will receive the reward of being set over many things in the future, and we will enter into His joy.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE PUNISHMENT FOR NOT SERVING THE LORD</h2>
<p><strong>1. &ldquo;That slave who knew his master&rsquo;s will and did not prepare or do according to his will, will receive many lashes&rdquo;</strong> (Luke 12:47).</p>
<p>All believers should serve the Lord. If we serve the Lord, we will receive a reward. If we do not serve the Lord, we will be punished. Since we know that it is the Lord&rsquo;s will for us to serve Him, we will not escape His punishment if we do not serve according to His will. This is a warning to us.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER THIRTY</h1>
<h1 class="title">MEETING</h1>
<p>Meeting with one another is a very important Christian practice, so we will consider it carefully.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE IMPORTANCE OF MEETING</h2>
<p><strong>1. &ldquo;Where there are two or three gathered into My name, there am I in their midst&rdquo;</strong> (Matt. 18:20).</p>
<p>If two or three believers are gathered into the Lord&rsquo;s name, He promises that He will be in their midst. This shows that He is with us when we meet. When we personally contact the Lord, we surely can touch His sweet presence and receive His grace, but we receive a different supply in the meetings. Even though the blessing that we receive in our personal contact with the Lord cannot be replaced by what we receive in the meetings, the presence of the Lord in the meetings provides a supply that cannot be obtained through only personal contact with the Lord. The presence of the Lord in the meetings always enlightens us and blesses us; it is very precious. This preciousness speaks of the importance of meeting with one another.</p>
<p><strong>2. &ldquo;They rose up that very hour and returned to Jerusalem, and they found the eleven and those with them assembled together...And as they were speaking these things, He Himself stood in their midst and said to them, Peace to you&rdquo;</strong> (Luke 24:33, 36).</p>
<p>The two disciples on the road to Emmaus met the Lord, and they walked and talked with Him. Yet even when He explained the Bible to them, they did not recognize Him. However, when the Lord reclined at table with them, their eyes were opened, and they recognized Him as the Lord. Then the Lord suddenly disappeared. Realizing that they were headed in the wrong direction and to the wrong place, they immediately rose up and returned to Jerusalem. When they arrived, they found the eleven apostles assembled together and met with them. While they were meeting, the Lord came into their midst; they received the blessing of His appearing and experienced His presence. Without participating in that meeting, they would not have received the blessing of the Lord&rsquo;s appearance. This experience shows the importance of meeting.</p>
<p><strong>3. &ldquo;Thomas...was not with them when Jesus came...After eight days, His disciples were again within, and Thomas was with them. Jesus came, though the doors were shut, and stood in the midst&rdquo;</strong> (John 20:24, 26).</p>
<p>Thomas was the last of the eleven disciples to see the Lord after His resurrection. In the evening of the day of the Lord&rsquo;s resurrection, the Lord came and stood in the midst of the disciples and appeared to them, but Thomas was not with them. After eight days the disciples gathered together again, and Thomas was with them. When the Lord appeared in the midst of them again, Thomas finally saw the Lord. This shows that in the meetings of the disciples&mdash;us&mdash;the Lord often appears. If we attend the meeting, we will gain the Lord&rsquo;s appearing; if not, we will miss it. This indicates the importance of meeting.</p>
<p>The Lord&rsquo;s appearing and presence are the most important point of meeting. In every meeting we should meet the Lord. Listening to a message, prayer, or other matters are not the most important aspects of meeting. The most important point of every meeting is to touch and meet the Lord.</p>
<p><strong>4. &ldquo;As the day of Pentecost was being fulfilled, they were all together in the same place...And they were all filled with the Holy Spirit&rdquo;</strong> (Acts 2:1-4).</p>
<p>When the Holy Spirit descended on the day of Pentecost, He did not descend upon individual believers in separate places; He descended upon the disciples when they were meeting together. He did not outwardly fill the individual believers who were separate from one another; He filled the disciples who were in the meeting. Only the disciples participating in that meeting obtained the outpouring of the Holy Spirit at the time. Those who did not come to the meeting missed this opportunity. This shows the importance of meeting.</p>
<p><strong>5. &ldquo;Incite one another to love and good works, not abandoning our own assembling together...but exhorting one another; and so much the more as you see the day drawing near&rdquo;</strong> (Heb. 10:24-25).</p>
<p>The meetings enable us to care for one another, exhort one another, and incite one another to love and good works. The meetings cause us to have spiritual fellowship with all the saints and to receive the life supply from the saints. Therefore, we should not abandon our own assembling together, especially in these last days of deep darkness. If we cease to meet, we will not only lose the blessings of the meetings, but we also will develop a habit of not meeting. Then we will become colder and colder until we have no way to fervently pursue the Lord and serve Him.</p>
<p>There was a brother in a Western country who had not been to a meeting for a long time. Whenever a co-worker went to visit him, he was not home. One day during winter a co-worker went to visit the brother, and he saw a fire burning in the fireplace of his living room. He took the coals out of the stove, allowed them to cool, and then scattered them on the floor of the living room. When the brother returned home and saw coals scattered over the floor and no fire in the fireplace, he was very angry. After he found out that the co-worker was responsible, he went to speak with him. The co-worker said to him, &ldquo;Brother, you are like one of those cold, dead pieces of coal. Satan has taken you out of the stove of the meetings, causing you to leave the church so that you are no longer burning.&rdquo; When the brother heard this word, he immediately woke up and began to come to the meetings once again.</p>
<p>By ourselves we cannot burn or be hot. We need to meet with the saints. The more wood or coal there is, the more quickly and brightly a fire will burn. When a Christian becomes isolated, he is cheated by the devil and eventually becomes cold and dead. If we do not want to be cold and dead, we must regularly attend the meetings of the church. The church is the sanctuary of God. His presence as well as the light of His presence are there. Many brothers and sisters can testify that coming to a meeting often causes their feelings of darkness or inward oppression to be replaced with a sense of enlightenment and freedom. Sometimes we feel sad, hurt, or depressed, but as soon as we come to a meeting, we receive comfort, our spirit is released, and our burdens disappear. The meetings remove our burdens and give us a sense of comfort, rest, release, and freedom. They resolve many problems. They provide us with a clear sense of the Lord&rsquo;s leading, a sense that we often cannot obtain through our seeking of the Lord by ourselves. In the meetings light shines on specific portions of the Bible that are beyond our understanding in our personal study of the Word. They also provide an atmosphere in which people can be brought to salvation, even persons whom we have been unable to lead to the Lord in our individual contact.</p>
<p>In the church meetings God gives grace, and people receive grace. In the church meetings the saints also display the grace that they have received. Whenever we meet, we should not only receive God&rsquo;s grace but also display the grace that we have received in order to glorify God, shame the enemy, and supply others. Our meetings involve more than only worshipping God and listening to His Word, and they involve more than simply fellowshipping with God and receiving His grace. They also are for our fellowship with the saints about the matters in which we have been graced. We must fellowship with the brothers and sisters in the grace of God and supply others with His grace through this fellowship. Thus, whenever we attend a meeting, we must open our spirit. When our spirit is open, we can supply others with the grace that we have received through prayers, a hymn, or a short word. If our spirit is not open, we cannot receive the supply from others. In the meetings we must supply the grace of God to help others and to receive the grace of God from others. If our spirit is closed during the meeting, the meeting will be low, heavy, and full of death to us. Our spirit must be open and released in the meetings. Once our spirit is released, grace and light will come, darkness and error will disappear, and everyone will receive the supply of life. All death will be swallowed up. Supplying one another and building up one another is a great principle in our meeting. If there is a mutual function according to God&rsquo;s grace, the grace that we receive will increase. In order to receive grace in this way, we must meet, and when we meet, we must open our spirit.</p>
<p>Christian meetings are important. The Christian life is not an individualistic life; it is the life of a flock that requires us to gather together and to live a corporate flock life. We are like bees and ants that live together rather than by themselves.</p><h2 class="head1">THE KINDS OF MEETINGS</h2>
<h2 class="head2">The Table Meeting</h2>
<p><strong>1. &ldquo;We gathered together to break bread&rdquo;; &ldquo;Come together...to eat the Lord&rsquo;s supper&rdquo;</strong> (Acts 20:7; 1 Cor. 11:20).</p>
<p>The first meeting for those who have received the Lord&rsquo;s redemption is the table meeting. Whereas other meetings emphasize our receiving, only the table meeting emphasizes the Lord&rsquo;s receiving. In this meeting we break bread, which is to eat the Lord&rsquo;s supper. Breaking bread and eating the Lord&rsquo;s supper speak of two aspects of one matter. Breaking bread emphasizes the fellowship that we have with all the saints through the Lord&rsquo;s bread and cup. Eating the Lord&rsquo;s supper emphasizes our remembrance of the Lord through eating His bread and drinking of His cup.</p>
<h2 class="head3">The First Section&mdash;Remembering the Lord</h2>
<p><strong>1. &ldquo;He took a loaf and gave thanks, and He broke it and gave it to them, saying,...Do this in remembrance of Me&rdquo;; &ldquo;Similarly also the cup,...saying,...This do, as often as you drink it, unto the remembrance of Me&rdquo;</strong> (Luke 22:19; 1 Cor. 11:25).</p>
<p>The table meeting has two sections. The first section extends from the beginning of the meeting until the passing of the bread and wine has been completed. In this portion of the meeting, the central point is the remembrance of the Lord. We should think only of the Lord&rsquo;s person and work, that is, how the Lord is God yet man, how He is our Lord, our Savior, and our all. We should also consider how He loves us, having accomplished redemption for us, intercedes for us, graces us, upholds us, and cares for us. We should also remember how He is coming to rapture us. When we remember the Lord, we should pray with thanksgiving and praise when we have the inspiration. We also can express our praise through hymns, reading Bible verses, or speaking something so that all the saints would have the same feeling and remembrance of the Lord. In this portion of the meeting our prayers, hymns, and speaking should center on the Lord&rsquo;s person and work and cause people to touch the Lord&rsquo;s person and work. We should not center on anything else or cause others to think about something other than the Lord. Sometimes during our remembrance of the Lord, a brother will report on the needs of another brother, or a sister may pray concerning the hardships of another sister. These things do not relate to our remembrance of the Lord; they should be considered in the fellowship and prayer meetings. At the Lord&rsquo;s table we should forget about everything and concentrate on remembering the Lord. We should think only of the Lord Himself and His glory, honor, work, and deeds. Our inward heart and outward actions should be centered on the Lord so that He can gain our remembrance (see chapter 20, &ldquo;The Breaking of Bread&rdquo;).</p>
<h2 class="head3">The Second Section&mdash;Worshipping the Father</h2>
<p><strong>1. &ldquo;After singing a hymn, they went out to the Mount of Olives&rdquo;; &ldquo;In the midst of the church I will sing hymns of praise to You&rdquo;</strong> (Matt. 26:30; Heb. 2:12).</p>
<p>After the bread and cup have been passed and are consumed in the table meeting, we should begin the second section of the meeting, which extends to the end of the meeting. The center of this time is the worship of the Father. All our prayers, hymns, and speaking should be focused on the Father. When the Lord Jesus finished breaking bread with His disciples, they sang a hymn to the Father before He led them to the Mount of Olives. Now in resurrection He sings hymns of praise to the Father in the midst of the church, leading us, who are sons, to sing with Him in praise to the Father. Through death and resurrection, the only begotten Son of the Father has dispensed His life into us, making us the many sons of God. Now He is the Firstborn among many brothers. In resurrection He leads us, as His many brothers, to worship and praise the Father with Him in His position as the Firstborn. After eating the bread and drinking the cup, we should willingly follow Him in spirit in the worship of the Father. This worship comes from the many brothers who follow the Firstborn. In this worship all prayers, hymns, and speaking should be addressed to the Father and center on the Father.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Prayer Meeting</h2>
<p><strong>1. &ldquo;If two of you are in harmony on earth concerning any matter for which they ask, it will be done for them from My Father who is in the heavens. For where there are two or three gathered into My name&rdquo;</strong> (Matt. 18:19-20).</p>
<p>In these verses the Lord speaks of prayer in the meeting, the gathering, of the saints. This kind of prayer is more powerful than individual prayer. It can bind what has been bound in the heavens and loose what has been loosed in the heavens. For such power, however, there is a need for harmony. If we desire this kind of prayer, we must come together and pray with one accord.</p>
<p><strong>2. &ldquo;These all continued steadfastly with one accord in prayer, together with the women&rdquo;</strong> (Acts 1:14).</p>
<p>This verse refers to a prayer meeting which brought in the blessing of Pentecost. The prayer of the church has special power. We must be in one accord. The moment that we are not in one accord, the prayer of the church is killed. This is a spiritual law.</p>
<p><strong>3. &ldquo;They continued steadfastly in...the prayers&rdquo;</strong> (Acts 2:42).</p>
<p>At the time of Pentecost those who were saved prayed steadfastly. This does not refer to individual prayer but to prayer in the meetings, because they met frequently.</p>
<p><strong>4. &ldquo;They lifted up their voice with one accord to God...and when they had so besought, the place in which they were gathered was shaken&rdquo;</strong> (Acts 4:24, 31).</p>
<p>These verses refer to a prayer meeting held by the early disciples when they encountered persecution. Their prayer in one accord caused them to not fear or shrink back in the face of the threat of persecution but to testify more boldly for the Lord.</p>
<p><strong>5. &ldquo;Prayer was being made fervently by the church to God&rdquo;; &ldquo;There was a considerable number assembled together and praying&rdquo;</strong> (Acts 12:5, 12).</p>
<p>When Peter was in prison, the church prayed fervently for him. A considerable number gathered solely for the purpose of praying for him. Their prayer caused God to work a great miracle to save Peter from prison. When the church encounters significant problems, we should meet together to pray. This prayer always carries authority.</p>
<p>When we attend the prayer meeting, we must remember that we not only come to meet but to pray. We must open and exercise our spirit to receive a burden for our prayer. Once we have a sense of burden in our spirit, we should all open our mouth to pray. If we do not practice this, the atmosphere of the prayer meeting will be very heavy, and little prayer will be released.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Meeting for the Mutual Building Up<br />
through the Exercise of Spiritual Gifts</h2>
<p><strong>1. &ldquo;Whenever you come together, each one has a psalm, has a teaching, has a revelation, has a tongue, has an interpretation. Let all things be done for building up&rdquo;</strong> (1 Cor. 14:26).</p>
<p>The meeting spoken of in this verse is for the exercise of the spiritual gifts. In this meeting one person does not do one particular thing; rather, everyone should follow the leading of the Holy Spirit in the exercise of spiritual gifts. Some may have a hymn, some may have a teaching, some may do this, and some do that. The goal of all spiritual exercise, however, is the building up of the church.</p>
<p><strong>2. &ldquo;If anyone speaks in a tongue, it should be by two, or at the most three, and in turn, and one should interpret; but if there is no interpreter, he should be silent in the church, and speak to himself and to God&rdquo;</strong> (1 Cor. 14:27-28).</p>
<p>In the meetings for building up, the exercise of the gift of tongues should be in turn and at most by two or three; more than this can cause confusion. Furthermore, there must be an interpreter; otherwise, the one speaking in a tongue should be silent, speaking to himself and to God.</p>
<p><strong>3. &ldquo;As to prophets, two or three should speak, and the others discern. But if something is revealed to another sitting by, the first should be silent. For you can all prophesy one by one that all may learn and all may be encouraged. And the spirits of prophets are subject to prophets; for God is not a God of confusion but of peace&rdquo;</strong> (1 Cor. 14:29-33).</p>
<p>In meetings for the exercise of the spiritual gifts, there should at most be three prophets who speak for God, and they must speak in an orderly manner. They should not allow their spirits to become unruly and unrestrained; otherwise, the meeting will be in confusion, and the saints will not be edified. A person who wants to speak for God as an oracle of God should control his spirit since the spirits of prophets are subject to prophets. God is not a God of confusion but of peace. In a confused meeting people cannot be built up by the word of God. Building up can occur only in a peaceful meeting.</p>
<p><strong>4. &ldquo;As in all the churches of the saints, the women should be silent in the churches&rdquo;</strong> (1 Cor. 14:33-36).</p>
<p>This is God&rsquo;s rule for the sisters concerning our meeting to speak for Him. God does not allow the sisters to minister the Word in the church meetings because sisters should stand in a position of having their heads covered. According to God&rsquo;s arrangement, brothers represent the head, and sisters represent the covered head. Therefore, when the brothers and sisters meet together, the brothers who represent the head should exercise the headship to speak, and the sisters who represent the covered head should cover their heads and not minister the Word. However, this does not mean sisters cannot preach the word in other situations. Sisters can preach the word at home, to children, and to women. However, in the meetings of the church, which are meetings with the brothers and the sisters, there are brothers who represent the head, so the sisters should keep the position of a covered head.</p>
<p><strong>5. &ldquo;All things must be done becomingly and in order&rdquo;</strong> (1 Cor. 14:40).</p>
<p>The goal of meeting to exercise spiritual gifts is the building up, so everything must be done becomingly and in order. If the meeting does not progress in an orderly manner, it cannot build people up. A meeting that builds up must absolutely be done becomingly and in order.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Meeting to Read the Word of God</h2>
<p><strong>1. &ldquo;When they had gathered the multitude together, they handed them the letter. And when they read it, they rejoiced at the encouragement&rdquo;</strong> (Acts 15:30-31).</p>
<p>In the early days when Paul and his companions arrived in Antioch, they gathered the multitude together and read the letter that the Holy Spirit had led the apostles and elders in Jerusalem to write. Therefore, sometimes we need to meet together to read the Bible.</p>
<p><strong>2. &ldquo;When this letter is read among you, cause that it be read in the church of the Laodiceans also, and that you also read the one from Laodicea&rdquo;</strong> (Col. 4:16).</p>
<p>When the early churches read letters written to them by the apostles, they met together for this reading. Sometimes we need to meet to read the Word of God, the Bible.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Meeting to Hear a Message</h2>
<p><strong>1. &ldquo;When we gathered together...Paul conversed with them since he was to go forth on the next day&rdquo;</strong> (Acts 20:7).</p>
<p>The believers in Troas met together to listen to the apostle Paul converse with them about spiritual matters so that they could be established. We should also meet to hear the ministry of the Word of God so that we can be edified and built up.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Meeting to Hear a Report</h2>
<p><strong>1. &ldquo;When they arrived and gathered the church together, they declared the things that God had done with them&rdquo;</strong> (Acts 14:27).</p>
<p>When the apostle Paul and his co-workers came back from a ministry journey, they gathered the church and declared the things that God had done with them. Sometimes we need to meet to hear a report related to the service of the church or the work.</p>
<h2 class="head1">HOW TO MEET</h2>
<p><strong>1. &ldquo;Gathered into My name&rdquo;</strong> (Matt. 18:20).</p>
<p>The important point regarding our meeting together is that we must be gathered into the Lord&rsquo;s name. This is to meet in the Lord&rsquo;s name. We belong to the Lord, and we have salvation in the Lord&rsquo;s name. Therefore, we should meet only in the Lord&rsquo;s name and into the Lord&rsquo;s name. We should not meet in, belong to, or meet into any name other than His name, including names related to a person, a group, a mission board, or a denomination. We should meet only in the Lord&rsquo;s name. We should not meet under any other name. We should take only the Lord&rsquo;s name. We should lift up His name. No other name should have any position with us.</p>
<p><strong>2. &ldquo;Day by day, continuing steadfastly with one accord...from house to house&rdquo;</strong> (Acts 2:46).</p>
<p>We need to meet often. It is best if we meet every day. We also need to continue steadfastly with one accord. If there are too many people, for the sake of convenience, we can meet in the homes of the saints.</p>
<p><strong>3. &ldquo;The whole church comes together in one place&rdquo;</strong> (1 Cor. 14:23; see also Acts 2:44).</p>
<p>We can meet in homes, but sometimes the whole church needs to come together in one place. Home meetings have their benefit and flavor, and meetings of the whole church together in one place have their benefit and flavor. We should have home meetings, and we should also have meetings of the whole church together in one place.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER THIRTY-ONE</h1>
<h1 class="title">READING THE BIBLE</h1>
<h2 class="head1">THE ORIGIN OF THE BIBLE</h2>
<p><strong>1. &ldquo;God-breathed&rdquo;</strong> (2 Tim. 3:16).</p>
<p>The Bible is God-breathed. The Bible is not something that comes from man&rsquo;s ideas or thoughts; rather, the Bible contains the thoughts and words of God, which were breathed into men through His Spirit and then written down.</p>
<p><strong>2. &ldquo;Men spoke from God while being borne by the Holy Spirit&rdquo;</strong> (2 Pet. 1:21).</p>
<p>Since the Bible is the word of God breathed out through His Spirit, the words in the Bible do not represent the ideas of man. Rather, they are words from God to men who were borne by the Holy Spirit. These men spoke while being borne by the Holy Spirit, just as a sailboat is blown, borne, and moves with the wind. Those who wrote the Bible were inspired by and under the power of the Holy Spirit; they were blown and borne by the Holy Spirit to express the word of God. The Bible did not come only from men nor does it express only the ideas of these men. Instead, these men wrote the word that came out of God.</p>
<p><strong>3. &ldquo;Spoken to you by God&rdquo;</strong> (Matt. 22:31).</p>
<p>After referring to reading the word that was &ldquo;spoken to you by God&rdquo; in verse 31, the Lord Jesus quoted a verse from the Old Testament in verse 32. The Lord&rsquo;s word in verse 31, therefore, proves that the words of the Old Testament were spoken by God and originated from God, even though they were written by prophets.</p>
<p><strong>4. &ldquo;God, having spoken of old in many portions and in many ways to the fathers in the prophets, has at the last of these days spoken to us in the Son&rdquo;</strong> (Heb. 1:1-2).</p>
<p>The Old Testament is the word that God spoke in the prophets of old to the fathers. The New Testament is the speaking of God in His Son, our Lord Jesus Christ. Both the words spoken by the prophets in the Old Testament and the words spoken by the Lord Jesus in the New Testament were spoken by God and were out of God.</p>
<p><strong>5. &ldquo;The words of God&rdquo;</strong> (John 8:47).</p>
<p>In this verse the Lord Jesus clearly stated that the words He spoke were the words of God.</p>
<p><strong>6. &ldquo;The Holy Spirit...will teach you all things and remind you of all the things which I have said to you&rdquo;</strong> (John 14:26).</p>
<p>When the Lord Jesus spoke of leaving the disciples, He prophesied that the Holy Spirit would come to teach the disciples and cause them to remember that the things that He had said to them. This word indicates that the Holy Spirit descended and inspired the disciples to write the books of the New Testament. The books of the New Testament are of the Holy Spirit, and they have divine authority.</p>
<p><strong>7. &ldquo;The Spirit...will declare&rdquo;</strong> (John 16:13).</p>
<p>The Lord&rsquo;s word in this verse indicates that the disciples spoke and wrote what the Spirit declared to them. The books of the New Testament, which were written by the Lord&rsquo;s disciples after His ascension, come from the Holy Spirit&rsquo;s revelation. This is an acknowledgment of their divine authority.</p>
<p>The Bible is the word that God commanded man to write (Exo. 34:27). It is the speaking of the Spirit of God through men who were inspired by the Holy Spirit (2 Sam. 23:2; Mark 12:36). The Old Testament is the word of God spoken by the prophets, according to His command (Jer. 1:7). It is the word of God that the priests received (Ezek. 1:3), and it is the speaking of the Spirit of God through the prophets (Zech. 7:7; Acts 3:18; 28:25; Rom. 1:2; 1 Pet. 1:10-12). The New Testament is the word spoken by God in the Lord Jesus (John 14:10) and the word declared by the Holy Spirit and then written by the apostles (1 Cor. 2:13). The words of the Holy Spirit to the apostles have the same divine status as the words in the Old Testament (2 Pet. 3:15-16). Therefore, the words in the entire Bible are from God. Every word and sentence, iota and serif (Matt. 5:18), were revealed by God. We must neither add to the Bible nor take away anything from it (Rev. 22:18-19).</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE FUNCTIONS OF THE BIBLE</h2>
<p><strong>1. &ldquo;Testify concerning Me&rdquo;</strong> (John 5:39, see also v. 46; Luke 24:27, 44, 46).</p>
<p>The first function of the Bible is to testify concerning the Lord Jesus. The Lord Jesus is the subject and content of the Bible, and the Bible is the explanation and expression of the Lord Jesus. The Lord Jesus is the <em>living</em> Word of God, whereas the Bible is the <em>written</em> Word of God. If the written Word, the Bible, did not have the living Word, the Lord Jesus, as its reality, it would be nothing but empty doctrines and letters. If the living Word, the Lord Jesus, did not have the written Word, the Bible, as His expression, He would be abstract and vague and difficult to know and touch. Thankfully, we have the distinct and definite explanation of the Bible with its clear revelation so that we can know and understand the Lord Jesus. The books of the New Testament reveal the Lord Jesus, and even the books of the Old Testament, including the law of Moses, the books of prophecies, and the psalms and poetry, reveal the Lord Jesus. The Law, the Prophets, and the Psalms are the three general sections that comprise the Old Testament (Luke 24:44). If we want to know the Lord Jesus, we must read and understand the Bible.</p>
<p><strong>2. &ldquo;Make you wise unto salvation&rdquo;</strong> (2 Tim. 3:15).</p>
<p>On the one hand, the Bible serves the Lord Jesus by testifying concerning Him, and on the other hand, it serves us by causing us to be saved and built up. The first function of the Bible in relation to us is to make us wise unto salvation. It reveals God&rsquo;s way of salvation in Christ and our pathway to salvation through faith so that we may know and understand God&rsquo;s salvation.</p>
<p><strong>3. &ldquo;Regenerated&rdquo;</strong> (1 Pet. 1:23; see also James 1:18).</p>
<p>The Bible causes us to be regenerated. The Bible is the word of the eternally living God, and it contains God&rsquo;s eternal life. When we receive the word of the Bible through faith, the word is planted like a seed of life in us. The Bible functions to sow the life of God into us, imparting God&rsquo;s life into us and regenerating us.</p>
<p><strong>4. &ldquo;For teaching, for conviction, for correction, for instruction in righteousness, that the man of God may be complete&rdquo;</strong> (2 Tim. 3:16-17).</p>
<p>After being regenerated by the word of God, the Bible teaches, convicts, corrects, and instructs us in righteousness so that we may be complete before God as regenerated men of God.</p>
<p><strong>5. &ldquo;For our instruction, in order that through endurance and through the encouragement of the Scriptures we might have hope&rdquo;</strong> (Rom. 15:4).</p>
<p>The teachings of the Bible enable us to endure and provide us with encouragement and hope. Many believers are unable to endure when they encounter difficulties or sickness. They become discouraged and lose hope. However, simply reading a section or even a sentence of the Bible often provides us with the inward strength to endure and supplies encouragement and hope that is beyond our expectations. When we encounter difficulties, we are helped and established by the Bible.</p>
<p><strong>6. &ldquo;An example...written for our admonition&rdquo;</strong> (1 Cor. 10:11).</p>
<p>Many things are recorded in the Bible as examples for our admonition. When we read the Bible, we can be warned by the experiences of some who went before us, and we can be careful not to follow their example. This is another help that believers find in the Bible.</p>
<p><strong>7. &ldquo;A lamp shining in a dark place&rdquo;</strong> (2 Pet. 1:19).</p>
<p>Often the Bible is like a lamp shining in a dark place. We are in a dark night because the age in which we live is dark (Rom. 13:12). In this darkness the Bible is like a shining lamp. It causes us to know our situation so that we do not become lost and confused. If we want to be enlightened and knowledgeable in this dark age, we must understand the Bible and keep the word of the Bible in our hearts so that it can shine and enlighten us.</p>
<p><strong>8. &ldquo;A lamp to my feet / And a light to my path&rdquo;</strong> (Psa. 119:105; see also Prov. 6:23).</p>
<p>People walking in the dark need a lamp to shine on the path of their feet. The Bible functions in this capacity. As we walk in this dark age, we truly need a heavenly lamp to shine on our every step so that we do not leave our path and fall into a deep pit. The Bible is a heavenly lamp. If we read the Bible and keep the word of the Bible in our heart, it will become a lamp to our feet and a light to our path. It will shine continually on our footsteps according to our need.</p>
<p><strong>9. &ldquo;Gives light, / Imparting understanding to the simple&rdquo;</strong> (Psa. 119:130).</p>
<p>The light from the Bible not only shines upon our feet and path; it also imparts understanding to the simple. Many who are simple by nature have gained understanding through reading the Bible. Furthermore, anyone who wants to understand spiritual matters must understand the Bible and be enlightened by the Bible.</p>
<p><strong>10. &ldquo;Keep his way pure&rdquo;</strong> (Psa. 119:9).</p>
<p>In addition to containing the power to enlighten, the word in the Bible has the power to cleanse. Enlightenment is in contrast to darkness, and purification is in contrast to filthiness. The age in which we live is filthy and dark. The word of the Bible causes all darkness to vanish when it shines on our feet. It cleanses our actions by removing everything that is filthy and impure. This is especially important to young people. If we read the Bible frequently, we will not only be enlightened but also kept pure. Every time we approach the Bible, its word will pass through us and enlighten and cleanse us. The word of the Bible will cleanse us, even if we cannot always remember what we have read. This is like a bamboo basket being dipped in water; it will be cleansed even though the water leaks away. If we want to be pure, we must read the Bible frequently.</p>
<p><strong>11. &ldquo;That I might not sin against You&rdquo;</strong> (Psa. 119:11).</p>
<p>The Bible also prevents us from sinning against God. We were born in sin, have grown up in sin, and easily sin against God. If we store the words of the Bible in our heart, they will constantly remind and warn us so that we do not sin against God.</p>
<p><strong>12. &ldquo;The sword of the Spirit&rdquo;</strong> (Eph. 6:17).</p>
<p>The word in the Bible is the sword of the Spirit. We can apply it by the Holy Spirit to deal with Satan and his messengers. Through the word of the Bible, we can defeat the devil, the enemy, who tempts and attacks us. When the Lord Jesus was in the wilderness, He defeated the tempter, the devil, through the word of the Old Testament. Therefore, in order to fight and defeat Satan and the evil spirits, we must read the Bible. We must be familiar with the Bible and be able to use it to deal with spiritual enemies at any time and in any place.</p>
<p><strong>13. &ldquo;Sharper than any two-edged sword&rdquo;</strong> (Heb. 4:12).</p>
<p>The word of the Bible is as sharp as a sword. It can deal with our spiritual enemies, but it can also divide our soul from our spirit and discern the thoughts and intentions of our heart. It divides what is of the soul and what is of the spirit. It also enables us to discern the thoughts and intentions that come from ourselves and those that come from God. The word exposes our entire inward condition before God. Nothing can be hidden in us, and everything is made manifest through the word.</p>
<p>For example, a brother who preaches the gospel and casts out demons according to his natural zeal can be touched when reading Matthew 7:21-22, which says, &ldquo;Not everyone who says to Me, Lord, Lord, will enter into the kingdom of the heavens, but he who does the will of My Father who is in the heavens. Many will say to Me in that day, Lord, Lord, was it not in Your name that we prophesied, and in Your name cast out demons, and in Your name did many works of power?&rdquo; As he is reading, the word will pierce him and cause him to see that his preaching of the gospel and his casting out of demons are according to soulish zeal, rather than God&rsquo;s revelation in his spirit. This exposes his zealousness as being from himself, according to the power of his soul, rather than from the will of God, according to the power of the Spirit. In this way, the word of the Bible enables him to discern that the source of his gospel preaching and casting out of demons is his soul rather than his spirit. Consequently, in the matters of preaching the gospel and casting out demons, the word separates his soul from his spirit, causing him to reject his soul in these matters and to rely on his spirit.</p>
<p>A sister who plans to marry an unbeliever may be touched when she reads 2 Corinthians 6:14, which says, &ldquo;Do not become dissimilarly yoked with unbelievers.&rdquo; This word can pierce her heart and cause her to see that her desire to marry an unbeliever is according to her own will, not God&rsquo;s will. Thus, the word enables her to discern that she is following her will and minding the preferences of her flesh rather than God&rsquo;s will and heart&rsquo;s desire in the matter of marriage. When the will in her soul is divided from God&rsquo;s will in her spirit, she will be saved from the desires of her flesh in this important matter. Rather than following her flesh and the desires of her heart, she will obey the peerless will of God. Then she will please God and be preserved by God.</p>
<p>The word of the Bible is always living and operative in our circumstances. It is sharper than any two-edged sword. There is no amount of mixture within us that cannot be divided and discerned by the word of the Bible. The word will always expose our real condition, bringing our situation into the shining of the light from His face. This will empower us to live in our spirit, forsaking our self and the thoughts of the self in order to live in God and in His will.</p>
<p><strong>14. &ldquo;I ate&rdquo;</strong> (Jer. 15:16; see also Matt. 4:4; Job 23:12; Heb. 5:14).</p>
<p>The Bible is food for our spiritual life. Just as our physical life needs nourishment, our spiritual life needs nourishment. The word is the only thing that can supply nourishment to our spiritual life. If we want to be strong and living before God, we cannot live on bread alone; we need the word that proceeds out of the mouth of God, which is the word of the Bible. We must eat the word of the Bible like food and even esteem the Bible more highly than food. We need to eat the word in order for our spiritual life to grow. We also must exercise to understand the more difficult portions in the Bible in order to be full-grown men, who are able to eat solid food. Without this eating and exercise, we will not become strong in our spiritual life.</p>
<p><strong>15. &ldquo;Milk of the word&rdquo;</strong> (1 Pet. 2:2; see also 1 Cor. 3:1-2; Heb. 5:12-14).</p>
<p>The Bible is not only solid food but also milk for our spiritual life. Solid food is for adults; milk is for infants. When our spiritual life is mature and we have an understanding of spiritual matters, we can extract the nourishment of solid food from the Bible, strengthening our spiritual life. When our spiritual life is immature and we lack an adequate understanding of spiritual matters, there are portions of the word of the Bible that are like milk, which can nourish us and cause our spiritual life to grow. Therefore, newly regenerated believers must love the word of the Bible and &ldquo;as newborn babes, long for the guileless milk of the word.&rdquo; If they do not, they will remain babes in Christ and their spiritual life will not grow.</p>
<p><strong>16. &ldquo;Washing&rdquo;; &ldquo;Clean&rdquo;</strong> (Eph. 5:26; John 15:3).</p>
<p>The word of the Bible washes our outward actions and removes our outward defilement. It also washes us inwardly and frees us from the weaknesses of the old creation. Ephesians 5:26 refers to this kind of washing. The Lord uses the water of life within us to wash us through the word of the Bible, eliminating the spots and wrinkles of the old creation. Spots and wrinkles are not related to the defilement that we acquire from our outward actions but to the weaknesses of the life of the old creation within us. The Lord uses the word in coordination with His life in us to wash away our spots and wrinkles. The Holy Spirit in coordination with the Lord&rsquo;s life in us frequently enlivens us with a word or sentence in the Bible in order to remove things of the old creation so that we can grow in the new creation. This washing is a function of the word of the Bible.</p>
<p>Ephesians 5 is not the only portion of the Bible that speaks of this function. John 15:3 says, &ldquo;You are already clean because of the word which I have spoken to you.&rdquo; This portion, which is related to being branches abiding in the Lord as the vine, shows that the Lord&rsquo;s word, the word of the Bible, cleanses us so that we can bear much fruit. This cleansing does not refer merely to an outward washing of the branches but to the removal of everything old so that the branches can be renewed. Therefore, this washing does not involve our outward actions but our inward life. Inwardly, we must be cleansed of everything related to the old creation in order to grow in the new creation. The word of the Bible manifests this washing power and function in us.</p>
<p><strong>17. &ldquo;Like fire...and like a hammer&rdquo;</strong> (Jer. 23:29; see also 5:14).</p>
<p>The word of the Bible is powerful; it is like a burning fire and a smashing hammer. The word of the Bible can burn hearts that are ice cold toward God and can completely burn away the things of man, which are contrary to God&rsquo;s holy nature. It can smash hearts that are hard toward God and subdue every thought that is against God. For thousands of years countless hearts which were cold toward God have been burned by the word of the Bible, and countless hearts which were hard toward God have been smashed by the word of the Bible. Throughout the ages many things which are contrary to God&rsquo;s holy nature have been burned by the word of the Bible, and many thoughts which were against God have been subdued by the word of the Bible. The word of the Bible truly has the power to deal with a person&rsquo;s cold and hard heart.</p>
<p><strong>18. &ldquo;Like the rain...like the dew...and like abundant showers&rdquo;</strong> (Deut. 32:2).</p>
<p>The word of the Bible is like rain, dew, and abundant showers. It waters and refreshes us. Rain is a general watering, dew is a gentle refreshing, and showers are a special watering. The word of the Bible manifests these functions, especially in relation to us as God&rsquo;s farm (1 Cor. 3:9), the harvest that God cultivates (Mark 4:20; 1 Cor. 3:6). The word of the Bible is like rain, dew, and showers. It waters and refreshes us so that we can grow and bear fruit.</p>
<p><strong>19. &ldquo;As the rain...and the snow...so will My word be&rdquo;</strong> (Isa. 55:10-11).</p>
<p>The word of the Bible is not only like rain, but it also refreshes like snow. Rain comes in the spring, summer, and fall, but snow comes in the winter. The refreshing of rain is quick and brief, but the refreshing of snow is slow and lasting. These comparisons remind us that the word of the Bible can refresh us in every season of our condition. Sometimes we need a quick, short refreshing, like rain. At other times we need a slower, longer refreshing, like snow. Whether the refreshing is like rain or snow, the word causes us to grow and bear fruit, and it will accomplish God&rsquo;s delight upon us (v. 11).</p>
<p><strong>20. &ldquo;A mirror&rdquo;</strong> (James 1:23).</p>
<p>The word of the Bible is like a mirror; it reflects our true appearance and condition. By reading the Bible, we see our real countenance and know our true condition. It is difficult to find a person who has not seen himself when he comes to the word in the Bible.</p>
<p><strong>21. &ldquo;Restoring the soul... / Making the simple wise... / Making the heart joyous... / Enlightening the eyes&rdquo;</strong> (Psa. 19:7-8).</p>
<p>The Bible functions in a sweet way to restore and refresh our soul, to make us wise, to make our heart joyous, and to enlighten our eyes. The word manifests these functions when we read the Bible. Our soul may be depressed, but a word in the Bible will restore and refresh us. We may be simple, that is, foolish, but a word from the Bible will make us wise. We may be troubled in our heart, but a word in the Bible will make us joyous; and we may be blind, but a word from the Bible will enlighten our eyes.</p>
<p><strong>22. &ldquo;Are spirit and are life&rdquo;</strong> (John 6:63).</p>
<p>The Lord&rsquo;s words, the word of the Bible, are spirit and life. God is Spirit; He is the source of life. The word of the Bible comes out of God, so it comes out of the Spirit and out of life. Since the source of the word is Spirit and life, it is spirit and life. The word of the Bible enables us to have Spirit and life; it causes us to receive life from the Spirit and to live according to the Spirit.</p>
<p><strong>23. &ldquo;My words...are life to those who find them, / And healing to all their flesh&rdquo;</strong> (Prov. 4:20-22; see also 16:24).</p>
<p>The word of the Bible can spiritually nourish us and also heal our flesh. Because the word of the Bible can restore our soul and make our heart joyous, it can heal our body. Our soul is refreshed, our heart is made joyous, and our body is healed because of the word of the Bible. There is a saying, &ldquo;When the heart is happy, the body grows fat.&rdquo; Since the word of the Bible makes our heart happy, it can also make our bodies healthy.</p>
<p><strong>24. &ldquo;Counselors&rdquo;</strong> (Psa. 119:24).</p>
<p>This verse says that the word of the Bible is our counselor. This is true. Often the word of the Bible is far better than the ideas or suggestions of any counselor, strategist, or consultant. We should consider all things with the Bible, the best counselor, and consult it in order to give the Lord an opportunity to give us His counsel and thoughts.</p>
<p><strong>25. &ldquo;Likened to...the rock&rdquo;</strong> (Matt. 7:24-25).</p>
<p>The word of the Bible is like a rock. It is reliable and firm. If our life and work are based on the Bible, they will be like a solid and reliable house built on a rock. The word of the Bible is the solid foundation of our life and work. This is another function of the Bible.</p><h2 class="head1">THE PURITY, PERFECTION, SWEETNESS,<br />
PRECIOUSNESS, POWER, AND SURETY OF THE BIBLE</h2>
<p><strong>1. &ldquo;Pure words, / Silver... / Purified seven times&rdquo;</strong> (Psa. 12:6; see also 18:30; 119:140; Prov. 30:5).</p>
<p>There are sixty-six books in the Bible, yet every sentence is pure like silver that has been purified seven times. The word of the Bible is refined and pure; there are no unnecessary words.</p>
<p><strong>2. &ldquo;Perfect...faithful...right...clear...pure...truth&rdquo;</strong> (Psa. 19:7-9).</p>
<p>Every person who has earnestly read the Bible confesses that no other book in the world is as perfect and faithful as the Bible. No other book in the world is as right, pure, and true as the Bible. Whether it is speaking concerning God or man, the origin of the heavens and earth or the end of all things, the meaning of human life or the way of man, the things in this life or in the coming age, the Bible clearly explains every matter related to man. It is perfect and faithful. Furthermore, the word of the Bible is not twisted. Its nature is not filthy, and its teachings are not false. The Bible is right, clear, and truthful.</p>
<p><strong>3. &ldquo;More to be desired are they than gold... / Sweeter also than honey&rdquo;; &ldquo;How sweet&rdquo;</strong> (Psa. 19:10; 119:103).</p>
<p>Those who have truly tasted the word of the Bible know its preciousness and sweetness. The Bible is more to be desired than gold and sweeter than honey from the honeycomb. If we do not have a sense that the Bible is precious and desirable, sweet and lovely, and if the word of the Bible is not more precious than gold in our heart and sweeter than honey in our mouth, we have not tasted the Bible. If we do not have an appreciation of the value of the Bible, I hope that we will ask God for the grace to know the preciousness and sweetness of His Word, the Bible.</p>
<p><strong>4. &ldquo;Better to me / Than thousands of pieces of gold and silver&rdquo;</strong> (Psa.119:72, see also v. 127).</p>
<p>Many people throughout history have confessed and testified that the value of the Bible is greater than thousands of pieces of gold and silver. Many have valued the Bible even more than their lives, including those who were martyred during the time of the Reformation because they realized the priceless value of the Bible, the word of God.</p>
<p><strong>5. &ldquo;My heritage forever&rdquo;</strong> (Psa. 119:111).</p>
<p>All the spiritual blessings that we receive in the Lord today are heavenly; they cannot be seen with our physical eyes. However, we can see these blessings in the Bible. Everything on this earth will pass away; nothing of ours will remain. However, the Bible, our only true heritage, will last forever. Those who truly know God treasure the Bible and regard it as a priceless, eternal heritage.</p>
<p><strong>6. &ldquo;No word will be impossible&rdquo;</strong> (Luke 1:37).</p>
<p>No word in the Bible is impossible. This is a characteristic of the Bible. Worldly books do not emphasize power and do not have power. The Bible, however, emphasizes power and truly has power. One sentence of the Bible can cause a person deep in sin to repent and be saved. One sentence of the Bible often changes a person completely. If anyone genuinely touches the word of the Bible, he touches the power in the Bible because the Bible is the Word of God. The Word of God is as powerful as God. God accomplished His creation and rules everything through His word (Heb. 11:3; 1:3). The word of God is the power of God. Since the Bible is the word of God, it has the power of God and even is the power of God. This power is limitless.</p>
<p><strong>7. &ldquo;One iota or one serif shall by no means pass away&rdquo;</strong> (Matt. 5:18; see also 24:35).</p>
<p>The word of the Bible is not only powerful but also sure. Heaven and earth will pass away, but not one iota or serif of the Word of God will pass away. Hebrews 1:11-12 speaks of God remaining forever, even after the heavens and earth have passed away. This shows that the word of the Bible is as sure as God Himself; it is surer than the heavens and the earth. The word of the Bible cannot pass away, and no one can destroy it. Oh, the Bible is so sure and reliable!</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN<br />
THE BELIEVERS AND THE BIBLE</h2>
<p><strong>1. &ldquo;I love Your law!... / it is my musing&rdquo;</strong> (Psa. 119:97, see also v. 20; 1:2).</p>
<p>We should love the Bible like the psalmists who desired it until their heart was crushed with longing. We should muse on the word of the Bible like the psalmists, who thought about it all day long. They mused upon the word day and night. If we want to know and understand the Bible, we must love the word and muse upon it.</p>
<p><strong>2. &ldquo;I have treasured the words of His mouth more than my apportioned food&rdquo;</strong> (Job 23:12; see also Psa. 119:6, 117).</p>
<p>We should treasure and regard the word of the Bible more than our apportioned food. Some brothers and sisters say that they are too busy to read the Bible. But no matter how busy we are, we still have time to eat three meals every day. If we treasured the Bible more than food, we would not say that we do not have time to read the Bible. If we have time to eat, we have time to read the Bible. We even should have more time to read the Bible because the Bible is more important to us than food. Someone once said, &ldquo;No breakfast before reading the Bible.&rdquo; We should not eat if we have not read the Bible. We should treasure the Bible more than food.</p>
<p><strong>3. &ldquo;Incline my heart&rdquo;</strong> (Psa. 119:36, see also v. 112).</p>
<p>We must incline our hearts toward the Bible. If we only use our eyes to read the Bible, but our heart is not inclined to it in our reading, it will be difficult to understand the Bible. Many brothers and sisters read the Bible without an inclined heart; rather, their hearts are inclined toward their schoolbooks, toward the activities of their day, toward their business or finances, or toward their housework and family. Therefore, we should pray that the Lord would empty our heart so that it would be inclined toward His word in the Bible.</p>
<p><strong>4. &ldquo;Learn&rdquo;</strong> (Psa. 119:73, 71).</p>
<p>Merely inclining our hearts toward the Bible is not enough; we must also learn. If we only incline, we cannot understand; we must learn in order to comprehend. Learning requires diligence. We should not merely have &ldquo;book learning&rdquo;; we also need to learn from events and from our living. We should not use our thoughts merely; we must use events and our living. Sometimes we must also suffer before we can learn a portion of the Bible. Therefore, the psalmist says, &ldquo;It is good for me that I have been afflicted, / That I might learn Your statutes [the Word of God]&rdquo; (v. 71). If we want to learn to know the Bible, we also need understanding, or the ability to understand. This is something that only God who created us can give. Thus, we must ask Him to give us understanding so that we would have the adequate ability to comprehend in order to learn to know His mysterious Word, this marvelous Bible.</p>
<p><strong>5. &ldquo;From a babe you have known the sacred writings&rdquo;</strong> (2 Tim. 3:15).</p>
<p>We need the Bible for our whole life. Therefore, we should know the Bible from a babe. The earlier we know the Bible, the better. From the time we are a babe, we should receive enlightenment, teaching, and salvation from the Bible. Furthermore, the teachings and truths of the Bible are numerous, deep, and mysterious. We need an entire lifetime to learn to know them. Children and young people especially need to spend time learning to know the Bible when their intellect and memory are adequate and strong. Many passages in the Bible should be memorized, and many truths should be learned and remembered. In contrast to most elderly people, this is something that can easily be done by children and young people. If we want to understand the Bible, we must begin to learn from the time we are a babe.</p>
<p><strong>6. &ldquo;Seek from the book of Jehovah and read&rdquo;</strong> (Isa. 34:16; see also John 5:39; Acts 17:11).</p>
<p>There are many teachings in the Bible that are deep and mysterious. We need to seek them out and read them. To seek is to search and prove the teachings and truths in the Bible. To read is to read the Bible out loud, touching the flavor of the teachings and truths in the Bible. Seeking emphasizes quiet consideration; reading emphasizes a vocal tasting. We should seek and read the Bible. We should quietly seek and prove, and then we should audibly read to taste.</p>
<p><strong>7. &ldquo;Reads...hear...keep&rdquo;</strong> (Rev. 1:3; see also Acts 8:28, 32).</p>
<p>We must read, hear, and keep the word of the Bible. To read is to read by ourselves. To hear is to listen to others read or speak. Whether we read the word by ourselves or hear it indirectly from others, we need to keep it. If we do not keep the word, the Bible will not benefit us.</p>
<p><strong>8. &ldquo;Then He opened their mind to understand the Scriptures&rdquo;</strong> (Luke 24:45).</p>
<p>We need a mind that has been opened in order to be able to understand the truths contained in the Bible. The truths in the Bible are mysterious and deep. Our natural intellect cannot understand them. The Lord must open our heart so that we can understand. Thus, we should ask the Lord to open our mind and give us an understanding that transcends our natural intellect in order to understand the Bible.</p>
<p><strong>9. &ldquo;Believed&rdquo;</strong> (John 2:22; 5:46).</p>
<p>We must believe the Bible. To believe is to confess and receive in our heart after our mind has understood. If we only understand the word of the Bible in our mind, it will be of no benefit to us. We must believe in our heart and use our believing to receive the word into our heart in order for the word to benefit us. Then it will give us the supply and help of life.</p>
<p><strong>10. &ldquo;Hear&rdquo;</strong> (Luke 16:29, 31).</p>
<p>We must hear and follow the Bible. We must understand and comprehend the Bible, believe and receive the Bible, and hear and obey the Bible. We should hear and obey all that the Bible says, no matter what or how it is said. In order to do this, we must reject our self, eliminate our prejudices, and submit to the Lord. Only those who submit to the Lord can hear and obey the word of the Bible. May the Lord have mercy on us and give us a submissive heart!</p>
<p><strong>11. &ldquo;Trust&rdquo;</strong> (Psa. 119:42).</p>
<p>We must trust in the word of the Bible. If we believe, receive, hear, and obey the word of the Bible, we also should trust in it. To trust in the Bible means that we commit ourselves to the Bible, which we have believed and heard. Many bear burdens, experience difficulties, overcome temptations, and deal with problems by trusting in the word of the Bible. They rely on the word of the Bible their entire life. The word of the Bible is able to bear our responsibilities. It has the capacity to lead us throughout our entire life. May we trust in the word of the Bible!</p>
<p><strong>12. &ldquo;Hope&rdquo;</strong> (Psa. 119:114, see also v. 147).</p>
<p>If we want to gain the words of the Bible, we must not only seek, prove, and study but also hope. Seeking, proving, and studying are related to the mind, and they require time and energy to search the Word of God. Hoping is related to the heart, and it involves waiting for God to give us His word. This requires that we live before God and fellowship with Him.</p>
<p><strong>13. &ldquo;Ate&rdquo;</strong> (Jer. 15:16).</p>
<p>Once we gain the word of the Bible, we should eat it, receive it into us, so that we can digest it inwardly in order to supply our spiritual life. This refers to our using our spirit to receive the word of the Bible into our spirit instead of using our mind to receive the word into our mind.</p>
<p><strong>14. &ldquo;In my heart I have treasured up Your word&rdquo;</strong> (Psa. 119:11, see also v. 98).</p>
<p>We should treasure up the word of the Bible in our hearts so that we can apply it at any time or place. Our hearts should store up the word of the Bible to prepare us for unexpected needs. We should diligently store up the word of the Bible in our hearts instead of looking for an applicable word in the Bible only when we encounter problems or difficulties. Going to the Bible at such times is only a second-rate solution. The best solution is to treasure up the word of the Bible in our hearts so that when we encounter a specific need, we will be able to apply the word immediately. The Bible should be not only in our hands but in our hearts. When we have the word of the Bible in our hearts, we can apply it to any situation, even if we do not have the Bible in our hands. This is proper.</p>
<p><strong>15. &ldquo;Dwell in you richly in all wisdom&rdquo;</strong> (Col. 3:16).</p>
<p>We should not only treasure up the word of the Bible in our hearts but also let it dwell in us richly. To do this, we need all wisdom and all ways to store the word of the Bible in our hearts richly. Our hearts should be rich storehouses of the Bible. Regrettably, many believers are too poor in this matter. Their hearts are storehouses of worldly knowledge and many things, but they have not stored up the word of God. Therefore, they are spiritually poor and have difficulty knowing the will of God when they encounter problems. In order for them to have a turn in spiritual matters, they must learn to let the word of the Bible dwell in them richly.</p>
<p><strong>16. &ldquo;I will take delight... / I will not forget Your word&rdquo;</strong> (Psa. 119:16).</p>
<p>We must take delight in the word of the Bible and not forget it. We must use the word of the Bible to make ourselves happy, and we should remember the word of the Bible forever. The word of the Bible can make us happy, but we must be in it and touch its sweetness in order to be happy. If we take delight in the word of the Bible, we will always remember and never forget it.</p>
<p><strong>17. &ldquo;Not forsaken&rdquo;</strong> (Psa. 119:87, see also vv. 102, 157).</p>
<p>We should never forsake the word of the Bible. We should not forsake the Bible no matter what problems we encounter, even persecution or death. It would be even worse if we forsook the Bible because of evil temptations. We should always bear responsibility for not forsaking the word of the Bible.</p>
<p><strong>18. &ldquo;Trembles at&rdquo;</strong> (Isa. 66:2; see also Ezra 9:4).</p>
<p>We should tremble at the word of the Bible. Our hearts should not be so hard that we would have no feeling when we touch the Bible. We should humble our hearts and repent. When we touch the word of the Bible, we should be in fear and trembling. This requires us to humble ourselves before God.</p>
<p><strong>19. &ldquo;Keep&rdquo;</strong> (Psa. 119:9; Luke 11:28; see also James 1:25).</p>
<p>We must keep the word of the Bible in order to obtain blessing and benefit. The blessing that we obtain from keeping the word of the Bible is truly great! It is even greater than the blessing that Mary obtained in bearing the Lord Jesus. Therefore, we should respond to the word in the Bible by keeping it.</p>
<p><strong>20. &ldquo;Speak&rdquo;</strong> (Psa. 119:46).</p>
<p>We should not only keep the word of the Bible ourselves but also speak it to others. Keeping the word benefits ourselves; speaking the word graces others. Regardless of whom we stand before, we should speak the word of the Bible to them. Even if they are kings or people in a high position, we should speak and not be ashamed.</p>
<p><strong>21. &ldquo;Declared&rdquo;</strong> (Psa. 119:13).</p>
<p>We should declare the word of the Bible as well as speak it. To speak is to preach on a small scale. To declare is to proclaim on a large scale. Both speaking and declaring tell others about the word of the Bible, and we should bear responsibility for both.</p>
<p><strong>22. &ldquo;Sing&rdquo;</strong> (Psa. 119:172, see also v. 54).</p>
<p>We should sing the word of the Bible. This means to take the word of the Bible as the content of our hymns or to write hymns that use the words of the Bible. This is very sweet and beneficial. This kind of singing refreshes and supplies our spirits. May we practice this.</p>
<p><strong>23. &ldquo;Explained&rdquo;</strong> (Luke 24:27, see also v. 32; Acts 18:24, 26).</p>
<p>We should also explain the Bible. To explain and to speak are almost the same thing. Both explaining and speaking clearly tell people about the word of the Bible so that the truths and teachings of the Bible can be understood.</p>
<p><strong>24. &ldquo;Cutting straight the word of the truth&rdquo;</strong> (2 Tim. 2:15).</p>
<p>We must not explain the truth of the Bible in a loose way. We must cut straight the word of the truth. The different truths in the Bible have boundaries. Although they are connected and interrelated, they cannot be confused and combined. We must cut straight these truths according to their boundaries, differentiating them clearly. We must not twist or explain them improperly. For example, the law in the Old Testament was given by God to the children of Israel. If New Testament believers, who are under grace, are taught to keep the law of the Old Testament, the boundary of the age has been crossed. Those who teach this do not cut straight the truth in the Bible that the age of the law and the age of grace are separate, even though they are related. Without a clear separation, the truth is confused and twisted, and the word of the truth is not cut straight. The Catholic Church brought many Old Testament rituals into the New Testament, and the Seventh-day Adventists brought the Sabbath into the New Testament. Both practices are not according to the boundaries of the truth. They twist and confuse the truth. We must never do this. We must cut straight the word of the truth according to the boundaries of the truth. We must clearly differentiate which truths are of the Old Testament and which are of the New Testament. We must discern which words were spoken to the children of Israel under the law, which were spoken to the believers under grace, and which were spoken to the Gentiles. We must know the word that refers to salvation, to reward, to the grace we have received, and to our responsibilities. We must cut straight these truths in the Bible according to their boundaries in order to know the Bible properly and to avoid error.</p>
<p><strong>25. Not &ldquo;twist&rdquo;</strong> (2 Pet. 3:16).</p>
<p>We must not twist the truths in the Bible. Twisting usually occurs in relation to portions that are hard to understand. When we come to a difficult portion in the Bible, we should not twist; we should not force ourselves to explain if we do not understand. We should wait until we understand; then spontaneously, we will be able to explain in a clear way. To twist is to explain in an unnatural way or to force an explanation. We should not force ourselves to explain any portion of the Bible or try to explain it in an unnatural way. Twisting will harm others and cause us to suffer loss. Those who twist the Scriptures do so to their own destruction.</p>
<p><strong>26. &ldquo;Nor adulterating&rdquo;</strong> (2 Cor. 4:2).</p>
<p>We should not adulterate the word of the Bible. To adulterate the word is not merely to explain it foolishly, wrongly, incorrectly, or improperly but to explain the word untruthfully or falsely in order to cheat people. We should never do this. If we explain any portion of the Bible, we should explain it accurately and truthfully. To explain the word of the Bible accurately and truthfully, we must not take a portion out of context. We must look at what comes before and after. We must consider the whole book. Sometimes we must consider what the entire Bible says in order to understand one verse or one portion. A brother once said that we need the whole Bible to explain one verse. This statement really is true. May we never forget it.</p>
<p><strong>27. &ldquo;Not add...nor...take away&rdquo;</strong> (Deut. 4:2; 12:32; see also Prov. 30:6; Rev. 22:18-19).</p>
<p>We do not have the authority to add to or to take away from the word of the Bible because of its completeness and divine authority. Whatever the Bible says, it says. Whatever it does not say, it does not say. We should never add to or take away from it. We must confess that the Bible is absolutely authoritative. We must not make up stories that are according to our own will. Our only standard should be the word of the Bible, the word of God. Neither adding nor taking away is related to receiving blessing, whereas adding and taking away are related to receiving cursing. We must be fearful before the word of the Bible.</p><h2 class="head1">HOW TO READ THE BIBLE</h2>
<h2 class="head2">Reading Daily</h2>
<p><strong>1. &ldquo;Examining the Scriptures daily&rdquo;</strong> (Acts 17:11).</p>
<p>Many can testify that the best way to read the Bible is to read it daily. Since the Bible is closely related to our living and actions, we need it in every area of our life. Therefore, we should read the Bible daily. Since the Bible is food for our spiritual life, we must receive spiritual nourishment from it daily. We need physical nourishment every day, and we similarly need spiritual nourishment every day. Just as we need to eat physical food every day, we need to read the Bible every day. We are healthy when we eat food every day, and we are healthy when we read the Bible every day. We should not eat food one day and then fast for three days. Likewise, we should not read the Bible in fits and starts. Just as our food should be apportioned to us throughout the day, our Bible reading should be apportioned in a measured and daily way. We should not receive too much or too little, reading too much one day and very little the next.</p>
<p>Furthermore, eating at specific times is the most healthy way to eat. Similarly, we should set aside specific times to read the Bible every day. Just as it is best for our body to eat a specific amount of food at specific times every day, it is best for our spirit to read a specific amount of the Bible at specific times every day. May we practice this by the Lord&rsquo;s grace.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Rising in the Morning</h2>
<p><strong>1. &ldquo;I anticipated the dawn... / I hoped in Your words. / My eyes anticipated the night watches, / That I might muse&rdquo;</strong> (Psa. 119:147-148; see also Exo. 16:21; Isa. 50:4).</p>
<p>The morning is the best time to read the Bible. Many who read the Bible acknowledge this. It is best to read the Bible in the morning when our heart has just awakened, our spirit is clean and quiet, and there is no noise, people, or events to disturb or worry us. If we read the Bible at a time other than the morning, it will be difficult to avoid disturbing noises and the interruptions of people or events and to read the Bible in peace. This makes it difficult to gain much benefit from reading the Bible. The children of Israel gathered the manna that they needed in the wilderness every day in the morning; if they waited until the sun came up, the manna melted away. Indeed, in order to gather the manna that we need for our spirit from the Bible, we must get up early every morning. If we are too late, it will melt away during the affairs of the day. Therefore, the psalmists anticipated the morning in order to hope in God&rsquo;s word. They anticipated the night watches to muse on God&rsquo;s word. The prophet Isaiah also listened to the Lord&rsquo;s word before God every morning. Should we not also get up early every morning to read the Bible, hope in God&rsquo;s word, muse on God&rsquo;s word, and listen to and receive God&rsquo;s word? If we are lazy and love our beds in the morning, we will not be able to gather the manna that we need for the day from the Bible. We will miss a great blessing for the day. No one who loves his bed in the morning can love the Bible. No one who is lazy in the morning can read the Bible. If we do not hate our bed and get up early in the morning, we will not be able to gather the manna of God&rsquo;s word from the Bible in the morning. Therefore, we must awaken early in the morning. Once we are awake, we must get up and get out of our bed; we should not linger in our bed. We must have the heart to do this and ask God to give us the grace.</p>
<p>Reading the Bible in the morning not only benefits us spiritually, but it is also very useful in dealing with the things that we encounter every day. If we come to the Lord&rsquo;s Word and read the Bible in the morning, it will supply us to meet our needs throughout the day. If we do not come to the Word, we will lack the power to deal with things or to overcome the temptations of the day. Therefore, we must read the Bible in the morning. We must seek and gain the Lord&rsquo;s word in the morning. Alas, many brothers and sisters do not do this. That truly is a pitiful situation. They do not know how much they have lost. May the Lord have mercy.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Asking the Lord to Open Our Mind</h2>
<p><strong>1. &ldquo;Open my eyes that I may behold / Wondrous things&rdquo;</strong> (Psa. 119:18; see also Luke 24:45).</p>
<p>We should not depend merely on our own intellect to read the Bible. We must ask the Lord to open our mind so that we might understand the truth in the Word and behold wondrous things. If we want to understand and know the Bible, we need an opened mind and opened eyes. Only the Lord can open our mind and eyes; therefore, we must ask the Lord.</p><h2 class="head2">Seeking the Enlightenment of the Holy Spirit</h2>
<p><strong>1. &ldquo;Revealed them through the Spirit, for the Spirit searches all things, even the depths of God&rdquo;</strong> (1 Cor. 2:10).</p>
<p>Even though the Bible has been revealed through the Holy Spirit, there are yet many deep and mysterious things of God in the Bible that only the Spirit can search out and reveal to us. The depths of the Bible are out of God, of God, and concerning God. No one knows the things of God except the Spirit of God. Therefore, if we want to read the Bible and understand it, we must seek the Spirit&rsquo;s enlightenment. Our natural intellect is unable to understand the Bible. We must be enlightened by the Holy Spirit. We need the Holy Spirit&rsquo;s revelation so that we can understand the Bible. Therefore, when we read the Bible, we should not depend on our intelligence but seek the enlightenment and revelation of the Holy Spirit.</p>
<p>Furthermore, if we want to understand the Bible, we need to do more than seek the enlightenment of the Holy Spirit; we also need to live in the Holy Spirit and become a spiritual person. The word of the Bible is a spiritual word, and the Bible speaks of spiritual matters. Only those who are spiritual can understand spiritual words and matters. Certain kinds of people understand certain kinds of words and matters. It takes a spiritual person to understand spiritual words, and it takes a spiritual person to understand spiritual matters. Only the spiritual can understand the spiritual. Since the Bible is spiritual, we must be spiritual in order to understand the words that it contains. The degree of our understanding of the Bible is based on the degree of our spirituality. Therefore, if we want to understand the Bible, we must be spiritual, learn to live in the Spirit, and become a spiritual person.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Turning Our Heart to the Lord</h2>
<p><strong>1. &ldquo;Whenever their heart turns to the Lord, the veil is taken away&rdquo;</strong> (2 Cor. 3:16).</p>
<p>We must not only be spiritual to read the Bible, but we must turn our heart to the Lord. Whether we understand the Bible and receive light when we read it depends on our spiritual condition and our heart. There will be a problem if our spirit is not right, and there will be a problem if our heart is not right. If we want to understand the Bible when we read it, our heart must turn to the Lord. If our heart is not turned to the Lord, it will be difficult for us to understand the Bible and see its light; there will be a veil on our heart that prevents us from seeing the light in the Bible. Once our heart turns to the Lord, however, the veil is taken away. Then we will see the Lord in the light of His Word, and we will understand and know the Bible. If we want to know the Bible, we must turn our heart to the Lord; that is, we must turn away from every person, thing, and matter outside of the Lord and return to the Lord.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Resolving to Do His Will</h2>
<p><strong>1. &ldquo;If anyone resolves to do His will, he will know concerning the teaching&rdquo;</strong> (John 7:17).</p>
<p>When we read the Bible, we must resolve to do His will in order to understand the Word. The Lord does not reveal His teachings to those who have no heart to keep them. He makes them known to those who have a heart to keep them and who resolve to keep them. Therefore, we must be a person of such resolve in order to understand the words in the Bible.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Searching and Studying</h2>
<p><strong>1. &ldquo;Search&rdquo;; &ldquo;Study diligently&rdquo;</strong> (John 5:39; a note in the Chinese Union Version on Daniel 12:4 indicates that <em>here and there</em> can be translated as &ldquo;search or study carefully&rdquo;).</p>
<p>The Bible is a book that must be searched and studied. This requires time and effort, so we need to pay the price. Anyone who is not willing to pay the price to spend the time and make the effort to diligently search and study the Bible will not be able to understand much of the Bible, especially its depths. If we read the Bible in a light way, we will not understand much. We must make an effort to search and diligently study the Bible in order to truly understand.</p>
<p>The Bible is too rich and mysterious. It really is worthy of searching and study. Even though many have spent much time to study the Bible throughout the ages, there are still many portions that need to be studied. Many who have Ph.D.s, who have spent an entire lifetime carefully studying the Bible, feel as if they are trying to measure the ocean with a dipper. Some very particular and special methods have been used to study the Bible throughout the ages. For example, the author of Young&rsquo;s Concordance counted every Hebrew and Greek word in the Old and New Testaments. Moreover, he counted how many times each word was used in the original language (either Hebrew or Greek), recorded their meaning, and then detailed how these words were translated into English in the King James Version, including how many times each translated word was used and the location of each translated word. Then he compiled these words into an alphabetical concordance so that they could be located easily. It is difficult to say how much time and effort was put into this matter. Others calculated the numbers represented by every letter of every word in the Old Testament Hebrew and the New Testament Greek. (In Hebrew and Greek, each letter stands for a number.) They counted the letters one by one and totaled their numerical value; they discovered that in both the Old and New Testaments, the numeric total of all the letters of all the words is divisible by seven. This means that the numeric total of every word in every verse in every chapter in every book of the Bible is divisible by seven. This is a truly marvelous kind of study, and it took much time and effort. Others have also spent much time and effort. May we be willing to take the time to study the Bible. May there be some among us who are willing to rise up and apply special effort to study this marvelous book.</p><h2 class="head2">Meditating and Considering</h2>
<p><strong>1. &ldquo;Meditates by day and by night&rdquo;; &ldquo;Muse upon&rdquo;; &ldquo;Consider&rdquo;</strong> (Psa. 1:2; 119:15, 95; see also Matt. 9:13).</p>
<p>When we read the Bible, we need to meditate and consider. Sometimes we need to muse upon the Word. This requires carefulness and time. It also requires quiet concentration. Many times we need to meditate, consider carefully, or concentrate quietly in order to understand the Bible and touch its essence.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Believing</h2>
<p><strong>1. &ldquo;Slow of heart to believe&rdquo;</strong> (Luke 24:25; see also John 2:22).</p>
<p>We must believe when we read the Bible. Sometimes we understand, and then we believe and receive. Sometimes we believe and receive, and then we understand. In any case, we must always believe. Whoever does not read the Bible in faith, whoever is slow of heart to believe, cannot understand the Bible in a clear way. Even if we could understand some portion, we would not receive much benefit. We must mix faith with the word of the Bible in order to understand the Bible and receive the benefit (Heb. 4:2).</p>
<h2 class="head2">Adding Prayer</h2>
<p><strong>1. &ldquo;Cried out...hoped&rdquo;</strong> (Psa. 119:147).</p>
<p>Reading the Bible also requires cooperation through prayer. Reading the Bible and prayer cannot be separated. Therefore, the early psalmists called on the Lord on the one hand and hoped in the Lord&rsquo;s word on the other. Before we read the Bible, we should pray and ask the Lord to cleanse us, to open the eyes of our heart, to prepare our spirit, and to open His Word and shine His light upon it to reveal His truth in it by the Spirit. As we read, we should turn the inspiration that we receive into prayer, praying for ourselves and for others. After we finish reading, we need to continue to pray, asking the Lord to preserve what we have understood so that we might keep it in faith and love and to give us strength and grace so that we might practice what we have seen. Thus, reading the Bible should begin with prayer, be accompanied by prayer, and end with prayer. Reading the Bible must be accompanied by prayer.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Praying and Reading</h2>
<p><strong>1. &ldquo;Receive...the word of God, by means of all prayer and petition&rdquo;</strong> (Eph. 6:17-18).</p>
<p>Our reading of the Bible should not only be with prayer but should be mingled with prayer. Any portion or sentence of the Bible can become our prayer. This is not simply to read the word of the Bible; this is to pray the word of the Bible. We should not use our mind to understand the Word but our spirit to taste and chew a portion of the Word so that it becomes our supply. Paul refers to receiving the word of God by means of all prayer and petition in Ephesians 6:17-18. This kind of praying and reading, that is, pray-reading, enables us to not only understand the true spiritual meaning of the Bible&mdash;the will of God&mdash;but also to enjoy the reality of the content of the Bible&mdash;God Himself. This is the most beneficial way to read the Bible for our spiritual growth.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Letting the Word Dwell in Us</h2>
<p><strong>1. &ldquo;Let the word of Christ dwell in you richly in all wisdom&rdquo;</strong> (Col. 3:16; see also Psa. 119:98).</p>
<p>We should let the word dwell in us when we read the Bible. If we read it and forget it, it will be difficult for us to thoroughly understand the Word. If we let the important points, the important chapters and verses, and the important truths of the Bible dwell in us, the Holy Spirit can enable us to understand the meaning of the Bible. Moreover, He can reveal the truths of the Bible to us at any time and in any place. Therefore, we must let the word of the Bible dwell in us richly in all wisdom and by all means. Remembering the Bible and memorizing the Bible are necessary to reading the Bible and a way to read the Bible. We should practice this, especially the young brothers and sisters. We should memorize one book of the Bible or choose a few golden verses from our daily reading to remember and memorize. Regardless of how well we remember or memorize the Word, this is always beneficial.</p>
<h2 class="head1">PRACTICAL WAYS TO READ THE BIBLE</h2>
<p>Reading the Bible also involves some practical points.</p>
<p><strong>1. We should have two copies of the Bible.</strong> One copy should be used to record inspiration and to underline important points; the other copy should not contain any of our writing. It should remain clean. When we read, we should read from the clean copy and record inspiration or underline a portion in the writing copy.</p>
<p>2. We should read two lines at the same time. One line should be the New Testament, which can be called the line of life because our emphasis should be on the nourishment of life. It is best to read one chapter of the New Testament every morning for twenty to thirty minutes, choosing one or two verses to pray-read. The other line should be the Old Testament, which can be called the line of knowledge because our emphasis should be on knowing the Bible. We can read from this line every day during the daytime or in the evening for thirty or forty minutes. We should read about three chapters of the Old Testament a day. In this way we can read from both the Old and New Testaments every day, and in one year we will read through the whole Bible. When we read from either the Old or New Testament, it is best to read from the first book to the last, chapter by chapter. It is best if we read it according to the number of chapters and sections laid out in the book <em>Once a Year through the Bible</em> published by the Gospel Book Room (see <em>The Collected Works of Watchman Nee,</em> vol. 2, pp. 191-234).</p>
<p><strong>3. We should pay attention to and remember the main points of every chapter.</strong> We should receive inspiration and turn this inspiration into prayer as soon as we sense it. We should remember and memorize the important phrases in the Bible. For example, when we read Matthew 1, we should see that the first section is on the genealogy of Christ, and the second section is on the birth of Christ. We should remember these two points. Then we may have a feeling about verse 21: &ldquo;You shall call His name Jesus, for it is He who will save His people from their sins.&rdquo; We can immediately turn this inspiration into prayer, asking the Lord to save us from our sins, according to the meaning of His name. We also can ask the Lord to save a brother or sister from their sin, according to the meaning of His name. Finally, if we have a sense of the preciousness of the Lord&rsquo;s names in verses 21 and 23, we should memorize these two verses.</p>
<p><strong>4. We should not seek deep explanations.</strong> We can be easily distracted when we read the Bible if we are seeking deep explanations. We should try to understand what we read, but we do not need to seek deep explanations. Such explanations distract and hinder us from understanding. We should guard against this. We need a certain level of spiritual life to understand the Bible because our understanding is proportional to our level of spiritual life. Given the present stage of our spiritual life, some parts of the Bible will not be understandable. However, as our spiritual life grows, we will spontaneously understand more of the Bible. Thus, when we read the Bible, we will have some understanding, but we should not feel the necessity to understand everything that we read at any given moment. We should not seek explanations that are beyond our spiritual comprehension. Instead, we should realize that we may understand a portion the next time we read the Bible.</p><h2 class="head1">A FEW POINTS OF EXPLANATION<br />
TO HELP IN READING THE BIBLE</h2>
<p>A few points of explanation will help the brothers and sisters in their reading of the Bible.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Sections of the Bible</h2>
<p>The Bible is divided into two major sections: the Old Testament and the New Testament. Each of these is further divided into several sections.</p>
<h2 class="head3">The Old Testament<br />
Containing Three Sections</h2>
<h2 class="head4">The Section of History&mdash;from Genesis to Esther&mdash;Containing Seventeen Books</h2>
<p>The five books from Genesis to Deuteronomy are considered as the books of the Law, or the books of Moses (Luke 16:29, 31; John 5:45-46; Rom. 10:4-5). They are commonly referred to as the Pentateuch. The twelve books from Joshua to Esther are called the books of history.</p>
<h2 class="head4">The Section of Experience&mdash;from Job to Song of Songs&mdash;<br />
Containing Five Books</h2>
<p>Some call these five books and Lamentations books of poetry because they are written in poetic form.</p>
<h2 class="head4">The Section of Prophecy&mdash;from Isaiah to Malachi&mdash;Containing Seventeen Books</h2>
<p>These books collectively are called the Prophets. The longer books are referred to as the major prophets, and the shorter books are referred to as the minor prophets.</p>
<p>In Luke 24:44 the Old Testament is divided into three sections: (1) the Law of Moses, the Pentateuch; (2) the Prophets, including the books of history; and (3) the Psalms, including the books of poetry. The Jews and their rabbis divided the Old Testament according to Luke 24:44: the Law of Moses, the Prophets, and the Psalms.</p>
<h2 class="head3">The New Testament Containing Three Sections</h2>
<h2 class="head4">The Section of History&mdash;from the Gospel of Matthew to the Acts of the Apostles&mdash;Containing Five Books</h2>
<p>The first four books are called the four Gospels. The fifth book is called Acts.</p>
<h2 class="head4">The Section of Experience&mdash;from Romans to Jude&mdash;Containing Twenty-one Books</h2>
<p>These twenty-one books are called the Epistles.</p>
<h2 class="head4">The Section of Prophecy&mdash;Revelation&mdash;<br />
Containing One Book</h2>
<p>In both the Old Testament and the New Testament, the first section is history, the second section is experience, and the third section is prophecy. This is very meaningful.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Types in the Bible</h2>
<p>In the Old Testament God used types as pictures to depict the truths that would be revealed in the New Testament. This is similar to a kindergarten teacher using pictures to teach children. There are many categories of types, including people, things, events, and ceremonies.</p>
<h2 class="head3">Adam Being an Example of a Person as a Type</h2>
<p>Christ, as the Head of the new creation, is typified by Adam (Rom. 5:14).</p>
<h2 class="head3">The Veil in the Temple Being<br />
an Example of a Thing as a Type</h2>
<p>The veil of the temple, which separated the Holy Place from the Holy of Holies so that man could not approach God in the Holy of Holies, is a type of the physical body of Christ. After the veil was rent, however, man could come before God. When the Lord Jesus&rsquo; body was rent on the cross, a new and living way was opened for sinners to approach God (Heb. 10:20). His death on the cross enables us to come to God directly.</p>
<h2 class="head3">The Children of Israel Leaving Egypt<br />
Being an Example of an Event as a Type</h2>
<p>Before God&rsquo;s salvation was manifested, God typified His salvation through the event of the children of Israel leaving Egypt (1 Cor. 10:1-11).</p>
<h2 class="head3">The Passover Being an Example<br />
of a Ceremony as a Type</h2>
<p>The Passover in the Old Testament is a type, a living picture, of Christ&rsquo;s death. God used this ceremony to point to the death of Christ in the New Testament (5:7).</p>
<h2 class="head2">Prophecies in the Bible</h2>
<p>The prophecies in the Bible are fulfilled literally. The greatest prophecies in the Bible concern the two comings of Christ. The prophecies concerning the first coming of Christ have been fulfilled literally. For example, the prophecy concerning a virgin was actually fulfilled by a virgin (Isa. 7:14; Matt. 1:18-21); the prophecy concerning the Lord riding on a foal of a donkey was actually fulfilled with a foal of a donkey (Zech. 9:9; Matt. 21:2-5). The prophecies concerning the second coming of Christ and other unfulfilled prophecies will certainly be fulfilled literally. Therefore, our explanation of prophecy must be absolutely literal.</p>
<p>Furthermore, no prophecy of Scripture is of one&rsquo;s own interpretation (2 Pet. 1:20). This means that no prophecy can be interpreted in isolation from other Scripture; we must see how it relates to other prophecies on the same subject.</p><h2 class="head2">The Spiritual Significance<br />
of History in the Bible</h2>
<p>The history in the Bible contains spiritual meaning. For example, the history of Sarah and Hagar speaks of the difference between the old and new covenants (Gen. 21:1-14; Gal. 4:22-31), and the story of Mephibosheth describes God&rsquo;s salvation (2 Sam. 9:1-13).</p>
<h2 class="head2">Dispensations in the Bible</h2>
<p>We must distinguish among the different dispensations in the Bible. If we do not, many parts will seem contradictory and be difficult to explain. The period of time from the creation of Adam to the end of the millennial kingdom can be divided into seven dispensations. The position and condition of man and the responsibility borne by man in each dispensation are different. In each dispensation, however, man failed, and each dispensation ends in judgment.</p>
<p><strong>1. The dispensation of innocence</strong>&mdash;from the creation of Adam to his being driven out of the garden of Eden, at most 130 years (cf. Gen. 5:3).</p>
<p>This period is called the dispensation of innocence because man was without sin at the time of Adam&rsquo;s creation. Man lived before God and was ruled by God; God ruled man directly.</p>
<p><strong>2. The dispensation of conscience</strong>&mdash;from the fall of Adam to the flood. The dispensations of innocence and conscience span approximately 1,656 years.</p>
<p>This period is called the dispensation of conscience because man fell from God to his conscience and was ruled by his conscience. God ruled man indirectly through his conscience.</p>
<p><strong>3. The dispensation of human government</strong>&mdash;from Noah&rsquo;s leaving the ark to the dispersion at the tower of Babel, 427 years.</p>
<p>This period is called the dispensation of human government because during this time man fell further from his own conscience to being ruled by other men. He was under man&rsquo;s rule. God thus ruled man even more indirectly through other men. At this time God gave man authority to rule men (9:6). Man&rsquo;s authority over man began in this dispensation (Rom. 13:1). By this time man had fallen to the furthest extent. He fell from God to his conscience and then from his conscience to being ruled by other men. Thus, man fell from God&rsquo;s government to self government and from self government to human government. After man fell to this extent, he could fall no further. At this point, man truly needed God to come in and save him.</p>
<p><strong>4. The dispensation of promise</strong>&mdash;from Abraham&rsquo;s calling to the giving of the law on Mount Sinai, 430 years.</p>
<p>After man could fall no further, God came in and called Abram (Abraham), promising him that He would bless man through his seed&mdash;Christ (Gal. 3:16). This meant that He would deal with man by grace through Christ. God repeated this promise to the patriarchs. Therefore, this period is called the dispensation of promise.</p>
<p><strong>5. The dispensation of law</strong>&mdash;from the giving of the law on Mount Sinai to the ministry of John the Baptist, about 1,500 years (Luke 16:16).</p>
<p>Although God promised to deal with man by grace through Christ, man did not know himself. Instead, he thought that he could do good and be justified by God by virtue of his own actions. Therefore, God temporarily put aside His promise of grace and used the law to show man his sin and impotence. Through the law, man was shown that he could not do good nor be justified in himself so that he would seek God&rsquo;s grace. This period is called the dispensation of law because God dealt with man through the law at this time.</p>
<p><strong>6. The dispensation of grace</strong>&mdash;from the ministry of John the Baptist to Christ&rsquo;s second coming (Mark 1:1-5).</p>
<p>God used the law only to deal with man temporarily. His original promise of grace was not annulled by the law (Gal. 3:17). He placed man under law (for approximately 1,500 years) to completely manifest man&rsquo;s sin and impotence so that he would know himself and his sin in order to bow before God&rsquo;s judgment (Rom. 3:19-20). Then God sent the Lord Jesus to fulfill His promise of grace, enabling Him to deal with man through grace and enabling man to live under His grace. The law continued to the time of John the Baptist (Luke 16:16), but from that time until the second coming of Christ, God has dealt with man and will deal with man through grace. Therefore, this period is called the dispensation of grace.</p>
<p><strong>7. The dispensation of the kingdom</strong>&mdash;from Christ&rsquo;s coming to reign as King to the casting of Satan into the lake of fire, 1,000 years (Rev. 20:10).</p>
<p>When Christ comes back, the dispensation of grace will be over. His kingdom will be on earth, and He will reign for one thousand years. This period of one thousand years is the time of the authority of His kingdom, so it is called the dispensation of the kingdom.</p>
<p>Many Bible scholars use these seven periods. However, the Bible divides the time from the creation of Adam until the end of the millennial kingdom into only four dispensations:</p>
<p><strong>1. The dispensation of the fathers</strong>&mdash;from Adam to Moses, before the giving of the law (Rom. 5:13-14), 2,513 years.</p>
<p><strong>2. The dispensation of the law<strong>&mdash;from Moses to the first coming of Christ (John 1:17), about 1,500 years.</p>
<p><strong>3. The dispensation of grace</strong>&mdash;from the first coming of Christ to His second coming.</p>
<p><strong>4. The dispensation of the kingdom</strong>&mdash;from the second coming of Christ to the casting of Satan into the lake of fire, 1,000 years.</p><h2 class="head2">People in the Bible</h2>
<p>We also must discern the different people in the Bible. We cannot apply the word that was spoken to the Jews to the Gentiles or to the church. We also cannot apply words spoken to the Gentiles or to the church to the Jews. In the Bible there are three kinds of people: Jews, Greeks, or Gentiles, and the church (1 Cor. 10:32). Genesis 1:1 through 11:9 (from the creation of Adam to the calling of Abraham) speaks of all humanity. Genesis 11:10 to Malachi 4:6 speaks of the Jews. During this time the church was a hidden mystery (Eph. 3:9-10, 4-5); consequently, only Gentiles are mentioned in addition to the Jews. The four Gospels are a transition from the Jews to the church. Even though the Jews are referenced in the four Gospels, the teachings in the four Gospels mainly concern the believers in the church because the church would shortly be manifested (Matt. 16:18; 18:17). The church is especially emphasized from Acts 1:1 to the end of Revelation 3. During this time the Jewish nation is temporarily set aside, even though God pays attention to Jews and Gentiles as individuals. Jews, Gentiles, and the church are considered together from Revelation 4:1 to the end of chapter 19.</p>
<h2 class="head1">OUTLINE OF THE SEVEN DISPENSATIONS</h2>

<h1 class="title">PRAYER</h1>
<p>Prayer, like reading the Bible, is a practice that Christians should not lack. In a Christian&rsquo;s spiritual life reading the Bible is like eating, and praying is like breathing. A person can go for several days without eating, but he cannot live even a few minutes without breathing. If a Christian does not pray, his spiritual life will be deadened, and he will not be living and strong. Breathing is necessary for the human body. If a person wants an active body, his breathing must be healthy. In the same way, prayer is a necessity for a Christian&rsquo;s spiritual life. If a Christian wants to be fresh in spirit and strong in life, he must pray.</p>
<p>The life within every Christian is a praying life, and every life has a capacity and a desire to function in certain ways. The life within us has a praying capacity which enables us to pray and which also causes us to desire to pray. This inward capacity requires us to pray and causes us to have a desire to pray. If we respond to this praying capacity and pray often, this capacity will be developed, and its desire will be satisfied. Then the life within us will be strengthened to grow, and it will not be grieved. If we do not obey this life, it will be impossible for it to grow. Therefore, we must pray and practice praying.</p>
<p>Let us carefully look into different aspects of prayer according to the record of the Bible.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE IMPORTANCE OF PRAYER</h2>
<p><strong>1. &ldquo;Watch and pray that you may not enter into temptation&rdquo;</strong> (Matt. 26:41).</p>
<p>The Lord Jesus&rsquo; command in this verse shows the importance of prayer. Prayer keeps us from temptation. While we live in the world today, the devil tempts us with many things. He has the opportunity to tempt us in matters related to food and clothing, occupations, money, marriage, and many other matters. He is constantly looking for an opportunity to tempt us. If we want to avoid his temptation, we must pray. We must pray constantly concerning every matter. Whatever we do, we must pray. Whether our actions involve making friends, getting married, spending money, working, or dealing with friends and relatives, we must pray and diligently seek the Lord&rsquo;s will. We must ask God what we can do and what we cannot do. We should also ask how we should do something and to what extent we should do something. We must have this kind of prayer in everything. We must pray even when we write a letter. We should ask God whether or not we should write and what we should write. If we watch and pray in every matter, we will be preserved by the leading of God and will not enter into the temptation of the devil.</p>
<p>When a ship sails on the ocean and encounters fog, it sounds a foghorn. On the one hand, this sends out a warning, but on the other hand, it receives an echo which directs its course. Today we are sailing in the vast ocean of this world. Sometimes we come across a patch of fog that makes it difficult for us to know the direction that we should take. At these times we should pray, as if we are sounding a foghorn, so that we can avoid danger and know how to move forward. If we do not, we will become lost in the fog, leave the proper course, and fall into error and danger.</p>
<p><strong>2. &ldquo;Put on the whole armor of God that you may be able to stand against the stratagems of the devil...by means of all prayer and petition&rdquo;</strong> (Eph. 6:11, 18).</p>
<p>The devil, our enemy, always attacks us. We need to stand against him. We must put on the whole armor of God and have much prayer and petition to stand against him. We must rely on the armor of God to stand against the enemy through prayer and petition. Prayer and petition are the way to utilize the armor of God and to cause the armor of God to have an effect upon us. In order to withstand the enemy, we must put on the armor of God by means of all prayer and petition.</p>
<p>The devil is the enemy of God. However, God does not deal with the devil by Himself; He wants us to deal with him. He wants us to pray and ask Him to deal with the devil. God deals with the devil according to the prayers that we pray. God deals with the enemy to the extent of our prayer. If we do not pray, God will not and cannot deal with the devil. Therefore, the devil fears our prayer and hates our prayer to the uttermost. Brothers and sisters, the devil is afraid of our prayer! Our prayer causes the devil to tremble because our prayer can bind him and cast him out. When he sees us bend our knees to pray, he trembles in fear. He dislikes, even hates, our prayer to the uttermost. Therefore, he uses every means to block our prayer and to disturb us while we pray. Many times he takes away our interest in prayer and even depresses our heart of prayer. He makes us unable to pray and causes us to have no desire to pray. He knows that once we pray, he will be dealt with and suffer loss. We should see through his stratagems and stand against our indifference, our depressed spirit, and any outward distractions in order to pray and petition so that he would be bound and suffer loss.</p>
<p>The work that God wants us to do on the earth today, whether it is preaching the gospel, saving sinners, building the church, or building up the saints, involves casting out the devil. In order to be effective, these must be carried out with much prayer and petition. We must pray to deal with and cast out the devil so that we can carry out these works for God. Spiritual work requires spiritual warfare. Spiritual warfare must be fought through prayer in order to be victorious. Prayer is necessary for spiritual warfare; it is also necessary for spiritual work.</p>
<p><strong>3. &ldquo;Everyone who asks receives&rdquo;; &ldquo;You do not have because you do not ask&rdquo;</strong> (Matt. 7:8; James 4:2).</p>
<p>These verses speak of a principle: He who asks receives, and he who does not ask does not receive. This shows the importance of prayer. Prayer is necessary for us to receive God&rsquo;s grace and blessing. If we want something from God, we must ask God; we must pray.</p>
<p><strong>4. &ldquo;In everything, by prayer and petition with thanksgiving, let your requests be made known to God&rdquo;</strong> (Phil. 4:6).</p>
<p>In both large and small matters, we should let our requests be made known to God by prayer and petition. This implies that we must pray and petition concerning everything and for everything. We should fellowship with God, touch God, and seek His will concerning everything. We should touch God and His will in everything. Therefore, prayer is necessary in everything.</p>
<p><strong>5. &ldquo;Come forward with boldness to the throne of grace that we may receive mercy and find grace for timely help&rdquo;</strong> (Heb. 4:16).</p>
<p>As children of God living on earth today, we need God&rsquo;s mercy and grace for timely help. We must come to the throne of grace frequently through prayer to obtain this grace and mercy. Timely help is help that arrives when it is needed. If we want to receive timely help from God, we must come to the throne of grace and contact God frequently. We can receive God&rsquo;s mercy and grace for timely help by frequently touching His throne and contacting Him in our spirit. Praying at all times is important for receiving grace and mercy.</p>
<p>6. &ldquo;Praying, and I saw in a trance a vision&rdquo;</strong> (Acts 11:5).</p>
<p>As we pray, we see visions. When Peter was praying in the city of Joppa, he saw a vision and knew that God wanted him to go and preach the gospel to the Gentiles. Today we often see spiritual visions and receive revelation while praying. It is difficult for people who do not pray much to see visions and receive revelations. Visions and revelations are of God. Therefore, if we continually contact God, it will be easy to receive visions and revelations. Prayer has a special function in the matter of receiving visions and revelations.</p>
<p><strong>7. &ldquo;Call unto Me, and I will answer you and tell you great and hidden things&rdquo;</strong> (Jer. 33:3).</p>
<p>When we call unto the Lord&mdash;when we pray&mdash;we not only receive an answer, but He also tells us great and hidden things. We can be directed by the Lord concerning a great and difficult matter, one that is not easy to understand, if there is sufficient prayer. When we have problems, we must pray to receive the Lord&rsquo;s direction. When we pray, the Lord will direct us.</p>
<p><strong>8. &ldquo;Be watchful at every time, beseeching that you would prevail to escape all these things which are about to happen and stand before the Son of Man&rdquo;</strong> (Luke 21:36).</p>
<p>Prevailing to escape the things which are about to happen and to stand before the Son of Man refers to escaping the coming tribulation and being raptured to the Lord. According to the Lord&rsquo;s word, great tribulation will come upon the people of the whole earth at the end of the age. If we are watchful and beseeching at every time, we will be positioned to escape the coming tribulation on the earth and be raptured to be with the Lord. Watching and praying are very much related to our future; therefore, we should realize the importance of prayer and pay attention to it.</p>
<p><strong>9. &ldquo;Beware, be alert; for you do not know when the time is&rdquo;</strong> (Mark 13:33).</p>
<p>Praying is important in our watching and waiting for the Lord to return. In the Bible the Lord clearly tells us that He will return, and He solemnly commands us to watch and wait for His coming. No one knows the day and the hour, so we must be watchful to wait for His coming. Prayer causes us to be watchful. Only a praying person can be watchful and wait for the Lord. If we want to be watchful and wait for the Lord, we should not be short of prayer.</p>
<p><strong>10. &ldquo;The end of all things has drawn near. Therefore be sober-minded and be sober unto prayers&rdquo;</strong> (1 Pet. 4:7).</p>
<p>This verse tells us that the end of all things is near, so we must be sober unto prayers. The world and the things of the world that people rely on will pass away. They will all come to an end. Since the end of all things is near, we must be sober unto prayers in order not to be entangled and bewitched by the world and the things of the world that are passing away. Without prayer, we will not be able to come to the Lord, hope in the Lord, or wait for the Lord. Brothers and sisters, the end of all things is even closer; therefore, we should be more sober unto prayers. We must realize that as the end of the world and the things in the world draw nearer, they will entangle and bewitch people even more. Do we not see the influence of the world and the things in the world upon people today? People in the world are entangled and bewitched as never before. We can overcome this condition only by being sober unto prayers. Being sober unto prayers is especially important given the entangling and bewitching influence of the world and the things in the world.</p>
<p><strong>11. &ldquo;Continue steadfastly in prayer and in the ministry of the word&rdquo;</strong> (Acts 6:4).</p>
<p>The ministry of the word requires accompanying prayer. Prayer comes first and then the ministry of the word. Without this order, the ministry of the word cannot be powerful. If we have not prayed, we cannot truly minister the word. If we minister the word without prayer, it will have no power or authority. If we want the ministry of the word to be with authority, we must pray. Prayer is especially important to the ministry of the word.</p>
<p><strong>12. &ldquo;Beseech the Lord of the harvest that He would thrust out workers into His harvest&rdquo;</strong> (Matt. 9:38).</p>
<p>If we want God to thrust out workers into His harvest to save sinners, we need to pray and beseech God. If we pray concerning this matter, God will thrust out workers to harvest souls through preaching the gospel. If we do not pray, God will have no way to do what He desires. There must be some who pray to open the way for God to carry out His work.</p>
<p><strong>13. &ldquo;I will be inquired of by the house of Israel to do it for them; I will increase them&rdquo;</strong> (Ezek. 36:37; see also Jer. 29:10-14).</p>
<p>Ezekiel 36 not only speaks of God&rsquo;s determination to increase the number of the house of Israel but also of the house of Israel&rsquo;s need to inquire of Him in order for Him to accomplish His desire. Jeremiah 29 speaks of God&rsquo;s determination that the captivity of Israel would last for seventy years and of how He would care for them and cause them to return to their own land. However, they had to pray in order for Him to accomplish this. These two passages of the Word reveal a principle: Even when God determines to do something for man, man still must pray before God will act. Whatever God does among man and for man comes out of His determination, but it must pass through man&rsquo;s prayer. God&rsquo;s determination alone is not enough; man&rsquo;s prayer must be added. Therefore, when God determines to do something, His determination is anointed through the Holy Spirit into those who love Him and draw near to Him. Then His determination becomes a burden in them that can be turned into prayer. When His determination becomes man&rsquo;s prayer, He hears and accomplishes it. If it does not become prayer, He cannot act.</p>
<p>For example, if God determines to save a particular person, but cannot find someone to pray for him, His desire to save will be frustrated. But if someone comes to God and contacts Him, His Spirit will anoint God&rsquo;s will into him and cause him to have a feeling and a burden to pray for this person&rsquo;s salvation. When he prays, God will listen and save the person whom He has determined to save and who has been cared for through prayer. This is a great principle of how God works for man. When God works for man, He works according to His heart&rsquo;s desire and determination. He causes His heart&rsquo;s desire to become the feeling and burden of those who are close to Him. He causes them to pray for the matter that He has determined in His heart, and then He hears their prayer and accomplishes the matter. This shows the importance of prayer. If God is going to do anything for man today, there must be some who are praying. God&rsquo;s determination must be matched by man&rsquo;s prayer before it can be accomplished.</p>
<p><strong>14. &ldquo;I sought a man...who would build up the wall and stand in the breach before Me&rdquo;</strong> (Ezek. 22:30).</p>
<p>God sought a man among the Israelites who would stand in the breach before Him for the children of Israel. It is the same in the church. Those who are standing in the breach before Him for His people are those who are praying for His people. Only those who pray before Him can stand in the breach among His people. Many times a breach between the brothers and sisters, such as a problem in the church, requires prayer in order for the breach to be filled. Prayer fills the breaches in the church and solves the problems in the church.</p>
<p><strong>15. &ldquo;Concerning My sons, / And concerning the work of My hands, command Me&rdquo;</strong> (Isa. 45:11).</p>
<p>This verse speaks of commanding God concerning His sons and His work. Commanding God is the highest kind of prayer. This kind of prayer is the highest right that we enjoy before God. God needs us to exercise this right and pray, commanding Him for His work on His children. When God wants to work on His children, He needs people to command Him to do what He desires according to His heart&rsquo;s desire and determination. Prayer that commands God concerning His work can and should be practiced by those who know Him and His heart&rsquo;s desire. Often this kind of prayer is necessary for God&rsquo;s work.</p><h2 class="head1">HOW TO PRAY</h2>
<p>Concerning any matter, we need to pray. Now let us consider how to pray.</p>
<p><strong>1. &ldquo;Lord, teach us to pray&rdquo;</strong> (Luke 11:1).</p>
<p>We must ask the Lord to teach us to pray because none of us can pray. When we come to the Lord, we should not pray according to our own determination or idea or according to our own heart or tendency. We should place ourselves before the Lord and quietly wait for the Lord through His Spirit to teach us how to pray. While we wait, the Spirit will lead us and give us an inward sense about how we should pray and the content of our prayer. We should then pray according to this inward sense. When our inward sense is according to the Spirit&rsquo;s leading, our prayer will be according to the Lord&rsquo;s teaching and leading.</p>
<p><strong>2. &ldquo;In My name&rdquo;</strong> (John 14:13-14; 15:16; 16:23-24, 26).</p>
<p>We must pray in the Lord&rsquo;s name when we pray. This does not mean saying &ldquo;In Jesus&rsquo; name&rdquo; at the end of our prayer. We may say this at the end of our prayers, but to pray in the Lord&rsquo;s name is not a matter of saying a phrase. It is a matter of being one with the Lord. Only a person who is one with the Lord is in the Lord&rsquo;s name. Therefore, praying in the Lord&rsquo;s name means that in the matter of prayer, we are one with the Lord; the Lord&rsquo;s affairs are our affairs, and our affairs are the Lord&rsquo;s affairs. This is similar to my writing a check, signing my name, and then asking someone to go to the bank to withdraw the money. Thus, my business becomes his business, and his business is my business. In this matter he is one with me, so he can withdraw money from the bank in my name. When he goes to the bank to withdraw money, he is withdrawing money in my name. In order to withdraw my money, he cannot be in his own name; he must be in my name. He must do it in my name. At that time the bank regards him as if he were me. He is in my name because he and I are one. Similarly, when we pray in the Lord&rsquo;s name, we are one with the Lord in prayer. We must be one with the Lord in the matter of prayer and allow the Lord&rsquo;s affairs to become our affairs and our affairs to become the Lord&rsquo;s affairs. Since this kind of prayer matches the Lord&rsquo;s will, the Lord willingly answers and accomplishes it.</p>
<p><strong>3. &ldquo;Abide in Me&rdquo;</strong> (John 15:7).</p>
<p>If we want to pray effectively, we must abide in the Lord. This is related to praying in the Lord&rsquo;s name. These two matters are part of the Lord&rsquo;s teaching in John 14 through 16. Praying in the Lord&rsquo;s name is a result of abiding in the Lord. If we want to pray in the Lord&rsquo;s name, we must abide in the Lord. In John 14 through 16 the Lord speaks of abiding in Him, and He also speaks of praying in His name. Abiding in the Lord is based on being one with the Lord and fellowshipping with the Lord. It is the practical experience of being one with the Lord. When we abide in the Lord, fellowship with Him, and are one with Him practically in our experience, we spontaneously pray in His name. The prayer that comes out of the Lord spontaneously through our abiding in Him matches His heart&rsquo;s desire; therefore, He will answer and accomplish what we ask. We must eliminate the separation between us and the Lord and fellowship with Him constantly in order to be up to the standard of the Lord and His heart&rsquo;s desire.</p>
<p><strong>4. &ldquo;Praying in the Holy Spirit&rdquo;; &ldquo;Praying at every time in spirit&rdquo;; &ldquo;The Spirit Himself intercedes for us with groanings which cannot be uttered&rdquo;</strong> (Jude 20; Eph. 6:18; Rom. 8:26, see also v. 27).</p>
<p>To pray is to contact God and touch His heart&rsquo;s desire. Only the Spirit of God knows the things of God (1 Cor. 2:11). Therefore, prayer must be in the Holy Spirit and in our spirit. The Holy Spirit dwells in our spirit and is mingled as one with our spirit. When we pray in our spirit, we also pray in the Holy Spirit. When we pray with our spirit, we pray by the Holy Spirit. Praying in spirit and with our spirit means to pray according to the feeling of our deepest part, not according to our thoughts, opinions, or determinations. Praying according to our thoughts, opinions, and determinations is to pray with our mind. We pray with our spirit only when we pray according to the feeling of our deepest inward part, because the feeling in our deepest inward part is of our spirit and from our spirit. If we pray according to the feeling of our deepest inward part, we will also pray in the Holy Spirit and by the Holy Spirit. This kind of prayer easily contacts God, touches His heart&rsquo;s desire, prays forth His will, and receives His answer and accomplishment.</p>
<p>Often the Holy Spirit gives us a burden, but our mind cannot understand the meaning of the burden. It cannot translate the burden into words that can be prayed. At such times the Holy Spirit intercedes for us with groanings that cannot be uttered. Thus, the groanings in our deepest inward part often are a kind of spiritual prayer. Sometimes we have a heavy burden within, but we cannot utter anything in prayer to God; we can only groan. After groaning within, the heavy burden is gone. This kind of groaning comes from the Holy Spirit&rsquo;s abiding in us. The Holy Spirit&rsquo;s groaning is according to the will of God, so God listens to this kind of groaning prayer. We must not lightly value, interrupt, or suppress this groaning. We should go according to our inward feeling and allow the Spirit to groan within us. Thus, we will pray freely in the Holy Spirit, out of the Holy Spirit, and through the Holy Spirit.</p>
<p><strong>5. &ldquo;According to His will&rdquo;</strong> (1 John 5:14; see also Matt. 26:39).</p>
<p>Prayer that is truly spiritual asks God to accomplish His will. Therefore, we must not pray according to our own will but according to God&rsquo;s will. The Lord prayed in this way in the Garden of Gethsemane. Our prayer should also be according to His will. In order to pray in this way, we must abide in the Lord and pray in and by the Holy Spirit.</p>
<p><strong>6. &ldquo;Ask in faith&rdquo;; &ldquo;Believe that you have received them&rdquo;</strong> (James 1:6; Mark 11:24).</p>
<p>Prayer asks for things not yet seen; therefore, it must be in faith. We should not only pray in faith but also pray until we have faith, until we believe. We should not only believe that we <em>will</em> receive an answer but even more that we <em>have</em> received an answer. When we pray to the point of believing, to the point of having faith, we will give thanks and no longer ask. Continuing to ask causes our faith to depart and to ask in vain.</p>
<p><strong>7. &ldquo;Enter into your private room, and shut your door and pray&rdquo;</strong> (Matt. 6:6).</p>
<p>The Lord&rsquo;s word in this verse indicates that we should not make a show of our prayer before others. We should come before God in a hidden place. Showing off our prayer before others is hypocritical and false; it is prayer for people to see and hear. Hidden prayer before God is honest and true; it is prayer for God to hear and see. Therefore, according to this principle, we should not pray as a show before others; we should pray honestly before God.</p>
<p>The Lord&rsquo;s word here may also indicate that when we pray, we should not allow anything to distract and disrupt our prayer. Even if our circumstances do not allow us to be in a hidden place, we should not allow outside things to affect our concentration in prayer. This is why we close our eyes when we pray.</p>
<p><strong>8. &ldquo;Prayer...to God&rdquo;</strong> (Acts 12:5).</p>
<p>To pray is to ask of God; therefore, our prayer should be to God. No matter what person or thing we pray for, our heart should not be directed toward the persons or matters of our prayer. Our attention should not be on them but on God.</p>
<p><strong>9. &ldquo;Do not be rash with your mouth, and let not your heart hastily utter&rdquo;</strong> (Eccl. 5:2; see also John 12:27-28).</p>
<p>We should not hastily utter anything in prayer or pray anything loosely. We must quietly wait and open our mouth to speak according to the feeling that God gives us in our spirit and in our inward understanding of His will. When we pray, we should be accurate in how we address God and in our words. In Matthew 15 a Canaanite woman begged the Lord, calling Him Son of David, but the Lord did not answer her. The Lord as the Son of David was for the chosen race of Israel and was not related to a Gentile Canaanite woman. Finally, she prayed based on the word <em>dog,</em> which came from the Lord&rsquo;s mouth, and stood in the position of a Gentile dog (v. 27). She called Him &ldquo;Lord&rdquo; and &ldquo;Master,&rdquo; and the Lord answered her immediately. The titles and words that we use in prayer are one of the secrets of prayer, and they can cause our prayer to be answered. This is similar to being careful about how we address and speak to a person in our dealings with him. We must pay attention to this matter.</p>
<p><strong>10. &ldquo;Pouring out my soul&rdquo;</strong> (1 Sam. 1:15; see also Lam. 2:19).</p>
<p>Prayer must come from our heart. We must pour out our soul. We cannot pray shallow words. Only honest prayer that is not perfunctory can be heard by God.</p>
<p><strong>11. &ldquo;Persistence&rdquo;; &ldquo;Earnestly&rdquo;</strong> (Luke 11:8; 22:44).</p>
<p>Prayer must be out of an honest heart and must be persistent. If prayer does not move you, it will not move God.</p>
<p><strong>12. &ldquo;With strong crying and tears&rdquo;</strong> (Heb. 5:7).</p>
<p>Sometimes when we pray, a burden can press us to the point of strong crying and tears. If we have never prayed with tears, there is a shortage in our experience of prayer.</p>
<p><strong>13. &ldquo;Do not babble empty words&rdquo;</strong> (Matt. 6:7).</p>
<p>The words of our prayer should be brief and to the point. Although we can repeat our words as the Lord did in the Garden of Gethsemane, we should not babble empty words.</p>
<p><strong>14. &ldquo;Entreated the Lord three times&rdquo;</strong> (2 Cor. 12:8; see also Matt. 26:44).</p>
<p>In order to break through in a matter, we often need to thoroughly and clearly pray several times. Both the Lord Jesus and Paul prayed in this way.</p>
<p><strong>15. &ldquo;Ask...seek...knock&rdquo;</strong> (Luke 11:9).</p>
<p>Sometimes asking in prayer is not enough; we must seek. Sometimes seeking in prayer is not enough; we must knock. We should ask for the Lord&rsquo;s blessing, seek the Lord Himself, and knock to enter into the presence of the Lord. In prayer we should initially ask for the Lord&rsquo;s blessing, then gradually seek the Lord Himself, and finally, knock to enter into the Lord&rsquo;s presence. Prayer should always move from the Lord&rsquo;s blessing to touching the Lord Himself and then to entering into His presence.</p>
<p><strong>16. &ldquo;Fasted&rdquo;</strong> (Acts 13:3; see also 14:23).</p>
<p>When we encounter a desperate situation, we should fast and pray. The principle of fasting is that we are willing to endure physical suffering before God and give up our rightful enjoyment in order to pray for a particular matter. Sometimes we need to pray this way.</p>
<p><strong>17. &ldquo;Always to pray and not lose heart&rdquo;</strong> (Luke 18:1).</p>
<p>Our prayer needs to be constant; we should not pray intermittently. Furthermore, we need to hold out to the end in our prayer and not lose heart.</p>
<p><strong>18. &ldquo;Pray in every place, lifting up holy hands&rdquo;</strong> (1 Tim. 2:8).</p>
<p>We should pray in every place, and we can pray in every place. This requires a holy living. We must have a holy living to have holy hands that can be lifted up in every place. Lifting up our hands is a gesture of sincerity to God. In our prayer we should be able to lift up holy hands to God in every place, praying sincerely.</p>
<p><strong>19. &ldquo;By means of all prayer and petition, praying at every time in spirit and watching unto this in all perseverance&rdquo;</strong> (Eph. 6:18).</p>
<p>Prayer also needs to be at every time, by means of all prayer and petition, and with watching in all perseverance. We should not pray for just a moment or pray in only one way. We should pray at every time by means of all prayer. Furthermore, we should watch in all perseverance in order to pray at every time by means of all prayer.</p>
<p><strong>20. &ldquo;Unceasingly pray&rdquo;</strong> (1 Thes. 5:17).</p>
<p>Prayer is as essential for our spiritual life as breathing is for our physical body. It cannot cease. Our spirit of prayer can pray spontaneously at any time in any place. In any situation we can spontaneously pray. Unceasing prayer is like the spontaneous blinking of our eyes.</p>
<p><strong>21. &ldquo;Anticipated the dawn and cried out&rdquo;</strong> (Psa. 119:147; see also Mark 1:35).</p>
<p>The morning is a quiet time, and our soul is alert, so it is the best time for prayer. Therefore, we should anticipate the dawn to get up and pray.</p>
<p><strong>22. &ldquo;Three times daily he knelt on his knees and prayed and gave thanks before his God&rdquo;</strong> (Dan. 6:10; see also Psa. 55:17).</p>
<p>Daniel prayed three times daily on his knees before God. David prayed to God in the morning, at noon, and in the evening. We should pray at least three times a day to God. Furthermore, if it is convenient, we should kneel before God, praying respectfully and sincerely.</p>
<p><strong>23. &ldquo;Call out all day long&rdquo;</strong> (Psa. 86:3).</p>
<p>We should pray daily. We should call out, especially when we are in great and heavy danger or difficulty.</p>
<p><strong>24. &ldquo;Went out to the mountain to pray, and He spent the whole night in prayer to God&rdquo;</strong> (Luke 6:12).</p>
<p>This verse speaks of the Lord Jesus&rsquo; prayer. When we go to a mountain to pray, our heart can be free, and we will feel closer to God than when we pray in our home. When we pray at night, our heart and spirit also can be quiet, and we can touch God more deeply than when we pray during the day. Sometimes, we should pray in this way, and sometimes we should spend the whole night in prayer.</p>
<p><strong>25. &ldquo;Prayer and petition with thanksgiving&rdquo;</strong> (Phil. 4:6).</p>
<p>We should not only pray but also petition with thanksgiving. Prayer is general, and petition is specific. Sometimes general prayer is not enough, so we need specific petition. In addition to these, we should add thanksgiving. We should thank God for caring for us, giving us the authority to pray, and hearing our prayer.</p>
<p><strong>26. &ldquo;The word which You have spoken...Do as You have spoken&rdquo;</strong> (2 Sam. 7:25).</p>
<p>Prayer is best when we ask according to God&rsquo;s word. If we grasp God&rsquo;s word and pray to Him, He will accomplish His word for us.</p>
<p><strong>27. &ldquo;Seek first His kingdom and His righteousness&rdquo;</strong> (Matt. 6:33).</p>
<p>The most important point of prayer is to care for God&rsquo;s rights and God&rsquo;s will. Therefore, we should seek His kingdom and His righteousness. Seeking His kingdom and His righteousness is to care for God&rsquo;s rights and God&rsquo;s will. If we do this, He will accomplish what we seek.</p>
<p><strong>28. &ldquo;Command&rdquo;</strong> (Isa. 45:11).</p>
<p>Our prayer can be so high that we command God. Sometimes we should not merely pray. We can petition, offer thanksgiving, and also command God. God has committed Himself to us in His Word; He wants us to command Him to do the things that we agree with according to His desire. We should command God to do things according to His Word, or His will. We should command our circumstances to change, our troubles to retreat, and our sicknesses to leave. Moses commanded the Red Sea to part, and the Lord Jesus commanded the wind and waves to be calm. When our prayer arrives at this highest peak, we can command, and it becomes a command. We should exercise to arrive at this level of authoritative prayer.</p><h2 class="head1">GOD&rsquo;S ANSWER TO PRAYER</h2>
<h2 class="head2">God Promises to Answer Our Prayer</h2>
<p><strong>1. &ldquo;Ask and it shall be given to you; seek and you shall find&rdquo;</strong> (Luke 11:9).</p>
<p>If we ask, the Lord promised that it shall be given to us. Therefore, our prayers are answered, not because we cry until the Lord softens His heart and responds. Rather, He answers us because of His promise. His promise is the basis for our prayer.</p>
<p><strong>2. &ldquo;Whatever you ask in My name, that I will do&rdquo;</strong> (John 14:13).</p>
<p>The Lord&rsquo;s promise concerning prayer is very broad. As long as we are abiding in the Lord and praying in His name, He will do whatever we ask.</p>
<p><strong>3. &ldquo;You will call upon Me and come and pray to Me, and I will listen to you&rdquo;</strong> (Jer. 29:12).</p>
<p>If we call upon God and pray to Him, He will listen to us. This is His word of promise. We should be full of faith, boldly call upon Him, and pray to Him because of His promise.</p>
<p><strong>4. &ldquo;Open your mouth wide, and I will fill it&rdquo;</strong> (Psa. 81:10).</p>
<p>This great promise speaks of God&rsquo;s desire for us to pray. According to His promise, He will fill our mouth if we open it wide. This should cause us to pray to God in great measure with assurance.</p>
<p>All of these verses show that God promises to answer our prayers. Since He has given us such promises, it is easy for our prayers to be answered.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Power with Which God Answers</h2>
<p><strong>1. &ldquo;To Him who is able to do superabundantly above all that we ask or think, according to the power which operates in us&rdquo;</strong> (Eph. 3:20).</p>
<p>God answers our prayer by His power. God&rsquo;s power is two-sided. One side is according to His life; the other side is according to His arm. The power of His life is within us, accomplishing our prayers concerning spiritual matters of life. The power of His arm is outside of us, accomplishing our prayers concerning environmental matters and things. His two-sided power is able to do superabundantly above all that we ask or think.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Time in Which God Answers</h2>
<p><strong>1. &ldquo;Before they call, I will answer; / Even while they are speaking, I will hear&rdquo;</strong> (Isa. 65:24).</p>
<p>Sometimes God answers us before we pray, and He hears us while we are praying.</p>
<p><strong>2. &ldquo;From the first day that you set your heart to understand this matter...your words were heard&rdquo;</strong> (Dan. 10:12).</p>
<p>On the first day that Daniel prayed, his prayer was heard by God, but he did not know of God&rsquo;s answer until twenty-one days later, because the angel coming with the answer met with resistance from Satan&rsquo;s angel. This shows that sometimes God&rsquo;s answer to our prayer can be delayed by Satan. Like Daniel, we should endure in prayer to overcome obstacles from Satan so that we may see God&rsquo;s answer.</p>
<p><strong>3. &ldquo;He remained...for two days&rdquo;</strong> (John 11:6, see also vv. 3, 21).</p>
<p>When Lazarus was sick, Martha and Mary, his sisters, sent some to tell the Lord. When the Lord heard about Lazarus, He remained for two days before He came. Consequently, the two sisters felt that the Lord had come too late, that He had done something wrong. However, the Lord waited for two days because He had His own plan. He wanted to wait until Lazarus had died and was buried so that He would have an opportunity to express His resurrection power. Therefore, the Lord&rsquo;s answer to prayer, whether early or late, is always according to His plan.</p>
<p><strong>4. &ldquo;Will not God...carry out the avenging of His chosen ones, who cry to Him day and night, though He is long-suffering over them?&rdquo;</strong> (Luke 18:7).</p>
<p>Sometimes God waits a long time before answering our prayer. While we are waiting, it seems as if He is ignoring our prayer, but eventually He gives us an answer. The time that He takes to answer our prayer is in His hands. If He thinks that it is better to be quick, He will answer quickly. If He thinks that it is better to be slow, He will answer slowly. </p>
<h2 class="head2">The Way in Which God Answers Prayer</h2>
<p><strong>1. &ldquo;What man is there among you who, when his son asks him for a loaf, will give him a stone? Or also when he asks for a fish, will give him a serpent?...How much more will your Father who is in the heavens give good things to those who ask Him!&rdquo;</strong> (Matt. 7:9-11).</p>
</h2>
<p>God&rsquo;s wisdom means that He is never wrong when He answers our prayers. Sometimes we ask wrongly, but He still answers correctly. Sometimes we think a stone is bread and a serpent is a fish, and so we ask for them. But God still gives us bread and fish. He gives us the correct things, the good things. A brother who was going from a Western country to Africa to preach the gospel asked the Lord to give him a healthy body so that he could suffer in Africa. One day he fell and broke his leg. The break was so bad that it could not heal; eventually, he was given a wooden leg. He did not understand why the Lord allowed this to happen, but when he was in Africa, some natives saw him and wanted to eat him. When he could not escape their pursuit, he gave them his wooden leg to eat. When they tasted it, they let him go. Then he understood that God had answered his prayer by giving him a wooden leg that would save his life. Sometimes God&rsquo;s answers to our prayer do not seem appropriate. We even think that He is wrong, but the subsequent facts prove that His answers are indeed appropriate and correct. Thank God, we may be wrong, but He is never wrong. We may ask wrongly, but He never gives the wrong thing.</p>
<p><strong>2. &ldquo;You do not know what you are asking. Are you able to drink the cup which I am about to drink?&rdquo;</strong> (Matt. 20:22).</p>
<p>The mother of James and John asked the Lord for thrones for her sons. The Lord instead said that He would give them a cup of suffering. We often do not know what we are asking. But the Lord in His wisdom knows what we need, so He gives according to our need. We ask for patience, but He gives us suffering. He knows that sufferings bring in endurance. He does not answer our prayers according to our concept but according to His wisdom.</p><h2 class="head2">God&rsquo;s Goal in Answering Prayer</h2>
<p><strong>1. &ldquo;Whatever you ask in My name, that I will do, that the Father may be glorified in the Son&rdquo;</strong> (John 14:13).</p>
<p>God&rsquo;s goal in answering our prayers is not our pleasure or joy. It is His glory, the expression of Himself, so that we might know Him.</p>
<h2 class="head1">BARRIERS TO PRAYER BEING ANSWERED</h2>
<h2 class="head2">Sin</h2>
<p><strong>1. &ldquo;If I regarded iniquity in my heart, / The Lord did not hear&rdquo;</strong> (Psa. 66:18; see also Prov. 15:8, 29).</p>
<p>The first barrier to prayer being answered is sin. If we regard iniquity in our heart, the Lord will not hear us. <em>Regarded</em> in Hebrew conveys a sense of being polite. If a person prays but regards, entertains, and is polite and deferential toward sin, rather than hating and refusing sin, God will not hear his prayer.</p>
<p><strong>2. &ldquo;Your iniquities have become a separation / Between you and your God, / And your sins have hidden His face / From you so that He does not hear&rdquo;</strong> (Isa. 59:2; see also 1:15; 58:4; Micah 3:2-4; John 9:31).</p>
<p>Sin creates a separation between God and us and causes God to hide His face from us. If we do not forsake sin, God cannot answer our prayer.</p>
<p><strong>3. &ldquo;We have transgressed and rebelled... / You have covered Yourself with a cloud / That prayer might not pass through&rdquo;</strong> (Lam. 3:42, 44).</p>
<p>Sin stirs up God&rsquo;s wrath, and He covers Himself with a dark cloud so that our prayer might not pass through. If we live in sin, our prayer surely cannot reach God, be heard by God, or be answered by God.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Idols</h2>
<p>False gods and idols provoke God&rsquo;s jealousy, causing God to be unwilling to hear our prayer. We may think that we have left false gods and idols and do not have any false gods and idols, but we must realize that anything that usurps the place of God is a false god and idol in our heart. If this is our condition, God cannot be inquired of by us and, even less, answer our prayer.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Loving the World</h2>
<p><strong>1. &ldquo;You ask and do not receive...Do you not know that the friendship of the world is enmity with God?&rdquo;</strong> (James 4:3-4).</p>
<p>The friendship of the world is enmity with God. Therefore, God will be unable to hear and answer our prayers if we are friends of the world and love the world.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Asking Evilly</h2>
<p><strong>1. &ldquo;You ask and do not receive because you ask evilly that you may spend it on your pleasures&rdquo;</strong> (James 4:3).</p>
<p>God will not answer prayers that ask inappropriately, that is, asking evilly that we may receive for the sake of our pleasures.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Not Forgiving Others</h2>
<p><strong>1. &ldquo;When you stand praying, forgive, if you have anything against anyone&rdquo;</strong> (Mark 11:25, see also v. 26).</p>
<p>Prayer is fellowship with God, and fellowship with God requires God&rsquo;s forgiveness. Sin without God&rsquo;s forgiveness causes our fellowship with God to be broken. Therefore, if we want to fellowship with Him in prayer, we must obtain God&rsquo;s forgiveness of our sins. His forgiving of us is based upon our forgiving of others. If we do not forgive others, God will not forgive us. If we do not forgive others, God cannot forgive us, and we cannot fellowship with God.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Not Being Reconciled with Our Brother</h2>
<p><strong>1. &ldquo;If you are offering your gift at the altar and there you remember that your brother has something against you...first go and be reconciled to your brother&rdquo;</strong> (Matt. 5:23-24).</p>
<p>If we have a problem with a brother, we cannot fellowship with God. The offering of our gift at the altar refers to fellowship with God. If we remember that a brother has something against us when we want to fellowship with God, we should first go and be reconciled to the brother to correct this problem. According to the Lord&rsquo;s word, if a brother has something against us, we must first be reconciled to him in order to clear up the problem. If we do not do this, we will not be able to fellowship with God. We will not be able to pray, and God will not listen to or answer our prayer.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Doubts</h2>
<p><strong>1. &ldquo;He who doubts...must not suppose that he will receive anything from the Lord&rdquo;</strong> (James 1:6-7).</p>
<p>A principle for prayers being answered is faith. Faith honors and glorifies God; doubts despise and humiliate God, making it impossible for Him to answer our prayers. Even when we ask for something from man, we must have faith. If we ask for something with doubt, a person will not want to do anything for us. This is the case even more when we pray to God. Doubting causes prayers to be unheard and unanswered. It prevents us from obtaining anything from God.</p><h2 class="head2">Problems between Husband and Wife</h2>
<p><strong>1. &ldquo;In like manner, wives, be subject to your own husbands...Husbands, in like manner dwell together with them according to knowledge...that your prayers may not be hindered&rdquo;</strong> (1 Pet. 3:1, 7).</p>
<p>Wives must be subject to their own husbands. Husbands must dwell together with their wives according to knowledge. This is according to God&rsquo;s ordination, and it pleases Him. If a husband and a wife do not live in this way, if there is a problem or separation, their prayer will be hindered. Any friction, quarrel, or discord between husband and wife makes it difficult for prayers to be heard and answered by God.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Stinginess</h2>
<p><strong>1. &ldquo;Whoever closes his ear to the cry of the poor man / Also will cry and will not be heard&rdquo;</strong> (Prov. 21:13; see also 1 John 3:17, 22).</p>
<p>Stinginess also causes prayers to not be heard or answered by God. If we do not listen to the cry of others, God will not listen to our cry. If we have the economic means to care for a brother&rsquo;s lack but close our heart of mercy, how can God hear our prayers and cries? If we do not keep His commandment to love and care for the brothers, if we do not practice what pleases Him, how can He answer our prayers and cries to Him? Therefore, we must deal with our stingy heart according to God&rsquo;s pleasure so that our prayers can be heard and answered by God.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Not Listening to the Word of God</h2>
<p><strong>1. &ldquo;He who turns away his ear from hearing the law, / Even his prayer is an abomination&rdquo;</strong> (Prov. 28:9).</p>
<p>If we do not listen to the word of God&rsquo;s command, or if we hate the word of God&rsquo;s command, He will not hear our prayer to Him. Our prayer will be an abomination to Him. Not listening to God&rsquo;s word prevents our prayers from being heard and answered by God.</p>
<p><strong>2. &ldquo;As He called and they would not hear, so they called and I would not hear&rdquo;</strong> (Zech. 7:13).</p>
<p>If we do not listen when God speaks to us, God will not listen when we speak to Him. Not listening to God&rsquo;s word prevents our prayers from being heard by God.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Not Keeping God&rsquo;s Commandments</h2>
<p><strong>1. &ldquo;Whatever we ask we receive from Him because we keep His commandments and do the things that are pleasing in His sight&rdquo;</strong> (1 John 3:22).</p>
<p>When we keep His commandments and do the things that are pleasing in His sight, we receive what we ask from Him. If we do not keep His commandments or do the things that are pleasing in His sight, we will not receive what we ask from Him. If we are not willing to keep God&rsquo;s commandments, God will not be willing to answer our prayer. If we are not willing to do what is pleasing in His sight, God will not be willing to accomplish the things that we ask. Not keeping God&rsquo;s commandments or not doing the things that are pleasing in His sight prevents our prayers from being answered by God.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Pride</h2>
<p><strong>1. &ldquo;There they cry, but He does not answer, / Because of the pride of evil men&rdquo;</strong> (Job 35:12).</p>
<p>God hates pride; pride prevents God from answering our prayer.</p>
<p><strong>2. &ldquo;God resists the proud but gives grace to the humble&rdquo;</strong> (James 4:6).</p>
<p>God&rsquo;s grace is given to the humble. The proud cannot receive God&rsquo;s grace; they only encounter God&rsquo;s resistance. Therefore, when the proud pray, they should not expect to receive God&rsquo;s answer. Pride hinders us from receiving an answer to our prayers.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Coldness</h2>
<p><strong>1. &ldquo;He struck the ground three times then stopped. And the man of God became angry with him and said, You should have struck it five or six times&rdquo;</strong> (2 Kings 13:18-19).</p>
<p>A cold heart, rather than a burning heart, can prevent our prayer from receiving an answer. The prophet Elisha told the king of Israel to strike the ground with some arrows. The king of Israel was not burning enough concerning this matter, so he struck the ground only three times. Elisha became angry with him and said that he should have struck the ground five or six times in order to completely defeat his enemy. Since he struck the ground only three times, he could strike the enemy only three times. Sometimes our prayers do not receive a complete answer from God because we are not burning enough and do not pray enough. God&rsquo;s answer corresponds with our prayer. The extent to which we pray is the extent to which God answers. How much we pray determines how much God answers. Since coldness causes us to pray less, it also causes us to receive less of an answer from God.</p>
<h2 class="head1">A FEW IMPORTANT MATTERS REQUIRING OUR PRAYER</h2>
<p><strong>1. &ldquo;Clear me of my secret faults. / Also keep back Your servant from presumptuous sins... / May the words of my mouth and the meditation of my heart / Be acceptable before You&rdquo;</strong> (Psa. 19:12-14).</p>
<p>We should pray for our condition before God and for our spiritual life. We should ask God to forgive us of our sins, especially our secret faults which have not even been exposed to us. We should ask God to keep us from sins, especially presumptuous sins. We should ask God to let the words of our mouth and the meditation of our heart be acceptable before Him. We should pray this kind of prayer daily. Newly saved brothers and sisters should especially pray this way every day.</p>
<p><strong>2. &ldquo;Search me, O God, and know my heart; / Try me, and know my anxious thoughts; / And see if there is some harmful way in me, / And lead me on the eternal way&rdquo;</strong> (Psa. 139:23-24).</p>
<p>We should frequently pray for God to search us, to know our heart, and to try us and know our anxious thoughts. We should ask Him to see what evil is within us, what idolatrous way is there, and to lead us in the eternal way (in verse 24 the phrase <em>harmful way</em> can also be translated &ldquo;idolatrous way&rdquo;).</p>
<p><strong>3. &ldquo;The Lord direct your hearts into the love of God and into the endurance of Christ&rdquo;</strong> (2 Thes. 3:5).</p>
<p>We should ask the Lord to direct our hearts into the love of God and into the endurance of Christ so that we would have the love of God and the endurance of Christ.</p>
<p><strong>4. &ldquo;Give the Holy Spirit to those who ask Him&rdquo;</strong> (Luke 11:13).</p>
<p>We should particularly ask God to give us the Holy Spirit. Although we have already received the Holy Spirit, we should ask God to give us more of the Holy Spirit so that we can experience the Spirit more.</p>
<p><strong>5. &ldquo;That...the Father of glory, may give to you a spirit of wisdom and revelation in the full knowledge of Him, the eyes of your heart having been enlightened, that you may know&rdquo;</strong> (Eph. 1:17-18).</p>
<p>This is a very spiritual prayer that we should pray. We should ask God to give us a spirit of wisdom and revelation in the full knowledge of Him and to enlighten the eyes of our heart that we may know the hope of His calling, the glory of His inheritance in the saints, and the surpassing greatness of His power toward us who believe.</p>
<p><strong>6. &ldquo;That He would grant you, according to the riches of His glory, to be strengthened with power through His Spirit into the inner man, that Christ may make His home in your hearts through faith, that you, being rooted and grounded in love, may be full of strength to apprehend with all the saints what the breadth and length and height and depth are and to know the knowledge-surpassing love of Christ, that you may be filled unto all the fullness of God&rdquo;</strong> (Eph. 3:16-19).</p>
<p>This is a very spiritual prayer that we should pray. We should ask God to grant us, according to the riches of His glory, to be strengthened with power through His Spirit into the inner man, that Christ may make His home in our hearts through faith, that we may be full of strength to apprehend with all the saints the breadth and length and height and depth, having tasted His love and being rooted and grounded in love, and that we may know the knowledge-surpassing love of Christ in order to be filled unto all the fullness of God.</p>
<p><strong>7. &ldquo;That you may be filled with the full knowledge of His will in all spiritual wisdom and understanding...by the full knowledge of God, being empowered with all power, according to the might of His glory&rdquo;</strong> (Col. 1:9-11).</p>
<p>We need spiritual wisdom and understanding to know the will of God so that we can walk worthily of the Lord to please Him in all things, bearing fruit in every good work and growing by the full knowledge of God, being empowered with all power according to the might of His glory unto all endurance and long-suffering with joy. We should thoroughly pray for this and ask God to give us this experience.</p>
<p><strong>8. &ldquo;That you may stand mature and fully assured in all the will of God&rdquo;</strong> (Col. 4:12).</p>
<p>Understanding and keeping the will of God are the most important matters for a Christian. Therefore, we must pray that God would enable us to stand mature and fully assured in all His will.</p>
<p><strong>9. &ldquo;Perfect you in every good work for the doing of His will, doing in us that which is well pleasing in His sight through Jesus Christ&rdquo;</strong> (Heb. 13:21).</p>
<p>God causes us to do His will through Jesus Christ by doing in us that which is well pleasing in His sight. We should pay attention to this matter, pursue it, and even more, pray for it.</p>
<p>The previously quoted verses relate to our condition before God and to our spiritual life. We must pay attention to these matters in our prayer. These are the prayers that we should pray related to ourselves. However, we also need to pray for the kingdom of God and His work, for the church and the saints, for all men, and for Israel, and so forth. These matters are considered in the following verses.</p>
<p><strong>10. &ldquo;Your name be sanctified; Your kingdom come; Your will be done, as in heaven, so also on earth&rdquo;</strong> (Matt. 6:9-10).</p>
<p>This is the prayer that the Lord taught us to pray. It is the greatest prayer in the Bible. This prayer touches God&rsquo;s eternal plan: It asks that God&rsquo;s name be sanctified on earth; it asks that the kingdom of God come to earth to rule, and it asks that the will of God be done on earth. We must realize that these three matters are not a problem in heaven; heaven does not need our prayer. However, these three matters are a big problem with man and the earth because Satan captured man and usurped the earth. We need to pray that these three matters would be on earth as they are in heaven.</p>
<p><strong>11. &ldquo;Beseech the Lord of the harvest that He would thrust out workers into His harvest&rdquo;</strong> (Matt. 9:38).</p>
<p>The condition on the earth today is in desperate need of God&rsquo;s thrusting out of workers into His harvest. We see this problem before our eyes, and according to God&rsquo;s principle, we must pray. The degree of our prayer is the degree of God&rsquo;s work. The extent to which we pray is the extent to which God will work. I hope that many among us will pray to the Lord concerning this matter.</p>
<p><strong>12. &ldquo;Petition concerning all the saints, and for me, that utterance may be given to me in the opening of my mouth&rdquo;</strong> (Eph. 6:18-19; see also Col. 4:3-4).</p>
<p>We must pray for the saints and the apostles. To pray for the saints is to pray that the saints would know God&rsquo;s plan for the church in Christ as recorded in Ephesians, to know the salvation that God gave the church through Christ, and to grow up and mature by this knowledge to the fullness of the stature of Christ so that we can express Christ and deal with the enemy, Satan. To pray for the apostles is to pray for God&rsquo;s workers and to ask God to give them utterance so that they can clearly speak the mystery of the gospel. This opens the door of the gospel so that they can preach the mystery of the gospel. We should have many among us who pray for these two matters. May the Lord truly raise up such praying ones among us.</p>
<p><strong>13. &ldquo;That the word of the Lord may run and be glorified&rdquo;</strong> (2 Thes. 3:1).</p>
<p>We should pray for the word of the Lord. We should ask the Lord to open a door for His word so that His word may run and be glorified in order to spread His kingdom.</p>
<p><strong>14. &ldquo;Concerning My sons, / And concerning the work of My hands, command Me&rdquo;</strong> (Isa. 45:11).</p>
<p>We should have desperate and high prayers for the children of God and for His work. Our prayer should be so desperate and high that we command God in specific things.</p>
<p><strong>15. &ldquo;Revive Your work&rdquo;</strong> (Hab. 3:2).</p>
<p>We should pray for a revival of the Lord&rsquo;s work, asking God to revive His work.</p>
<p><strong>16. &ldquo;Turn us back to You... / Renew our days as before&rdquo;</strong> (Lam. 5:21).</p>
<p>We should pray for God to turn the church to the way of His recovery and to renew the days of the church so that the church may be as the church in apostolic times.</p>
<p><strong>17. &ldquo;Keep them in Your name...that they may be one&rdquo;</strong> (John 17:11).</p>
<p>We should pray for the oneness of the church.</p>
<p><strong>18. &ldquo;Petitions, prayers, intercessions, thanksgivings be made on behalf of all men; on behalf of kings and all who are in high position&rdquo;</strong> (1 Tim. 2:1-2).</p>
<p>We should pray for all men, asking God to save them. We should also pray for those who are in high positions in the government, asking God to bless them and give peace.</p>
<p><strong>19. &ldquo;My petition to God for them is for their salvation&rdquo;</strong> (Rom. 10:1).</p>
<p>We should especially pray for the salvation of the Jews. They are God&rsquo;s chosen people and are loved by God. He desires that they repent and be saved. We should be sympathetic to God&rsquo;s heart and pray much for them.</p>
<p><strong>20. &ldquo;Come, Lord Jesus!&rdquo;</strong> (Rev. 22:20).</p>
<p>This is the last prayer in the Bible, and it should be our final prayer: &ldquo;Lord Jesus, I want You to come quickly!&rdquo;</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER THIRTY-THREE</h1>
<h1 class="title">A FEW MATTERS CONCERNING<br />
THE LIVING OF THE BELIEVERS</h1>
<p>In this chapter we will briefly cover eight matters and four principles concerning the living of the believers.</p>
<h2 class="head1">MARRIAGE</h2>
<h2 class="head2">Marriage Being Ordained by God</h2>
<p><strong>1. &ldquo;Jehovah God said, It is not good for the man to be alone; I will make him a helper as his counterpart&rdquo;</strong> (Gen. 2:18).</p>
<p>When God created man, He saw that it was not good for man to be alone, so He determined to make a helper for man as his counterpart. This shows that marriage is according to God&rsquo;s divine and holy ordination. Marriage was ordained by God when God first created man. Marriage did not come in after the fall of man, nor is it based on the lusts of man. Marriage was ordained by God for man in creation, and it is a primary matter in our human living. In our living, only creation is higher than marriage, and all other matters are headed up by marriage. The origin of man was through creation; the continuation of man is through marriage. In the beginning God created man, but the continuation and propagation of man is through marriage. Therefore, marriage is important to God, and He ordains that man marry.</p>
<p>God ordained man to have a helper as his counterpart because it was not good for the man to be alone. Being alone is not good for several reasons. It is not good in regard to reaching God&rsquo;s goal, and even more, it is not good in regard to man himself. Both physically and emotionally, in human living and human affairs, it is not good for man to be alone. Therefore, God determined to make a helper as a counterpart for man.</p>
<p><strong>2. &ldquo;He who created them from the beginning made them male and female, and said, &lsquo;For this cause shall a man leave his father and his mother and shall be joined to his wife; and the two shall be one flesh&rsquo;&rdquo;</strong> (Matt. 19:4-5).</p>
<p>In the beginning God not only ordained that man have a helper as his counterpart in marriage, He also created them male and female and ordained that the two should be one flesh. Man has an inward need for marriage, which comes from God&rsquo;s creation. God created this need in human nature. The Bible reveals that God&rsquo;s goal in the universe is with man. In order for God to accomplish His goal in the universe, He must gain man, and in order to gain man, He must ensure that the man He created for His purpose continues and propagates through marriage. Therefore, God not only ordained marriage; He also created a need for marriage within man.</p>
<p>God&rsquo;s creation of man was very special. He created man so that a male and a female would need each other in order to be a complete person by becoming one flesh. According to the teaching of the Bible, neither a female nor a male is a complete person. In order to be complete, a male and a female must join together as one. Just as two halves of a watermelon are needed in order to be a complete watermelon, only a man and a wife are a complete person from God&rsquo;s point of view. A brother once invited a couple over for dinner, but the husband came without his wife. The brother mentioned to his guest that only half of a person came. According to the Bible and God&rsquo;s original ordination, I felt that this word was correct. God wants male and female to become one flesh; therefore, He wants man to marry. Marriage is God&rsquo;s original ordination.</p>
<p>The Scripture quoted by the Lord Jesus in Matthew 19:5 was in response to a question concerning divorce. In His word the Lord acknowledged God&rsquo;s original ordination concerning marriage. Furthermore, the Lord indicated that man should honor God&rsquo;s original ordination concerning marriage. In the New Testament the Lord&rsquo;s consideration of the importance of human marriage matched God&rsquo;s consideration in creation.</p>
<p><strong>3. &ldquo;Let marriage be held in honor among all&rdquo;</strong> (Heb. 13:4).</p>
<p>This word was spoken by the Holy Spirit in the New Testament through the apostle. It shows that the Holy Spirit, just as God in creation and the Lord Jesus in the New Testament, considers marriage to be an important human matter. The apostle said that marriage should be held in honor among all. Another translation of this word is &ldquo;let marriage be held in all honor.&rdquo; No one should despise marriage, and nothing related to marriage should be despised, because the Holy Spirit says that marriage should be held in all honor among all. This is the first relationship in human relationships. It comes out of God&rsquo;s holy ordination. We absolutely must not consider marriage as being something unholy.</p>
<p><strong>4. &ldquo;Teachings of demons...who forbid marriage&rdquo;</strong> (1 Tim. 4:1-3).</p>
<p>Marriage was ordained by God for man so that man could accomplish His goal. In contrast, the forbidding of marriage comes from demons. Demons have a desire to destroy the accomplishment of God&rsquo;s goal which depends upon human marriage, so they forbid people to marry. They not only forbid people to marry but also teach the forbidding of human marriage as a doctrine. People practice this doctrine in Buddhism, Catholicism, and other religions. Attacks on this divine matter of God&rsquo;s ordination come from enemies who have an intention to destroy God&rsquo;s goal by causing people to marry loosely or by forbidding them to marry. We should be aware that an ideology not to marry comes from demons, God&rsquo;s enemies.</p>
<p><strong>5. &ldquo;If you do marry, you have not sinned; and if the virgin marries, she has not sinned&rdquo;</strong> (1 Cor. 7:28).</p>
<p>Since marriage is according to God&rsquo;s ordination and should be honored by man, no one should consider a proper marriage as sinful. Only a filthy or unstable mind will consider a proper marriage of a man and a woman as a sinful thing.</p>
<p>We should not have the thought that those who love God should not marry. This is not God&rsquo;s thought. If we follow this thought back to its root, it comes from demons. Without marriage, there would be no propagation, and without propagation, the human race would end, and there would be no one through whom God could accomplish His goal in the universe. Therefore, the matter of marriage is not only right but also necessary in God&rsquo;s eyes.</p><h2 class="head2">The Matter of Keeping One&rsquo;s Virginity</h2>
<p><strong>1. &ldquo;His disciples said to Him, If the case of the man with his wife is like this, it is not profitable to marry. And He said to them, Not all men can accept this word, but only those to whom it has been given...There are eunuchs who made themselves eunuchs because of the kingdom of the heavens. He who can accept it, let him accept it&rdquo;</strong> (Matt. 19:10-12; see also 1 Cor. 7:7-9).</p>
<p>Although God ordained marriage for His common goal in creation, He gives some people the gift not to marry for the sake of His goal in His redemption. Those who have been given this gift spontaneously receive it. They can willingly not marry for the sake of God and the kingdom of the heavens. A person who does not have a willingness to not marry or who feels forced in the matter of not marrying has not received this gift from God. In such a case, not only is he permitted to marry, but he should marry. It is better for one to follow God&rsquo;s ordination and his natural need to be married than to be forced to not marry.</p>
<p><strong>2. &ldquo;Both the unmarried woman and the virgin care for the things of the Lord, that she may be holy both in body and in spirit...may be comely and may wait on the Lord without distraction. But if anyone thinks that he is behaving unbecomingly to his virgin daughter, if she is past the bloom of youth and thus it must be so, let him do what he wishes, he does not sin; let them marry. But he who stands firm in his heart, being under no constraint, and has authority with respect to his own will and has decided this in his own heart, to keep his own virgin daughter, he will do well. So then both he who gives his own virgin daughter in marriage does well, and he who does not give her in marriage will do better&rdquo;</strong> (1 Cor. 7:34-38).</p>
<p>The apostle&rsquo;s word in these verses refers to the matter of some believers keeping their virginity, and it is very clear and definite. If one stands firm in his heart and feels no need to marry, this is a matter of his own will. It is possible for one to decide to keep his virginity and not marry in order to please the Lord by waiting upon the Lord without distraction. However, if one feels that dealing with himself in this way is incompatible with his human circumstances, he can freely marry without any consideration of sin. Furthermore, in such a situation it is better for him to marry. The Bible does not have a hard rule concerning this matter; instead, it gives us the authority to choose freely. Consequently, the Catholic Church&rsquo;s rule against marriage for monks, nuns, priests, and popes contradicts the teaching of the Bible to the uttermost.</p>
<p><strong>3. &ldquo;These are they who have not been defiled with women, for they are virgins&rdquo;</strong> (Rev. 14:4).</p>
<p>There are some saved ones who definitely receive a special gift from God to keep their virginity in order to become a special group of overcomers to Him. They become firstfruits to God and to the Lord Christ, receiving God&rsquo;s reward.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Concerning Choosing a Proper Mate</h2>
<p><strong>1. &ldquo;Do not become dissimilarly yoked with unbelievers&rdquo;</strong> (2 Cor. 6:14).</p>
<p>In the Old Testament God did not allow oxen and donkeys to be yoked together (Deut. 22:10). Similarly, in the New Testament He does not allow believers to be yoked together with unbelievers in marriage. Since oxen and donkeys have different dispositions and inclinations, they have difficulty walking together on the same road. Believers and unbelievers also have different dispositions, views, inclinations, and goals, so it is difficult for a believer who is dissimilarly yoked to walk on a road that follows the Lord and lives to the Lord. We have the Lord&rsquo;s life within, but unbelievers do not have His life. We are light, but they are darkness. We love the Lord, but they love the world. How can we be yoked together and joined in marriage with them? Therefore, when believers choose a spouse, they must choose a believer. This keeps the Lord&rsquo;s commandment. This will not only please the Lord but also help keep us from going astray.</p>
<p><strong>2. &ldquo;Take along a sister as a wife&rdquo;; &ldquo;She is free to be married to whom she wishes, only to one in the Lord&rdquo;</strong> (1 Cor. 9:5; 7:39).</p>
<p>Believers can marry only believers. If we are brothers, we can marry only believing sisters. If we are sisters, we can marry only brothers in the Lord.</p>
<p>In the Old Testament God did not allow His people to marry Gentiles lest their holiness be mixed with the unholiness of the Gentiles and they be tempted to leave Him to follow other gods (Deut. 7:3-4; Exo. 34:16; Ezra 9:2; Neh. 10:30). King Solomon was misled because he did not keep God&rsquo;s commandment and married Gentile women. This caused him to sin and leave God (1 Kings 11:1-8; Neh. 13:23-27). This should be a warning to us.</p>
<p>When choosing a mate, the most important thing is to seek and follow the Lord&rsquo;s leading. According to the pattern in Genesis 24, if older ones like Abraham can oversee and confirm our choice, our choice will be more solid. A good wife and an appropriate spouse is a gift from God (Prov. 19:14); consequently, we may not be able to choose well by ourselves. We also should not pay more attention to outward beauty than to inward virtues and capabilities (11:22; 12:4; 31:10, 30). However, we must love the other person. Love must be the basis of choosing a mate (Gen. 29:18, 20). If there is no love, we should not base our choice on other conditions. Of course, in choosing a mate, our love must be strictly controlled and directed by the Lord so that it may be appropriate and beneficial, rather than harmful.</p><h2 class="head2">Concerning Those Who Are Married</h2>
<p><strong>1. &ldquo;To the married...a wife must not be separated from her husband (but if indeed she is separated, let her remain unmarried or be reconciled to her husband), and a husband must not leave his wife...But if the unbelieving one separates, let him separate&rdquo;</strong> (1 Cor. 7:10-11, 15).</p>
<p>Those who are married may not be separated. Furthermore, a believing spouse may not be separated from an unbelieving spouse. If they are separated, they should be reconciled if possible. However, if an unbelieving spouse separates, the believing spouse should let the unbelieving spouse separate. There should be no legal action, because God desires reconciliation.</p>
<p>Those who are no longer married because of separation should not marry again. If believers remarry when adultery is not involved (see points 2 and 3 below in the section &ldquo;Concerning Divorce&rdquo;), the oneness of a marriage between one man and one woman is destroyed, and they become adulterers.</p>
<p><strong>2. &ldquo;Have you been bound to a wife? Do not seek a release&rdquo;</strong> (1 Cor. 7:27).</p>
<p>A brother who is bound to a wife should not and may not seek a release. This is not the Lord&rsquo;s will. The Lord wants him to learn some lessons through his wife.</p>
<p><strong>3. &ldquo;A wife is bound for so long a time as her husband lives&rdquo;</strong> (1 Cor. 7:39).</p>
<p>While her husband is alive, a sister is bound and cannot remarry; otherwise, she will destroy the oneness between a husband and wife, and she will be committing adultery.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Concerning Remarriage</h2>
<p><strong>1. &ldquo;Should the husband fall asleep, she is free to be married to whom she wishes, only to one in the Lord&rdquo;</strong> (1 Cor. 7:39).</p>
<p>If a sister&rsquo;s husband dies, the bond of oneness between husband and wife is broken. Then she is free to remarry as long as she keeps one condition: She must marry a brother in the Lord.</p>
<p><strong>2. &ldquo;Widows, It is good for them if they remain even as I am. But if they do not have self-control, let them marry; for it is better to marry than to burn with desire&rdquo;</strong> (1 Cor. 7:8-9).</p>
<p>When the apostle Paul spoke this word, he must have been single. (We do not know if he ever married.) At this time he thought it best if widows do not remarry but remain single as he was in order to concentrate on serving the Lord. If they could not, they could remarry. It is better to remarry than to force oneself to remain single.</p>
<p><strong>3. &ldquo;I will therefore that younger widows marry, bear children, keep house&rdquo;</strong> (1 Tim. 5:14, see also vv. 9-13, 15).</p>
<p>In 1 Corinthians 7 Paul clearly says that at that time he wanted widows to be as he was and remain single. He did not have a command from the Lord, but this was his hope and opinion. First Corinthians was written early in his ministry. When he wrote 1 Timothy in his later years, his manner of speaking about this matter changed. He must have observed that it was difficult for young widows, who could be easily tempted by Satan, to remain single. Therefore, at that time he wanted younger widows to marry, bear children, and keep house to give no opportunity for Satan to tempt them. Furthermore, he also commanded that widows be sixty years old before the church enrolled them for assistance. Younger widows were to be refused because the church could not know whether she would remain single as a widow in need of assistance.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Concerning Divorce</h2>
<p><strong>1. &ldquo;They are no longer two, but one flesh. Therefore what God has yoked together, let man not separate&rdquo;</strong> (Matt. 19:6).</p>
<p>When a husband and wife are married, they become one flesh and are no longer two. We must pay particular attention to the Lord&rsquo;s word <em>no longer two.</em> This corresponds to a man and a woman being joined together to be a complete person. Since two are joined as one, they should not be separated. According to the Lord&rsquo;s word, this yoking is God&rsquo;s work; it is of God. Therefore, man may not separate them. People today have no problem with divorce, but the Lord says, &ldquo;No!&rdquo; Marriage is God&rsquo;s yoking, but divorce is man&rsquo;s action. God only agrees with marriage; He never agrees with divorce.</p>
<p><strong>2. &ldquo;Whoever divorces his wife, except for fornication, and marries another, commits adultery&rdquo;</strong> (Matt. 19:9).</p>
<p>Marriage is one; if it becomes two through divorce, there is confusion. Therefore, unless a man&rsquo;s wife commits adultery, he may not divorce her and marry another. If he divorces his wife and marries another for any matter other than adultery, he breaks the oneness of marriage and commits adultery.</p>
<p><strong>3. &ldquo;Everyone who divorces his wife, except for the cause of fornication, causes her to commit adultery, and whoever marries her who has been divorced commits adultery&rdquo;</strong> (Matt. 5:32).</p>
<p>If a wife commits adultery, she is an adulteress. If she does not commit adultery but her husband divorces her, forcing her to marry another, he causes her to commit adultery since she may not marry again while he is living. If she marries again, she breaks the oneness of marriage, commits adultery, and becomes an adulteress. Whoever marries her also breaks the oneness of marriage and therefore commits adultery. This is something that must not be done. In conclusion, as long as a husband or wife are living, neither party can remarry unless adultery is involved. If they do, they break the oneness of marriage and commit adultery. This breaks God&rsquo;s ordination and destroys what God has yoked. God does not approve of this.</p><h2 class="head2">Marriage Being a Symbol of the Union<br />
between Christ and the Church</h2>
<p><strong>1. &ldquo;I betrothed you to one husband...as a pure virgin to Christ&rdquo;</strong> (2 Cor. 11:2).</p>
<p>The marriage of a man and a woman is a symbol of the joining of Christ and the church. The apostle considers Christ as the husband and the believers as His betrothed. Furthermore, he betrothed us as a pure virgin to Christ. Therefore, whenever we see a marriage, we should be reminded of our relationship to Christ and of Christ&rsquo;s relationship to us.</p>
<p><strong>2. &ldquo;He who has the bride is the bridegroom&rdquo;</strong> (John 3:29; see also Matt. 9:15).</p>
<p>When John the Baptist introduced the Lord Jesus, he said that the Lord was not only the Lamb of God who takes away the sin of the world but also the Bridegroom who would marry the bride. The Lord Himself also said that He came to earth as the Bridegroom. The bride whom He desires to marry is His redeemed ones, the believers. He is the unique, true Bridegroom in the universe. Human bridegrooms are a symbol of Him as the true Bridegroom. His relationship with us and our relationship with Him are the relationships of the Bridegroom with the bride. We should be reminded of this whenever we see a bridegroom and a bride.</p>
<h2 class="head1">FAMILY</h2>
<h2 class="head2">Husband and Wife</h2>
<p><strong>1. &ldquo;For this cause shall a man leave his father and his mother and shall be joined to his wife; and the two shall be one flesh&rdquo;</strong> (Matt. 19:5; see also Eph. 5:31).</p>
<p>The family is built upon the union of a husband and a wife. The condition of the producing and building up of the family primarily depends on the condition of the union between a husband and his wife. The union of husband and wife involves two becoming one flesh, one person, according to God&rsquo;s ordination. In order to have a healthy family, a husband and wife must be one to the extent that they are one person. God wants a husband and wife to become one person and one flesh. Therefore, He wants a man to leave his parents and be joined to his wife. This is different from the ancient Chinese tradition. In China, when a father and mother find a wife for their son, the daughter-in-law serves them. Consequently, the family often has difficulties and is not very healthy. According to God&rsquo;s ordination, parents should not expect their son&rsquo;s wife to serve them. No one should stand between them, making it difficult for them to become one. They should be given complete freedom so that they can truly become one. Thus, they will be able to produce and build up a healthy family.</p>
<p><strong>2. &ldquo;Wives, be subject to your own husbands as to the Lord&rdquo;</strong> (Eph. 5:22; see also Col. 3:18; 1 Pet. 3:1-6).</p>
<p>The responsibility between a husband and wife falls first on the wife. Every time the Bible speaks of the relationship between husband and wife, it speaks first of the wife. A wife should be subject to her husband. Her subjection should be as to the Lord. In matters between husband and wife, God established the husband to represent His authority and the wife to represent the church&rsquo;s subjection to His authority. Therefore, the wife should consider her husband as the Lord. She should take her husband as her authority and be subject to her husband as to the Lord.</p>
<p><em>Be subject to</em> emphasizes authority. Sometimes the husband is wrong in a certain matter, and the wife cannot and should not obey; nevertheless, the husband is still the authority, and the wife must still be subject to him and not overthrow him. Sometimes a wife should not obey her husband, but she should still be subject to him. If she does not obey him because he is wrong, she should still be subject because he is the authority. Obedience is related to an order; subjection is related to position and authority. For example, Daniel&rsquo;s three friends remained in subjection to the king&rsquo;s authority even though they did not obey his order to worship an idol (Dan. 3).</p>
<p>Wives also should be subject to their own husbands. Ephesians 5:22 speaks of this matter, because a wife often agrees with another sister&rsquo;s husband but is not subject to her own husband. Sisters should remember the person whom God has ordained as their authority and be subject to their own husband, not another sister&rsquo;s husband. Agreeing with and admiring another person&rsquo;s husband, while not being subject to and not admiring one&rsquo;s own husband, kills the harmony between a husband and wife and causes the family to suffer loss.</p>
<p><strong>3. &ldquo;The wife should fear her husband&rdquo;</strong> (Eph. 5:33).</p>
<p>Since the husband represents the Lord, the wife should not only honor her husband but also fear her husband. The wife should have fear toward her husband. It is beautiful when a wife has a proper fear of her husband. This will protect her and enable her to avoid many errors. However, if a husband fears his wife, this becomes a very ugly situation and causes many problems.</p>
<p><strong>4. &ldquo;Young women to love their husbands&rdquo;</strong> (Titus 2:4).</p>
<p>It is not enough for wives to be subject to and fear their husbands; they must love them. Wives are best at loving their husbands, and this is also the sweetest thing. The love of a wife for her husband is the soul of her treatment of her husband. If the wife lacks love for her husband, it is as if a person has lost his soul or as if a lamp is out of oil.</p>
<p><strong>5. &ldquo;I do not permit a woman...to assert authority over a man&rdquo;</strong> (1 Tim. 2:12).</p>
<p>A wife may not become the head and assert authority over a man. This is not allowed by God. When a wife becomes the head and asserts authority over a man, it is as if heaven and earth have been turned upside down. This is a confusing and disgraceful situation. The most dangerous situation, one which invariably creates many problems, occurs when a woman is the head in every matter, controlling and asserting authority over a man. It is a protection and a blessing for a woman to maintain her position of subjection with a man&rsquo;s authority covering her head. This is well pleasing to God.</p>
<p><strong>6. &ldquo;Husbands, love your wives and do not be bitter against them&rdquo;</strong> (Col. 3:19; see also Eph. 5:23-29, 33).</p>
<p>God&rsquo;s command to husbands is marvelous. The opposite of subjection is the assertion of authority, and since God tells wives to be subject to their husbands, logically speaking, He should tell husbands to assert authority over their wives. Instead, He commands husbands to love their wives. Although the husband is the head, God does not command him to assert authority over his wife; rather, He wants him to love his wife. A husband&rsquo;s authority as head must be exercised through love. If he does not love his wife, it will be difficult for him to assert authority over his wife. If he does not love his wife, it also will be difficult for his wife to be subject to him. A husband who considers himself as the head but lacks love toward his wife or, as in the case of some brothers, does not love his wife enough should not expect his wife to be subject to him.</p>
<p><strong>7. &ldquo;Husbands...dwell together with them according to knowledge...assigning honor to them&rdquo;</strong> (1 Pet. 3:7).</p>
<p>Husbands must deal with their wives with love and according to knowledge. A husband must deal with his wife according to knowledge because his wife is weaker. <em>According to knowledge</em> means according to reason, according to facts and principles, not according to emotions and reactions. If a husband is sympathetic to his wife&rsquo;s weaknesses and cares for and reasonably deals with her according to the facts of each matter, he truly loves his wife. However, when some brothers deal with their wives, they are completely unreasonable; that is, they consider only their own preferences. They give free rein to their emotions and are confused to the extent that they are not a proper head. This creates problems for their wives who seemingly are without a husband or a head. We should not be like this.</p>
<p>Although the husband should be sympathetic with his wife according to knowledge because she is weaker, he should not despise her for her weakness. On the contrary, he should assign honor to her because she is one flesh with him and a fellow heir of the grace of life. A husband is the authority in God&rsquo;s ordination, and a wife must submit to this authority; in the old creation God made the husband stronger and the wife weaker. Nevertheless, in God&rsquo;s eyes a husband and wife are one person, and in His salvation a husband and wife are heirs together of the grace of life. Therefore, husbands should be sympathetic to their wives&rsquo; weaknesses on the one hand and assign honor to their wives on the other hand.</p>
<p>Husbands often love their wives and are sympathetic to them, but they do not honor them. Honor must be added to a husband&rsquo;s love and sympathy in order for him to properly treat his wife. Only love and sympathy combined with honor can be considered as true love and reliable sympathy.</p>
<p><strong>8. &ldquo;Do not deprive each other, except by agreement for a time that you may devote yourselves to prayer, and then be together again&rdquo;</strong> (1 Cor. 7:5; see also 9:5).</p>
<p>Unless they want to devote themselves to prayer, a husband and wife should not sleep separately so that Satan does not have an opportunity to tempt them. According to this principle, husbands and wives also should not be separated for long periods of time. A husband should take his wife with him wherever he goes.</p><h2 class="head3">A Husband and a Wife Being a Symbol<br />
of Christ and the Church</h2>
<p><strong>1. &ldquo;The two shall be one flesh. This mystery is great, but I speak with regard to Christ and the church&rdquo;</strong> (Eph. 5:31-32).</p>
<p>A husband and a wife, being one flesh, are a symbol of a great mystery, Christ and the church, and of the oneness between Christ and the church. Whenever we consider a husband and wife being one flesh, we should see the mystery of the oneness of Christ and the church.</p>
<p><strong>2. &ldquo;A husband is head of the wife as also Christ is Head of the church...But as the church is subject to Christ, so also let the wives be subject to their husbands in everything. Husbands, love your wives even as Christ also loved the church and gave Himself up for her&rdquo;</strong> (Eph. 5:23-25).</p>
<p>A husband, as the head of the wife, is a symbol of Christ as the Head of the church. Therefore, a wife being subject to her husband is a symbol of the church being subject to Christ, and a husband loving his wife is a symbol of Christ loving the church. Every proper relationship between husband and wife is a manifestation of the story of Christ and the church. Therefore, as husbands and wives, we should be careful to be proper husbands and wives in order to properly manifest the relationship between Christ and the church.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Children and Parents</h2>
<p><strong>1. &ldquo;Children, obey your parents in the Lord, for this is right. &lsquo;Honor your father and mother...that it may be well with you and that you may live long on the earth&rsquo;&rdquo;</strong> (Eph. 6:1-3; see also Col. 3:20; Prov. 30:17).</p>
</h2>
<p>The second human relationship in the Bible is between children and parents. Just as the Bible speaks first of wives and then of husbands when referring to matters concerning husbands and wives, it speaks first of children and then of parents when referring to matters concerning parents and children. Obeying and honoring are the most important matters of a child&rsquo;s behavior toward his parents. This is fitting and pleasing to the Lord. When God first commanded man to honor his father and mother, He added a promise. The apostle says that this is the first commandment with a promise: If we honor our parents, it will be well with us, and we will live long. The earthly blessings of prosperity and longevity are gained by honoring one&rsquo;s parents. Conversely, Proverbs 30:17 says that those who do not honor their parents will lose the sight of their eyes, which means they will not receive light. Children, may this be a warning!</p>
<p><strong>2. &ldquo;Let them first learn to show respect toward their own household and to render a return to their parents&rdquo;</strong> (1 Tim. 5:4).</p>
<p>Children should learn to show respect toward their own household and to render a return to their parents. The gift that parents give their children in raising them should not be despised or forgotten by the children. The children should respect and render a return to their parents. This is pleasing in the sight of God.</p>
<p><strong>3. &ldquo;Fathers, do not provoke your children to anger, but nurture them in the discipline and admonition of the Lord&rdquo;</strong> (Eph. 6:4; see also Col. 3:21).</p>
<p>Typically, fathers are strict with their children to the extent that the children are provoked to anger. Therefore, the Bible teaches that the most important matter for fathers in dealing with their children is not to provoke them to anger. A good father will not make his children angry or cause them to feel wronged. He will make his children happy and nurture them in the discipline and admonition of the Lord. However, it is not right for him to care merely for his children&rsquo;s happiness, neglecting the discipline and admonition of the Lord. Nevertheless, if he uses only the discipline of the Lord to teach them and ignores their feelings, he will be too dry. The secret of being a father is for him to care for his children&rsquo;s happiness and to nurture them in the discipline and admonition of the Lord.</p>
<p><strong>4. &ldquo;Train the young women....to love their children&rdquo;</strong> (Titus 2:4; see also Prov. 13:24; 19:18; 22:6, 15; 29:15, 17).</p>
<p>In a father&rsquo;s treatment of his children, the Bible emphasizes not provoking them to anger and nurturing them in the discipline and admonition of the Lord. In a mother&rsquo;s treatment, however, the emphasis is on love. Mothers can never be successful if they do not love their children. If a family does not have a mother&rsquo;s love, it can never be a good family. Without a mother&rsquo;s love, a family is crippled. Therefore, the young sisters who are mothers must learn to love their children.</p>
<h2 class="head3">A Father and Children Being a Symbol<br />
of God the Father and His Children</h2>
<p><strong>1. &ldquo;The Father has given...that we should be called children of God; and we are&rdquo;</strong> (1 John 3:1, see also v. 2).</p>
<p>A father and his children symbolize God the Father and His children. God the Father loves us and gave us to be called children of God, and we are. He is a Father to us, and we are His children. This relationship is manifested by the mutual relationship and treatment of a father and his children. When we see a proper condition between a father and his children, we should be reminded of our mutual relationship with God the Father as His children.</p>
<p><strong>2. &ldquo;If you...know how to give good gifts to your children, how much more will your Father who is in the heavens give good things&rdquo;</strong> (Matt. 7:11).</p>
<p>The Lord&rsquo;s word in this verse clearly shows that fathers should be the symbol of God the Father. Human fathers know how to give good gifts to their children just as God the Father gives good gifts to us His children.</p><h2 class="head2">Servants and Masters</h2>
<p><strong>1. &ldquo;Slaves, be obedient to those who are your masters according to the flesh with fear and trembling, in singleness of your heart, as to Christ&rdquo;</strong> (Eph. 6:5; see also Col. 3:22-25).</p>
<p>In our households there might be a relationship between master and servants, so the Bible has a specific teaching regarding this matter. When the Bible speaks of the matter of servants and masters, it begins from the bottom and goes up. It speaks of servants first and then masters. Brothers and sisters who are servants should be obedient to their masters with fear and trembling. Their obedience should be in singleness of heart, as to Christ. They should not only serve and honor their master before his face but do everything for their master as to the Lord, as if they are serving the Lord, not man. In this way, they will receive a reward from the Lord.</p>
<p><strong>2. &ldquo;Slaves under the yoke should regard their own masters as worthy of all honor...Those who have believing masters should not despise them, because they are brothers; but rather they should serve them&rdquo;</strong> (1 Tim. 6:1-2; see also Titus 2:9-10; 1 Pet. 2:18).</p>
<p>A servant should give all honor to his master. If the master is a believer, the servant should not despise him, because he is a brother or a sister. They should not leave the position of a servant but rather should serve them. Servants certainly should not be rude to their masters but be loyal and obedient. They should obey not only kind and gentle masters but even crooked ones.</p>
<p><strong>3. &ldquo;Masters, do the same things toward them, giving up your threatening&rdquo;</strong> (Eph. 6:9).</p>
<p>When masters deal with their servants, they should not threaten them. We must remember that both masters and servants are slaves of the Lord in the heavens.</p>
<p><strong>4. &ldquo;Masters, grant to your slaves that which is just and equal&rdquo;</strong> (Col. 4:1).</p>
<p>In their dealings with their servants, masters may not cheat or oppress them. They must be just and equal as the Lord is to us.</p>
<h2 class="head3">Masters and Slaves Being a Symbol<br />
of the Lord and His Slaves</h2>
<p><strong>1. &ldquo;Masters, grant to your slaves that which is just and equal, knowing that you also have a Master in heaven&rdquo;</strong> (Col. 4:1).</p>
<p>The relationship between a master and a servant manifests the relationship between the Lord and His slaves. When we deal with servants, we should remember that we have a Master in heaven. We symbolize Him as the Master, so we cannot make mistakes with regard to our servants lest we symbolize, or manifest, Him incorrectly.</p>
<p><strong>2. &ldquo;Slaves, be obedient to those who are your masters...as to Christ...as slaves of Christ&rdquo;</strong> (Eph. 6:5-6; see also Col. 3:22-24).</p>
<p>Just as masters symbolize Christ as our Master, servants symbolize the believers as the Lord&rsquo;s slaves. Therefore, brothers and sisters who are servants should serve their masters well, as if they are serving the Lord, lest they improperly symbolize, or represent, a slave of the Lord.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Concerning Relatives</h2>
<p><strong>1. &ldquo;If anyone does not provide for his own, and especially for those of his household, he has denied the faith and is worse than an unbeliever&rdquo;</strong> (1 Tim. 5:8, see also v. 16).</p>
<p>Believers should do their best to care for their relatives. They should care for their relatives&rsquo; lack, especially in the matter of money. We should especially do so for those in our own household. If someone in our household has a lack, we should do our best to attend to it. It is reasonable that we should not burden the church or others.</p>
<h2 class="head1">OCCUPATIONS</h2>
<h2 class="head2">The Principle of Work</h2>
<p><strong>1. &ldquo;If anyone does not want to work, neither should he eat&rdquo;</strong> (2 Thes. 3:10, see also vv. 12, 8; 1 Thes. 4:11; Acts 20:34).</p>
<p>A Christian must work, and each must work for himself. He cannot be idle, expecting to eat while being a burden to others. If a Christian does not want to work, neither should he eat. If his hands do not want to move, neither should his mouth.</p>
<p><strong>2. &ldquo;But rather should labor&rdquo;</strong> (Eph. 4:28; see also Titus 3:14, 8).</p>
<p>When Christians work, they must have a proper job. According to the standard of a saint, Christians should not have any job that is dark, immoral, ill-famed, improper, untrue, unclean, illegal, or harmful.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Occupations</h2>
<p><strong>1. &ldquo;Work the ground&rdquo;</strong> (Gen. 3:23; see also 9:20).</p>
<p>It is best if Christians work in nature, producing what is necessary for human living. The first recorded occupation in the Bible that God wants for man is to work the ground. Working the ground is to farm to produce fruit from the earth. It is most beneficial to us and to others.</p>
<p><strong>2. &ldquo;A tender of sheep&rdquo;</strong> (Gen. 4:2; see also 30:31; Exo. 3:1; Amos 1:1).</p>
<p>The second recorded occupation that is pleasing to God in the Bible is the keeping of sheep. Shepherding involves cooperating with nature to produce things from animals that are beneficial to us and others.</p>
<p><strong>3. &ldquo;Fishermen&rdquo;</strong> (Matt. 4:18).</p>
<p>A third occupation recorded in the Bible is fishing. Fishing involves the taking of natural produce from the sea. It also is beneficial to human living.</p>
<p><strong>4. &ldquo;Tentmakers&rdquo;</strong> (Acts 18:3).</p>
<p>A fourth kind of occupation recorded in the Bible is tentmaking. This handcraft combines natural products with labor to produce things that people need.</p>
<p><strong>5. &ldquo;Physician&rdquo;</strong> (Col. 4:14).</p>
<p>According to the Bible, Christians can have additional skills other than producing necessities for human living. The first skilled occupation spoken of in the Bible is that of a physician. Although physicians do not produce necessities for human living, they provide a necessary skill to benefit humans.</p>
<p><strong>6. &ldquo;Slaves&rdquo;</strong> (Eph. 6:5).</p>
<p>Even being a slave is considered as a kind of occupation for Christians in the Bible. It is a kind of skill, and it is beneficial to people.</p>
<p>According to the principle of a skill, occupations involving teaching, nursing, or laboring are beneficial to man. A Christian&rsquo;s job or occupation must be necessary or beneficial to man.</p><h2 class="head2">The Matter of Partnerships</h2>
<p><strong>1. &ldquo;Do not become dissimilarly yoked with unbelievers&rdquo;</strong> (2 Cor. 6:14; see also Deut. 22:10; 2 Chron. 20:35-37).</p>
<p>Believers may not form business partnerships with unbelievers because God&rsquo;s Word says that believers should not be dissimilarly yoked. Just as God does not allow an ox and a donkey to be yoked together to plow the field, He does not allow a believer to form business partnerships with unbelievers. Since the dispositions, interests, and human goals of a believer and an unbeliever are completely different, it is difficult for a believer to practice the will of God and avoid being contaminated and affected by such a dissimilar relationship, causing him to offend God and withdraw from God. God cannot bless such a partnership. For the benefit of the believer, He will usually destroy it in His discipline. A good example of this kind of discipling can be seen in the case of Jehoshaphat, who formed a partnership to build ships with Ahaziah, who did not want God. Even though Jehoshaphat was a God-seeker, God destroyed the ships that were built.</p>
<h2 class="head2">What to Do with Profit</h2>
<p><strong>1. &ldquo;Have something to share with him who has need&rdquo;</strong> (Eph. 4:28).</p>
<p>When believers have a job or a business, they should not hoard their money but should share with brothers and sisters who have need. Hoarding causes us to suffer loss; sharing causes us to have a reward and brings in more of God&rsquo;s blessing.</p>
<p><strong>2. &ldquo;These hands have ministered to my needs and to those who are with me&rdquo;</strong> (Acts 20:34).</p>
<p>Paul worked to supply not only his own needs but also the needs of his co-workers. This shows that when a believer works, his work is not only for his own living but also for God&rsquo;s work. Thus, when he makes a profit, he should supply God&rsquo;s work and God&rsquo;s workers. Every believer who loves the Lord and lives to the Lord loves to do this and should do this. If a believer keeps his profit and allows the work of God to suffer loss and difficulty, he is wrong. May the Lord have mercy on us and save us.</p>
<h2 class="head1">MAKING FRIENDS</h2>
<h2 class="head2">The Principle of Making Friends</h2>
<p><strong>1. &ldquo;Do not become dissimilarly yoked with unbelievers, for what partnership do righteousness and lawlessness have? Or what fellowship does light have with darkness?...Or what part does a believer have with an unbeliever?&rdquo;</strong> (2 Cor. 6:14-15).</p>
<p>The first principle in the matter of making friends is that believers may not make friends with unbelievers. We are righteousness, light, of Christ, and the temple of God; unbelievers are lawlessness, darkness, of Satan, and idol-worshippers. The nature, use, and owner of a believer and unbeliever are completely opposite. Therefore, we must be separated from them. We should not have fellowship with them so that we can have fellowship with God and become sons and daughters who are pleasing to God.</p>
<p><strong>2. &ldquo;Evil companionships corrupt good morals&rdquo;; &ldquo;Evil pursues sinners&rdquo;</strong> (1 Cor. 15:33; Prov. 13:21; see also 18:24).</p>
<p>The second principle related to believers&rsquo; making of friends is not to have evil companionships. While we cannot be friends with unbelievers, we must be careful and not make friends loosely even with a believer. If we make friends loosely without discernment, it will be difficult to avoid evil influences; thus, we can corrupt ourselves and suffer loss.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Kind of Friends That We Should Make</h2>
<p><strong>1. &ldquo;There is a true friend that sticks closer than a brother&rdquo;</strong> (Prov. 18:24; see also John 11:11; 15:13-15).</p>
<p>Our first friend should be the Lord Himself. He is closer to us than a brother. We should fellowship with Him and be His close friend.</p>
<p><strong>2. &ldquo;With those who call on the Lord out of a pure heart&rdquo;</strong> (2 Tim. 2:22; see also 3 John 14).</p>
<p>Our second friend should be one who loves the Lord with a pure heart. We should fellowship much with him and pursue the Lord together.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Patterns of Friendship</h2>
<p><strong>1. &ldquo;The friend of God&rdquo;</strong> (James 2:23; see also 2 Chron. 20:7; Isa. 41:8; Gen. 18).</p>
<p>Abraham is the best pattern in the matter of making friends. He fellowshipped with God and was the friend of God. God also considered him as a friend, so he was called the friend of God. In Genesis 18 Abraham entertained God just as a friend would receive another friend, especially when he walked with God to send Him away.</p>
<p><strong>2. &ldquo;Intimate counsel with God&rdquo;</strong> (Job 29:4).</p>
<p>Job is also a good pattern in making friends. He was an intimate friend of God from the days of his prime.</p>
<p><strong>3. &ldquo;Feared God and turned away from evil&rdquo;</strong> (Job 1:1; see also 2:11-13; 42:7-10).</p>
<p>Job&rsquo;s three friends made friends with Job, who feared God and turned away from evil. As a result, they gained a deeper knowledge of God because of Job. This should be a pattern to us in making friends.</p>
<p><strong>4. &ldquo;Fully followed Jehovah&rdquo;</strong> (Num. 32:12; see also 14:6-10).</p>
<p>Caleb and Joshua were friends who both fully followed Jehovah. Young believers should especially follow their example in making friends.</p>
<p><strong>5. &ldquo;A man according to My heart&rdquo;</strong> (Acts 13:22; see also 1 Sam. 18:1-3; 19:1-7; 20:12-17; 2 Sam. 1:26).</p>
<p>Jonathan did not care for his relationship with his father or for his father&rsquo;s fleshly will. He made friends with David, a man according to God&rsquo;s heart. As a result, he and his descendants were not affected by his father; rather, they were blessed. This is a pattern that we should follow in making friends.</p>
<p><strong>6. Making friends with overcomers in a wasteland, like Daniel and his three friends</strong> (see Dan. 1:6-17; 3:8-30).</p>
<p>Daniel&rsquo;s three friends made friends with Daniel, who was an overcomer in a wasteland. As a result, they were a shining testimony and spoke for the Lord in the wasteland, and their testimony and words continue to shine throughout the ages. This is a good pattern for making friends in the wasteland in which the church exists today.</p><h2 class="head1">FOOD AND DRINK</h2>
<h2 class="head2">Before the Fall</h2>
<p><strong>1. &ldquo;Every herb that produces seed...and every tree which has fruit that produces seed&rdquo;</strong> (Gen. 1:29).</p>
<p>Before the fall God ordained that man eat herbs and the fruit of trees. Man ate vegetables and could not eat meat.</p>
<h2 class="head2">After the Fall</h2>
<p><strong>1. &ldquo;Every moving thing that lives shall be food for you; just as I gave you the green herb&rdquo;</strong> (Gen. 9:3).</p>
<p>After the fall of man God ordained that animals as well as vegetables could be food for man. In other words, after the fall both meat and vegetables could be eaten. The purpose of eating is to maintain life. The meat that we eat as food comes from the killing of animals, and in the Bible this symbolizes Christ being killed that we might obtain life and live. Therefore, in brief, meat symbolizes redemption through the shedding of blood. While meat symbolizes redemption through the shedding of blood, vegetables symbolize works without the shedding of blood. Before man fell, man could eat only vegetables to maintain his life, symbolizing that man was without sin and could live before God without the shedding of blood. But after the fall and the entrance of sin (Rom. 5:12), man needs the shedding of blood for redemption in order to live before God. This need is symbolized by God telling man to eat meat after the fall.</p>
<p>In contrast, Satan tells people to eat only vegetables. Satan&rsquo;s hidden and crafty intention in telling people to eat only vegetables is to cause them to reject the requirement of the shedding of blood for redemption and to instead rely on their works in order to live. (Alas, vegetarians do not have this realization!) Satan influences what people eat by promoting self-denial. Those who are tricked by Satan into being vegetarians not only practice self-denial but also rely on self-denial. For example, Buddhism emphasizes self-denial and relies on self-denial. Consequently, Buddhism also emphasizes and promotes vegetarianism. Once we see Satan&rsquo;s intention in this matter, we should not be influenced by the thought or practice of vegetarianism; instead, as those who eat meat, we should declare that we are sinners in need of the blood that Christ shed for our redemption.</p>
<p><strong>2. &ldquo;Its blood, you shall not eat&rdquo;</strong> (Gen. 9:4).</p>
<p>Although God ordained that man could eat meat after the fall, He did not allow man to eat blood. Blood is needed for the redemption of human life because life is in the blood (Lev. 17:10-11). When the Lord Jesus came, He told us to drink His blood because only His blood redeems us and enables us to obtain His life (John 6:53-56; Matt. 26:27-28). According to typology, blood redeems man, but in reality only the blood of Jesus can take away the sin of man (Heb. 9:12; 10:4). Therefore, we can eat only the blood of the Lord Jesus. God commands man not to eat blood in order to show that the shedding of blood is for the redemption of sin and to show that only the blood of the Lord Jesus can take away man&rsquo;s sin.</p>
<h2 class="head2">In the Dispensation of Law</h2>
<p><strong>1. Man could eat both vegetables and meat</strong> (Lev. 10:12-14; Deut. 12:17-18, 20-22).</p>
<p>In the dispensation of the law, man&rsquo;s failure to keep God&rsquo;s requirements exposed his weakness, sin, and inability to be justified by works of law, showing that, in reality, man could be redeemed and live before God only through the shedding of blood. This is signified by God telling people to eat meat.</p>
<p><strong>2. Animals were divided into clean and unclean, edible and inedible.</strong></p>
<p>Even though God told His people to eat the meat of animals in the dispensation of the law, He also told them to discern between clean animals that could be eaten and unclean animals that could not be eaten. According to Acts 11:5-12, this signifies that God wants His people to discern between clean and unclean people in their relationships and dealings with others. Clean animals represent people with whom His people can deal. These include animals that have divided hooves and that chew the cud (Lev. 11:2-8, 26-28), fish that have fins and scales (vv. 9-12), birds that eat vegetables rather than meat (vv. 13-19), and insects with wings that leap up and fly (vv. 20-25, 29-38, 41-44). All of these clean animals also had to be living (vv. 39-40).</p>
<p>According to typology, animals with divided hooves represent people who have discernment in their walk (cf. 2 Cor. 6:17; Eph. 5:11), and animals that chew the cud represent people who continuously consider the Word of God (cf. Luke 1:29). Fish that move through the water with fins and that are protected from the water with scales signify people who live in and move through the world without being penetrated by the world (cf. John 17:15-17; Rom. 12:2). Birds that do not eat dead meat but rather seeds of life represent people who touch matters of life rather than matters of death. Insects that have wings to fly above the earth and legs that can leap above the earth signify people who can transcend the elements of the world. A living animal represents a person who has life before God. Only people represented by these types of clean animals are considered clean before God. The people of God should deal only with such people.</p>
<p><strong>3. Blood still not being eaten</strong> (Lev. 17:10-15; Deut. 12:16, 23-25).</p>
<p>In the dispensation of the law God did not allow man to eat blood, signifying that even in the dispensation of the law, God still required the shedding of blood for redemption in type.</p><h2 class="head2">In the Dispensation of Grace</h2>
<p><strong>1. &ldquo;Teachings of demons...abstaining from foods, which God has created to be partaken of with thanksgiving by those who believe and have full knowledge of the truth&rdquo;</strong> (1 Tim. 4:1-3).</p>
<p>In the dispensation of grace we can eat meat and vegetables. Abstaining from meat is a teaching of demons. Everything created by God is good and can be partaken of with thanksgiving by those who believe and have full knowledge of the truth. If we partake with thanksgiving, nothing need be refused, because it is sanctified through the Word of God and intercession.</p>
<p><em>Sanctified</em> in 1 Timothy 4:5 means that something is separated to be holy to God for His use. Everything that God originally created lost its position of belonging to God and being for His use because of the fall. The Word of God, however, tells us that these things have been recovered in God&rsquo;s eyes through the redemption of Christ and that He has given them to us. Since we believe and understand the Word of God, we can receive these things with thanksgiving and petitions. Thus, they are sanctified through the Word of God by our thanksgiving and intercession, and they have been brought back to God for His use. He uses them to feed those who belong to Him and who live to Him. Since we are sanctified and live to God, these things are also sanctified and brought back to God for His use. For example, bread in the bakery is common. If we take it and give thanks for it according to God&rsquo;s Word, it is sanctified. This sanctification is not natural; it occurs through the Word of God and intercession. Through the fall of man, the rightful position of things for God&rsquo;s use was lost. Through the redemption of Christ, however, they can be sanctified and recovered for God&rsquo;s use through the Word, which speaks of this recovery and of His promises to give us these things, and intercession, which is petition based on the Word that we believe. These things can be sanctified for God&rsquo;s use because of Christ&rsquo;s redemption and recovery of them, because of God&rsquo;s promises related to them, and because of our prayer and intercession for them. Thus, we can eat and enjoy them unto God.</p>
<p><strong>2. The ordinances in Leviticus 11 being abolished in the New Testament</strong> (Acts 10:9-16).</p>
<p>The ordinances in Leviticus 11 are related to the law of the old covenant. They were for the Israelites under the law. They were abolished in the dispensation of grace of the new covenant. Christians under grace today do not need to keep these ordinances. Even though spiritually, according to law, we do not need to keep those ordinances, physically, for the sake of health, there is some benefit in limiting our eating of foods that are considered unclean.</p>
<p><strong>3. &ldquo;Abstain from...what is strangled and blood&rdquo;</strong> (Acts 15:20, see also v. 29).</p>
<p>In the dispensation of grace we still cannot eat blood. Since the blood of a strangled animal has not flowed out, it remains within the animal. Consequently, it is forbidden. God does not allow us to eat blood in the dispensation of grace so that we can manifest to the universe that only the blood of the Lord Jesus can take away our sin. Spiritually speaking, we should eat only His blood, which is symbolized by not eating things which are strangled and blood.</p>
<p><strong>4. &ldquo;The things which the Gentiles sacrifice, they sacrifice to demons and not to God; and I do not want you to become those who have fellowship with demons. You cannot drink the Lord&rsquo;s cup and the demons&rsquo; cup; you cannot partake of the Lord&rsquo;s table and of the demons&rsquo; table&rdquo;</strong> (1 Cor. 10:20-21; see also Acts 15:20, 29).</p>
<p>Idol sacrifices touch demons, and as those who belong to God, we should not eat food sacrificed to idols. We cannot drink the Lord&rsquo;s cup and eat the Lord&rsquo;s table, breaking bread and fellowshipping with the Lord, and at the same time drink the demons&rsquo; cup and eat the demons&rsquo; table, eating idol sacrifices and fellowshipping with demons.</p>
<p><strong>5. &ldquo;It is not that which enters into the mouth that defiles the man&rdquo;</strong> (Matt. 15:11; see also Rom. 14:2, 14, 23).</p>
<p>In God&rsquo;s eyes nothing is unclean; therefore, what enters a person&rsquo;s mouth cannot defile him. Everything can be eaten. If some are weak in the faith and think that something is unclean, it is unclean to them, and they should not eat it. If one has doubts and eats without faith, he will be condemned because everything not done in faith is sin. However, if we are strong and have faith, we can eat anything. Nothing will be unclean to us.</p>
<p><strong>6. &ldquo;Food will not commend us to God; neither if we do not eat are we lacking, nor if we eat do we abound&rdquo;</strong> (1 Cor. 8:8).</p>
<p>In the dispensation of grace food is not a requirement for being commended to God; therefore, eating or not eating a certain item is not important.</p>
<p><strong>7. &ldquo;The kingdom of God is not eating and drinking, but righteousness and peace and joy in the Holy Spirit&rdquo;</strong> (Rom. 14:17).</p>
<p>We should not be too particular in our eating, because the kingdom of God is not eating and drinking but righteousness and peace and joy in the Holy Spirit. Those who live in the kingdom of God today should not emphasize the matter of eating but should emphasize the matter of spiritual life. This is pleasing to God.</p>
<p><strong>8. &ldquo;Whether you eat or drink...do all to the glory of God&rdquo;</strong> (1 Cor. 10:31).</p>
<p>Although there is no law today concerning what we can eat, our eating and drinking should be to the glory of God. Our eating and drinking should glorify God. If it does not glorify God, our eating and drinking can cause problems.</p>
<p><strong>9. &ldquo;Do not break down the work of God for the sake of food. All things indeed are clean, but it is evil for a man to eat while stumbling others. It is good not to eat meat nor drink wine nor to do anything by which your brother stumbles&rdquo;</strong> (Rom. 14:20-21, see also v. 15; 1 Cor. 8:9-13).</p>
<p>Our eating and drinking must not wound others or cause God&rsquo;s work to be hindered or destroyed. We should not eat or drink anything that stumbles the brothers or harms the work of God.</p>
<p><strong>10. &ldquo;Do not be drunk with wine, in which is dissoluteness&rdquo;</strong> (Eph. 5:18; see also 1 Tim. 5:23).</p>
<p>Although the Bible does not prohibit us from drinking wine, it does prohibit us from <em>being drunk</em> with wine. It is difficult not to become drunk with wine when we drink it. If we do not want to be drunk with wine, it is better not to drink wine. If we do not want to fall into a pit, the safest thing is to not go near its edge. When we are near the edge, it is easy to fall into a pit. Likewise, when we contact wine, it is easy to become drunk. Being drunk with wine causes dissoluteness, so we should avoid it.</p><h2 class="head3">Food and Drink Being a Symbol of Christ<br />
and the Word of God<br />
as the Food and Drink of Life</h2>
<p><strong>1. &ldquo;I am the bread of life; he who comes to Me shall by no means hunger, and he who believes into Me shall by no means ever thirst&rdquo;; &ldquo;The bread which I will give is My flesh, given for the life of the world&rdquo;; &ldquo;He who eats My flesh and drinks My blood has eternal life&rdquo;; &ldquo;If anyone thirsts, let him come to Me and drink&rdquo;; &ldquo;Whoever drinks of the water that I will give him shall by no means thirst forever&rdquo;</strong> (John 6:35, 51, 54; 7:37; 4:14).</p>
<p>Everything in the universe has a symbolic meaning. Most things symbolize God&rsquo;s salvation in Christ. This is not a coincidence; it is God&rsquo;s arrangement. God arranged for the visible things in the universe to be symbols of spiritual things. Different human relationships are such symbols, and even items like food and clothing are symbols. Food and drink symbolize Christ as our food and drink of life. Christ said that He is the bread of life who satisfies man&rsquo;s hunger. His living water also causes man to by no means thirst forever. Through His death on the cross, He gave Himself and flowed out His life as living water to man. If a person is willing to come to Him, believe into Him, and receive Him, which is to eat and drink Him, he will be given the satisfaction of life so that he will by no means hunger or thirst forever. Every time we eat or drink, we should realize that the Lord is the bread of life for us to eat and the living water for us to drink and enjoy, causing us to be full and satisfied.</p>
<p><strong>2. &ldquo;Man shall not live on bread alone, but on every word that proceeds out through the mouth of God&rdquo;; &ldquo;Your words were found and I ate them&rdquo;</strong> (Matt. 4:4; Jer. 15:16).</p>
<p>Food symbolizes the word of God as the food of our spiritual life. We must learn to live not on bread alone but on God&rsquo;s word. We should eat the word of God as food. Every time we eat physical food and our body gains nourishment, we should be reminded of how our spirit needs the word of God to nourish it.</p>
<h2 class="head1">CLOTHING</h2>
<h2 class="head2">Before the Fall</h2>
<p><strong>1. &ldquo;Both the man and his wife were naked and were not ashamed&rdquo;</strong> (Gen. 2:25).</p>
<p>Before the fall man did not wear clothing, but he was not ashamed. Although he was naked, he was without sin; therefore, he did not need clothing to cover any shame.</p>
<h2 class="head2">After the Fall</h2>
<p><strong>1. &ldquo;The eyes of both of them were opened, and they knew that they were naked; and they sewed fig leaves together and made loincloths for themselves&rdquo;</strong> (Gen. 3:7).</p>
</h2>
<p>After he sinned, man was ashamed of his nakedness. Therefore, he felt a need for clothing to cover his shame. Although he used leaves of a tree to make loincloths to cover his shame, these leaves could not cover the shame. Sinful man always tries to cover his shame with his own actions and behavior, but such a covering is not possible through human actions.</p>
<p><strong>2. &ldquo;Jehovah God made coats of skin for Adam and for his wife and clothed them&rdquo;</strong> (Gen. 3:21).</p>
<p>The loincloths of leaves made by fallen man could not cover them, so God came and covered their shame with the skins of killed animals&mdash;sacrifices&mdash;as clothes. This signifies that even though fallen man cannot cover his shame through his own actions and behavior, God can cover our shame with the killed Lamb&mdash;Christ&mdash;as righteousness.</p>
<p><strong>3. &ldquo;Covered the nakedness&rdquo;</strong> (Gen. 9:23).</p>
<p>In principle, after the fall God wants man to wear clothing to cover the shame of his nakedness. Therefore, any clothing or style that covers the body well is proper. Clothes that expose the chest, shoulders, feet, and legs do not correspond to God&rsquo;s desire for man to be covered.</p>
<h2 class="head2">In the Dispensation of Law</h2>
<p><strong>1. &ldquo;Neither shall you go up by steps to My altar, so that your nakedness may not be uncovered on it&rdquo;</strong> (Exo. 20:26).</p>
<p>In the dispensation of the law God continued to tell man to wear clothing in order to cover his shame and to not expose his body. God did not allow the Israelites to use steps to go up to His altar so that the nakedness of their lower body would not be exposed. As sinners, we need to wear clothes to cover ourselves at all times.</p>
<p><strong>2. &ldquo;A woman shall not put on a man&rsquo;s clothing, nor shall a man wear a woman&rsquo;s garment; for everyone who does these things is an abomination to Jehovah your God&rdquo;</strong> (Deut. 22:5).</p>
<p>God did not allow the women among His people, the Israelites, to wear men&rsquo;s clothing or the men to wear women&rsquo;s clothing. Great confusion occurs when the protection of the difference between men&rsquo;s and women&rsquo;s clothing is eliminated. This encourages adultery, so it is an abomination to God. Today most women dress like men. In principle, this is not pleasing to God.</p>
<p><strong>3. &ldquo;You shall not wear clothing of mixed materials, of wool and linen together&rdquo;</strong> (Deut. 22:11).</p>
<p>In the dispensation of the law God did not allow the children of Israel to wear clothing made of different materials, such as wool and linen. Wool comes from the animal life, and linen comes from the plant life. This signifies that God does not want our acts of righteousness, which are symbolized by clothing, to be something from Christ and something from Adam, that is, a mixture of a spiritual and fleshly living. God does not want us to live by such a mixture.</p>
<p><strong>4. &ldquo;Make for themselves fringes on the borders of their garments...and to put on the fringe of each border a cord of blue...so that when you see it you will remember all the commandments of Jehovah and do them, so that you do not seek after your own heart and your own eyes, according to which you committed fornication; that you shall...be holy to your God&rdquo;</strong> (Num. 15:38-40).</p>
<p>In the Old Testament God told the Israelites to attach a fringe to the borders of their clothing and to put a cord of blue on the fringe. Blue is the color of the heavens. A cord of blue on the fringe of their garment surrounded their legs and signified that their steps were under the heavenly limitation. When they saw the cord of blue, they remembered the commandments of God, and they also remembered to not follow their own heart and their own eyes to commit fornication, causing them to be holy to God.</p>
<p><strong>5. The garments of the priests</strong> (Exo. 28:1-43).</p>
<p>The garments that God ordered the priests to wear in Exodus 28 were completely different from the clothing of the people of Israel. Every item of the priestly clothing has spiritual significance.</p><h2 class="head2">In the Dispensation of Grace</h2>
<p><strong>1. &ldquo;Women adorn themselves in proper clothing with modesty and sobriety, not with braided hair and gold or pearls or costly clothing&rdquo;; &ldquo;Let your adorning not be the outward plaiting of hair and putting on of gold or clothing with garments, but the hidden man of the heart in the incorruptible adornment of a meek and quiet spirit&rdquo;</strong> (1 Tim. 2:9; 1 Pet. 3:3-5; see also Gen. 35:4; Exo. 33:5-6; Isa. 3:16-25).</p>
<p>The verses from 1 Timothy and 1 Peter clearly show that in the dispensation of grace, God wants us to pay attention to inward spiritual virtues rather than outward beauty and costly ornamentation. These verses are specifically directed toward the sisters because they pay more attention to matters of adornment.</p>
<p>While God does not give specific instructions on how to dress, two principles are presented: our clothing must be proper, and our clothing must not be extravagant. I dare not say that there is a specific standard for what is proper, but I believe that we each have a sense of whether or not our clothing is proper. This is marvelous! Regardless of where we are or what we are doing, we have an inward sense of whether or not our clothing is proper. With regard to the matter of extravagance, God is a little more specific. He counts gold, jewelry, and costly items as extravagant and does not allow us to wear them. While it may be more difficult in determining whether or not a particular garment is extravagant, we each have an inward sense of what is extravagant and what is not. Under the new covenant God does not give us dead ordinance after dead ordinance concerning every matter. Instead, He imparts His living law of life inside of us so that we know what to do with respect to every matter (Heb. 8:10). May we be willing to follow His inward leading in the matter of clothing and adornment.</p>
<p>The clothing that we wear is very much related to our coming before God. When Jacob and his family were going to Bethel to worship God, they took off their earrings and put away their idols. This shows that jewelry, like idols, can hinder us from approaching God. Adornment truly is an idol worn on our body. If we want to approach God, we must take off the idol of adornment&mdash;jewelry&mdash;just as we remove other idols.</p>
<p>The golden calf that the children of Israel worshipped in the wilderness was made from their jewelry. Therefore, God told them to take their ornaments off so that He would know what to do to the children of Israel. The ornaments we wear often become the idols we worship. This makes it difficult for God to know how to deal with us. If we want the Lord&rsquo;s leading, we must take all the ornaments off of our body just as the children of Israel did.</p>
<p>Isaiah 3 says that the city of Zion was punished because the daughters of Zion were haughty in their adornment. This shows that haughty, elegant adornment causes God to punish us. This should be a warning to those who are haughty in their elegant adornment.</p>
<p><strong>2. &ldquo;When you fast, anoint your head and wash your face&rdquo;</strong> (Matt. 6:17; see also Eccl. 9:8).</p>
<p>Although we should not be extravagant in our adornment, we should be clean and neat in our clothing. Even when we fast, the Lord wants us to brush our hair and wash our face. Even Ecclesiastes, which mainly speaks of vanity, says that our clothes must be clean and our hair combed. Rumpled clothes and messy hair are not spiritual. We should not dress in rumpled clothing or neglect to brush our hair in order to obtain spiritual praise by appearing to be fasting. This is false spirituality. This should be condemned. If we are truly spiritual, we will be very normal in our adornment. We will be neat and clean, not extravagant or messy.</p>
<p><strong>3. &ldquo;Every man praying or prophesying with his head covered disgraces his head. But every woman praying or prophesying with her head uncovered disgraces her head&rdquo;</strong> (1 Cor. 11:4-5).</p>
<p>According to the Lord&rsquo;s word through the apostle, a brother should not cover his head when he prays or speaks; that is, he should not wear a hat. However, if a sister prays or speaks a word, she should cover her head. This matter is covered in chapter 19, &ldquo;Head Covering.&rdquo;</p>
<p><strong>4. &ldquo;If a woman has long hair, it is a glory to her, because her long hair has been given to her for a covering&rdquo;; &ldquo;It is shameful for a woman to have her hair cut off or to be shaved&rdquo;</strong> (1 Cor. 11:15, 6).</p>
<p>According to God&rsquo;s ordination sisters should have long hair. Long hair is the sisters&rsquo; glory. Therefore, the sisters should not cut or shave off their hair. On the contrary, they should be ashamed of cutting or shaving off their hair. Today&rsquo;s fashion, however, surprisingly considers short hair beautiful. This is the opposite of what the Bible says. Sisters should not follow today&rsquo;s fashion. Of course, the styling and perming of hair definitely should not be done. A sister who fears and loves the Lord is not without a sense that these things offend the Lord. No sister who pursues the Lord with a pure heart can style and perm her hair with a peaceful heart. These things are not pleasing to the Lord and are not a sign of fearing the Lord. May the Lord save the sisters from fashions that are contrary to His will, and may their hair grow according to His will.</p>
<p><strong>5. &ldquo;If a man has long hair, it is a dishonor to him&rdquo;</strong> (1 Cor. 11:14).</p>
<p>It is a glory for sisters to have long hair, but it is a shame for brothers to have long hair. Sisters have long hair because their head should be covered. Brothers should not have long hair because they are the head. This is God&rsquo;s ordination, and the sense from our human nature also confirms this. When we see a man with long hair, we feel uncomfortable, and when we see a woman with very short hair, we feel equally uncomfortable. These feelings are spontaneous reactions, and we should give heed to them.</p><h2 class="head3">Clothing Being a Symbol of Christ<br />
as the Believers&rsquo; Righteousness<br />
and the Righteousnesses of the Believers</h2>
<p><strong>1. &ldquo;He has clothed me with the garments of salvation, / He has wrapped me with the robe of righteousness&rdquo;</strong> (Isa. 61:10; see also Luke 15:22; 1 Cor. 1:30).</p>
<p>God has clothed us with the garments of salvation and wrapped us with the robe of righteousness. Clothing us with salvation and wrapping us with righteousness refer to the same thing. The garment of salvation is the robe of righteousness, and the robe of righteousness is the garment of salvation. God&rsquo;s righteousness as salvation has been put on us like a garment. Consequently, clothing in the Bible symbolizes righteousness. It symbolizes Christ as our righteousness, and it also symbolizes our righteous deeds. Food symbolizes Christ as our inward supply for our life, and clothing symbolizes Christ as our outward righteousness to cover our shame. Christ inwardly satisfies us and outwardly makes us pleasing to God. God gave Christ to us to eat as the bread of life for our satisfaction, just as the loving father killed the fattened calf to feed the prodigal son for his happiness. He also gave Christ to us as the robe of righteousness to put on so that we could be acceptable to Him, just as the loving father put the best robe on the prodigal son so that he could be beautiful before his father. The loving father prepared the fattened calf for his son inwardly and the best robe for his son outwardly, and God prepared Christ as life for us inwardly and Christ as righteousness for us outwardly.</p>
<p>Because God tells man to eat meat in order to manifest his need for the redemption of Christ, Satan causes man to abstain from eating meat to express his refusal of the need for the redemption of Christ. In a same way, because God wants man to wear clothes to manifest his need for Christ as righteousness, Satan causes man to be naked to express his rejection of Christ as righteousness. Demons who possess people often cause them to be naked (cf. Mark 5:15), and Satan also operates in people&rsquo;s hearts and creates a desire within them to bare their chests and shoulders. All the fashions that expose the body come from Satan&rsquo;s operation. His hidden intent is to cause man to reject Christ as his righteousness. Alas, many brothers and sisters who have received Christ as their righteousness follow the fashions of Satan that expose much of their body. In the matter of their clothing, they do not properly manifest their need for and their gaining of Christ as their righteousness. May the Lord show us that both food and clothing can be positive symbols of Christ. May He also show us that Satan can use both food and clothing to manifest contrary, hidden, and negative symbols. May the Lord save us from Satan&rsquo;s hidden, contrary, and negative purposes so that we may match His positive intentions.</p>
<p><strong>2. &ldquo;The fine linen is the righteousnesses of the saints&rdquo;</strong> (Rev. 19:8; see also Matt. 22:11; Rev. 7:14; Isa. 64:6).</p>
<p>Revelation 19:8 clearly associates clothing with righteousness. The fine linen garment that the bride of Christ will wear is the righteousnesses of the saints. This fine linen is not the righteousness of Christ but our righteous acts through the Holy Spirit. The righteousness of Christ causes us to be saved, but our righteousnesses cause us to overcome. Every saint should have two kinds of righteousness and wear two kinds of clothing. The first kind of righteousness is Christ as our righteousness, which justifies us before God. Christ Himself is a robe of righteousness that makes us worthy to be God&rsquo;s children. This righteousness is related to our salvation. The second kind is the righteousness that relates to our acts through the Holy Spirit, which makes us acceptable before Christ. Our righteousnesses in the Holy Spirit become a garment that makes us worthy of being the bride of Christ. This righteousness is related to our overcoming. Christ as our righteousness makes us worthy of coming before God. Our righteousnesses by the Holy Spirit make us worthy of being presented to Christ. The righteousnesses of the Holy Spirit are a fine linen garment that we can wear before Christ; this is the wedding garment that we need in order to attend Christ&rsquo;s wedding feast. If we have Christ only as our righteousness but not the righteousnesses through the Holy Spirit, we will be saved, but we will not overcome. While we will be worthy of being the children of God and of enjoying the blessing of His house, we will not be worthy of being the bride of Christ and of enjoying the blessing of His wedding feast. If we want to be worthy of being the bride of Christ and of enjoying the blessing of His wedding feast, we must have the righteousnesses that come through the Holy Spirit. These righteousnesses are not something that we have in ourselves. Our own righteousness is like a filthy garment and cannot be brought before God and Christ. These righteousnesses come out of our living in the Holy Spirit by the life of Christ, that is, by Christ Himself. Such a wedding garment is bright and clean because of the blood of the Lamb. When we have such a garment, we are worthy of being the bride of Christ and of being presented to Christ.</p>
<p>Before God we should have one garment, and before Christ we should have another. The garment that we should have before God is Christ Himself as our righteousness. We receive this garment when we believe. This garment is objective. The garment that we should have before Christ is the righteousnesses that come out of our living the life of Christ through the Holy Spirit. We live out this garment after we believe. This garment is subjective. Since these two garments are related to salvation and overcoming, we cannot ignore them. Therefore, when we pay attention to the matter of clothing, we should consider the significance of these two garments.</p><h2 class="head1">CONCERNING MONEY</h2>
<h2 class="head2">The Position of Money</h2>
<p><strong>1. &ldquo;Cannot serve God and mammon&rdquo;</strong> (Matt. 6:24).</p>
<p>The Lord Jesus said that we cannot serve God and mammon, which is money. The Lord&rsquo;s word shows that money stands in a position that is against God. Satan is God&rsquo;s enemy; he is against God. Money is in the same position as Satan in its opposition to God. Often money is the incarnation of Satan. It works for Satan, causing people to leave God, reject God, and oppose God. It even usurps God&rsquo;s position in man. There are many who treasure money as if it were a god. Money is truly God&rsquo;s enemy; it is a source of opposition to God. It is no wonder that the Lord Jesus said that we cannot serve God and money.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Nature of Money</h2>
<p><strong>1. &ldquo;Mammon of unrighteousness&rdquo;</strong> (Luke 16:9).</p>
<p>The Lord calls money the mammon of unrighteousness. The unrighteousness of money is not related to its being obtained unrighteously through unrighteous means; rather, its unrighteousness is related to its very nature. There was no money in the garden of Eden, and there will be no money in the New Jerusalem. Therefore, money is not of God but of Satan. It was invented by Satan, and it is promoted among fallen mankind. Its nature before God is completely incompatible with every aspect of God, so in God&rsquo;s eyes its very nature is unrighteousness.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Curse of Money</h2>
<p><strong>1. &ldquo;Deceitfulness of riches&rdquo;</strong> (Matt. 13:22).</p>
<p>While money itself is unrighteousness, it also is a curse to man because of its deceitfulness. It is difficult to find anything in the world more deceitful than money. The deceitfulness of money is powerful. We should be warned.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Vanity of Money</h2>
<p><strong>1. &ldquo;It is gone...like an eagle that flies&rdquo;; &ldquo;The uncertainty of riches&rdquo;; &ldquo;It fails&rdquo;</strong> (Prov. 23:5; 1 Tim. 6:17; Luke 16:9).</p>
<p>God says that money is vain and uncertain. It can grow wings and fly away. Money is uncertain, and it will fail. These verses should remind us not to be cheated by money or consider it as being reliable. If we consider it as being something that is reliable, we will be cheated pitifully with vanity.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Believers and Money</h2>
<p><strong>1. &ldquo;Let your way of life be without the love of money&rdquo;</strong> (Heb. 13:5).</p>
<p>Money bewitches people, causing them to love it. Believers, however, must be without the love of money. Money bewitches people because it cheats people. But if we have seen through its deception, how can it bewitch us into loving it? Knowing that it is in a position that is opposed to God, that its nature is unrighteousness, and that it cheats men with empty results, how can we still love and long for money?</p>
<p><strong>2. &ldquo;Watch and guard yourself from all covetousness&rdquo;</strong> (Luke 12:15, see also vv. 16-34).</p>
<p>Believers should also watch and guard themselves with regard to money lest they be covetous. If we want to guard ourselves from covetousness, we should not be like the foolish rich man who depended on money, not on God. God, who feeds the birds of the air and arrays the lilies in the field, regards us as more important than these birds and flowers. If we, therefore believe that He will care for all our needs in our daily living, we will not worry about clothing and food, and we will be free from all covetousness.</p>
<p><strong>3. &ldquo;Store up for yourselves treasures in heaven...For where your treasure is, there will your heart be also...No one can serve two masters...You cannot serve God and mammon&rdquo;</strong> (Matt. 6:20-21, 24).</p>
<p>The basic attitude of every believer should be not to love money. If this is our basic attitude, we will not covet when we do not have money, and we will not hold on to money when we have it. Thus, we will store up treasures in heaven. Every believer should store up treasures in heaven because where our treasure is, there our heart will be. If we want our heart to be in heaven, we must store up treasures in heaven. In addition, no one can serve two masters. We cannot serve God and serve money. We must not keep our money in our hands but instead send it to heaven.</p>
<p><strong>4. &ldquo;Nor to set their hope on the uncertainty of riches...Be ready to distribute, to be ones willing to share; laying away for themselves a good foundation as a treasure for the future&rdquo;</strong> (1 Tim. 6:17-19; see also 2 Cor. 8:9, 14-15; Eph. 4:28; Acts 20:35).</p>
<p>As believers, we must learn to not set our hope on money but to be ready to distribute, be willing to share, and lay away a good foundation as a treasure for the future. We should use money not only for today but also for the future. This requires that we distribute and share with others. When we use money for ourselves, it is for today. When we use money for others, it is for the future. We should consider how the Lord Jesus became poor for us and be willing to become poor for others so that those among us with much would have nothing over and those with little would have no lack. We should give our extra money to those with little. We should always remember the Lord&rsquo;s word: &ldquo;It is more blessed to give than to receive&rdquo; (Acts 20:35).</p>
<p><strong>5. &ldquo;Make friends for yourselves by means of the mammon of unrighteousness, so that when it fails, they may receive you into the eternal tabernacles&rdquo;</strong> (Luke 16:9, see also vv. 1-13).</p>
<p>We should take advantage of today, while money is still useful, to do our best to make friends by means of our money. This is to use our money to help others, supply others, or promote the gospel to save others. In the future, when money fails, those whom we have helped with our money will welcome us into the eternal tabernacles. I am afraid that many brothers and sisters are not as prudent as the unrighteous steward in Luke 16. They do not take advantage of today while they have the opportunity to use their money to help others. Consequently, no one will welcome them into the eternal tabernacles. What a joyful matter it will be if others are able to welcome us into the eternal tabernacles. This, however, requires that we use our money to prepare such welcomers. When we are saved and return to God&rsquo;s house, the Father will welcome us according to the Lord&rsquo;s word in Luke 15. However, whether or not others will welcome us into the eternal tabernacles depends on how we use our money today to make friends according to the Lord&rsquo;s word in Luke 16. May we be faithful in this matter.</p>
<p>In the Lord&rsquo;s eyes our faithfulness in the matter of making friends with the mammon of unrighteousness is the least of things (v. 10). This is because the earthly mammon of unrighteousness is an empty thing; it does not represent that which is true (v. 11). Rather, it &ldquo;belongs to another,&rdquo; to fallen, earthly men; it is not what is our &ldquo;own&rdquo; (v. 12). If we are faithful in this matter today, the Lord will give us great matters related to the kingdom, entrusting us with the heavenly, true matters. He will give us our own things, which are the things of the kingdom.</p><h2 class="head1">CONCERNING AUTHORITY OVER US</h2>
<h2 class="head2">The Origin of Authority over Us</h2>
<p><strong>1. &ldquo;There is no authority except from God, and those which exist are ordained by God&rdquo;</strong> (Rom. 13:1).</p>
<p>All authority is from God, and those that exist are ordained by God. God gave man authority to rule other men after the flood (Gen. 9:6). However, men who receive authority often abuse it and force people to do things that offend God. In such cases those who fear God cannot obey their command and offend God, even though they should be subject to the authority from God. The record in Daniel 1:8-16, 3:8-27, and 6:4-23 is an example of ones who were subject to authority while not obeying commands that were offensive to God.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Believers and the Authorities over Us</h2>
<p><strong>1. &ldquo;Let every person be subject to the authorities over him, for there is no authority except from God...Render...fear to whom fear is due, honor to whom honor is due&rdquo;; &ldquo;Be subject to rulers, to authorities, to be obedient...to slander no one&rdquo;</strong> (Rom. 13:1, 7; Titus 3:1-2; see also 1 Pet. 2:13-14).</p>
<p>All the authorities over us are ordained by God; therefore, believers should be subject to them, rendering fear and honor. Believers should obey and not slander.</p>
<p><strong>2. &ldquo;Honor the king&rdquo;</strong> (1 Pet. 2:17).</p>
<p>Believers should honor the king or leader of a country.</p>
<p><strong>3. &ldquo;Render to all the things due: tax to whom tax is due, custom to whom custom is due&rdquo;</strong> (Rom. 13:7; see also Matt. 22:21).</p>
<p>The believers should also do their part to pay taxes properly.</p>
<p><strong>4. &ldquo;Petitions, prayers, intercessions, thanksgivings be made...on behalf of kings and all who are in high position&rdquo;</strong> (1 Tim. 2:1-2; see also Dan. 1:8-16; 3:8-27; 6:4-23).</p>
<p>Believers need to pray for all those who are in high position. We need to petition the Lord to give them wisdom, peace, and salvation. This is very important.</p>
<h2 class="head1">FOUR PRINCIPLES CONCERNING THE LIVING<br />
OF THE BELIEVERS</h2>
<h2 class="head2">Profitable to Yourself</h2>
<p><strong>1. &ldquo;All things are lawful to me, but not all things are profitable&rdquo;</strong> (1 Cor. 6:12; see also 10:23).</p>
<p>All things are lawful to the believers, but they must also be profitable. Believers certainly should not do anything that is not profitable or is harmful to themselves.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Being Free from All Things</h2>
<p><strong>1. &ldquo;All things are lawful to me, but I will not be brought under the power of anything&rdquo;</strong> (1 Cor. 6:12).</p>
<p>Believers must not be controlled by what they do. Anything addictive, anything that controls people or causes them not to be free, should not be done.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Building Up Others</h2>
<p><strong>1. &ldquo;All things are lawful, but not all things build up&rdquo;</strong> (1 Cor. 10:23).</p>
<p>Whatever the believers do should also build up others. Anything that corrupts or stumbles others should not be done.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Glorifying God</h2>
<p><strong>1. &ldquo;Whether you eat or drink, or whatever you do, do all to the glory of God&rdquo;</strong> (1 Cor. 10:31).</p>
<p>Whatever the believers do must be done to the glory of God. Anything that is a shame to God&rsquo;s name or that damages the testimony of God should not be done.</p>
<p>Doing what is profitable to oneself, being free from all things, building up others, and glorifying God are four great principles for the daily living of the believers. In the living of the believers, both big and small matters can be tested and decided by these four principles, especially when the Bible does not give a clear teaching on the matter. If something is according to all of these principles, it is permissible. If a matter violates even one of these principles, we should not do it. Matters such as smoking and going to movies are not expressly forbidden in the Bible, but these four principles can help us determine whether or not we may do them.</p></body></html>
