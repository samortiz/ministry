   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>OF GOD S REDEMPTION 2 Scripture Reading: Mark 15:16-41</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>In this message we come to 15:16-41, a section that speaks of the crucifixion of the Slave-Savior.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>THE MOCKING OF THE SLAVE-SAVIOR</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Mark 15:16 says, And the soldiers led Him away into the courtyard, which is the Praetorium, and they called together the whole band of soldiers.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The Praetorium was the governor s official residence.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Verse 17 says, And they clothed Him in purple, and having woven a thorny crown, they placed it upon Him.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Thorns are a symbol of the curse Gen 3:17-18 .</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The Lord Jesus became a curse for us on the cross Gal 3:13 .</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>In 15:17 a thorny crown, signifying royalty, was used as a mockery of the Slave-Savior v. 20 .</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>In verses 18 and 19 the soldiers continued their mockery of the Lord Jesus: And they began to salute Him, Hail, King of the Jews!</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>And they kept beating His head with a reed and spitting at Him, and kneeling down, they worshipped Him.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>After they had mocked Him, they stripped Him of the purple and put His own garments on Him.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>And they led Him out that they might crucify Him v. 20 . The Lord here, as the Passover Lamb to be sacrificed for our sins, was brought like a lamb to the slaughter, fulfilling Isaiah 53:7-8.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>CRUCIFIED AT GOLGOTHA</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Verse 21 goes on to say, And they compelled a certain passerby, coming from the country, Simon a Cyrenian, the father of Alexander and Rufus, that he might carry His cross.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Cyrene was a Greek colonial city, the capital of Cyrenaica in North Africa.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>It seems that Simon was a Cyrenian Jew.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>According to 15:22, They bring Him to the place called Golgotha, which is, being interpreted, Place of a Skull.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Golgotha is a Hebrew name John 19:17 which means skull.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Its equivalent in Latin is Calvaria, anglicized into Calvary Luke 23:33 .</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>It does not mean a place of dead men s skulls, but simply skull.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Verse 23 continues, And they tried to give Him wine mixed with myrrh, but He did not take it.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>This wine mingled with myrrh and also with gall Matt 27:34 was intended as a stupefying draught.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>But the Lord would not be stupefied; He would drink the bitter cup to the dregs.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Verse 24 says, And they crucify Him, and divide His garments, casting a lot for them, what each should take.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Here we see that the Lord suffered being robbed by sinners to the uttermost.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>This was a fulfillment of Psalm 22:18, and it also exposed the darkness of Roman politics.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Mark 15:25 says, Now it was the third hour, and they crucified Him.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The third hour was nine o clock in the morning.</S>
