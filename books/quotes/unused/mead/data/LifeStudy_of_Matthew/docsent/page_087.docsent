   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>LIFE-STUDY OF MATTHEW MESSAGE TWENTY-THREE THE DECREE</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>OF THE KINGDOM S CONSTITUTION 11</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>We come now to the sixth section of the new King s decree on the mountain, 7:1-12.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>VII.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>CONCERNING THE PRINCIPLES</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>OF THE KINGDOM PEOPLE</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>IN DEALING WITH OTHERS</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Apparently, the Lord s intention in 7:1-12 is to cover the principles according to which the kingdom people deal with others.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Actually, His intention here is to encourage us to forget ourselves and to take care of others.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>In the two previous chapters, the Lord has dug out our temper, our lusts, our inner being, the self, the flesh, and our anxiety.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Now He brings us to the point where we must learn to take care of others.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>When you judge others, you must judge them according to how you want them to judge you.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>To consider the matter in this way is to take care of others.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The heavenly ruling over the kingdom people requires that they take care of others.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Although a number of negative points were touched in chapters five and six, the matter of taking care of others is not covered until chapter seven.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>In whatever we do, we must think about others.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>We have a real lack in this area, because in our natural life we do not consider others.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>From beginning to end, we only consider ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Our thinking and our consideration are wrapped up with ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Therefore, we are always centered around ourselves and never consider others.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>I would ask you to recall the way you lived in the past.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Was it your practice to consider others?</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>If we consider others when we are about to criticize or judge them, we shall neither criticize nor judge.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The reason we judge others and criticize them is that we do not care for them.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>If we cared for others, we would sympathize with them.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>A. Not Judging Lest You Be Judged</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>with What You Judge</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>In 7:1 the Lord said, Do not judge, lest you be judged.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The kingdom people, living in a humble spirit under the heavenly ruling of the kingdom, always judge themselves, not others.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The Lord s word about not judging lest we be judged does not seem to be a word about taking care of others.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>However, when we probe into this word, we see that it actually means to take care of others.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>When you are about to judge others, instead you must take care of them.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Let us seek to find out the secret of this word about not judging.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>How can we tell that the real meaning here is to take care of others?</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Are you afraid of being judged?</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>If you are, then you should realize that others are also afraid of being judged.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Do you feel bad about being judged by others?</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>If you do, then you should know that others also feel bad about being judged by you.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>No one likes to be judged.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>If you do not like to be judged, then what about others?</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>You need to take care of them.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>If you do not like to be judged by others, why do you judge other people?</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>If you are afraid of being judged, then you must consider others, who also are afraid of being judged.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Always take care of others.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Verse 2 says, For with what judgment you judge, you shall be judged; and with what measure you mete, it shall be measured to you.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Under the heavenly ruling of the kingdom, the kingdom people will be judged with what they judge.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>If they judge others with righteousness, they will be judged by the Lord with righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>If they judge others with mercy, they will be judged by the Lord with mercy.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Mercy boasts against judgment James 2:13, Gk.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>. Do not judge others so much, for you will be judged in the same degree that you judge others.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>If you take care of others, you will not be judged by them.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Verse 2 says that with what measure we mete, it shall be measured to us.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>The principle here is the same as with judgment.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Apparently, in these verses the Lord does not charge us to take care of others; actually, however, these verses mean that we must take care of others.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Are you afraid of being measured by others?</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>If so, then you must take care of others, for they also are afraid of being measured by you.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>If you take care of others, you will not judge them, criticize them, or measure them.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>In the past I knew a certain group of Christians who talked a great deal about spirituality.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>In a sense, their talk was genuine.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>However, this group had one weak point: it was the practice of measuring others.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>It seemed that everyone in this group had a little scale in his pocket.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Whenever they invited you to tea, they measured you with their invisible scale.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Later they would come together to talk about you.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Some would ask, Have you found out where he is?</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>This means, Have you measured him?</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>I also learned that this group did not care at all for the feelings of others; they cared only for their practice of measuring others.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Their measuring was actually their criticizing and their judging.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>I would take this opportunity to encourage you not to measure others.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Do not try to determine how spiritual others are, how much growth they have, or what is their condition in life.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>If you refrain from measuring others, you will be kept from criticizing them and judging them.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>This is based on the principle of taking care of others.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Those in the group to which I just referred had a difficult time helping others.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>The reason they could not help others was that the others were under their measurement, judgment, and criticism.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>In helping others, we must be blind.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>If you want to help others in the church life, you need to be blind.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>If you would be a good husband or wife, be blind in taking care of your spouse.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>Do not measure, judge, or criticize.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>Do not have any measurement of others.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>This is a way of showing mercy toward them.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>If you show mercy toward others, you will receive mercy.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>But if you measure others without mercy, then you will also be measured without mercy.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>With what measurement you mete, it will be measured to you.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>Mercy does not do any measuring.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>This means that mercy imposes no requirements.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>Anything that requires a measurement is not mercy.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>Mercy does not know mathematics; it does not know how to add or subtract.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>Mercy is absolutely blind.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>Why do you treat me so well when I am so pitiful?</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>It is because you are merciful toward me.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>Sometimes, by the Lord s mercy, I have been merciful toward others.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>Afterwards some of my children, whose eyes were so clear about the situation, said to me, Daddy, don t you know how poor this person is?</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>Why were you so good to him?</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>I was good to him because I was blind.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>My children, however, were very clear-sighted.</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>But those who are so clear-sighted cannot be merciful.</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>If you would be merciful, you must be like Isaac, who blessed Jacob in a blind way.</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>Likewise, we, the kingdom people, must be blind in dealing with others.</S>
   <S PAR='98' RSNT='1' SNO='98'>If so, we shall be merciful to them and always take care of them.</S>
   <S PAR='99' RSNT='1' SNO='99'>Whenever my children asked me why I was kind to those who did not deserve kindness, I answered, You don t know what I am doing.</S>
   <S PAR='100' RSNT='1' SNO='100'>Your eyes are too big and clear.</S>
   <S PAR='101' RSNT='1' SNO='101'>Why did I treat him that way?</S>
   <S PAR='102' RSNT='1' SNO='102'>It was because I was considerate of him.</S>
   <S PAR='103' RSNT='1' SNO='103'>This is the principle of the kingdom people in dealing with others.</S>
   <S PAR='104' RSNT='1' SNO='104'>For us to deal with others, we must consider them, sympathize with them, and be merciful toward them.</S>
   <S PAR='105' RSNT='1' SNO='105'>The kingdom people must take care of others in their dealings with them.</S>
   <S PAR='106' RSNT='1' SNO='106'>If you read these verses again and again, you will see that the basic principle hidden here is that we must forget ourselves and take care of others.</S>
   <S PAR='107' RSNT='1' SNO='107'>Do you know why you criticize others and judge them?</S>
   <S PAR='108' RSNT='1' SNO='108'>It is because you think of yourself too much.</S>
   <S PAR='109' RSNT='1' SNO='109'>You neglect the feelings of others and do not care for them.</S>
   <S PAR='110' RSNT='1' SNO='110'>You care only for your feeling.</S>
   <S PAR='111' RSNT='1' SNO='111'>Hence, you judge and criticize others.</S>
   <S PAR='112' RSNT='1' SNO='112'>Therefore, if we would be kept from judging others, we must take care of them.</S>
   <S PAR='113' RSNT='1' SNO='113'>This requires that we forget ourselves and consider others.</S>
   <S PAR='114' RSNT='1' SNO='114'>If we center around ourselves and ignore the feelings of others, we shall criticize them.</S>
   <S PAR='115' RSNT='1' SNO='115'>But if we take care of others, we shall not judge them.</S>
