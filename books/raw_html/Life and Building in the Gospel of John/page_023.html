        <h2 class="head1">THE LORD JESUS LIVING BY GOD<br />
AND LIVING OUT GOD</h2>
<p>The Gospel of John not only shows that God wants to be our life but also presents the Lord Jesus as the pattern of One who took God as His life. John&rsquo;s description of the Lord Jesus&rsquo; living on the earth shows a genuine man who lived by God&rsquo;s life, not by His human life. Chapters 3 through 6 and chapters 18 through 19, which present the Lord&rsquo;s betrayal and crucifixion, all show a man who took God as His life.</p>
<p>In the Gospels of Matthew, Mark, and Luke, there is no mention of the Lord Jesus being hungry or thirsty, much less weeping, in ordinary circumstances. The only exception is when the Lord was tempted by the devil in Matthew 4:2, but this was not a normal situation. Only the Gospel of John shows the Lord Jesus being hungry, thirsty, and weeping in His normal human living (4:7; 11:35). This shows that He was a man, who, like us all, could be hungry, thirsty, and tired from journeying (4:6) and who could sympathize with man. When men wept, He wept. The situations described in the Gospel of John indicate that He genuinely was a man.</p>
<p>The Gospel of John also shows that the Lord Jesus did not live by His own human life. He said, &ldquo;The words that I say to you I do not speak from Myself, but the Father who abides in Me does His works&rdquo; (14:10). Even though He was a man living on the earth, He lived entirely by God, who was in Him as life. He was a man who could hunger and thirst, but He was a man who lived by God and who lived out God in His situations of hunger and thirst.</p>
<h2 class="head1">NOT WORKING FOR GOD BUT LETTING GOD WORK</h2>
<p>As soon as a Christian begins to love the Lord, he has the thought that he needs to do something for the Lord. There is hardly a person who, when he begins to love the Lord, has an inward realization that the Lord has no desire for him to do anything but to put aside his own life so that the life of God can be lived out through him. Very few have this thought when they first begin to love the Lord.</p>
<p>A young brother once came to see me and said, &ldquo;Brother Lee, I would like to serve the Lord my whole life and work for Him. Originally, I wanted to study at a seminary, but I am afraid that a seminary may not be spiritual enough. I have heard that you have a training, and I would like very much to come. Would you grant me an opportunity to attend your training?&rdquo; As I talked to him, I learned that he had not been saved for long. He was very young in every respect, even though he was quite zealous for the Lord. I said to him, &ldquo;Brother, do not be anxious. Nothing is more important than giving the Lord the opportunity to live in you and to be expressed through you, not even studying in a seminary, attending the training, preaching the gospel, or reading the Bible.&rdquo;</p>
<p>God delights the most in our giving Him the opportunity to be in us as our life, not in how much we have pursued Him, how much we have worked for Him, or how much of a price we have paid for Him. This lesson cannot be learned in a seminary or a training but only in our daily living. Although we go to work, go to meetings, and worship God with the brothers and sisters, these can all be outward things. The most important thing is to stop ourselves because we love the Lord and to take Him as our life, letting Him live in us. Then when we work for God, our work will touch God&rsquo;s heart and be acceptable to Him.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE ISSUE OF THE WORD BECOMING FLESH<br />
BEING A TABERNACLE</h2>
<p>This mingling of God and man is the Word becoming flesh. The Word, who is the explanation of God, became flesh and was mingled with man as one. In and through the life and nature of man, the Word spoke forth God, explaining and declaring God through His expression. He was not an angel or a spirit but a man who spoke God forth. People say that He was a man because He was a man who fully lived a human life, yet in His human living God was expressed. He was a man living out God. This is the Word becoming flesh. This is the mingling of God and man.</p>
<p>When God is mingled with man through the Word becoming flesh, there is an issue of building. Once the Word became flesh, a tabernacle was erected. Our experience testifies that whenever we live by God as our life practically, we have a distinct sense of the Lord&rsquo;s presence. This sense is related to both God being mingled with us and to us being God&rsquo;s dwelling place.</p>
<p>John says that God&rsquo;s dwelling is the tabernacle. As soon as the tabernacle is mentioned, we must consider the matter of being built up in coordination. The tabernacle was not built with one piece of wood, one piece of linen cloth, or one measure of gold, silver, and bronze. The tabernacle was produced with many boards and much linen cloth, gold, silver, and bronze. When we truly deny ourselves and live by God as our life, we not only sense God&rsquo;s presence, but we also sense that we cannot live individually before God. When we live by ourselves, we often feel self-sufficient, but when we live by God, we feel the need to be coordinated with the brothers and sisters.</p>
<p>This is certainly the case with our church service and the move of the work, but even our family affairs touch this principle. When we handle our family affairs by ourselves, we often have the feeling that our wisdom, skill, ways, and insight are quite good, and we have no sense of any need to fellowship or seek help from the brothers and sisters. But whenever we stop ourselves and live by God as our life, we immediately feel that we must fellowship with the brothers and sisters. This is the issue of the Word becoming flesh. If a brother sees the vision of the mingling of God and man and allows God to come into him as life practically, he will be built up quickly and see the vision of the church, the Body of Christ.</p>
<p>The matter of the church, the Body of Christ, is not merely one of light or truth; to merely preach and teach this truth is futile. We need to receive mercy and be led to understand God&rsquo;s desire, which is to gain a way to mingle Himself with man and be man&rsquo;s life. Whoever sees this and cares for God&rsquo;s heart will let God into him to be his life. Such a one will discover that he needs the other members, the Body, the church. He needs a group of brothers and sisters who, like him, live in God&rsquo;s life.</p>
<p>Many Christians today can talk about serving God and about being spiritual. However, there is no sense of their being in coordination with others or even of receiving a supply from other members. A person who is being mingled with God and built up with others, however, can be supplied by those with whom he is not like-minded in a natural way. It is even possible for him to be coordinated with these ones. Such a mutual supply and coordination are not related to having the same doctrine but to being connected to the same inner life. This is the building of the church.</p>

 	<h2>Noise Words</h2>
 	<p>Common words, such as "and", "is", "but", and "the", also known as noise words, are bypassed in a search. The search string, the Spirit &amp; who, would result in an error since who, which stands by itself, is a noise word. The following is a list of noise words:</p>
	<p>$, a, also, an, and, another, any, are, as, at, be, because, been, being, both, but, by, came, can, did, do, each, for, has, had, he, have, her, here, him, himself, his, how, if, in, into, is, it, like, make, me, might, much, my, of, on, or, our, out, over, said, should, since, some, still, such, take, than, that, the, their, them, then, there, these, they, this, those, to, too, very, was, way, we, well, were, what, where, which, while, who, with, would, you, your</p>

<div id="myModalRanking" class="reveal-modal">
  	<h2>Ranking</h2>
  	<p>Rank is a value from <strong>0</strong> to <strong>1000</strong> indicating how closely a match scored or ranked against the original search string. Rank values are affected by the following factors:</p>
		<ol>
            <li><span>The total number of occurrences of the original search words/phrases in a portion of a book.</span></li>
            <li><span>Content that includes the search words in close proximity to each other are ranked above those that do not. Therefore, a portion of a book that has the search words in close proximity may have a higher ranking than another portion of a book that has a higher hit count but the words are not in close proximity to one another. Therefore, we also include a search word hit count for reference.</span></li>
            <li><span>The rank values are relative to each other. Therefore, it is not possible to interpret the RANK value as a percentage or group the rank values into high/medium/low ranges. Think of rank as a method to order the results for a specific search.</span></li>

 	<h2>Search Scope</h2>
 	<h3>Include All Word Forms</h3>
	<p>This option breaks out the search string into its individual words and generates all conjugations and declensions for each word in the search phrase. A search on the word, dwell, would search for dwell, dwelling, dwelling's, dwells, dwelt, and dwelled.</p>
	<p>There is no need to use ^ (inflectional search) or * (prefix search) when using the Include all word forms search scope.</p> 
	<h3>Specified Word Forms</h3>
	<p>This option searches for exact matches of the specified words or phrases used in the search string. Use of ^ (inflectional search) with a particular word in the search string will broaden the search for that given word in that all conjugations and declensions for that word will be searched. Similarly, use of * (prefix search) with a particular word in the search string will broaden the search for that given word in that all words with that prefix will be searched as well.</p> 
	<h3>Note</h3>
	<p>Common words, such as "and", "is", "but", and "the", also known as noise words, are bypassed in a search. A list of all noise words is as follows:</p>
	<p>$, about, after, all, also, an,and, another, any, are, as, at, be, because, been, before, being, between, both, but, by, came, can, come, could, did, do, each, for, from, get, got, has, had, he, have, her, here, him, himself, his, how, if, in, into, is, it, like, make, many, me, might, more, most, much, must, my, never, now, of, on, only, or, other, our, out, over, said, same, see, should, since, some, still, such, take, than, that, the, their, them, then, there, these, they, this, those, through, to, too, under, up, very, was, way, we, well, were, what, where, which, while, who, with, would, you, your</p>
