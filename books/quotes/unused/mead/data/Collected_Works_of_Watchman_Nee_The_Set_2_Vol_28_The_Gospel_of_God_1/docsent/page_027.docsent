   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Most people today are ignorant first of God's righteousness and then of the fact that the Lord Jesus has accomplished God's righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>People do not know that God's righteousness is manifested apart from the law.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>They still try to work up righteousness before God.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>They are like the man who owes ten thousand talents of silver.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>There is absolutely no way to repay the debt.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>But the man still tries to save six cents by getting off at an earlier stop, hoping to save to repay his debt.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>He is still calculating, hoping to save a little here or there, to do this or that, to generate a little money for the repayment of the debt.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>He still wants to say to his creditor that though he owes ten thousand talents, he does have a few pennies with him.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>He does not realize that the full sum has already been sent to his home.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Man has no idea what God has done in His Son.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Because of this, the apostle Paul tells us what attitude man should have.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Concerning God's righteousness, we need to look at two passages in the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The first passage is in Romans 10.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Verses 3 and 4 say, "For because they were ignorant of God's righteousness and sought to establish their own righteousness, they were not subject to the righteousness of God.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>For Christ is the end of the law unto righteousness to everyone who believes."</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>I love these two verses.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>When we read these verses in relation to the gospel, our hearts must be warmed up.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>These verses say that the Jews did not know that God's righteousness had been established; they were still seeking to establish their own righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>They tried their best to be good, to exchange their work for their salvation, and to exchange their righteousness for life and all that God has given to them.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>But Paul said that all those seeking to establish their own righteousness are not subject to the righteousness of God.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Not to be subject to the righteousness of God is not to be subject to the work that God has accomplished in His Son Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>God's righteousness is accomplished in His Son Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The cross of Jesus is both a manifestation of God's love and an accomplishment of God's righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>On the cross of Jesus, God's righteousness was accomplished.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>If any man wants to establish his own righteousness today, he is denying the sufficiency of the Lord's work on the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Never think that we can add something to the work that the Lord Jesus has finished.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Never think that we can help it or patch it up a little.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>All those who seek to establish their own righteousness are not subject to God's righteousness at all.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>If someone sends a sum of money to my home to pay back a loan he has made to me and I still try to save a few pennies to repay him, I am in reality despising what he has given me.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>All those who seek to establish their own righteousness are blaspheming God.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Why is "Christ...the end of the law"?</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Christ as "the end of the law" means that Christ includes everything that the law has.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>In other words, God has not just given you ten thousand talents of silver; all the money in the world has been given you.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>How can you save a few more pennies?</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The end of the law is Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>How are you going to find any more righteousness?</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>If a man is very big, and he occupies the whole chair, can you squeeze yourself into the same chair?</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The end of the law is Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>How are you going to establish your own righteousness?</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Thank and praise God that what He has given us is the best!</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>I would say a strong word in a most reverent way: God has "exhausted" His omnipotence in His Son Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The end of the law is Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>All those who believe in Him must receive righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Those believing in Jesus are bound to receive.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>There is no possibility for them not to receive.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>I like this thought.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>It is impossible for us not to be saved.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>God has given us His Son, who does not only possess the little that you need, but even everything.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>God can never forsake those who have believed into His Son.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>God has no way to reject us.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>All those who come to God through the Son must receive righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>There will be no hassle; the guarantee is sure.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>The other passage of Scripture is 2 Corinthians 5:21.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>We have been saved, but we still live as humans.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>It is true that we are now saved, and that our sins are forgiven, but what do we do while living on this earth?</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>We are all Christians today, and are all the children of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Regarding His children, God declares something most amazing here: "Him who did not know sin He made sin on our behalf."</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>God has made the Lord Jesus sin.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Originally the Lord Jesus was without sin at all; He had nothing to do with sin.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Now God has judged Him as though judging sin itself.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>God judged Him this way "that we might become the righteousness of God in Him."</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Today in the Lord Jesus Christ, you and I are the showpiece of God's righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>When people see us, they see God's righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>We, the sinners, through the Lord Jesus becoming sin for us and through His bearing of our sins to forgive us, have now become the righteousness of God in the Lord Jesus Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>We are the living righteousness of God walking on earth.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>In Christ we are the representatives of God's righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>If you do not know what God's righteousness is, all you need to do is find a saved person and take a good look at him.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>You will then know what God's righteousness is.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>If you want to know what God's righteousness is, just find a Christian and you will know that God has not dealt with our sins irresponsibly.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>He has made sin Him who knew no sin.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Because the Lord Jesus has died, the work of redemption is accomplished.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>For us to be in the Lord Jesus today is an expression of the righteousness of God.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>When a person sees someone who believes in the Lord Jesus, he sees God's righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>If someone wants to know what God's righteousness is, I can stand up and tell him, "Just look at me.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>God loves me so much.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>He loves us to the uttermost.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>He is not loose concerning sin at all.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>This is why He caused the Lord Jesus to die on the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>Look at me, a saved sinner today.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>I am the showpiece of God's righteousness in Christ."</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>Today we declare two great messages to the world.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>Both of them are what the world desperately needs.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>The first is that God loves man.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>This is a most wonderful fact.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>But that is not all.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>The other great message is that God in His righteousness has forgiven man's sins.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>Now man can come to God with all boldness and full faith, reminding Him that He has forgiven his sins.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>At the end I would like to ask you a question.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>Why is the parable of the prodigal son in Luke 15?</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>It seems that there is something lacking in this parable of the prodigal.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>After the prodigal squandered his estate and came home, the father should indeed love him, but he should have said at least a few words of reprimand to the son, perhaps something like this: "You have taken all your estate and have spent everything; even your stomach is empty now."</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>But the father did not say a word like this.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>No wonder the older son had to say something.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>Even we have to say something.</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>Is it not unrighteousness when there is sin and it is not dealt with?</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>If Luke 15 had only the parable of the prodigal, we would have to conclude that God is not righteous, that God has not judged sin, but has glossed over it.</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>In the parable of the prodigal son there is not so much as one word of rebuke.</S>
   <S PAR='98' RSNT='1' SNO='98'>But thank and praise the Lord that there are three parables in Luke 15.</S>
   <S PAR='99' RSNT='1' SNO='99'>The first is the parable of the shepherd saving the sheep.</S>
   <S PAR='100' RSNT='1' SNO='100'>The second is the parable of the woman seeking the lost coin.</S>
   <S PAR='101' RSNT='1' SNO='101'>The third is the parable of the father receiving the prodigal son.</S>
   <S PAR='102' RSNT='1' SNO='102'>Immediately in the first parable we have the good shepherd forsaking his life for the sheep.</S>
   <S PAR='103' RSNT='1' SNO='103'>The Lord Jesus has already come and died.</S>
   <S PAR='104' RSNT='1' SNO='104'>The sin of the prodigal was already judged in the first parable.</S>
   <S PAR='105' RSNT='1' SNO='105'>Because of what happened in the first parable, there is the second parable, in which a woman lights a lamp to seek for the lost coin.</S>
   <S PAR='106' RSNT='1' SNO='106'>Since the Lord Jesus has accomplished salvation, the Holy Spirit can come to enlighten with His light.</S>
   <S PAR='107' RSNT='1' SNO='107'>After this the Father does not see the problem of sin anymore.</S>
   <S PAR='108' RSNT='1' SNO='108'>The problem of sin has been cleared up in the parable of the shepherd giving his life for the sheep.</S>
   <S PAR='109' RSNT='1' SNO='109'>In addition, the inward feeling has been enlightened in the parable of the woman lighting the lamp.</S>
   <S PAR='110' RSNT='1' SNO='110'>The wrongs have been realized already.</S>
   <S PAR='111' RSNT='1' SNO='111'>By the time the Father comes, all He needs to do is to welcome the prodigal.</S>
   <S PAR='112' RSNT='1' SNO='112'>The Lord Jesus has forgiven our sins.</S>
   <S PAR='113' RSNT='1' SNO='113'>The Holy Spirit has enlightened us and has caused us to be convicted concerning sin, righteousness, and judgment.</S>
   <S PAR='114' RSNT='1' SNO='114'>Hence, by the time the Father comes, the matter of sin need not be mentioned anymore; He only has to do the work of welcoming us.</S>
   <S PAR='115' RSNT='1' SNO='115'>In the previous two parables, God's righteousness as well as His love were already manifested.</S>
   <S PAR='116' RSNT='1' SNO='116'>Suppose a person has not yet come to God, but he sees that he is a sinner and realizes that the Lord Jesus has judged his sins.</S>
   <S PAR='117' RSNT='1' SNO='117'>The Good Shepherd has borne his sins away and the Holy Spirit has enlightened him concerning his sins.</S>
   <S PAR='118' RSNT='1' SNO='118'>When such a one returns home, he has to realize that the matter of sin is forever gone; it has been dealt with on the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='119' RSNT='1' SNO='119'>Remember that the Father's house is not the place to talk about sin.</S>
   <S PAR='120' RSNT='1' SNO='120'>It is not the place to talk about our squandering.</S>
   <S PAR='121' RSNT='1' SNO='121'>The cross is the place to talk about sin; it is the place to talk about our squandering.</S>
   <S PAR='122' RSNT='1' SNO='122'>If you are at home, God can most righteously choose not to talk about your sins.</S>
   <S PAR='123' RSNT='1' SNO='123'>We can eat and drink to our heart's delight.</S>
   <S PAR='124' RSNT='1' SNO='124'>We can live, wear the costly garments, rest, and make merry to our heart's delight.</S>
   <S PAR='125' RSNT='1' SNO='125'>God has said that once we were lost, but now we have been found, that once we were dead, but now we have come to life.</S>
   <S PAR='126' RSNT='1' SNO='126'>There is no problem here any longer.</S>
   <S PAR='127' RSNT='1' SNO='127'>Hallelujah!</S>
   <S PAR='128' RSNT='1' SNO='128'>God's grace is sufficient for us.</S>
   <S PAR='129' RSNT='1' SNO='129'>In this way, we realize that God's grace is a faithful and righteous grace.</S>
