   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The words recovery and economy refer to one thing as seen from two viewpoints.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>With God, it is a matter of economy; with us, it is a matter of recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>God's economy was unveiled through the apostles, but because the believers lost the proper understanding of God's economy, there is the need for it to be recovered.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Therefore, what is being recovered today is God's economy.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The Lord's recovery is also to recover the oneness of the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>This means that in the recovery we must see the universal Body and do everything in the limitation, the regulation, of the one Body.</S>

   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>This involves the mingling of divinity with humanity.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>In order to work Himself into us, God became a man and lived a human life on earth.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Then He passed through death and entered into resurrection and ascension, becoming the consummated, life-giving Spirit ready to come into us.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>When He came into us, He regenerated our spirit.</S>
