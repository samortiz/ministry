   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Our Need to Labor on Christ as Our Good Land</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The surplus of the produce of the good land typifies Christ, and the way to have the surplus is to labor on Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Regrettably, some brothers and sisters are lazy.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>D. L. Moody, who throughout his life brought myriads of people on two continents to Christ, said that he never saw a lazy person get saved.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Perhaps he was too extreme to say this, but I can say that I have never seen a lazy person who could be spiritual.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>A lazy person may be saved, but I am sure that he cannot be spiritual.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>You can be brought into the good land, but if you are lazy, you will have no surplus.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Rather, you will be a beggar.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>If we are diligent and industrious to labor on the land God allotted to us, we will have much produce from this rich land.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>This produce will be enough not only for us to live on but also for us to have a surplus.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The surplus is the first tenth, not the last tenth.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The Israelites had to separate every first lamb and every first tenth of the produce for the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>This typifies that after being brought into Christ, we need to labor on Christ, to cooperate with the Holy Spirit to live by Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Some may say that we should not use the word labor because today is the dispensation of grace; they say everything is of grace, not of works.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>There is no doubt that the good land given to us is a grace.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The sunshine, the air, the early rain, and the latter rain are also a grace.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>However, we still have to till the ground.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>We cannot say that grace will till the ground for us; grace will never do that.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>From the very beginning of the Scriptures, after Adam was created, man had to till the ground.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>We need to till the ground, sow the seed, and reap the harvest.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Grace will not do these things for us.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>We cannot bring rain down from heaven.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>That is not our ability; that is something beyond our ability.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>That is truly something of grace.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Sunshine, air, rain, and the rich soil are all of grace.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>However, we must realize that we all have our responsibility.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Every morning we have to rise up early.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Not one farmer can be lazy; every one has to rise up early in the morning.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>If we do not rise early in the morning to spend a little time with Christ, I am certain that when we come to the meeting, we will have nothing in our hand.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>We will come to the meeting with empty hands.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>We need to rise up a little earlier, contact the Lord, read the Word, and pray a little to till the ground, sow the seed, and reap the harvest.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Some may say that we should not be legalistic in this way.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>However, we need to be legalistic three times a day in order to eat.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>We can fast only for a while; if we fast all the time, we will not be able to live.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Day by day we must rise up early to spend some time with the Lord; this is our labor.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>We have to pray; this is our labor.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>We also have to exercise our spirit to contact the Lord throughout the whole day; this also is our labor.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Moreover, we must deal with many enemies, including the flesh, the self, and the environment.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Even our family, friends, relatives, neighbors, colleagues, classmates, and roommates are problems we have to deal with.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>We also have to preach the gospel and learn to help others.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>All these are items of the labor we should have.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>If we labor in all these ways, we will have the rich produce of Christ our good land.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Then when we come to the meeting, we will come with our hands full of the riches of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Because day and night we labor on Christ, we will have a rich produce that is not only good enough for us to live in Christ and by Christ, but also good enough for us to come to worship God.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>In this way, when we come to God, we come with Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>As we have seen, there were two main items related to the worship in the Old Testament: the central place and all the types.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>If you spend time to read the Scriptures, the Holy Spirit will lead you to understand the background of the worship in the Old Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Based on this, the Lord told the Samaritan woman, An hour is coming.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>This means that at the time the Lord spoke this word, the age, the dispensation, had changed.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Before that time was the old age, the old dispensation, in which there was the worship of the Old Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Now, however, the age has changed.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Now the proper worship, the true worship, is not a matter of a place or of the types.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>It is a matter in the spirit, not of Jerusalem, and it is a matter in truthfulness, not of the types.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>The worship of the New Testament time is a worship in the spirit and a worship in truthfulness.</S>
