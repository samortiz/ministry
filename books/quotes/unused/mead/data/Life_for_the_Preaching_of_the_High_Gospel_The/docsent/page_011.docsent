   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>TAKING CHRIST AS OUR PERSON</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>For the past years we have been stressing Christ as our life, but in recent days the Lord has shown us that He is also a person.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In John 15:4a He says, "Abide in Me and I in you."</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>You as a person abide in Christ, and He as a person abides in you.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Christ is a person.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>He is not merely power, strength, might, or life, but a person.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Within a tree there is life, but the tree is not a person.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Within a motor there is power, but the motor is not a person.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>But within a man, there is life and power, and even the more, he is a person.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Christ to us is not only life and power but also a person abiding in us John 15:4a, 5a; 14:23 .</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Ephesians 3:17a says, "That Christ may make His home in your hearts."</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>A person needs a home.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Christ desires to make His home in our hearts.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>This means that this Christ who is making home in our hearts is a person.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>God's intention is that we human beings take Christ as our person.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>This means that we have to live, not by ourselves but by Christ as our person Gal 2:20a; Phil 1:20b-21; John 6:57; 14:19 .</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Suppose we have a young man and a young lady who are going to get married.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>They are two beings with two persons.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>How can the two of them become one being?</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>In many weddings the head of the bride is covered.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>This signifies that the two persons become one since the wife is willing to have her head covered.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>As a wife, you have to realize that, according to God's economy, your head has to be covered.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>This does not mean that the man as the head has authority and that the wife is miserable in losing all her rights.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Rather, it is a matter of love.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>It means that the wife loves her husband to such an extent that she is willing to give herself up.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>She is willing to give up her person and take her husband as her person.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>As a living being, she does not live by her own person; she lives by her husband's person.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>This is real love.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Likewise, we need to give up our person and take Christ as our person.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>When we are willing to forget about ourselves and take Christ as our person, we will be rooted and grounded in love Eph 3:17b .</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>We will say to the Lord, "O Lord Jesus, I just love You!</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>You are so wonderful, good, nice, capable, and qualified.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>O Lord, You are so sweet and tender.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>I want to forget about myself and take You as my person!"</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Among the saints, the husband should not say to his wife, "Have you heard the message in the meeting tonight?</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Who is the head?"</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The wife would say, "Yes, I heard that.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>No doubt, you are the husband, so you are the head.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>But it's pitiful that I am a woman.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Since I am your wife, I have no choice but to cover my head."</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>This kind of wrong understanding concerning the husband being the head, the person, of the wife will lead to either separation or divorce.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>We must know that the wife's taking the husband as her person is a matter of love.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>When we take Christ as our person, it simply means that we love Him.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>We tell Him, "O Lord Jesus, You are so sweet and capable.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Therefore, Lord, I just forget about myself, and I take You as my person."</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>If I ask a sister why she is wearing a particular dress, she may say, "Because I like it."</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>This is a failure.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>As a wife, you should be able to say, "I wear this dress because my husband likes it."</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Suppose I ask a brother, "Why do you comb your hair this way?"</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>His answer should be, "Because my Husband, the Lord who lives in me, likes it."</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>This is what it means to take Christ as our person.</S>
