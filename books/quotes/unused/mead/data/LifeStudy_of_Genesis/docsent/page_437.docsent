   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Among the thousands of people in the church life, there are many different kinds: the clever, the wise, the crafty, the proud, the arrogant.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>According to religion, the correct way is to change our outward behavior.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>But God's way, the way of life, is different.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>God did not say to Jacob, "Jacob, I have wrestled with you, touched you, changed your name, and given you My blessing.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>From now on, you must not exercise your craftiness or use your natural strength to face the situation with your brother, Esau.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Don't be crafty any longer.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Trust in Me and let Me take care of this matter."</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>There is no such account in the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>There is simply the record of Jacob's being touched.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The Lord touched his thigh, changed his name, and gave him His blessing that is all.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>No sermon, no instruction, was given to him.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Whatever Jacob did after that, such as divide his folks into three groups, was up to him.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Often, after the Lord touches us, He does not tell us what to do.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Instead, He leaves us to ourselves, allowing us to do whatever we like.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>If we examine our experience, we shall see that this is so.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Those, especially the elders, who care for others are fond of instructing people.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Frequently they say, "Brother, you were mistaken.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Now that the Lord has blessed you, you should not treat your wife the same way.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Surely for the sake of the Lord's glory, you must change."</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The sisters who engage in shepherding may charge others, saying, "Sister, you should not exchange words with your husband any longer.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>You should not do this you should not do that."</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>This is our way, but it is not the Lord's way.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>After touching Jacob's thigh and blessing him, the Lord gave him no instruction.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>He did not even say a word.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Rather, after that touch, Jacob still exercised himself.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>He seemed to say to his people, "You all stay back.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Let me go forward to see my brother Esau."</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>But as he walked toward him, he did so in a limping way.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>What a difference between our natural concept and God's way!</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>What a difference between the religious practice and the Lord's touching!</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>I do not want to hear of instructions that are given to you; rather, I like to see that, one by one, so many of you are touched by the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Often, sisters have come to me complaining about their husbands.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>However, as they accuse their husbands before me, I am happy because in their accusations I notice that they are limping.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Perhaps only a few days earlier they came to me without any sign of having been touched.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>But now, although they still complain and accuse their husbands, a definite limp is perceivable.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>I do not rebuke these dear sisters, for I am happy to see that they have been touched.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>One touch is better than all kinds of instructions.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The Lord's touching of our natural life is much better than a hundred messages.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>This is our need today.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Verse 31 says, "And as he passed over Penuel the sun rose upon him, and he limped upon his thigh" Heb .</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>After the touch, the sun rose upon Jacob.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>He was crippled, but he was in the light.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Anyone in the Lord's recovery who has light must be a crippled one.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>No one under the light is still whole; everyone under the light of the heavenly shining is lame.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>In the dark night, Jacob was strong and every part of him was whole.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>But after he was touched, the sun rose upon him and he was full of light.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>He was under the shining of the heavenly light, yet he was a crippled man.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Because we are truly in the Lord's hand and are following His way, many of us are having this kind of experience.</S>
