   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>B. Some Teaching by Way of Concession,</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Not by Command</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In 7:6 Paul says, But this I say by way of concession, not by command.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The word command here implies that the apostle in his teaching has authority to give commands to the believers.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>However, what Paul says in 7:1-5 is by way of concession, not by command.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>C. In Some Matters Paul Charging,</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>yet Not He but the Lord</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Verse 10 says, But to the married I charge, not I but the Lord, A wife should not be separated from her husband.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>We have seen that the Old Testament principle of speaking for God, of prophesying, is, Thus saith the Lord Isa 10:24; 50:1; Jer 2:2; Ezek.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>2:4 .</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>But the New Testament principle of incarnation is I charge; that is, the speaker charges.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The speaker and the Lord are one.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Hence, Paul also says, Not I but the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The Greek word for charge may also be translated enjoin or command.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The words I charge, not I but the Lord, indicate two things: first, that the apostle is one with the Lord; hence, what he commands, the Lord commands.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Second, his commandments are the Lord s. What Paul commands here the Lord had already commanded in Matthew 5:31-32 and 19:3-9.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Divorce is altogether not allowed by the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The principle in 7:10 is the same as that in Galatians 2:20, where Paul says, It is no longer I who live, but Christ lives in me.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>In both verses we see the principle of incarnation; two persons living as one person.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>In 7:10 we have two persons, the Lord and Paul, speaking as one.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>This is the reason Paul says, I charge, not I but the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Why does Paul not say in this verse, But to the married the Lord charges ?</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Why does he say that he charges, yet not he but the Lord?</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The answer to these questions is that Paul realized that he was one with the Lord and that what he spoke was the Lord s word.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Even when he did not claim to have a word from the Lord, because he was one with the Lord, whatever he said was the Lord s word.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>D. In Some Matters Making It Clear</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>That It Is He Who Says, Not the Lord</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>In some matters Paul makes it clear that it is he who speaks, not the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>For example, in verse 12 he says, But to the rest I say, not the Lord, If any brother has an unbelieving wife and she consents to dwell with him, let him not leave her.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>This word also is based on the New Testament principle of incarnation.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Although Paul is careful to add, not the Lord, whatever he says in the following verses is part of the divine revelation in the New Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>It is his opinion in the Lord, not the Lord s commandment, yet it still expresses the Lord s mind.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Can you sense Paul s spirit in these verses?</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Here Paul seems to be saying, Even though I realize that this is my word, not the Lord s word, I still believe that this is pleasing to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The Lord is pleased by keeping the peace.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Even though the Lord does not say such a word, I have the assurance that it pleases Him.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Therefore, I say that a brother should not leave an unbelieving wife if she consents to dwell with him.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Likewise, a sister should not leave an unbelieving husband if he consents to dwell with her.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>However, if an unbelieving husband desires to leave a sister or if an unbelieving wife should leave a brother, neither the sister nor the brother should fight.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Rather, each should let the other party go, for God has called us in peace.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>I am the one who is saying this, not the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Yet I believe that such a saying is pleasing to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Here we see a person who is one with the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Because he is one with Him, he knows the Lord s heart, mind, and pleasure.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>For this reason, he has the boldness to utter something which the Lord has not spoken.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>In verses 29 and 35 Paul also makes it clear that he is the one who speaks, not the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>In verse 29 he says, But this I say, brothers, the time is shortened, that henceforth both those that have wives may be as though they had none.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>In verse 35 Paul writes, But I say this for your own profit, not that I may put a noose on you, but for that which is comely and waiting on the Lord without distraction.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>In both verses it is clear that Paul is the one speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Nevertheless, the Lord speaks in Paul s speaking.</S>
