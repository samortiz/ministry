He went out and told his brothers. Apparently, he was merely passing on words, but actually he was acting according to the principle of rebellion. He had a spirit of rebellion, and this rebellion was manifested in the way he spoke. Had he humbled himself under authority, he would not have dared to pass on any word. Anyone who desires to learn submission must refrain from passing on words that undermine authority. We have to be restrained in words. The unnecessary spreading of words has caused much havoc. We should never be those who spread unnecessary words to others.</p><h2 class="head2">The Reviling of Aaron and Miriam</h2><p>There is also the story of Aaron and Miriam reviling Moses. Although Aaron served alongside Moses, God's calling was to Moses. His calling to Aaron was a result of His calling to Moses. Miriam's calling was an adjunct to the two. Moses' calling was an independent calling. Aaron and Miriam's callings were not independent; they were part of Moses' calling. If Moses had not received a calling, Aaron and Miriam would not have been called. Aaron and Miriam were older than Moses in the flesh, but in God's work, Moses was greater. He was the deputy authority. I cannot tell you the reason for this. I can only say that God likes to do things this way. Aaron and Miriam did not want to submit to Moses' authority, and words escaped their mouths. When they saw that Moses had married a Cushite, they reviled him, saying, "Has Jehovah indeed spoken only through Moses? Has he not spoken through us also?" The Bible says, "And Jehovah heard it" (Num. 12:2). As soon as a man has a spirit of rebellion within him, his mouth reveals it. The proper exercise of authority, however, will shut up many mouths. If a man knows authority, he will stop much noise and many questions. Authority seals up not just the words and noise but questions as well. When a spirit of submission is present, many questions are automatically answered. Everyone who has touched authority submits to God's arrangements. Aaron might have thought that Moses was just his brother and that he had stroked Moses' head and even disciplined him from his youth. What was wrong with rebuking him a little now? He only said one thing: "Has Jehovah indeed spoken only through Moses? Has he not spoken through us also?" We do not know if he had spoken to anyone else about Moses' affairs or reviled him or challenged his leadership for marrying a Gentile. It seems as if Aaron and Miriam did not say anything serious at all. We may feel that their words were not very serious. We may think that such words could not easily be considered as reviling, but the Bible says that Aaron and Miriam reviled Moses. God understood their words to be a reviling. As soon as we move our little finger, God knows what we are doing. He knows whether or not there is any rebellion within us. There was nothing special about Moses to Aaron and Miriam, but in God's eyes Moses was His chosen authority. Any word that carries a spirit of rebellion, whether it is casual or serious, constitutes rebellion. It is hard to ask a rebellious person to refrain from reviling words.</p><h2 class="head2">The Attack of Korah's Company against Moses</h2><p>Numbers 16 speaks of the rebellion of Korah's company, Dathan and Abiram of the tribe of Reuben, and the two hundred and fifty leaders. Their rebellion was also characterized by their speaking. This rebellion was larger in scope than the previous one. Numbers 16 tells us that they accused Moses and Aaron of having gone too far and of exalting themselves above the congregation of the Lord. Their attack became a reviling. Their rebellion burst out like a flood and opened the door of Sheol. This was a serious rebellion. Their words became absolutely unrestrained. In order to serve God, we have to find authority everywhere. We have to learn to be submissive in our attitude and our words. In order to learn submission, we have to be faithful in the way we speak. We must not open our mouth loosely.</p><h2 class="head1">AUTHORITY SHUTS UP REVILING</h2><p>Once we take proper instructions in the matter of submission, we will realize that the condition of the church today is a mess. We cannot find order and authority anywhere. If God grants many of us the leading to touch His authority for the next three to five years, we will realize the contrast between the confusions of the past and the excellence that is in the church. We can find a resemblance of this feeling in the matter of salvation. Formerly, we did not have the assurance of salvation nor a grasp of the content of salvation. As a result, we had little feeling for the matter of salvation. Today everyone knows how great salvation is, and the church's feeling toward this matter has changed. Formerly, the church was not clear about salvation because the way was not clear. The same can be said about authority. We must see authority. Once we see authority, we will realize the multiplicity of our words and their evil. They convey nothing but reviling, gossip, and rebellion. By the Lord's mercy, we will touch authority, and we will not dare to speak rashly. Our knowledge of authority is linked to our speaking. If we cannot control our mouth, we cannot control our own person either. The kind of mouth we have determines the kind of person we are. Out of the abundance of the heart the mouth speaks (Matt. 12:34). This is a law.</p><p>We have to deal with a rebellious mouth. We have to deal with reviling words. Yet we cannot deal with rebellion by ourselves. God can. If God gives us the grace to touch authority a little, we will discover something restraining us as soon as we try to speak in a light way. We will not be able to say what we want to say; our words will be stopped. This is not a matter of outward change. Once we know authority, our speaking will change. During the past twenty years, we have not been free to speak about authority. Putting the whole matter in simple words: We have to touch God's authority. It is not the amount of change in the outward man or in our words that matters. As soon as we touch authority, we will become different. We will fall on our knees, and our entire being will wilt away. We will no longer dare revile or criticize. Our mouth will be shut. May the Lord have mercy on us so that no rebellious spirit or rebellious words will be found in us.</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_057.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_059.html">Next</a> </body></html>
