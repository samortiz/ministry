<h2 class="head1">A THOROUGH LIQUIDATION, TERMINATION,<br />AND DEALING</h2><p>Handing oneself over means to thoroughly give up everything. The emphasis is not only on the words give up everything but on the word thoroughly as well. Thorough means a clear-cut liquidation, termination, and dealing. Objects related to sin cannot be sold; they have to be burned or destroyed. Acts 19 speaks of Paul's work in Ephesus. Many who had practiced magic brought their books, put them in a pile, and burned them on account of the strong testimony. The value of the books was fifty thousand pieces of silver (v. 19). If Judas had been there, he would have been in rage, saying, "Why this waste? These books at least could be sold at twenty percent discount, and we could give forty thousand pieces of silver to the poor." The Holy Spirit wanted to burn them because these objects were related to sin. Sin was in them. They were offensive objects and, therefore, needed to be burned.</p><p>A brother in Shanghai was in the business of selling comic books. He could earn seven thousand People's yen a day. He depended on this business for his living. His books were worth over eight hundred thousand People's yen. For many years he kept his occupation. When filling out the personal data card from the church, he would leave the "occupation" column blank. If anyone asked him about his occupation, he would dodge the question. One day the Lord touched him and would not let him go. He felt that he had to deal with this matter. He went to the brothers and spoke with them. He was willing to hand himself over, and he asked the brothers and sisters to burn the books for him. When Brother Chang Yu-zhi heard this, he praised the brother and promised to burn the books for him. When I heard about it, I stopped him. I asked the brother to burn the books himself. This is like Abraham killing Isaac; he had to do it with his own hands.</p><p>The young brothers and sisters who are in school have not yet touched mammon. I would say this to them: From now on keep yourself pure. You have to make up your mind not to touch or be defiled by many things. You have to separate yourselves from these things. You have to ask God to keep you pure and to grant you the grace to be blind to mammon. Today man's heart is open to mammon. But I hope that you can touch the hymn we sang earlier. I hope that you can maintain a pure heart and never fall to the power of mammon for the rest of your life. Do not wait until you have become rich to seek deliverance from mammon. In the Bible the Lord speaks of "the mammon of unrighteousness" (Luke 16:9). Its very nature is unrighteous. It is versus God, and it turns men away from God. You have to be saved from it just as you need to be saved from sin.</p><h2 class="head2">Hating Mammon like Hating Sin</h2><p>In the past we put the blame on the co-workers, but the church should bear the blame as well. It did not have the boldness to speak as the Lord Jesus did concerning selling everything, forsaking all, and following Him. Being delivered from mammon is not just a simple act of handing oneself over. Some people do not have mammon in their hands, but they do have it in their heart. Actually, there is a greater love for mammon in many poor people. The Lord Jesus said, "Blessed are the poor in spirit" (Matt. 5:3), but many people are not poor in spirit. They crave mammon. They crave it because they do not have it. This proves that they have not been delivered from the power of mammon. In 1 Timothy 6:9-10 Paul said that those who intend to be rich and aspire after money have pierced themselves through with many pains. This word shows that those who desire to be rich are under the power of mammon. Today I hope that we all will advance step by step and be totally free from the power of mammon. We have to hate mammon as much as we hate sin. It is wrong for a Christian not to hate sin. Such a one is a fallen Christian. In the same way, when we find that we cannot hate mammon like we hate sin, we have fallen. We should be like the apostle Peter who said, "Silver and gold I do not possess, but what I have, this I give to you..." What he had was the name of Jesus Christ the Nazarene (Acts 3:6). The early church did not have silver or gold; it only had the name of the Lord Jesus. Today we have to go back to the very condition at the beginning.</p><p>If we take a look at this generation, we can see that our age does not allow us to accumulate mammon. Christian poverty is a voluntary poverty that results from salvation. This was Zaccheus's experience (Luke 19:1-10). Many people are poor because of their environment or upbringing. Others become poor as a result of persecution or class struggle. These are not poor voluntarily. The last time I was in Shanghai, I saw many people who are poor outwardly but not inwardly. I also saw many brothers and sisters who once were rich but are now poor for the Lord. They are very happy. In the future the greatest suffering in hell will be the suffering of unfulfillment. In hell none of man's lusts will be fulfilled. This will be the greatest suffering. There still will be sin in hell, in fact, many sins (Rev. 21:8), but man will not be able to indulge himself or find satisfaction in his lusts. Today many people crave the riches of the world but cannot get them. They are not only suffering in this age; they also will suffer great chastisement when their soul goes through Hades's fire for their avarice. How unnecessary this is!</p>
