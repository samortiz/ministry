   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER TWELVE A FELLOWSHIP</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Date:December 30, 1947</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Place:Chanticleer Restaurant, Hong Kong</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Speaker:Witness Lee</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>GRACE BEING THE UNIQUE REALITY</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The Lord Jesus is the grace.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>John 1:17 says, "Grace and reality came through Jesus Christ."</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>This chapter shows us that reality is something that can be seen, and grace is something that can be received.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Grace is the unique reality in the universe.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Other than grace, nothing is real.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Even the heaven and the earth will pass away one day.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>This is why we say that the earth and everything that can be seen will not last forever, and they are therefore not real.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>THE NEED FOR THE LIFE WITHIN TO GROW</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The identifying death mentioned in Romans 6 can only be experienced and lived out in the Holy Spirit in chapter eight.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Hence, it is useless to "reckon" alone.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>In the same way, the sin in Romans 5 is lived out in chapter seven.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>When a baby is born, sin is there already.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>But it is only when he grows up that sin is manifested.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The same principle applies to God's life within us.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>When we are regenerated, we have life already.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>But this life needs to grow before its fullness is expressed.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Between 1938 and 1942, I saw this truth.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>In 1943, I was put into prison.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>One month after I came out of the prison, I became sick, and I was in bed for a whole year.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>During this period of time, this truth appeared clearer and clearer to me.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>THE LORD'S DEATH AND HIS LIFE</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Ephesians 1 and 2 cannot be separated from each other.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>In fact, the end of chapter one is joined to the beginning of chapter two.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Chapter two should not begin with a capital letter.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The death of the Lord Jesus contains two elements: death and life.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The two combined together also give life.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The Lord gives life to us out of His death.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>This can be likened to some medicine that kills germs, on one hand, and imparts life, on the other hand.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Everything mentioned after chapter two confirms these two facts, that is, the fact of the Lord's death and the fact of His life.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>To sin, the world, human relationships, and the flesh, we are dead; whereas to God, we are living.</S>
