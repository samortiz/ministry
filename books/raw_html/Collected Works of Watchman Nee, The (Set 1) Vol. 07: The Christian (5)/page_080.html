<H1 CLASS=TITLE>TWELVE BASKETS FULL</H1><H1 CLASS=PAREN>(3)</H1><H2 CLASS=HEAD4>Issue No. 5</H2><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>A CERTAIN DAY</H2><P>How anxious I am today! Seemingly, I have lost something! I surely would like to leave this place to meet with some saints to soothe my loneliness. A day like this is hard to endure! To be here confined alone is really not easy!</P><P>This is an occasional activity of the soul. It is the provoking of the soul.</P><P>O Lord, I dare not move one step; for I know that Your Spirit works in my heart to divide my soul from my spirit, so that my spirit can ascend to heaven and so that I can be one spirit with the Spirit of the Lord Jesus, and not be affected by the provocation of my soul.</P><P>How unbearable, truly unbearable! If I can endure this unbearableness and not try to escape from the route that the Lord has chosen for me, the soul will lose its power of influence.</P><P>May the Lord cause me to be calm. (January 2)</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>NEVER THIRST AGAIN</H2><P>When the Lord, who is worthy of our praises forever, was on the earth, He told us, "Whoever drinks of the water that I will give him shall by no means thirst forever" (John 4:14). This is a faithful saying and worthy of all acceptation, for what the Lord bestowed upon us can satisfy us forever. The Lord knows the nature of His own gift.</P><P>But what a pity that many times in our experiences we are not like this! Many times we are thirsty again! Do we not have this sense of dryness often? We often feel dissatisfied and even feel the presence of much need.</P><P>However, the word of our beloved Lord will never return void. Whatever He says is true.</P><P>The problem is on our side, because we do not believe! If we believe His word, we will surely not thirst again. The living water He promised will constantly supply our parched soul and spirit, and it will satisfy all our desires. The more we believe the Lord's promise, the more the life will "flow."</P><P>Oh, how disgusting is this evil heart of unbelief! May the Lord give us grace that we may believe in Him and rest in Him.</P><P>Blessed are those who know that the Lord can satisfy our heart! Blessed are those who have no thirst other than the thirst for the Lord!</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>REST</H2><P>We have only one resting place and that is our Lordâ€”"Rest in the Lord." If we rest in our environment, knowledge, perception, health, or spiritual experience, we will find that they will change and will fail. They are shaky foundations. Thank the Lord that He is our resting place. Although we cannot rest on anything else, we can rest in Him. He is our high tower with a firm foundation.</P><P>Because of His great love, we rest in Him. He loves us. This love is "eternal" and "unto the end." This love caused our Lord Jesus Christ to come down from heaven to die for us on the cross, to resurrect and ascend, to intercede for us, and to prepare a place for us, and it will cause Him to come again. How marvelous this love is! The human tongue and reasonings fail to depict this love of the Lord. Since we have such a loving God, why is it we cannot stop worrying and simply rest in Him? Nothing that comes along should make us anxious or worried. We should calm down and rest. Why? Because God loves us.</P><P>Furthermore, we rest in Him because of His wisdom. His wisdom will not let Him miscalculate. He knows how to arrange and how to proceed. Everything that comes to us has gone through His wise consideration. He knows how to cause all things to work together for good to those who love God. Although we may think that we are in despair and have no way to go on, and although our hearts are troubled, yet He is not like us. He knows how to uphold the whole universe, and He also knows how to arrange the smallest things for us. So why do we worry? Does He not have wisdom?</P><P>Moreover, we rest in Him because of His mighty power. His arm will never fail, and the greatness of His power is inconceivable. Whatever things He knows that He should do, He is able also to accomplish them. He is able to save His children. He is able to destroy Satan's work. He is forever victorious. It is this power that is working for us! Therefore, trembling and feeble brothers, we can be bold. Recline and rest in the Lord, because this mighty Lord is our Father.</P><P>May the Lord give us rest and free us from anxiety in times of difficulty through looking up to Him. May we believe His love, wisdom, and power, and may we not cause any useless confusion.</P>
