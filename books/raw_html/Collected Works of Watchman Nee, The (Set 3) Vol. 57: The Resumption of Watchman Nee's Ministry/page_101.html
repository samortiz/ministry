<h2 class="head2">Satan Usurping Man's Worship through Money</h2><p>At the same time, money takes hold of all things. On the one end, God produced all things through creation. On the other end, Satan converted all things into money, thus unifying all things. If a man has money, he can buy anything. He can buy gold. He can even buy the whole of Shanghai or the whole of China. There is not one thing that money cannot buy. Mammon is opposed to God. This is the reason the Bible tells us not only that the love of money is a root of all evils (1 Tim. 6:10), but that covetousness and idolatry go together (Eph. 5:5; Col. 3:5). Covetousness is the only idol. When one worships money, he is not worshipping money itself, but the created things behind the money. Because man wants goods, he spends the "common goods,'' that is, the money, to buy the particular goods. This means that man wants God's things and does not want God Himself. This is the reason that man either serves God or mammon. Those who have a heart for mammon can never love God.</p><h2 class="head2">The Only Way to Serve God Being<br />to Be Delivered from Mammon</h2><p>God's things come from God; this is grace. The things that come from God are not for sale. The sunlight is not metered, and there is no charge for it. But there is a charge for electric light. In order to get anything from Satan, man has to buy it. Even the carob pods of the prodigal son had to be bought. If a person truly wants to serve the Lord, he must be delivered from money. Once a person's thoughts are turned to money, he cannot serve God. It is wrong for a man to view all things from the side of money; he should view all things from the side of God.</p><h2 class="head1">MINISTRY AND AUTHORITY</h2><p>Another thing which we must see is the relationship between ministry and authority. The eyes have the ministry of the eyes; they control the seeing function. In order for any member in the body to see, it has to rely on the ministry of the eyes. The meaning of coordination is that we give to others what we have, and others give to us what they have. The first condition to coordination is that we accept our own limitation. We have to acknowledge that we are only a member, and that we are not the Body. If we were capable in everything, then we would be the whole Body, and we would not need coordination any longer. However, as long as we are only a member, we cannot think that we have everything. The one-talented ones cannot pretend to be rich. Even if the eyes are important, they cannot replace the ears. One can see colors only with the eyes, and one can hear sounds only with the ears. Perhaps I can only speak, not walk. In that case, someone will have to do the walking. If we see this, we will realize that what one individual can do is actually very limited.</p><p>During these days the Lord has shown us that too few brothers and sisters know what real coordination is. A brother said once, "I do not think that this thing should be done this way.'' I said to him, "Who is asking you to think?'' If you are an ear, you do not have to say, "I think this matter should be done this way.'' If the eyes see that something is white, then it is white. There is no need for the ear to think about whether it is white.</p><p>The sisters cover their heads with respect to the brothers. Christ says that He does not speak from Himself (John 12:49). The word from is ek in the original language. It means "out from.'' This means that the Son can speak nothing out from Himself. In other words Christ's head is covered before God. Today the church also has its head covered before Christ. The fact of the covering is demonstrated through the sisters' covering of their heads. Whenever we are in the coordination of the Body, all our heads have to be removed. For many to think about what to do and to express the opinions that they have is quite inappropriate. Someone asked me once, "If I cannot say amen to a certain thing, what should I do?'' The Bible never says that a servant of God should do something "when he feels an amen to do it,'' and should not do something "when he does not feel an amen to do it.'' Man's head needs to be cut off. When some brothers and sisters talk to me, I have the feeling that my head should be cut off. Only the unique Head is qualified to think. Today man's mind is full of the thought of being the head. A person has to learn to reject proposals and opinions.</p><p>God has reserved for Himself teachers who can make decisions concerning the interpretation of the Bible and judgments on the Scriptures. The reason that there are so many sects and strange doctrines is that everyone wants to be a teacher. However, not everyone is a teacher in reality. It is useless for the ear to say that something is white. Whether or not a thing is white is not determined by what the ear says, but by what the eyes see. Today there are many heresies that have developed from the church because of this very reason.</p><p>There is one thing that is very strange in 1 Corinthians 12: Although the eyes and the ears are on the head, they are not the head. In the body the controlling organ is the head, whereas the working organs are the members. The organ that actually sees is not the eyes, but the optical nerves within the head. Outwardly speaking, the whole body moves by the seeing of the eyes. Actually it moves by the head. Even if you are a great gift or a strong member, you are useless if you are not in coordination, and if you are not the eyes, you surely need coordination all the more. Today we need to see our own limitation.</p><p>There are many things that do not require our consideration. Once we see the limitation of the members, the matter of authority will be settled. If we are at odds with the members appointed by God, we are at odds with the Head. If we are omnipotent and omniscient, we will not need any coordination. In the church we are not afraid of the seemingly foolish ones who know nothing; we are only afraid of those who know everything and who can do everything. In coordination we should not be the head. Rather, we should learn to listen and not have too many of our own thoughts.</p>
