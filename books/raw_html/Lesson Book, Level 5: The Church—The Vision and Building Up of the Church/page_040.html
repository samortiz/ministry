<h1 class=msg>Lesson Eight</h1><h1 class=msg>THE FORMATION OF THE CHURCH</h1><h2 class=head2>Scripture Reading</h2><h1 class=scripture>Rom. 5:18-19; 1 Pet. 3:18; John 12:24; 1 Pet. 1:3; 1 Cor. 15:45; John 20:19-22; 7:39; Acts 1:8; Luke 1:35; 1 Cor. 12:13; Matt. 16:18; Eph. 1:22-23; Acts 2:33, 17; Luke 24:49; Acts 1:4; Luke 4:18</h1><h2 class=head2>Outline</h2><ol class="upper-roman"><li>Christ’s crucifixion to redeem people for the church</li><li>Christ’s resurrection to regenerate people to be living members of the church</li><li>Christ’s ascension to pour out the Spirit on His people to form the church	<ol class="upper-alpha">	<li>Being universal</li>	<li>On the day of Pentecost and in the house of Cornelius</li>	<li>By Christ the Head</li>	<li>Through the outpouring of the Spirit		<ol class="decimal">		<li>The baptism in the Holy Spirit</li>		<li>On the one hundred twenty believers</li>		<li>On the believers in Cornelius’ house</li>		</ol></li>	</ol></li></ol><h2 class=head2>Text</h2><p>After seeing the vision of the church, God’s purpose for the church, the status of the church, and the universal and local aspects of the church, we need to see the formation of the universal church and the establishment of local churches in the next two lessons.<p>Many Christians prefer one “church’’ over another because it appeals to their personal preference, or they form their own church when they want to do something different. We must refer to the Bible to see who is qualified to form the church, and to see how the local churches are established.<p>[We need to realize that none of us is qualified to form the church. Only the Lord Jesus is qualified for this. In Matthew 16:18 He says, “I will build My church.’’ He is the unique one who is qualified to form the church.]
