   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER ELEVEN THE MATURITY OF JACOB Scripture Reading: Gen 37; 42 49</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>After Jacob was dealt with by God at Peniel, he began to recognize his own weakness and was gradually changed.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>He gradually saw the way he should take; he passed through Shechem to Bethel and finally dwelt in Hebron.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>However, this does not mean that Jacob needed no further dealings from God after Peniel.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The Bible shows us that after Peniel, he seemed to encounter even more dealings from God than before.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>We may say that Jacob was a suffering-ridden person.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>From Shechem to Bethel and from Bethel to Hebron, Jacob suffered many sorrows.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>We can take a look at the following examples.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>In Shechem Jacob met a very difficult situation.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>His daughter was defiled by Shechem, the son of Hamor the Hivite, the prince of the country.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Jacob's sons then conspired to slay Shechem and all the males in the city.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>This matter greatly troubled Jacob.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Let us read Genesis 34:30: "And Jacob said to Simeon and Levi, Ye have troubled me to make me to stink among the inhabitants of the land, among the Canaanites and the Perizzites: and I being few in number, they shall gather themselves together against me, and slay me; and I shall be destroyed, I and my house."</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Jacob was very worried that Shechem's countrymen might rise up in revenge to destroy him and his entire house.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>This was the crisis that confronted Jacob in Shechem.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>In chapter thirty-five Jacob went to Bethel and encountered another incident.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>"Deborah Rebekah's nurse died" v. 8 . He could not see his mother, but if his mother's nurse was there, he would have been somewhat comforted.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>He did not expect that his mother's nurse would die also.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The Scripture purposely records that "she was buried beneath Bethel under an oak: and the name of it was called Allon-bachuth."</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The meaning of Allon-bachuth in the original language is "the oak of weeping."</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>From this we have a glimpse of Jacob's sorrow and grief at that time.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>He journeyed from Bethel, and when he was close to Ephrath, he was met with an even more sorrowful event.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>"Rachel travailed, and she had hard labor....And it came to pass, as her soul was in departing, for she died, that she called his name Benoni: but his father called him Benjamin.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>And Rachel died, and was buried in the way to Ephrath, which is Bethlehem.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>And Jacob set a pillar upon her grave: that is the pillar of Rachel's grave unto this day" vv.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>16-20 .</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The wife whom Jacob loved so much died on the way.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The pillar that he set upon Rachel's grave told of his sad story.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>When Jacob was in Edar, he experienced another heartbreaking thing.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>His son Reuben went to lay with Bilhah, Jacob's concubine v. 22 . This was another matter that caused Jacob to suffer.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>After he passed through all these incidents, he arrived at Hebron where his father Isaac sojourned.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Here the Bible makes no mention of his mother Rebekah; perhaps his mother had already died.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>This was God's severe dealing with Jacob.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>In his youth his mother had loved him.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>His mother had taught him how to steal the blessing that his brother Esau should have received.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>But now the mother who had loved him so dearly was no longer around.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>He truly experienced many sorrows.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>At this point we have completed our study of the third stage of Jacob's history.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>In the first stage of his history, we saw his disposition.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>In the second stage of his history, we saw the trials and disciplines that he suffered.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>In the third stage of his history, we saw that God not only disciplined him, but also dealt with his being and his natural life.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Even after his natural life had been thoroughly dealt with, we see that the discipline of God was still upon him.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>God dealt with him in this way for the purpose of creating in him a character that he did not possess before.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The section from chapter thirty-seven to the end of Jacob's old age may be considered the fourth stage of Jacob's history.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>We may also say that this was the period of the maturing of Jacob, the brightest period in Jacob's entire life.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Proverbs 4:18 says, "But the path of the just is as the shining light, that shineth more and more unto the perfect day."</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Jacob shone brighter day by day until his death.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>During this period of almost forty years, Jacob did not do much, yet before God he was transformed fully into a man of grace and love.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>We can see from the Bible that a Christian need not regress and decline in his old age.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>The three top apostles in the New Testament all shone brightly at the time of their death.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>When Peter wrote his second Epistle, it was close to the time of his departure from his tabernacle.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>But he still reminded and exhorted the brothers while he was yet in his tabernacle.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>In particular he said that he was an eyewitness of the Lord's glory and power.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>There was absolutely no waning of the brightness of Peter's shining.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>As for Paul, he said, "For I am already being poured out, and the time of my departure is at hand....Henceforth there is laid up for me the crown of righteousness, with which the Lord, the righteous Judge, will recompense me in that day" 2 Tim 4:6-8 .</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>We can see from these sentences that the hope he had toward the Lord was brightly shining.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>With the apostle John, who wrote his Gospel, his Epistles, and the book of Revelation during his old age, this shining is most apparent.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>The Gospel he wrote says, "In the beginning was the Word."</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>The first Epistle he wrote says, "That which was from the beginning...the Word of life."</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Revelation also says, "The things which you have seen...and the things which are about to take place after these things."</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>John wrote "from the beginning" all the way to "forever and ever."</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>There was no decline at all in the life of the aged John.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Therefore, our old age need not be days of deterioration.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>The history of Solomon's old age 1 Kings 11:1-8 should not be the history of our old age.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>God shows us that our old age should be days of fullness.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Even though David sinned, his ending was better than his beginning; he ended by preparing for the building of the temple.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Although Peter denied the Lord three times, in the end he was for the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Although Mark once withdrew from the work because of difficulty Acts 13:13; 15:37-38 , he still wrote the Gospel according to Mark, and eventually he was profitable to Paul for the ministry 2 Tim 4:11 .</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>The histories of these men show us that they all did very well in the last stretch of their journey.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Let us come back to Jacob.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>In the beginning he was crafty and deceitful to the uttermost, yet in the end he was transformed into a lovely person, a useful person in God's hand.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>If we compare Jacob with Isaac and Abraham, we may say that Jacob's ending was better than that of Abraham and much better than that of Isaac.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>The shining in Jacob's later years comes almost as a surprise to us.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>We may think that a person like Jacob is without much hope and not worthy of being perfected.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>Even if he improved, we may think that he would not end up being of much use in God's hand.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>But individually speaking, Abraham's and Isaac's endings were not as good as Jacob's. Both Abraham's and Isaac's later years seem a little rusty.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>However, Jacob's later years were shining and fruitful.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>God was able to accomplish in him in his later years all that was absent in his early years.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>Let us look at some of the events in Jacob's later years.</S>
