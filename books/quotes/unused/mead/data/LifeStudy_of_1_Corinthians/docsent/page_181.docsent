   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>LIFE-STUDY OF FIRST CORINTHIANS MESSAGE SIXTY-ONE DEALING WITH THE GIFTS 5 Scripture Reading: 1 Cor 14:1-25</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>As Paul was writing chapters twelve, thirteen, and fourteen of 1 Corinthians, there was a burden in his spirit and on his heart concerning certain crucial matters: speaking, the Spirit, the Body, God s administration, and love.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>These five matters are emphasized in chapters twelve and thirteen.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In chapter fourteen Paul comes to another main point: the superiority of a particular gift for the building up of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Among the many spiritual gifts, one is superior not for our work, maturity, or spiritual interests, but for the building up of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>As we shall see, this superior gift is that of prophesying.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Therefore, in dealing with the gifts, Paul emphasizes six matters: speaking, the Spirit, the Body, the administration of God, love, and the gift which is superior for the building up of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Paul s ultimate concern is not speaking, the Spirit, the Body, God s administration, or love as the excellent way to exercise the gifts.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Rather, Paul s ultimate concern is the building up of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Paul was very church-conscious and church-centered.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>His concern was focused on the church.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>In Colossians 1:24 Paul says, Now I rejoice in my sufferings on your behalf, and fill up that which is lacking of the afflictions of Christ in my flesh for His Body, which is the church.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Christ died not only for redemption, but also for the church.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>According to Ephesians 5:25, Christ gave Himself up for the church.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Yes, Christ died to accomplish redemption.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Redemption, however, is a procedure; it is not God s goal, God s destination.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Redemption is a way to reach the goal, but the goal is the church.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Because the church is God s goal, we cannot agree with those Christians who neglect the church and who have only a superficial grasp of Christ s redemption.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Many do not even like to hear the church mentioned.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>But the death of Christ mainly and ultimately is for the church.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>In eternity we were chosen and predestinated by God.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Because we fell away from God, there was the need for Christ to accomplish redemption in order to bring us back to God.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>But redemption is not God s goal; it is not His ultimate intention.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>God s goal, His intention, is to have His chosen people organically united to be the Body, the church.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Even if we had not fallen, it nevertheless would have been necessary for God to carry out a certain procedure to obtain the church.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>When I was young, I was told simply that Christ came because we had fallen into sin.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>I was taught that God loved us and gave His only begotten Son to save us.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>According to this understanding, if we had not fallen, it would not have been necessary for Christ to come.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>But it is a mistake to think that God s intention is merely to redeem us from hell to heaven.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>God s intention is to have the church, and the death of Christ redeems us so that we may become His Body.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>This was the reason Paul was church-conscious and church-centered.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>In his consciousness the church was an extremely crucial matter.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>As we consider the spiritual gifts, we need to ask what the gifts are for.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Many Christians care only for the gifts, but they do not care for the purpose of the gifts.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Some desire to have a gift of preaching, and others desire the miraculous gifts such as the gift of tongue-speaking or the gift of healing.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>But they may not care at all what these gifts are for.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Paul was different.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The concern deep within him was for the building up of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>He knew what gifts were useful for the building up of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>We need to learn of Paul to be concerned for the building up of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Whether we are spiritual, mature, or gifted is secondary.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The primary thing in God s economy is the building up of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Paul s emphasis, his main point, in chapter fourteen concerns what gift is best, not for us, but for the building up of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Yes, God has given many gifts, but not all gifts are important with respect to the building up of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Therefore, in this chapter Paul shows us which gift is superior for the building up of the church.</S>
