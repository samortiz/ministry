   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE PANORAMIC VIEW OF GOSPELIZING TAIWAN The Full-timers Working Diligently in One Accord</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>After two terms of the full-time training, there will be two hundred fifty full-timers.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>After they complete their training, they will have some time off for rest.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Then they will be completely yoked.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>However, this yoke is not a bondage; rather, it is Canaan, the good land.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>This good land requires us to cultivate it diligently.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Furthermore, some full-timers from other cities also have the burden to stay in Taipei to take care of the home meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Regarding this point, I hope that every one of the full-timers will seek the consent of the church from which they came, because the churches are the ones who supported the full-timers to come here.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>We have already heard the good news that some churches want to stand in one accord with the Lord s move today in gospelizing Taiwan.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>If there is the need for some to stay, then they may stay.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>If some should return to their localities, then they should go back to their respective localities.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>This all depends on the fellowship of the brothers.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>This is a proper word.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The original intention of the training was that the trainees should return to where they came from to serve there.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Therefore, upon the completion of the training, the full-time trainees must seek the consent of the church in their locality regarding where they are to go.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>This is in the principle of fellowship.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Of course, the majority of the churches are willing to bear the burden together in gospelizing Taiwan.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>After all, there is only one move of the Lord today on the whole earth.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>We need to spread from Taiwan to the entire earth, taking Taiwan as the center.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>However, on this central line, we still must keep the principle of having fellowship with every locality.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Gospelizing Cities and Communities First,</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Then Propagating in Towns and Villages</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>In order to gospelize Taiwan, we must first gospelize the communities of Taipei, Kaohsiung, Taichung, and then Tainan.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>After we gospelize all the communities in the big cities, we can then propagate out from the city centers to towns and villages.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>This is our initial blueprint.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Setting a Goal and Putting All of Our Effort</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>into the Home Meetings</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Every year, there are college graduates joining the full-time service, and the training also continues every year.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Through these, we need to make the homes of the new ones into Canaan.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>However, we should not do this in a rigid way.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Instead, we should do it in an active, attractive, living, and fruitful way.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The result we obtain should not be something rigid but something living and abiding as our Canaan, the good land.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>From our past experience in leading the new ones to the corporate Lord s table meeting, we learned the lesson that the table meeting is short of the word of God.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>At the end of the Lord s table meeting there should be the ministering of some short messages.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>For example, we can first minister on the Lord s life and His precious blood, then on God s love, and third on God s grace.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>After speaking on God s love and God s grace, we can proceed with God as light as the fourth topic and then continue with God s Spirit, God s power, God s righteousness, and other topics.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>We who lead the home meetings are already familiar with these messages, so we should share and minister to the new ones a little each time.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>This can be compared to a dessert after a feast with many delicious dishes.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>However, we should not serve the dessert in a rigid and inflexible way.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>As long as a topic is interesting to people, we can serve it according to their need without following a set rule, and we can plant that topic into them.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>If the Lord wills, we should supply a message every Lord s Day.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>We can never take the old way of degraded Christianity.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Not only does history prove this, but the entire situation in today s Christianity also indicates this.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The statistics that we saw earlier, in particular, give us a clear picture of the present trend.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The result brought in by the old way of traditional Christianity has been a decline in the number of people.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Hence, we must set our goal on the home meetings and labor on them.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>This is a fierce fight and not a small matter.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The work we are doing in these days is not an easy work.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>To work out a foundation of the home meetings is unprecedented in the history of Christianity.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>This will turn the age.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>This is absolutely not a small matter.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>We need to pray much more, endeavor in one accord toward this goal, and concentrate all of our strength on the home meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>The Lord s work will not hold still.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>We will continue to study to take the home meetings further so that the Lord will have a way to accomplish His heart s desire.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>A message given on May 12, 1987 in Taipei, Taiwan</S>
