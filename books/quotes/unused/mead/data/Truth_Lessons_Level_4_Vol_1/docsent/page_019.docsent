   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The prophet Isaiah used bruised reeds and dimly burning flax as types to prophesy concerning the poor situation of God s people at the time of Christ s earthly ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Despite their poor situation, Christ would not break a bruised reed nor quench a smoking flax; He kept the door of mercy and grace open to all the people.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>No matter how much opposition, persecution, and attack He encountered, the Servant of Jehovah, Christ, was always merciful and full of sympathy.</S>

   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Psalm 69 prophesied that Christ would be devoured by the zeal for God s house v. 9a . This prophecy was fulfilled at the time Christ cleansed the temple, the house of God John 2:12-17 . When the Lord saw the corrupted situation of the temple, He could not tolerate it.</S>

   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>After the Lord cleansed the temple, His disciples remembered that it was written, The zeal of Your house shall devour Me v. 17 . Out of the zeal for God s house, He could not tolerate the corruption, greed, and defilement in God s temple.</S>

   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>In prophesying concerning Christ s suffering Isaiah said, He was despised and forsaken of men, / A man of sorrows and acquainted with grief; / And like one from whom men hide their faces, / He was despised; and we did not esteem Him 53:3 .</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>According to the account of the four Gospels, the Lord Jesus was continually despised and forsaken, causing Him to sorrow and be acquainted with grief.</S>

   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>They did not receive Him.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>On the contrary, they rejected Him, just as it was prophesied in Isaiah 53:1: Who has believed our report?</S>

   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The Lord Jesus, the Savior Himself, is the arm of Jehovah coming to save man.</S>

   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>On the contrary, the religionists forsook Him and even nailed Him to the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Christ, as the Servant of Jehovah, was full of sorrow in His human living, which fully qualified Him to be the Savior of the world.</S>

   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Taking David as a type, Psalm 69 prophesied concerning Christ s suffering: More numerous than the hairs of my head / Are those who hate me without cause v. 4a . The Lord Jesus quoted this verse in John 15:25, saying that He was hated by many without cause.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>This indicates that Christ suffered not only for our sake, but He also suffered in bearing reproaches for the sake of God.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Hence, Christ was not only our Substitute bearing our problems but was also God s Substitute bearing God s problems.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Paul quotes Psalm 69:9 in Romans 15:3, saying, The reproaches of those who reproached You fell upon Me.
