<p><em>Hymns,</em> #930 reads as follows:</p>
<ol class="decimal">
<li>&ldquo;Must I go, and empty-handed,&rdquo;<br />
Thus my dear Redeemer meet?<br />
Not one day of service give Him,<br />
Lay no trophy at His feet?<br /><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Must I go, and empty-handed?&rdquo;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Must I meet my Savior so?<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not one soul with which to greet Him:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Must I empty-handed go?<br /><br /></li>
<li>Not at death I shrink nor falter,<br />
For my Savior saves me now;<br />
But to meet Him empty-handed,<br />
Thought of that now clouds my brow.<br /><br /></li>
<li>O the years in sinning wasted;<br />
Could I but recall them now,<br />
I would give them to my Savior,<br />
To His will I&rsquo;d gladly bow.<br /><br /></li>
<li>O ye saints, arouse, be earnest,<br />
Up and work while yet &rsquo;tis day;<br />
Ere the night of death o&rsquo;ertake thee,<br />
Strive for souls while still you may.</li>
</ol>
<p>This hymn was written long ago in America by Charles C. Luther. It was translated into Chinese at an early date and was widely sung among Chinese Christians. The story behind this hymn concerns an American sister who lived an ordinary Christian life. While she was on her deathbed, she suddenly felt that she had failed the Lord and was ashamed to meet Him because she had not led one person to Him in her lifetime. Therefore, she was exceedingly sorrowful. Her pastor, who was Charles C. Luther, not knowing how to comfort her, wrote this hymn to express her sentiments. When I was young, every time I attended a gospel revival meeting, we would sing this hymn. The tune can easily arouse one&rsquo;s spirit. Even though the original Chinese translation was poor, each time after we sang the hymn, there would always be people walking up to the front in tears and consecrating themselves for the gospel.</p>
<p>Later when I was compiling our hymnal, I spent much time considering whether this particular hymn is suitable to be included. Because our emphasis has always been on such high topics as the Spirit, life, Christ, and the church, I felt that the content and thought of this hymn were rather ordinary and therefore did not deserve to be included. However, because I had obtained a deep impression from this hymn, I truly liked it and could not forget it. Moreover, there is something special about the tune that can easily stir up the believer&rsquo;s spirit for gospel preaching. Therefore, I decided to do my best to improve the translation and to include it in the hymnal.</p>
<p>This hymn says that when a believer dies and goes to meet the Lord, he should not be empty-handed but should offer some trophies to Him. We preach the gospel not in fear of death but because we do not want to meet the Lord empty-handed. That we are saved is not a problem, but we still need to live an overcoming life that we may have trophies to offer to the Lord. Paul said that the believers whom he led to salvation were his hope, joy, and crown of boasting before the Lord (1 Thes. 2:19-20). If when you meet the Lord, you see that everyone else is bringing a herd of lambs and you alone are empty-handed, you will feel sad and ashamed. However, if you also bring with you a good number of lambs, your feeling and joy will be indescribable.</p>
<p>According to this hymn, while we believers are alive, it is day, and when we die, we enter into the dark night, that is, the night of death (stanza 4). We must work while it is day, for when night comes, no one can work (John 9:4). Therefore, while it is still day, before the night falls, we should work actively to save many souls that we may bring with us to offer to the Lord. Although the spiritual meaning of this hymn is not very deep, it has its value in practicality.</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_008.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_010.html">Next</a> </body></html>
