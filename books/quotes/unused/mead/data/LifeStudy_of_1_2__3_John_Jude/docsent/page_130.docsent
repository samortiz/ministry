   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In verse 4 John uses the word walking.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>As in 1 John 1:7, where John speaks of walking in the light, the word walk means to live, behave, and have our being.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The truth concerning the Person of Christ should not only be our belief; it should also be our living.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Once again, truth here denotes the divine reality, especially concerning the Person of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The Father commands us to walk in this reality, that is, in the realization of the divine fact that Jesus Christ is the Son of God see Matt 17:5 , that we may honor the Son as the Father desires John 5:23 .</S>

   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>In verses 5 and 6 John goes on to say, And now I ask you, lady, not as writing a new commandment to you, but that which we have had from the beginning, that we should love one another.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>And this is love, that we walk according to His commandments.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>This is the commandment, even as you heard from the beginning, that you should walk in it.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The phrase from the beginning is found a number of times in John s writings.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>In some instances this phrase is used in the absolute sense 1 John 1:1; 3:8 , but here in verses 5 and 6, as elsewhere John 15:27; 1 John 2:7 , it is used in the relative sense.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The commandment referred to in verses 5 and 6 is the commandment given by the Son that we should love one another John 13:34 .</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The Father commands us to walk in the truth to honor the Son, and the Son commands us to love one another to express Him.</S>
