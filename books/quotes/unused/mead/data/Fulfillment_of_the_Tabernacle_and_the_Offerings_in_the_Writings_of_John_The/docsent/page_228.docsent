   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>A BROAD SPAN</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The span of the things covered in the last two chapters of the Gospel of John is very broad.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>It begins with the discovery of the Lord's resurrection and ends with His coming back.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Between these two events are all the things related to the Christian life during the church age: seeking the Lord with love toward Him; seeing the Lord in resurrection; receiving the revelation of the issue of the Lord's resurrection concerning the brothers and the Father by experiencing His manifestation; meeting with the believers to enjoy the Lord's presence; being breathed on by the Lord with the Holy Spirit and being sent by the Lord with His commission and authority to represent Him; learning how to live by faith in the Lord and trust in Him for our daily living; loving the Lord with the natural strength dealt with; shepherding the flock for the building of the church; and practicing the Lord's invisible presence, in which some follow Him even to death to glorify God, not by self-will, but according to His leading, and some live until He comes back.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>At the beginning of chapter twenty the Lord's resurrection is discovered.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>At the end of chapter twenty-one there is a definite reference to the Lord's coming back.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Between these two events, the Lord's resurrection and His coming, we have various matters related to the Christian life during the church age.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>First, as exemplified by Mary the Magdalene, we have the matter of seeking the Lord with love for Him.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Mary certainly was one who loved the Lord and sought Him.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Because she sought Him in love, Mary saw the Lord in His resurrection and received the revelation concerning the issue of His resurrection regarding His brothers and our Father.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>What a great revelation this is!</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>We all need to see the revelation concerning the issue of Christ's resurrection the producing of His many brothers.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Because of the Lord's resurrection, God is our Father, and we have been begotten, regenerated, by Him to be His many sons.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>We need to receive this revelation through experiencing Christ's resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Furthermore, we need to meet with the brothers in the church to enjoy the Lord's presence and then be breathed on by the Lord to receive the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>This enjoyment of the Lord's presence and this receiving of the Holy Spirit take place in the church meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>We also need to be sent by the Lord with His commission and authority to represent Him.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>As those sent out by the Lord, we must learn to live by faith in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>We need to trust in Him for all the needs of our daily living.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Moreover, we should love the Lord, but we should not love Him with our natural strength.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>We should be those who have had the natural strength dealt with.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>No longer should we be like Peter before he denied the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>As we have seen, in chapter twenty-one Peter was reminded not to love the Lord Jesus with his natural strength.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>After reminding Peter of this, the Lord charged him to shepherd the flock for the building up of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>We also should carry out the shepherding of the sheep.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Finally, we need to practice the Lord's invisible presence either until we die to glorify God or until He comes back.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>We need to consider all these matters and then apply them to ourselves in our Christian experience.</S>
