<p>All that God is, is in His Son; and all that His Son is, is in the Spirit. Just as air is everywhere, so the Spirit is present in every place and at all times. He can reach any person in any place and at any time. When the Spirit enters a person, he will experience the Spirit&rsquo;s glorification of the Lord Jesus and the Spirit&rsquo;s conviction.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Spirit Glorifying the Lord Jesus</h2>
<p>The Spirit causes a believer to love the Lord Jesus, find his delight in Him, and desire to love, exalt, and please Him. This is the Spirit&rsquo;s glorification of the Lord Jesus within the believer (John 16:14). We should not rely on our feelings to determine whether or not the Spirit is in us. After hearing that the Spirit is in them, some believers try to feel the Spirit. We do not need to ask whether the Spirit is in us. We only need to ask how we treat the Lord Jesus. Loving Him and turning to Him prove that the Spirit is in us.</p>
<p>It is amazing that we do not feel the Spirit when He works in us; we only sense that the Lord Jesus is lovable, glorious, and sweet. The sense that the Lord Jesus is lovely and worthy to receive our love and adoration is a result of the operation of the Spirit in us.</p>
<p>There is no way to separate the Lord Jesus from the Spirit in our experience. We do not need to look for the Spirit. We only need to ask how we treat the Lord Jesus, that is, whether He has ground in us and whether we desire to love Him, exalt Him, and please Him. If our answer is yes, we should have the full assurance that the Spirit is within us.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Spirit Convicting People</h2>
<p>Furthermore, the Spirit causes a believer to see his corruptness. This is the Spirit&rsquo;s convicting (v. 8). We need to admit that we still have many improper things within us, such as sin, the world, temper, lusts, and the flesh. On the positive side, when the Spirit operates in us, He causes us to sense that the Lord is lovable, glorious, and sweet, but on the negative side, He causes us to see that we are corrupt. We will sense that we have disappointed our parents, that we are not humble toward our colleagues, and that we are not loyal to our boss. We will see that we are worldly, bad tempered, and fleshly. Then we will confess these sins. This experience demonstrates the Spirit&rsquo;s work in us. When the Spirit operates in us, we sense that the Lord Jesus is lovable and that we are corrupt. When we sense that we are corrupt, the Spirit is working to cleanse and purify us by dealing with all the improper things in us.</p>
<p>When the Spirit works in us, He causes us to sense the loveliness, glory, and sweetness of the Lord Jesus, and the Spirit causes us to hate our corruptness, sins, lusts, and the flesh. On one hand, we will love, glorify, and honor the Lord Jesus; on the other hand, we will confess our corruptness and sins. Such experiences prove that the Spirit has a special place in us. The more we revere the Lord Jesus and condemn ourselves, the more we will be filled with the Spirit.</p>
<p>The building of the church is the building of God with man, and it is altogether a matter in the Spirit. God is in His Son, His Son is realized as the Spirit, and the Spirit reaches us, enters into us, and dwells in our spirit. When He enters into us, He shows us the Lord&rsquo;s loveliness, and He causes us to judge and condemn ourselves in order to be cleansed from the improper things in our being. This is the work of the Triune God in us.</p>
<h2 class="head1">OUR RESPONSIBILITY&mdash;<br />
PRAYING WITH OUR SPIRIT</h2>
<p>Our responsibility is to pray with our spirit. When we sense that the Lord Jesus is lovely, we should pray. Some saints do not practice this. They often feel that the Lord Jesus is lovely and gracious, but they do not pray. When asked why they do not pray, they usually give two reasons: first, they feel that they are dull of speech and unable to pray; and second, they think that the Lord Jesus knows their hearts, so there is no need for them to pray.</p>
<p>Many years ago I gave a message in Shanghai concerning how to draw near to God and touch His presence. Afterward, a brother whom I knew came to me and said, &ldquo;Brother, the way you teach Christians to pray is too complicated. You say that we need to be calm, turn to our spirit, and pray. This is too troublesome. According to your way, it is difficult to be a Christian. I am a Christian, and I love the Lord very much, but I pray in my heart. The Lord knows me, so why should I have to tell Him how I feel?&rdquo; What he said seemed reasonable. When I considered this matter before the Lord, He showed me that even though we do not need to pray because He knows our heart, we will not be filled with Him if we do not pray. If we do not pray, we will be limited in our enjoyment, even to the point of being unable to sing Hallelujah. The more we pray, the more we will be filled with the Lord, be joyful, and be able to sing Hallelujah. The Lord does know our intentions, but if we do not pray, the Spirit will have little ground in us.</p>
<p>After seeing our need to pray, I asked the brother whether he was joyful and whether he sang. He replied that he was a businessman who dealt with money every day, so he could not be joyful. He also said that since the day he was saved, he had never said Hallelujah. I told him that prayer was the only way to be joyful and to sing; otherwise, he would be just like the unbelievers. He needed to turn his thoughts into prayer. When he sensed that the Lord Jesus is lovely, he should say, &ldquo;Lord Jesus, You are lovely.&rdquo; When he felt that the Lord had preserved him, he should say, &ldquo;Lord Jesus, thank You for keeping me in peace.&rdquo; If he would turn his feelings into prayer, he would be joyful.</p>
<p>Many Christians do not pray. Such Christians often quench the Spirit, and this offends the Lord. First Thessalonians 5:16-18 says, &ldquo;Always rejoice, unceasingly pray, in everything give thanks,&rdquo; and verse 19 says, &ldquo;Do not quench the Spirit.&rdquo; This shows that when we do not pray, we quench the Spirit; when we do not give thanks to the Lord, we quench the Spirit; and when we do not rejoice, we quench the Spirit.</p>
<p>Another brother said that he did not pray because he did not have the leading to pray. This word is not accurate. He does not pray because he quenches the moving of the Spirit, not because he does not have the leading of the Spirit. Seeing the Lord&rsquo;s loveliness and touching His grace are issues of the moving of the Holy Spirit. We should immediately turn these experiences into prayer. We can say, &ldquo;Lord, You are lovable,&rdquo; while we are hurrying on our way to work. Of course, it is better if we have time to be calm and worship the Lord. However, if we do not have such time, it is still good to pray in the midst of our business.</p>
<p>If we would pray more often, we would enjoy praying, and we would become skillful in praying. Initially, a brother might be able to pray only a few sentences, but gradually the length of his prayers will increase, he will become sensitive to his spirit, his thoughts will match the sense in his spirit, and he will have the utterance to express the sense in his spirit.</p>
<p>The moving of the Spirit within us causes us not only to see the Lord&rsquo;s loveliness but also to see our mistakes. A normal Christian is conscious of his mistakes. A Christian who is not conscious of his mistakes has a problem with the Lord. A normal Christian senses his mistakes and shortcomings. Whenever we see our mistakes and shortcomings, we need to confess. We should not say that we lack time. As soon as we sense a mistake, we need to confess it in prayer.</p>
<p>It is not difficult to pray; we only need to practice. Every believer always feels that the Lord is lovely, glorious, and sweet. A believer also senses his mistakes. He needs to turn these feelings into prayers of praise or confession. The more he prays, the better. If we would receive this fellowship and practice it, we will be blessed persons. We will experience our glorious Lord and taste His riches in our spirit. The more we pray, the more our spirit will be living, fresh, and strong. Moreover, the more we confess our sins, the more the Spirit will enlighten and search our inward parts; and the more thorough our confessions will be, and the more we will be filled with the Spirit. Through such a continuous cycle, we will become people who live in spirit and are full of the Spirit. The more we experience this cycle, the less we will despise and rebuke others; we will have fewer opinions, and we will be less contentious. We will be delivered not only from the world and sins but also from our narrowness and the self. Such deliverance does not come from listening to messages or from exhortations; it is the issue of prayer. Furthermore, we will be built together with the saints.</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_003.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_005.html">Next</a> </body></html>
