   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>In preaching the gospel we just need to choose one of the ten preceding subjects.</S>

   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>This will bring about a complete salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>In other words, no matter which way a sinner takes, he has to see that he has transgressed against God's law and has offended God Himself.</S>

   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>If the Holy Spirit has not yet done this work, we should speak to them until they have this realization.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>We should show them that they have offended God.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Otherwise, sooner or later they will have problems with their own salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>The work of an evangelist is to create a sense of these ten needs in man and then to show him the way of salvation.</S>
