   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>3.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Do Not Become a Cross to Your Children</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Two students were once talking to each other in school.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The girl said to her classmate, I know my father.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>He is willing to die for me.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Listen to what she said!</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>This is the comment of a child about her father.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Her father was a Christian.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>This was the kind of father he was to her.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The other girl was also from a Christian family.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Her father was harsh and lost his temper with his daughter easily.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Once she heard a sermon at school.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>When she arrived home, her father asked her what she had learned.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>She answered, I now know that the Lord has given you to me to be my cross.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Both fathers were Christians.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>But what a difference between them!</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>I would say to the parents: Be slow to demand obedience from your children.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Instead, first demand that you yourselves be good parents before the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>If you are not good parents, you can never be good Christians.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>God does not give us children for the purpose of making us their crosses.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>God gave us children so that we will learn to honor their freedom, personality, and soul before the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>E. Not Provoking Children to Anger</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Fifth, Paul showed us an important thing that parents should not do they should not provoke their children to anger Eph 6:4 .</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>1.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Not Exercising Authority Excessively</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>What does it mean to provoke children to anger?</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>It means the excessive use of authority.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>One can overpower his children with physical strength.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>This is always possible because parents are stronger than their children.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Or one can try to subdue his children with financial power.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>He may say, If you do not obey me, I will not give you any money.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>If you do not listen to me, I will take away your food and clothing.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Since the children depend on him for their living, he overpowers them with his money by threatening to withdraw his support.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Some parents dominate their children with physical power, and others dominate them with their iron will.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>This can provoke their children to anger.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>When they are provoked, they will wait for the chance for their freedom.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>One day they will break their bondage and seek total freedom.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>I know a brother whose father gambled, smoked, and behaved rudely at home.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>He embezzled public funds and was involved in many other unscrupulous businesses.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>But he still went to church, and he wanted all of his children to go to church.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>He would rebuke and punish them severely if they did not go.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>He ruined his children s taste for the family, all the while insisting that they go to church.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Later, the brother said, I vowed that when I grew up one day, I would never go to church.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>As soon as I could support myself, I was going to turn away from the church.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Even though he swore this way, eventually he was saved.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Thank God!</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Otherwise, he would have become another anti-Christian proponent.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>This was a very serious matter.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>The father did not try to make his children love him, yet he demanded that his children go to church.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>This never works.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>This provokes children to anger.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Parents should not exercise excessive authority over their children or provoke them to anger.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>They must never make their children hardened and rebellious toward them.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>I remember another man who is not saved.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Not long ago I saw him.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>He was forced to read the Bible when he was growing up at home, and he was forced to read the Bible when he went to a parochial school.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>I am not saying that parents should not charge their children to read the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>I am saying that you must attract them and be an example to them yourself.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>It will never work if you merely tell them that the Lord is precious, yet constantly abuse them.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>There was a mother who was a nominal Christian.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>She had a terrible temper.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>She insisted that her son read the Bible and go to a parochial school.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>One day he asked when he could stop reading the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>His mother replied, When you finish secondary school, you can stop reading the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>On the day that he received his high school diploma, he took his three copies of the Bible and burned them in the backyard.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>You must draw children in a natural way.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Otherwise, when their anger is provoked they may do anything.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>You want them to be good, but they will rebel against you when they become free.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>This is what is meant by provoking children to anger.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Do not provoke your children to anger.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>You must learn to be proper parents, to have love, tenderness, and a proper testimony before them.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>You must also be an attraction to them.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Do not exercise your authority excessively.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>Authority can only be exercised under self-control.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>If you are excessive in your use of authority, you will stifle your relationship with your children.</S>
