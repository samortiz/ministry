   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE DEIFICATION OF MAN</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In the second to the fifth centuries, the church fathers found three high mysteries in the Bible: 1 the Triune God, the Divine Trinity, the highest mystery; 2 the person of Christ; and 3 the deification of man that man could become God in life and in nature but not in the Godhead.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>However, after the fifth century the truth concerning this last mystery was gradually lost.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Using the Nicene Creed, today s Christianity affirms the first two mysteries the mystery of the Divine Trinity and the mystery of Christ s person but much of Christianity does not see anything about the third mystery the mystery of God becoming man that man may become God in life and in nature.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>There is no teaching regarding this among most Christians today.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>But I feel strongly the Lord is going to recover this truth.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>As far as the truth is concerned, this may be the last item that the Lord needs to recover.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>REVOLUTIONIZED BY REALIZING</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>THAT WE ARE GOD-MEN</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>When we think of ourselves as God-men, this thinking, this realization, revolutionizes us in our daily experience.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>For example, a brother may be unhappy with his wife.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>But he remembers that he is a God-man, and immediately his attitude is changed.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Then he will desire to be a God-man husband.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>We need to understand that to be a part of mankind is to be something negative.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>In God s view mankind is a negative term referring to fallen man.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>As believers in Christ and children of God, we are not mankind we are God-man kind.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>To realize this is to be changed, even revolutionized.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>When we realize that we are God-men, we will say, Lord, You are the first God-man, and we are the many God-men following You.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>You lived a human life, not by Your human life but by God s divine life to express Him.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>His attributes became Your virtues.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>You were here on this earth dying every day.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>You were crucified to live.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Lord, You are my life today and You are my person.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>You are just me.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>I therefore must die.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>I need to be conformed to Your death.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>I have to be crucified to die every day to live a God-man s life, a human life yet not by my human life but by the divine life, with Your life and Your nature as my constitution to express You in Your divine attributes, which become my human virtues.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>This makes us not just a Christian or a believer in Christ but a God-man, one kind with God.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>This is the highest point of God s gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>PREACHING THE TRUTH THAT GOD BECAME A MAN</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>THAT MAN MAY BECOME GOD IN LIFE AND IN NATURE AND LIVING THE LIFE OF A GOD-MAN TO BRING IN</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>A NEW REVIVAL AND TO END THIS AGE</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>According to this gospel we were fallen, yet Christ died for us.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>If we believe in Him and receive Him, we will have the eternal life to be the sons of God.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Christians today admit that all the believers in Christ are the sons of God or the children of God, but they do not dare admit that the believers in Christ are God.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>At the end of this age, we are teaching and preaching the truth that God became a man in order to make man God, the same as He is in life and in nature but not in the Godhead.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>It is a great blessing to hear this truth.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>After hearing that God wants a group of God-men, how can you be content to be anything else?</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>What do you want to be?</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Do you want to be a typical Chinese or a typical American?</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Do you want to be merely a Christian or a believer in Christ?</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>We should all declare that we want to live the life of a God-man.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Eventually, the God-men will be the victors, the overcomers, the Zion within Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>This will bring in a new revival which has never been seen in history, and this will end this age.</S>
