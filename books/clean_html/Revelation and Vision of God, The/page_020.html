<p>From then on the creed had been revised and expanded again and again until A.D. 553, when a creed that was richer and more exhaustive than the previous ones was produced. This creed was called “The Athanasian Creed,” and its contents are as follows:<ol class="decimal"><li>Whosoever will be saved, before all things it is necessary that he hold the catholic faith.</li><li>Which faith except every one do keep whole and undefiled, without doubt he shall perish everlastingly.</li><li>But this is the catholic faith: That we worship one God in trinity, and trinity in unity;</li><li>Neither confounding the persons: nor dividing the substance.</li><li>For there is one person of the Father: another of the Son: and another of the Holy Ghost.</li><li>But the Godhead of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost is all one: the glory equal, the majesty co-eternal.</li><li>Such as the Father is, such is the Son, and such is the Holy Ghost.</li><li>The Father is uncreated: the Son is uncreated: and the Holy Ghost is uncreated.</li><li>The Father is immeasurable: the Son is immeasurable: the Holy Ghost is immeasurable.</li><li>The Father eternal: the Son eternal: and the Holy Ghost eternal.</li><li>And yet there are not three eternals; but one eternal.</li><li>As also there are not three uncreated: nor three immeasurable, but one uncreated: and one immeasurable.</li><li>So likewise the Father is almighty: the Son almighty: and the Holy Ghost almighty.</li><li>And yet there are not three Almighties: but one Almighty.</li><li>So the Father is God: the Son is God: and the Holy Ghost is God.</li><li>And yet there are not three Gods; but one God.</li><li>So the Father is Lord: the Son Lord: and the Holy Ghost Lord.</li><li>And yet not three Lords; but one Lord.</li><li>For like as we are compelled by the Christian verity to acknowledge every Person by himself to be God and Lord:</li><li>So are we forbidden by the catholic religion to say, there are three Gods, or three Lords.</li><li>The Father is made of none; neither created; nor begotten.</li><li>The Son is of the Father alone: not made; nor created; but begotten.</li><li>The Holy Ghost is of the Father and the Son: neither made; neither created; nor begotten; but proceeding.</li><li>Thus there is one Father, not three Fathers: one Son, not three Sons: one Holy Ghost, not three Holy Ghosts.</li><li>And in this Trinity none is before or after another: none is greater or less than another.</li><li>But the whole three Persons are co-eternal, and co-equal.</li><li>So that in all things, as aforesaid, the Unity in Trinity, and the Trinity in Unity, is to be worshipped.</li><li>He therefore that will be saved, must thus think of the Trinity.</li><li>Furthermore it is necessary to everlasting salvation, that we believe also rightly in the Incarnation of our Lord Jesus Christ.</li><li>Now the right faith is, that we believe and confess, that our Lord Jesus Christ, the Son of God, is God and Man.</li><li>God, of the substance of the Father, begotten before the worlds: and Man, of the substance of his mother, born in the world.</li><li>Perfect God: and perfect Man, of a reasonable soul and human flesh subsisting.</li><li>Equal to the Father as touching His Godhead: inferior to the Father as touching his Manhood.</li><li>Who although He be God and Man; yet He is not two, but one Christ.</li><li>One; not by conversion of the Godhead into flesh; but by assumption of the Manhood into God.</li><li>One altogether, not by confusion of substance; but by unity of person.</li><li>For as the reasonable soul and flesh is one man; so God and Man is one Christ.</li><li>Who suffered for our salvation: descended into hades: rose again the third day from the dead.</li><li>He ascended into heaven: He sitteth on the right hand of the Father God, the Father almighty:</li><li>From whence He shall come to judge the quick and the dead.</li><li>At whose coming all men must rise again with their bodies;</li><li>And shall give account for their own works.</li><li>And they that have done good shall go into life everlasting; but they that have done evil, into everlasting fire.</li><li>This is the catholic faith; which except a man believe truly and firmly, he cannot be saved.</li></ol><p>Glory to the Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghost. So it was, and is, and ever shall be, without end forever. Amen.
