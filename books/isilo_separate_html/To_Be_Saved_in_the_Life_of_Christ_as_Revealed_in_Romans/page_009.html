Individualism is the philosophy, thought, doctrine, and principle of not being one with others. When not going along with others and not being one with others becomes a principle or philosophy, that is individualism. Some brothers or sisters may respect the elders and may realize that the church needs a group of brothers to take care of the administration of the church. But often these same brothers or sisters may not agree with the elders or may refuse to be one with them. Such individualism is difficult to deal with. Actually, each one of us has this problem of individualism. In order to be built into the Body of Christ, we must overthrow individualism. Conversely, if we are built up in the Body of Christ, we will be delivered from the individualism of our natural life.<h2 class=head2>Through Our Cooperation by Presenting Our Bodies as a Living Sacrifice</h2><p>We are built up in the Body of Christ, saved from the individualism of our natural life (Rom. 12:5), through our cooperation by presenting our bodies as a living sacrifice (Rom. 12:1). In the past five years I discovered that the primary frustration to the Lord in carrying out His new way is not our agreement or disagreement with the new way. The main frustration and difficulty in carrying out the new way is twofold: first, we do not present our body, and second, we do not like to cooperate with others. If we present our bodies and go along with others, we will be in the new way. It is not enough to agree with the new way. We must also present our bodies as a sacrifice to the Lord and present our bodies to go along with others. This is the building up of the Body of Christ, and this is the new way.<p>In one locality, I know a number of the saints very well. Many of these saints agree with the new way, but there is still very little actual practice of the new way among them. The reason for this is that the saints are short in the presenting of their bodies to the Lord as a sacrifice for the new way, and they are also short in going along with others. If the saints would present themselves and go along with one another, immediately there would be the practice of the new way. To visit people with the gospel is not a small thing. To visit people requires that we present our bodies to the Lord as a sacrifice and that we go along with others. When we go to visit others, the three or four of us that go together should be as one man. In this way our visiting people with the gospel becomes very effective.<h2 class=head2>Through Our Cooperation by Not Thinking More Highly of Ourselves than What We Are</h2><p>We are built up in the Body of Christ through our cooperation by not thinking more highly of ourselves than what we are (Rom. 12:3-4). We think more highly of ourselves than what we are. For this reason, we see very little of the building up of the Body of Christ and very little actual practice of the new way.<br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_008.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_010.html">Next</a> </body></html>
