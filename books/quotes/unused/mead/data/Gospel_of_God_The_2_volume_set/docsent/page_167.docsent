   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>It is a simple thing for us to make a decision because we change so easily.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>One minute we can be in heaven, and the next minute we can be in hell.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>We may change once a day for the three hundred and sixty-five days of the year.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>But since God is God, His foreknowledge and predestination cannot be shaken.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The God whom we know and whom we worship cannot change what He has decided.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Because He has the foreknowledge, the predestination, and the calling, our justification is eternal.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>It is a small thing for us to lose our justification.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>But it is a great thing for God to lose His foreknowledge.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>For us to lose our justification does not mean much.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>But for God to make a mistake in foreknowing and calling us is a serious thing.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>God cannot annul justification without affecting His foreknowledge, predestination, and calling.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>If you take away one ring, the other three rings will not stand.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Whenever our salvation is lost, God's foreknowledge, predestination, and calling are all negated.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>In addition, there is another item.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The Lord says, "Those whom He justified, these He also glorified" v. 30 . Unless God brings those whom He justified into glory, His work is not complete.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>If we cannot get into the new heaven and the new earth, and if we cannot enter into eternal glory, God's work is not complete.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The last ring of God's work is glory.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Until we are in glory, God's work is not complete.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>This is God's Word.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>What are we going to do with it?</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>We cannot set it aside.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>God says that those whom He justified will enter into glory unconditionally.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>He does not say that those who are justified will enter into glory if they have good works.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>He does not say that only those whose works are approved can enter into glory.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Neither does God say that those whom He justified must also be considered saved by man before they can enter into glory.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>There are no such conditions.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>All of the things that are mentioned here are related to God.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>It is God who foreknew.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>It is God who predestinated.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>It is God who destined us to be like His Son and to be conformed to the image of the Son of God.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>It is God who has called us and justified us.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>It is God who will bring us, the justified ones, into glory.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>It is also God who will bring us into the new heaven and the new earth to inherit the eternal glory.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Which of the rings is the greatest in the Bible?</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Some say that glory is the greatest.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Others say that foreknowledge is the greatest.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Actually, there is no difference between them; every one is the same.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>We cannot say one is greater than the others.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>As many as God foreknew, that many are marked out.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>As many as are marked out, that many are called.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>As many as are called, that many are justified.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>As many as are justified, that many will enter into glory.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Hallelujah!</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Can God foreknow that one hundred will be saved, but mark out only ninety, call only eighty, justify fifty, and merely bring ten into glory?</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>God cannot change.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>It is impossible to mark out many and call a few.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Please remember that the words "those whom" in these verses convey this meaning.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>"Those whom" He foreknew, these He also predestinated.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>"Those whom" He predestinated, these He also called.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>"Those whom" He called, these He also justified.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>"Those whom" He justified, these He also glorified.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>These "those whoms" join the five rings together.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>In the original language, the word "these" means "these people."</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>So, those whom He foreknew, "these people" He also marked out.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Those whom He marked out, "these people" He also called.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Those whom He called, "these people" He also justified.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Those whom He justified, "these people" He also glorified.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>We cannot be short of any one item.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>These are all works of God.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>If they were our works, we could get some saved by mistake because we do not know which ones should be saved.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>But if they are God's works, there can be no mistake.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>If we do not know God and His works, we may still think that there is the possibility of losing some people.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>But if we know God and His works, we will realize that no one can be subtracted or added.</S>
