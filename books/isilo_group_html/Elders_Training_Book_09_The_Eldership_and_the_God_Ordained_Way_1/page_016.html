This is to go with the Christ who has all the authority. We must be filled with the Spirit, so that we can speak at any time with boldness. That boldness is a strong sign that we are experiencing the outpoured Spirit.</P><P>In order to be prevailing in the gospel, we must be people who live a revived life, an overcoming life. As regenerated persons, we need to be filled with the Spirit inwardly and outwardly. Then when we go to visit people, we go with Christ as the Spirit. Christ is not only our power but also our authority. When we speak to people, Christ speaks in our speaking. When we are filled with the Spirit, we have the boldness and the utterance. We can speak the same word in two ways. One way is by ourselves. The other way is to speak with Christ. This makes a great difference.</P><P>Some saints have asked how a person could be regenerated within fifteen minutes. But I would ask how much time is needed for a person to be regenerated. Many years ago there was a Norwegian missionary in China who was very powerful and prevailing in preaching regeneration. Many people were regenerated through her preaching. After her message, she would go to the entrance to meet people as they left and check with them one by one as to whether or not they had been regenerated. Even many pastors at that time were not regenerated.</P><P>Once she was preaching in a certain denomination where the pastor was an unregenerated opium smuggler. After her message she greeted this pastor at the entrance and asked him whether or not he had been regenerated. He said that he had, but this missionary replied that by the tone of his voice and by the expression on his face, she knew that he had not truly been regenerated. He was insulted by having such a word spoken to him in the presence of the members of his congregation. When he went back home, filled with hatred for this Norwegian missionary, he plotted to kill her. As he was making his evil plans, the Holy Spirit said to him, "See how evil you are!" The Holy Spirit worked upon him; he repented with tears and even rolled on the floor as he made his confession to the Lord.</P><P>His experience and the experience of many others, in accordance with the truth of the Scriptures, show that regeneration is instantaneous. But to help people experience regeneration, we need the Spirit. If we go out by ourselves and in ourselves, we may talk fluently to someone for a long time with no result. People may be convinced by us and still not be regenerated. We need to get ourselves prepared with the infilling and outpouring of the Spirit. When we go in this way, others will be regenerated. Whether or not others get regenerated depends upon what kind of persons we are when we go out.</P><P>To take an easy way in the Lord's present move does not work. Even the first item, the preaching of the gospel, is not an easy thing. It requires us to live a victorious life. By what way can we live such a life? There is no other way except by contacting the Lord. First, we must enjoy Him every morning. We have to spend a little time every morning to be with the Lord, to enjoy the Lord. Living a revived life enables us to bring others to the Lord so that they can be regenerated.</P><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_015.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_017.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Elders' Training, Book 09: The Eldership and the God-Ordained Way (1) &nbsp; pg 16</div><br></body></html>
