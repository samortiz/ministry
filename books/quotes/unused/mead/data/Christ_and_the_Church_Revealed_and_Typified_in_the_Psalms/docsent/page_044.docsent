   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>After I was saved, I heard many messages and read many books which told how to be a victorious Christian.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>These messages and books indicated that I had many enemies: the world is my enemy; my self is my enemy; my temper, my hatred, and all my problems are my enemies.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Then these messages and books indicated many wonderful ways to overcome these enemies.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Some said that I must pray much; others said that I must pray with fasting; still others exhorted me to pray with fasting and without sleep.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>But none of these ways worked.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Then I was told that Christ was crucified on the cross, and all the enemies including myself were crucified there too; now I must reckon upon this.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>I tell you, I tried to reckon for a long time, but I never succeeded.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>I filled many notebooks with these ways and methods of being an overcoming Christian.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>One day I threw them all away.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>There were so many good instructions, concepts, teachings, and suggestions, and I greatly appreciated them.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>But one day I began to realize that by coming into the local church and staying in the local church, every problem is solved and every enemy is overcome.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>It was so wonderful; I cannot tell you how wonderful it was!</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>When I stayed in the local church, the world was gone, my temper was gone, and my problems disappeared.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>I am speaking from actual experience; I have been learning this for over thirty years.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>I have tried many methods and ways.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>I searched the Bible to find the will of God.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Eventually that did not work, and I found nothing.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>But when I came into the local church and stayed there, the will of God was spontaneously made clear.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>I tried to solve my problems as an individual again and again, but could never overcome.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>When I stayed in the local church, however, all the enemies fled.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>I had no intention of defeating them; they all fled.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>From my experience I can boldly testify and declare that the best way to solve your problems, to overcome your enemies, to know the Lord's will, and to obtain the Lord's blessing is simply to stay in the local church and praise the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Just do it.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Just try it.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>This one kind of medicine heals all kinds of diseases.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>In the early years of my ministry I had many points to pass on to others.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>A sister came to me thirty-five years ago and asked how she could overcome her temper.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>I replied, "Sister, firstly, you must do this; secondly, you must do that; thirdly fourthly fifthly sixthly until there were twelve points.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Go home and practice all these twelve points, and you will overcome your temper."</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>It was a hard job!</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>About ten years later, others came with the same question.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The number of points was then reduced to about six.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Then after a few years, the points were reduced further to three.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Today, I will give you not twelve points, not six, not three, but only one: just come into the local church, stay in the local church, and praise the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>All your problems will be solved spontaneously.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Believe me.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>I cannot tell you what kind of revelation this is to me.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>I would tell the entire universe that I have the secret.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>It is so prevailingly, tremendously effective.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Come to the local church and praise the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Hallelujah, hallelujah!</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>For all your problems, the best way to pray to the Lord is to come to the local church and praise the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>In God's dwelling place, in the local church, the Lord does not supply us little by little.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>He loads us with good; He applies His victory over all our enemies.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>In the years 1939 and 1940 Brother Watchman Nee saw the Body of Christ with great clarity.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>I have mentioned how he released some messages on this matter, telling us definitely that spiritual warfare is not an individual matter, but a matter of the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>If you as an individual attempt to defeat the enemy, you will to a great extent be defeated by him.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>You must realize that the battle has already been won.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>There is no need for you to fight it.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>If you simply place yourself in the Body in a practical way and remain in the Body, the victory is yours.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>We were raised up by the Lord in 1920.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Before 1940, we never had a large number for baptism.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>There may have been thirty-seven or thirty-eight at one baptism that was all.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>The number was always small, because before 1940 we always preached the Gospel in an individual way.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>The Lord had not yet revealed the way of preaching the Gospel as a church, the whole church preaching together.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>In 1940 we began, and in January we had more than one hundred baptized at once.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>In February another hundred were baptized, and in March another hundred.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>We had seen that the effective way to preach the Gospel was not as individuals, but as the church.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>If you attempt to convince your friends as an individual, it is rather difficult; but if you ask some brothers to help you bring your unbelieving friend to the gathering, there will be no need for you to preach.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>He will be saved you will see.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>When you bring all the problems to the church, they are spontaneously solved.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Do not keep your friends in your hands in an individual way; bring them into the church.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>In the church God loads us with good; in the church He applies His victory.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Are you sorrowful?</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Then what should you do?</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Yes, come to the church meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Do not attempt to encourage yourself and overcome your problems.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Bring all your sorrows to the local church, and tell the enemy Satan to go with you to the meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>If your wife is angry, just tell her, "Dear, let us go to the church."</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Don't try to solve your problems in your home and then come to the church.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>You will be frustrated.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Tell all the enemies and all the problems, "Come with me to the meeting."</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>I have had many experiences like this.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>As soon as I have come into the entrance of the meeting hall, the enemies and problems have fled.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>They followed me to the meeting, but when I entered the meeting, they turned and left.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>I have learned how to save much time in reading books.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>Coming to one meeting is better than reading ten books.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>Hallelujah!</S>
