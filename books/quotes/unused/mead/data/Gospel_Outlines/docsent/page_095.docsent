   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Subject Ninety-four IMPOSSIBLE WITH MEN</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>BUT POSSIBLE WITH GOD</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The Fourth Contrast in Luke Scripture: Luke 18:18-27; 19:1-10 Two rich men In Luke 18 a ruler is mentioned who was a rich man.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In Luke 19 a chief publican is mentioned.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>He was also a rich man.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The rich man mentioned in Luke 18 was a young, moral official, respected by men.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The rich man in Luke 19 was an old, despised official, rejected by the Jews of that time.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Both of them loved their wealth dearly.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The honorable rich man The young ruler in Luke 18 was one who was wealthy, moral, and seemingly benevolent.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>So the question he asked the Lord Jesus was concerning what to do in order to inherit eternal life.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Because he was wealthy and charitable, he paid attention to the matter of good work.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The Lord Jesus showed him that to call the Lord good is to acknowledge that the Lord is God, because only God is good.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>This means that the Lord was also showing this rich man that he was not such a good man, but a sinner.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Then the Lord brought him to the realization of his lack.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>He felt that he had kept all the commandments, but the Lord said that he lacked one thing; that is, to sell all that he had and distribute it to the poor and then come and follow the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>What he lacked was to dissolve his wealth and care for the poor on the one hand, and to follow the Lord on the other.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Many thought that they were good.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The Lord often brought them to realize what they lacked.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>You might have done ten good things, but the Lord would say that you still lack one.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Maybe you love your parents, but you lack loving your brothers.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Or maybe you are humble, but you lack patience.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>When that rich man heard what he lacked, he went away sorrowful.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>He went away because: 1 toward men, he was wealthy but really not charitable, because he could not distribute his wealth to the poor; and 2 toward God, he had an idol in his heart.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The first of the ten commandments is not to have any idol before God, and next is to love thy neighbor.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Outwardly he had obeyed the ten commandments, but in reality he did not obey them at all.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The Lord was showing him that he had transgressed against the law.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>According to the written letters you may have obeyed the ten commandments, but according to the reality, no one can obey the ten commandments.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Between you and God, are there absolutely no idols in your heart?</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Toward men, is your heart full of love?</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Since no man can attain to that level, it is impossible with men.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>It is impossible with men because men are rich.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>When a man is rich, he has an idol toward God, and he has no love toward men.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Your knowledge, wealth, and good family life are your riches.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>When you did not know so much, you had love toward men.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>But now that you know so much, you have no love toward men.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>So the ones who feel rich can never be saved.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>This is impossible with men.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The despised rich man The rich man mentioned in Luke 19 lived in Jericho.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Jericho was a sinful and cursed place.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>But Jesus passed through there.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Jesus would not pass through the place where the honorable rich man lived, but today He is coming to the fallen, sinful place.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Here the rich man was rich but not good.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>He specialized in scandal and deceit.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>He was there not to ask Jesus questions but to see Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>To ask Jesus questions is like the study of Jesus as religion.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>This cannot save you.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Look at Jesus, and you will be saved.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Because all were crowding Jesus, Jesus was concealed.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Today Jesus is also concealed by so many false Christians and Catholics.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>You must overcome the concealing.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>There are two reasons for this concealing: 1 there were too many people, and 2 he was short in stature.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>To be short in stature is something natural; to be too crowded is environmental and speaks of a man-made situation.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>To overcome these overshadowings you need to run ahead of the crowd.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Do not be running blindly in their midst, lest you run into hell with them.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>You need to pass them, leaving behind those false Catholics and false Christians.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Also, you need to climb up the tree in order to overcome your natural problem.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Though short in stature, once he climbed up a sycamore tree he could see what others could not.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>He really knew how to do business.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Some people may have heard the gospel over a hundred times and still not be saved, but he only heard the message for a few minutes, and he was saved.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>If you don t know how to read the Bible, and you ask someone else to read it for you, that someone is like your sycamore tree.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>If you don t know how to pray, and you ask someone else to help you to pray, that person is like your sycamore tree.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Or like today with so many people around, you hesitate to get saved; but you would wait until most are gone and would stay around to have some talk and prayer, this will be like climbing up the sycamore tree.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>If you stay in the midst of the crowd, you may be listening to the gospel all your life and still not be saved.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>But if you would run ahead and climb up the sycamore tree, you will be saved.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>He wanted to see Jesus, but actually Jesus saw him first.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>When Jesus came to that place, He looked up and saw him.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>He called him by name and said to him, Zaccheus, make haste, and come down.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>When you believe in the Lord, right away you will sense that the Lord is calling your name.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>He calls your name because He knows you.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>You are saved when the Lord calls you.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>The Lord knows your living situation.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>He also knows what sins you have committed.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Because He knows you, He calls your name.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>Among so many people, Jesus only called Zaccheus, because Zaccheus had a heart for Him.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>When he heard Jesus, he received Him joyfully.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>Have you ever received Jesus?</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>Have you let Him live in you?</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>The first rich man only studied the truth, but this rich man received Jesus into him.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>Emphasize the words receive and live.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>After he received Jesus into him, something happened.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>Immediately he said, Lord, Jesus became his Lord the half of my goods I give to the poor; and if I have wrongfully exacted aught of any man, I restore fourfold.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>Now he is rich and charitable.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>He has forsaken the idol.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>This power did not come from himself but came as a result of his receiving Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>The Lord said, Today is salvation come to this house.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>Where Jesus is, there is salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>Mere letters are something dead; the more you study them the more you are dead.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>But, as soon as Jesus comes in, man is saved.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>It is possible with God.</S>
