   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>There is a greater contention about the authorship of the book of Job The things recorded in this book took place before the time of Moses and may have been concurrent with Abraham, which is about two thousand years before Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Some have said it was written by Elihu, and some have said that Moses was probably the author.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Among the Psalms there are some that do not mention any author, but the authorship of most of them is identified.</S>

   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Therefore, at least seven authors were clearly indicated.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The sons of Korah are plural in number in the manuscript, and this may therefore refer to more than one person.</S>

   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>They did not want to divulge their own names.</S>
