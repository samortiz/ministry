   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>BEING CALLED TO CALL ON THE LORD</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Verse 2 of chapter one continues to say, "With all those who call upon the name of our Lord Jesus Christ."</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>We have to call upon the name of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>We have been called to call.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>We are the called ones, and we are the calling ones.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>As to our position we are the called ones; as to our situation we are the calling ones.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Day by day we call, saying, "O Lord Jesus!</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>O Lord Jesus!</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Jesus Lord!"</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>We are the calling ones, all the time making a cry.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Even when we visit our relatives, we have to be the calling ones, all the day calling on the name of the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>OUR CALLING ON THE LORD BEING OUR BREATHING</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>To call on the Lord is to enjoy the Lord, to breathe the Lord in. Calling is just breathing.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Jeremiah was designated the "weeping prophet."</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>After the book of Jeremiah, he felt he was not finished, so he wrote Lamentations as a weeping book.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>In this weeping book there are two wonderful, joyful verses: "I called upon Your name, O Jehovah, / From the lowest pit.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>/ You have heard my voice; do not hide / Your ear at my breathing, at my cry" 3:55-56 .</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Our calling is our breathing.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>We have to call on the name of the Lord because to call on the Lord is to breathe.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Sometimes our dear husband or wife or our children put us into "the lowest pit."</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Whenever you get into "the lowest pit," do not murmur or complain.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Simply call, "O Lord Jesus," and you will be in the third heaven.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>To call on the Lord is just to breathe Him in. Verse 56 says, "Do not hide / Your ear at my breathing, at my cry." The Lord turns His ear to our breathing.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>This spiritual breathing is our calling, "O Lord Jesus, O Lord Jesus."</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>To call on the Lord is to take the Lord in. First Corinthians 15:45b is a very important verse which tells us, "The last Adam became a life-giving Spirit." Spirit in Greek is pneuma, the word for breath.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Therefore, this verse may be translated as, "The last Adam became a life-giving Breath."</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Today Christ is the Breath, the Air, the Spirit, the life-giving Pneuma so we can breathe Him in. The way to participate in Christ and enjoy Him is to call on Him.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Because He is the Breath, to call on Him is to breathe Him as the Breath into us.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Whenever we feel lonely, we should call on the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Right away we will have the sensation that the Lord is with us.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The more we call on Him, the more He is with us and the more we enjoy His presence.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>This is because the Lord is the Breath.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>When we breathe deeply by calling on the Lord, we have a refreshing sensation within.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>To call "O Lord Jesus" is refreshing and spiritually enjoyable because when we call on the Lord, we breathe Him in. He is the Breath; He is the Air; He is the life-giving Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>OUR CALLING BEING THE KEY FOR ENTERING INTO THE RICHES OF CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>First Corinthians clearly tells us that Christ is the power of God and the wisdom of God to the called ones 1:24 .</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>He is also the Passover and the Feast of Unleavened Bread 5:7b-8 .</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The only way to enjoy such a Christ is to call on Him.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>This book is in the hands of all Christians, and I believe most Christians have read it.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Very few, however, have seen the matter of calling on the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>We all must know that this is the key to get into the riches of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>If we have not seen calling on the Lord, we do not have the key.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>This may be compared to having a wonderful building but no key.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>We can appreciate the building, but we cannot enter into it.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>In Christianity certain teachers teach people that unto us, both Jews and Greeks, Christ is the power of God and the wisdom of God.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Such teachers may present a picture of a wonderful "building," but where is the entrance?</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Most of them do not know.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>People may talk much about Christ as power and wisdom, but how can we get into Christ?</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>The key to entering into such a Christ is to call, "O Lord Jesus!"</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>The fundamentalist teaching in Christianity tells us that as long as we believe in Christ, we are in Christ and we have everything.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Fundamentalist teaching is objective.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>It is wonderful, but merely "in the air."</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>The Pentecostal teaching tells us that we have nothing until we speak in tongues.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Nothing is ours; we even have not been saved and regenerated.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Therefore, we have to pray, seek, fast, and wait until some great power falls upon us, and then we start to turn our tongue, exercise our jaw, and speak anything but English.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Neither teaching is accurate.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>The fundamentalist teachings are too much at one extreme, and the Pentecostal teachings are too much at the other extreme.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>We have to come back from both extremes.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Forget about the Pentecostal teachings and forget about the fundamentalist teachings.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Come back to the pure word of the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>The pure Word says that the Lord is "rich to all who call upon Him" Rom 10:12 .</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>It is so easy.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>If we just call on the Lord, all the riches of Christ are ours.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>There is no doubt about this, but we have to participate.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>The manna comes down from heaven, but we have to go and pick it up.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>In the morning someone may serve us breakfast, but we have to go to the table and use our hands and mouth to eat.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>We cannot say that because everything is on the table, it is ours.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>The more we say it is good enough that it is on the table, the more it is not enough.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>After we say, "Good enough," for ten days, we will be ready for a funeral.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>We need to eat.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Yes, all the riches of Christ are ours, but we may not participate in them.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>There is much on the table, but only that which we take into us is really ours.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>There may be thirty pounds of beef on the table, but if we eat only two and a half ounces, only that much is ours.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>We have to participate and eat.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>The way to eat Jesus and participate in Him is to call, "O Lord Jesus!"</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>There is no other way.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>Romans 10:12 does not say that the Lord is rich unto all that merely believe on Him.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>Merely to believe on Him is not enough.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>If we only believe that a meal which has been prepared for us is good, the cook may say, "Silly brothers, I don't care to see that you believe.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>I like to see that you eat.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>I don't care whether you believe this food is good or not.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>I don't care even if you complain.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>As long as you eat, that is good enough."</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>Merely to believe in the Lord and to love Him does not work.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>Only one thing works: to call, "O Lord Jesus!"</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>Try to call in this way.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>To be sure, this will cause us to reject all the fundamentalist teachings.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>We may tell others, "I don't care for this teaching.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>I only care for calling, O Lord Jesus!'"</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>After calling for ten minutes, we may tell the Pentecostal teachers, "I don't need to wait, and I don't need to fast.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>After calling on the name of the Lord for ten minutes, I can go to breakfast, because I have enjoyed Him."</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>Regardless of whether you are old or young, I would challenge and encourage you all to do this.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>Try it tomorrow morning for ten minutes.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>After calling on the Lord for ten minutes, you will be on fire.</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>Hallelujah, we have the entrance, and we have the key!</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>This little key truly works.</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>The Lord is rich to all who call upon Him!</S>
   <S PAR='98' RSNT='1' SNO='98'>First Corinthians 1:2b says "With all those who call upon the name of our Lord Jesus Christ in every place, who is theirs and ours."</S>
   <S PAR='99' RSNT='1' SNO='99'>Christ is our portion, yours and mine.</S>
   <S PAR='100' RSNT='1' SNO='100'>The way to participate in our portion is by calling on Him.</S>
   <S PAR='101' RSNT='1' SNO='101'>This is wonderful.</S>
   <S PAR='102' RSNT='1' SNO='102'>By calling in this way we are truly feasting, not fasting, day by day.</S>
   <S PAR='103' RSNT='1' SNO='103'>Our Christian life is a feasting life.</S>
   <S PAR='104' RSNT='1' SNO='104'>Day by day we enjoy Christ as a feast.</S>
