<h2 class="head1">THE EARTH COVERED WITH THE EXPRESSION<br />OF CHRIST&rsquo;S VIRTUES</h2><p>Christ&rsquo;s train envelopes the whole earth. First this train was in the heavens. Then it descended to Jerusalem and spread to Antioch, Philippi, Corinth, and Rome. Eventually, it spread to Asia and then to the western hemisphere. Now the long train of Christ is wrapping the globe. Compared to this train, the earth is very small. It is covered by the church. Even though the church has become degraded, it cannot be denied that nothing is more prosperous and far-reaching in human history than the church.</p><p>When I left the mainland of China thirty-three years ago, there were not more than four million Christians in China. Recently I read a newspaper article which says that now in China there are forty million believers. Furthermore, we have learned that in just one county in a certain province there are one hundred forty thousand believers pray-reading and calling on the name of the Lord Jesus. This proves that God is living and that Christ is mighty. Communist countries are known for being atheistic and for restricting the activities of Christians. But after thirty-three years, there are ten times more believers in China today than there were in 1949. This is the stretching, the lengthening, of the long robe of Christ. His train cannot be broken. The more there is persecution of the Christians, the farther His long robe extends.</p><p>I have also read that today in Russia the number of those who attend church services is five times the number of those who attend in England. This reminds me of an article I read in 1944. Stalin had asked the United States for aid. President Roosevelt told him that because so many American taxpayers were Christians, Russia would have to open the churches once again before aid could be given. Roosevelt pointed out that his people could not help one who persecutes Christians. Stalin thought that since the churches had been closed for years, there probably were not many Christians left. Therefore, he promised Roosevelt to open the churches. To his great surprise, at Easter, 1944, crowds of Christians gathered into the church buildings for Easter worship.</p><p>Christ the Lord is full of divine attributes and human virtues. In history there has never been a person with so many attributes and virtues. Now the expression of His virtues and attributes makes up a long train, a train that covers the whole earth. This train is the church, the fullness of Christ. Praise Him that we all are parts of Christ&rsquo;s long robe!</p><h2 class="head1">CHRIST WITH THE CHURCH</h2><p>The tunic, the long robe, the ephod, the breastplate, and the shoulder-pieces typify Christ with the church. Regarded as a whole, these garments signify Christ expressing God. This is the basic significance of the priestly garments. But on the breastplate were engraved the names of God&rsquo;s redeemed ones. This no doubt signifies the church. Thus, upon the priestly garments we have the breastplate. This means that upon Christ, signified by the garments, we have the church, signified by the breastplate and the two shoulder-pieces. Moreover, the breastplate and the shoulder-pieces were set into the ephod. This indicates that the church is in Christ. Christ has His fullness, and this fullness is the church. The breastplate, the shoulder-pieces, and the long skirt all typify the church.</p><p>As we consider the garments worn by the high priest, we see that the most beautiful and precious part is the breastplate and the shoulder-pieces and that the longest part is the skirt. The most precious and beautiful part and the longest part signify the church. If the breastplate and the shoulder-pieces were removed and the skirt were cut off from the high priest&rsquo;s garments, the garments would be without fullness and beauty. This indicates that without the church, Christ&rsquo;s expression would be lacking in fullness and beauty. Today the beauty of Christ and the fullness of Christ are in the church. In other words, the church is Christ&rsquo;s fullness.</p><p>The picture of the high priest&rsquo;s garments shows clearly that the beauty and fullness of the garments consist of the breastplate, the shoulder-pieces, and the long skirt. The significance of this is that today Christ&rsquo;s beauty and fullness are in the church. According to our view, the church may be degraded and pitiful. But the Lord has His view of the church. According to His view, the church is lovable. He is not disappointed. What the enemy, Satan, has been doing may be compared to the activities of a naughty boy. One day the Lord Jesus will say, &ldquo;Satan, is there anything more you can do? If not, go to the lake of fire. Now I shall come in to clear up the situation.&rdquo; In the eyes of the Lord, the church is wonderful. This is true even today. Hallelujah for the clear picture of Christ with the church portrayed in the garments of the high priest!</p><p>The main elements of the high priest&rsquo;s garments are linen, gold, and precious stones. Linen signifies humanity, gold signifies divinity, and precious stones signify transformation. Also, there are various colors: blue signifying heavenliness, purple signifying kingliness, and scarlet signifying redemption. As we consider the garments of the high priest, we truly see a portrait of Christ with the church.</p>
