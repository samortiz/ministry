   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Feeding Them</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>and Giving Them a Drink</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In Romans 12:20 Paul says, If your enemy is hungry, feed him; if he is thirsty, give him a drink; for in doing this you will heap coals of fire upon his head.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>This is loving our enemies.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Our love to them will be coals of fire heaped upon their heads to turn them to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>It may be that by feeding our enemies and giving them a drink, we may, at least to some extent, move and turn their hearts and gain them for the Lord s sake.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>3.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Not Being Conquered by Evil,</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>but Conquering Evil with Good</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Romans 12:21 says, Do not be conquered by evil, but conquer evil with good.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>To be conquered by evil is to repay evil with evil v. 17 . Suppose someone treats us evilly, and we treat him evilly in return.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>This indicates that we have been conquered by evil.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>We should not be like this.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Instead, we should conquer evil with good.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>This means that if someone treats us evilly, we should treat him well in return.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>This is to conquer evil with good.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>C. Praying for Their Persecutors</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The Lord Jesus charged us to pray for those who persecute us Matt 5:44 .</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>This is a wonderful attitude to hold toward our persecutors.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Stephen had such an attitude.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>When he was being stoned, even unto death, he knelt down and cried with a loud voice, Lord, do not hold this sin against them Acts 7:60 .</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Stephen prayed for his persecutors in the same way as his Lord, whom he loved and lived Luke 23:34 .</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>1.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Blessing Them</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Not only should we pray for our persecutors; we should also bless them Rom 12:14 .</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>It is even more difficult to bless a persecutor than to pray for him.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Nevertheless, through the divine dispensing this was Paul s experience.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Therefore, he could say, Reviled we bless 1 Cor 4:12 .</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>First Peter 3:9 says, Not rendering evil for evil or reviling for reviling, but on the contrary blessing one another, because you were called to this, that you might inherit blessing.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>We have been called to bless others; hence, as a blessed people, we should always bless others so that we might inherit blessing.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>What we bless others with, we will inherit ourselves Matt 10:13; 7:2 .</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>2.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Not Cursing Them</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>After charging us to bless those who persecute us, Paul goes on to say, Bless and do not curse Rom 12:14 .</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>It is very difficult for us not to curse a person who is persecuting us.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Even if we would not curse him with our mouth, we may be cursing him deep within us.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Therefore, in order to bless our persecutors and not curse them, we need to be saturated with the processed Triune God through His dispensing.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>D. Pursuing Peace with All Men 1.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Living in Peace with All Men</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>We also need to pursue peace with all men.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Hebrews 12:14 says, Pursue peace with all men.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>To pursue in this verse means to chase, even to chase vigorously.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>In having the best attitude toward others, we need to pursue peace, to chase peace vigorously.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>We should not fight with anyone.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Rather, we should pursue peace with all men.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>This means that we endeavor to keep a peaceful situation with everyone by living in peace with all men.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>2.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>As Far as It Depends on Them</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Romans 12:18 says, If possible, as far as it depends on you, live in peace with all men.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>We need to live in peace with others, as far as it depends on us to do so.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Sometimes it is not possible to live in peace with all men, because others are not willing to have a life of peace.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>There is nothing we can do in such a situation.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>This is the reason Paul says that we should live in peace with all men if possible.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>As far as it depends on us, we should do our best to live in peace with everyone.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>SUMMARY</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>We are in the church, but the church is among human society.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Hence, it is crucial that we have the best attitude toward others.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>We first need to be subject to the government through the dispensing of the processed Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Authority is from God, and those in authority are appointed by God as servants of God to the believers for their good.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>We need to recognize this fact and not resist them.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>We should pay taxes and customs to them since they are God s officers.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>We should also learn to subject ourselves to authorities, fear and honor them, and maintain a good relationship with the government.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>We do not do these things by ethical teachings, by philosophical instructions, or by our natural life and ability but through our experience of the dispensing of the processed Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>We should also learn, for the Lord s sake, that is, for the expression and glorification of God, to be subject to all human institutions according to the will of God.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Furthermore, we should love our enemies and do good to those who hate us.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>This is the highest standard of morality.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>If we would fulfill these requirements, we must be born of God to be a God-man, a person saturated with God and mingled with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>As those born of God, we have His life and nature.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Hence, we are spontaneously able to love our enemies even as God our Father loves them.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Since His love has been dispensed into us, the love with which we love our enemies is the love of God our Father.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>We love our enemies by feeding them and giving them a drink, thus turning them to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>If someone treats us evilly, we should treat him well in return.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>This is to conquer evil with good.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>In addition, we have to pray for those who persecute us.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>Stephen had such an attitude.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>He was the same as the Lord, whom he loved and lived.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>Not only so, we should also bless our persecutors.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>We have been called to bless others, so we, as a blessed people, should always bless others so that we might inherit blessing.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>It is very difficult for us not to curse a person who is persecuting us.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>Therefore, we need to be saturated with the processed Triune God through His dispensing.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>We also need to pursue peace with all men, endeavoring to keep a peaceful situation with everyone by living in peace with all men.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>Sometimes it is not possible for us to live in peace with all men, because others are not willing to have a life of peace.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>However, as far as it depends on us, we should do our best to live in peace with everyone.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>QUESTIONS In being subject to the government, what is the difference between a natural character and a transformed character?</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>Why are the authorities appointed by God for the believers good?</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>How could Paul, a patriotic Jew, instruct the saints to respect the government in Titus 3?</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>How does loving our enemies become a test to us?</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>What is the secret to loving our enemies and doing well to those who hate us?</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>How do we pursue peace with all men?</S>
