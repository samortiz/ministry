   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>DRINKING</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The gospel also includes this verse: "He who believes in Me, as the Scripture said, out of his innermost being shall flow rivers of living water" John 7:38 .</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The Lord Jesus invited all those who were thirsty to come to Him and drink v. 37 . Rivers of living water should flow from you.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>How many rivers do you have flowing out of your inner being?</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Do you have a river of peace? of love? of power? of holiness? of humility? of kindness?</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>If you sense a lack of rivers flowing from you, it indicates that you are not drinking sufficiently.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>You need to drink more of Him.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>CHRIST OUR HOME</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Part of the gospel is also found in John 14:23: "If anyone loves Me, he will keep My word, and My Father will love him, and We will come to him and make an abode with him."</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Do you love the Lord?</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Do you keep His word?</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Do you have Him coming to you and making His abode with you?</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The thought here is mutual: we become His abode and He ours.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>You have an abode; you are not homeless.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Who is your home?</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Christ!</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>I wish I could preach the Gospel of John to you in every meeting for a year!</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>I think I would not even be finished after a year!</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>ENJOYING THE RICH GOSPEL</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>How can we constantly enjoy this profound, rich gospel?</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>We can find out right in this Gospel of John.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The Word and the Spirit</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Notice how many times the Word is mentioned.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>In chapter one the Word was in the beginning and was God.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>In chapter fifteen the words of Christ are to abide in us; His word has cleansed us.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>We are to love Him and keep His word 14:23 .</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Those who hear His word have eternal life 5:24 .</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The Father's word is the truth which sanctifies 17:17 .</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Reference is also made again and again to the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>"It is the Spirit Who gives life; the flesh profits nothing; the words which I have spoken unto you are spirit and are life" 6:63 .</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>"He will give you another Comforter, that He may be with you forever; Even the Spirit of reality you know Him, because He abides with you and shall be in you" 14:16 .</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The Word and the Spirit are crucial matters.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>For too long we have neglected them.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>We may come to the meetings, but we have not given our attention to the Word.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>We may pray, but we have not sufficiently regarded the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>We must come back to care for both the Word and the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The New Testament makes it clear that today the Lord is both the Word and the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>"Now the Lord is that Spirit" 2 Cor 3:17 .</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>"His name is called The Word of God" Rev 19:13 .</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The Word is also the Spirit John 6:63 .</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>These three are one.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>All three are also life.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The Lord, the Word, and the Spirit are all life.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Thus, all these four are one.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The Word today is also the Bible in our hand.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Outside us we have the Word.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Within us is this Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>These two, the Spirit and the Word, are the two wires that transmit the heavenly electricity from the power plant into the building!</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Open up the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Open your eyes to read it.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Understand it and love it.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Combine this with praying.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>In this way you will be mingling the Word with the Spirit, thus transmitting Christ into you.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>You will be receiving of His fullness, grace upon grace.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Practice going to the Word throughout the day, snatching a few minutes here and there.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>It is in the Bible that you meet God, Christ, and the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Here is life, light, and love.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Learn to open your whole being when you turn to the Word.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Open your eyes to see, your mind to understand, your heart to love, and your spirit to pray and realize.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>This practice will bring you the Word with the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>The result of thus sowing the seed into the soil is that life will spring up.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Life will come forth from you.</S>
