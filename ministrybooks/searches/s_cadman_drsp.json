Prior to this, eighty to ninety percent of the world\u2019s populated areas were under the white people\u2019s domination.\u201d Mr. Panton said, \u201cSuddenly (1 Thes. 5:3), we are brought face to face with racial strife.\u201d Dr. S. P. Cadman said, \u201cThis coming war will forever remove the superiority of the white people.\u201d On June 30, 1925, the Thames Paper reported, \u201cMoscow (Russia) encourages the yellow and black people to shake themselves from the domination of the white people. The struggle between races is no longer a distant dream on this little planet, but a shocking matter in the near future.\u201d Consider again the present anti-foreigner sentiment in China. We cannot help but think that racial wars are close at hand. The subjugation of the minority races by the white race has been a known fact. It is true that where there is discontent, there are outcries. But even if the yellow and the black people are to gain supremacy in the future, there is still no rationale behind it! Those who have not received the Lord\u2019s salvation and who [944] have not been regenerated can never treat others with justice. This is not what we are talking about here. After reading what we have quoted, we can see that the coming war is inevitable. The pacifists can go on with their peace campaign, while the warmongers can go on with their war preparations. The day of the Lord is truly at hand. \u201cFor nation will rise up against nation, and kingdom against kingdom....All these things are the beginning of birth pangs\u201d (Matt. 24:7-8). "}]}
