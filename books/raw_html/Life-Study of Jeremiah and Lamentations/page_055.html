<H2 CLASS=HEAD2>J. Jehovah Making Jerusalem a Heap of Ruins</H2><P>Jehovah will make Jerusalem a heap of ruins, a habitation of jackals. He will make the cities of Judah a desolation without inhabitant (v. 11).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>K. Jehovah Feeding Israel with Wormwood</H2><P>Jehovah will feed Israel with wormwood and give them poisonous water to drink (8:14; 9:15). Their food will be bitter and their drink poisonous.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>L. Jehovah Scattering Israel among the Nations<br>and Sending the Sword after Them</H2><P>Jehovah will scatter Israel among the nations and send the sword after them until He has consumed them (9:16).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>M. A Voice of Wailing Being Heard from Zion</H2><P>Jeremiah 9:19 speaks of a voice of wailing which was heard from Zion. The voice said, "How we are ruined! / We are utterly put to shame! / For we have forsaken the land / Because they have cast down our dwellings."</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>N. Death Coming Up through Israel's Windows</H2><P>Death has come up through Israel's windows. It has entered their palaces to cut off the children from the streets and the young men from the open squares. The corpses of men will fall like dung on the surface of the field and like a sheaf after the reaper, and there will be no one to gather them (vv. 21-22).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>O. Jehovah Punishing All Those<br>Who Are Circumcised and Yet Uncircumcised</H2><P>"Behold, days are coming, declares Jehovah, when I will punish all those who are circumcised and yet uncircumcised" (v. 25). Israel had been circumcised physically, on their body, but not psychologically, in their inner being.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>P. Jehovah Shaming Every Goldsmith by His Idol</H2><P>Jehovah will shame every goldsmith by his idol and will punish the molten image of falsehood, for such images are vanity, the work of delusion (10:14-15).</P>
