	 <h2 class="head5">2) Having Seven Horns and Seven Eyes,<br />
Which Are the Seven Spirits of God</h2>
<p>In Revelation 5:6 John says that the Lamb has seven horns. Horns signify strength in fighting (Deut. 33:17). Christ is the redeeming Lamb, yet He has horns for fighting. He is the fighting Redeemer. His fighting is complete (perfect and complete) in God&rsquo;s move, as signified by the number seven.</p>
<p>Revelation 5:6 also says that the Lamb has &ldquo;seven eyes, which are the seven Spirits of God sent forth into all the earth.&rdquo; Eyes are for observing and searching. When we look at others, we search them out. We can tell what their attitude is, what kind of persons they are, and how they feel. Christ as the redeeming Lamb has seven observing and searching eyes for executing God&rsquo;s judgment upon the universe to fulfill God&rsquo;s eternal purpose, which will consummate in the building up of the New Jerusalem. Therefore, in Zechariah 3:9 He is prophesied as the stone, the topstone (4:7) with seven eyes for God&rsquo;s building. According to Greek grammar, the antecedent of <em>which</em> in Revelation 5:6 is <em>seven eyes</em>. Hence, the seven Spirits of God refer only to the seven eyes of the Lamb, not to His seven horns. The seven eyes of Christ are the seven Spirits of God sent forth into all the earth, and they run to and fro through the whole earth (Zech. 4:10).</p>
<h2 class="head6">a) The Son and the Spirit Being Inseparable</h2>
<p>That the seven eyes of the Lamb are the seven Spirits of God means that one of the three of the Godhead is the eyes of another of the Trinity. This contradicts an erroneous teaching concerning the Divine Trinity, which holds that since the three persons of the Godhead&mdash;the Father, the Son, and the Spirit&mdash;must not be confused, they are not only distinct but also separate. Such a teaching is inaccurate and is merely according to the natural human mind. Instead of trying to understand the Triune God according to our human mind, we must understand Him according to the teaching of the Bible. The fact that the seven eyes of the Lamb are the seven Spirits of God indicates that the Spirit is the eyes of the Son. Our eyes are not separate from us; rather, they are a part of our being. Likewise, since the seven Spirits of God (the Holy Spirit) are the seven eyes of Christ (the Son of God), the Spirit and the Son are distinct yet not separate from each other.</p>
<p>That Christ, the Son of God, cannot be separated from the seven Spirits of God, the Spirit, is indicated not only by the inseparability of the eyes of the Lamb from the Lamb in Revelation 5 but also by the inseparability of the living water (signifying the Spirit) from the smitten rock (signifying the crucified Christ) in Exodus 17, out of which the water flowed. In Exodus 17 Moses was instructed to strike the rock with his staff, and the water flowed out of the smitten rock. The striking of the rock is a clear, complete, and full picture of Christ&rsquo;s crucifixion. The rock was struck by the staff of Moses (v. 5). In this type, Moses signifies the law, and the staff represents the power and authority of the law. Hence, the striking of the rock by Moses&rsquo; staff signifies that Christ was put to death on the cross by the authority of God&rsquo;s law (cf. Gal. 2:19-20a; 3:13). Moreover, the water flowing out of the smitten rock typifies the Spirit (John 7:37-39). This indicates that the Holy Spirit is the flowing out of Christ. When Christ is infused into us, He is the Spirit. It is through the eyes that one person is infused into another person. When a person infuses himself through his eyes, he infuses the reality of what he is. In the same way, the Spirit as the reality of Christ is infused into the saints. Hence, there is no way to separate the Spirit from Christ. Separating Christ from the Spirit is like separating the living water from the smitten rock. Once we separate the living water from the rock, the living water is without a source, and the rock is without a flow, for the living water is the flow of the rock, and the rock is the source of the living water. The living water and the rock are two yet one; they are indivisible, just as the eyes and the body are inseparable. Hence, the Spirit and the Son are distinct yet inseparable.</p>
<p>The Lord as the Lamb having seven eyes, which are the seven Spirits, indicates that Christ comes to us as the seven eyes, that is, as the Spirit, for us to experience. Moreover, the Lamb is on the throne, from the throne flows the river of water of life, and in the water of life grows the tree of life (Rev. 22:1-2). This is a picture of the redeeming Christ who has become the life-giving Spirit constantly flowing with the life supply. By this, we can see that Christ is the life-giving Spirit not only for us to know and understand but also for us to take, experience, and enjoy. We need to enjoy Christ by realizing Him as the Spirit. The seven Spirits of God are for the imparting of life because the Spirit is the Spirit of life (Rom. 8:2). Therefore, we must exercise not only our mind to understand Him but also our spirit to contact Him in our spirit, as revealed in the Epistles (v. 4).</p>
