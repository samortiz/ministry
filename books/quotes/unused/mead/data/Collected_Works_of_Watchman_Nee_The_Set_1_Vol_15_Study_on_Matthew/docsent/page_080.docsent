   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Verse 23:"On that day some Sadducees, who say that there is no resurrection, came to Him and questioned Him."</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The two parties departed and the Sadducees appeared on the scene; this is like a round-the-clock war.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The Sadducees believed that there is no resurrection and that a person is completely terminated after he dies.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Hence, they believed that there are neither demons nor angels.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Men are prone to develop hypothetical problems to entangle others, just as the Sadducees of old did.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Verses 24-28:"Saying, Teacher, Moses said, If anyone dies and does not have children, his brother as next of kin shall marry his wife and raise up seed to his brother.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Now there were seven brothers with us.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>And the first married and died, and having no seed, he left his wife to his brother.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Likewise also the second and the third until the seventh.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>And last of all the woman died.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>In the resurrection, then, whose wife will she be of the seven?</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>For they all had her."</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The supposedly difficult problem, "Now there were seven brothers with us," was absolutely fictitious.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Verse 29:"And Jesus answered and said to them, You err, not knowing the Scriptures nor the power of God."</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>"You err."</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>This was the Lord's judgment concerning them.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The phrase "not knowing the Scriptures" indicates that they had no spiritual knowledge.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The phrase "nor the power of God" indicates that they had no spiritual experience.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>These are the reasons for making mistakes.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Hence, a believer ought to have both knowledge and experience.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Verses 30-32:"For in the resurrection they neither marry nor are given in marriage, but are like angels in heaven.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>But concerning the resurrection of the dead, have you not read that which was spoken to you by God, saying, I am the God of Abraham and the God of Isaac and the God of Jacob'?</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>He is not the God of the dead, but of the living."</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>"For in the resurrection" refers to the rapture.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>"Neither marry nor are given in marriage" does not refer to the angels.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The Lord not only pointed out resurrection; what He was saying was: "You say that when a person dies, he is terminated.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>If that is the case, God should have introduced Himself in the section concerning the bush as the God of the dead,' and such a God could never have encouraged Moses."</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The logic here was that God is the God of Abraham; since Abraham is a dead person, this would make God the God of the dead.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>However, He is not the God of the dead.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Therefore, although Abraham is dead, he will become alive again cf.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>8:11 .</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Jacob and Isaac also will be resurrected.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Concerning resurrection, see 1 Corinthians 15:50-58.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Verse 33:"And when the crowds heard this, they were astounded at His teaching."</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Their being astounded is the indication of defeat.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>They thought that it was a difficult problem.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>However, the Lord still was able to answer it.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>"Astounded" means to marvel.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Verses 34-35:"But the Pharisees, when they heard that He had muzzled the Sadducees, gathered themselves together.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>And one of them, a lawyer, asked Him a question, testing Him."</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The phrase "gathered themselves together" indicates that they regrouped because they sympathized with one another's similar defeats.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The lawyer was so proud that he would not admit to being humbled by the Lord's eloquence.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Verse 36:"Teacher, which is the great commandment in the law?"</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The lawyer asked the Lord, "Which is the great commandment in the law?" because a person cannot emphasize one commandment and neglect another cf.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>James 2:10 .</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Verses 37-38:"And He said to him, You shall love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your mind.'</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>This is the great and first commandment."</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>"The great and first commandment," because it includes the entire law.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>To violate one of the commandments of the law equals not loving God with "all."</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Verse 39:"And the second is like it: You shall love your neighbor as yourself.'"</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>"Neighbor" refers to anyone besides oneself.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>The neighbor can also refer to the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>See the parable of the good Samaritan Luke 10:30 .</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Verse 40:"On these two commandments hang all the Law and the Prophets."</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>The two commandments encompass the entire law.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>The former includes all laws in relation to God, and the latter includes all laws in relation to man.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>The Ten Commandments were originally divided into two parts, those related to God and those related to man.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Verse 41:"Now while the Pharisees were gathered together, Jesus questioned them."</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>"Jesus questioned them."</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>It seems as if the Lord was saying, "You have asked Me enough questions.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Let me now ask you one question."</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Verse 42:"Saying, What do you think concerning the Christ?</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Whose son is He?</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>They said to Him, David's."</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>"What do you think?"</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>This is parallel to verse 17.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>This question seems to be one for a three-year-old child.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>The Lord did not ask a difficult question, because He was afraid that they would not answer see Matt 21:27 .</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Verses 43-45:"He said to them, How then does David in spirit call Him Lord, saying, The Lord said to my Lord, Sit at My right hand until I put Your enemies underneath Your feet'?</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>If then David calls Him Lord, how is He his son?"</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>"The Lord said to my Lord."</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>The first "Lord" is Jehovah, and the second "Lord" is the Messiah.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>The Lord desires to show us that according to the flesh, Christ is the Son of David.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>Yet according to the Spirit, He is the Lord of David.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>The Pharisees knew the Lord only as the Son of David.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>They were like today's modernists.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>Thank God that He is also the Lord of David.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>Verse 46:"And no one was able to answer Him a word, nor did anyone from that day dare to question Him anymore."</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>The reason they could not answer was that they knew the answer yet were unwilling to answer.</S>
