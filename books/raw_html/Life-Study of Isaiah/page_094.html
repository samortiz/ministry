<H1 CLASS=SERIES>LIFE-STUDY OF ISAIAH</H1><H1 CLASS=MSG>MESSAGE TWENTY</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>AN EXAMPLE OF SEEKING AFTER JEHOVAH<br>AND TRUSTING IN HIM</H1><H1 CLASS=PAREN>(2)</H1><H1 CLASS=SCRIPTURE>Scripture Reading: Isa. 36&#151;39</H1><P>In the foregoing message we saw, from chapters thirty-six through thirty-nine, what kind of person Hezekiah was. We saw that although he was godly and could pray in a godly manner, he was not a man of God. Furthermore, he was not careful and considerate but hasty, and instead of being for God and God's kingdom, he was for himself and his own interests. Thus, he was not a person who could be trusted to carry out God's purpose. In this message we will consider many of the details in these four chapters.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>I. HEZEKIAH'S SEEKING AFTER JEHOVAH<br>FOR HIS SITUATION</H2><P>Isaiah 36:1&#151;37:38 tells us of Hezekiah's seeking after Jehovah for his situation.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>A. The Enemy's Attack</H2><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>1. Sennacherib King of Assyria<br>Coming Up against the Fortified<br>Cities of Judah and Taking Them</H2><P>In the fourteenth year of King Hezekiah, Sennacherib king of Assyria went up against all the fortified cities of Judah and took them. The king of Assyria sent Rab-shakeh to Jerusalem to King Hezekiah with a great force (36:1-2a). Rab-shakeh said to those who came out to him, "Say now to Hezekiah, Thus says the great king, the king of Assyria, What is this confidence in which you trust? I say, It is but a vain word that you say, There is counsel and strength for war. Now on whom do you trust, that you rebel against me? Behold, you have put your trust in the staff of this broken reed, in Egypt; on which, if a man leans, it will go into his hand and pierce it, for so is Pharaoh king of Egypt to all who trust in him" (vv. 4-6).</P>
