   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Brother Austin-Sparks's second visit to us created a big problem, and all the saints were tested.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Some young co-workers who were raised up and taught by me were influenced by him.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>One of these young co-workers was even saved through me in Shanghai.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>They began to say that they just wanted Christ and did not care for the church.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>To just want Christ and not care for the church is divisive.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Regardless of how much you care for Christ and have experienced Christ, if you meet in a way that does not care for the truth of the church, your meeting is a division.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>These divisive ones proclaimed that they had seen the church in glory.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>They condemned me and some other brothers as old men who did not have visions.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>They felt that they had the vision.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>I had a long talk with them.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>I told them that if they did not take care of the truth concerning the church, especially the church ground, they would be divided again and again after they left the recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>What I said to them came to pass.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>I began to warn them in 1959, and we tolerated them until 1965.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>During those years, they were causing trouble among the churches.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The leading brothers wrote me a letter in 1965 asking me to return to Taiwan from the United States to solve this problem.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>They said that I was the only person who had the ground, the position, and the right to deal with this problem because the work in Taiwan was started by the Lord through me.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>I eventually returned to Taiwan in 1965, and this problem with these rebellious ones was solved.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>How can such things take place among us?</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>They can take place because the ones involved do not care for the Body, for the oneness.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Regardless of how many visions someone has seen, he has no right to build up any division.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>I hope that we all can see this.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Paul and Peter encountered the trouble concerning circumcision recorded in Acts 15, but they did not have any division.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>They tried their best to get the problem solved in order to keep the oneness of the Body of Christ, that is, the oneness of all the local churches in both the Jewish and Gentile territories.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Thus, the churches kept the oneness, and there was no division.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>In 1987 rebellion and division began to occur with certain ones among us.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Even if the accusations they made were true, however, that cannot be built up as a case to justify their division.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>One leading brother asked one of these rebellious ones about their meeting as a division in Anaheim.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>This one said that he would remove this division from Anaheim.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>But it does not matter where it is removed to.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Wherever it is, it is still a division.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>I must testify in honesty that I have been commissioned by the Lord to carry His truth and bring His recovery to the United States.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The recovery is based upon the truth that Christ has only one Body.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Even if these divisive ones move to a city in which there is not a church, they have to be checked concerning what kind of relationship they have with the other churches.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>One of the tests of a genuine local church is that it should have universal fellowship with all the other local churches.</S>
