<h2 class="head1">MAN BEING ALLOWED TO FAIL</h2>
<p>In Luke 15, the father, who represents God, acted differently than we would as parents. When the younger son said to his father, &ldquo;Give me the share of the estate that falls to me,&rdquo; the father readily gave him his share (v. 12). The father did not respond by trying to exhort and persuade him to choose differently or by withholding his portion of the estate. Most parents would have responded in this way, but the father immediately gave the younger son his portion of the estate. Even when the son was leaving, the father did not try to restrain him. It seems as if the father was very hardhearted and did not love his son very much, because he simply gave up on him.</p>
<p>This is often how God treats us. He allows us to fail. He allows us to leave with what we have and lets us fall. However, when the younger son returned after wasting all his inheritance and living with hogs, the father blessed his son with his riches, and they all were merry and rejoicing. The father rejoiced because his son had died and was made alive again and had been lost and was found (vv. 24, 32). Anyone who has not died and who has never been lost is an &ldquo;older son&rdquo; who cannot fully enjoy his father&rsquo;s love and his father&rsquo;s riches.</p>
<p>I hope that we can see this deep principle: One who has never fallen or failed cannot know God, experience God, or enjoy God. God has no way to work Himself into a person who has no &ldquo;holes.&rdquo; In order for God to enter into us for our experience and enjoyment, we must experience repeated failures.</p>
<h2 class="head1">MAN BEING BROKEN BY FAILURE<br />
TO EXPERIENCE GOD</h2>
<p>Blessed are those who fall; blessed are those who fail. Blessed are those who have not been meeting for a long while, blessed are those who cannot rise up, and blessed are those who are weak. Our inability to rise up, our falls, our failures, our forsaking of the meetings, and our backsliding only enable us to be broken. When our spirit and heart are broken and contrite, we will prostrate ourselves before God and say, &ldquo;No one is more pitiful than I; no one is weaker than I; no one has failed more than I; no one is in a worse condition than I.&rdquo; When we can say these words, we will be blessed, and we will even hear God saying, &ldquo;Bring out quickly the best robe and put it on him, and put a ring on his hand and sandals on his feet. And bring the fattened calf; slaughter it, and let us eat and be merry, because this son of mine was dead and lives again; he was lost and has been found&rdquo; (vv. 22-24).</p>
<p>The benefit of failure is that we are broken; the advantage of failure is that we enjoy God. We should not look down upon the failures in our Christian journey. Those who are experienced, who know God, and who are deep in the Lord will be able to say, &ldquo;Thank You that You allowed me to fail so many times. Praise You that Your hand did not so quickly rescue me. Rather than praising You for rescuing me so quickly, I will praise You for not rescuing me quickly. I worship You that You have allowed me to fall and fail and even that You have allowed me to be indifferent and to backslide. I praise You that my many failures and my frequent backsliding have enabled me to know myself and to be broken before You. My heart is broken, and my spirit is broken. Although I cannot lift up my head before others, I have received Your grace and experienced You. Because of my weaknesses and failures, I can know You, experience You, and gain You.&rdquo; The more we follow Him, the more we will know the sweetness and preciousness of our failures. I am not encouraging us to fail; rather, I am thankful that our failures bring in the enjoyment of God as grace.</p>
