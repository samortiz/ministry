   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>a. In Love</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In love in Ephesians 1:4 may modify having predestinated in verse 5.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>God the Father predestinated us in love that we may be His many sons.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The divine love is His motive to have many sons for the fulfillment of His divine economy.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>b.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Unto Sonship</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Ephesians 1:5 reveals that God predestinated us unto sonship.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>This means that the goal of God s predestination is sonship.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Because we were predestinated to be sons of God even before we were created, we, as God s creatures, need to be regenerated by Him so that we may share in His life to be His sons.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Sonship implies both life and the position of a son.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>God s marked-out ones have the life to be His sons and also the position to inherit Him.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>According to Ephesians 1:4, God chose us to be holy.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>However, to be holy is the procedure, not the goal.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The goal is sonship.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>God has chosen us to be holy so that we may be His sons.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Therefore, to be holy is the process, the procedure, whereas to be sons of God is the goal.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>God does not merely want a group of holy people; He desires many sons.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>God has chosen us to be holy for a purpose, and this purpose is that we may be sons of God.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>c.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Through Jesus Christ</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Ephesians 1:5 also tells us that we have been predestinated unto sonship through Jesus Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Through Jesus Christ means through the Redeemer, who is the Son of God.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Through Him we were redeemed to be the sons of God with the life and position of God s sons.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>d.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>According to the Good Pleasure of His Will</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Finally, we were predestinated unto sonship by God the Father according to the good pleasure of His will.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>God has a will in which is His good pleasure.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>God predestinated us to be His sons according to this pleasure, according to His heart s delight.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>B. IN TIME 1.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Created by God</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>After we were foreknown, chosen, and predestinated by God in eternity, we were created by Him in time.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Acts 17:26a says, He made from one every nation of men to dwell on all the face of the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Zechariah 12:1 says that God stretched forth the heavens, laid the foundation of the earth, and formed the spirit of man within him.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>This indicates that in the universe there are three important matters: the heavens, the earth, and the spirit of man.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The heavens are for the earth, the earth is for man, and man has a spirit for God.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Therefore, man is the center of the universe, and the center of man is his spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>As far as God is concerned, if there were no spirit within man, man would be an empty shell.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>If there were no man on earth, the earth would be void and the heavens would be useless.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>In God s creation, the heavens serve the earth, the earth serves man, and man has a spirit to receive God.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>a. Through Christ</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>We were created by God through Christ John 1:3 .</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>All believers realize that we have been saved through Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>We also need to see that we were created through Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Christ is the active instrument through which the creation of mankind was processed.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>b.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>In the Image of God</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Through Christ we were created by God in His image Rom 5:14b; 2 Cor 4:4b .</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Strictly speaking, the image of God is Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Second Corinthians 4:4 speaks of Christ as the image of God.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>For man to be created in God s image, which is Christ, means that we were created not only through Christ but according to Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>God s intention in creating us in this way was that one day Christ, according to whom we were created and through whom we were created, would come into our being.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>This means that, having been created in the image of God, we were created as vessels to contain Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Hence, we were created through Christ and according to Christ that we might contain Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>2.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Fallen</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>In time we were not only created but also became fallen.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Romans 5:12 says, As through one man sin entered into the world and death through sin; and so death passed to all men because all have sinned.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>a. In Adam</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Within every fallen person there are two striking things.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>The first is that we are in Adam and have the Adamic nature.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>In the sight of God there are only two men Adam and Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>All fallen ones are in Adam.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Furthermore, those who are in Adam are part of Adam.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>In Adam there are three main things: sin, death, and being constituted sinners Rom 5:19 .</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>In Adam we inherited death, we were under the reign of death Rom 5:12, 14 , and we were constituted sinners.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>b.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Of Sin</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>The second striking matter concerning mankind in the fall is that all fallen people are of sin.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Through the disobedience of Adam, sin, the evil nature of Satan, entered into mankind.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>After entering into the human race, sin made its dwelling place in the fallen body of man Rom 7:17, 18, 21, 23 .</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Because the element of sin was injected into man, fallen man is now of sin, that is, a constitution of sin.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>For this reason fallen people are sinners by constitution.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>This means that in the fall we are sinners by nature.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>3.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>Dead in Offenses and Sins</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>In time we were not only created by God and then became fallen; we also became dead in offenses and sins.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>Ephesians 2:1 reveals that in the past we were dead in our offenses and sins, and 2:5 says that we were dead in offenses.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>Furthermore, Colossians 2:13 says that we were dead in the offenses and the uncircumcision of our flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>Offenses are acts which overstep the limit of right, and sins are evil doings.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>Before we were saved, we were dead in such offenses and sins.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>The word dead in Ephesians 2:1 and 5 and Colossians 2:13 refers to the death of our spirit that pervades our entire being.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>Through Adam s transgression sin entered into the world and death through sin.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>Now death reigns over all men Rom 5:14, 17 .</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>Therefore, in Adam all die 1 Cor 15:22 .</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>In eternity we were foreknown, chosen, and predestinated by God.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>Then in time we were created by God.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>However, we became fallen and eventually became dead in offenses and sins.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>This was our situation in the past.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>By being dead in offenses and sins, we lost the function that enables us to contact God.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>Spiritual death has annulled the function of our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>No matter how active we were in our body and soul, we were deadened in our spirit, unable to contact God.</S>
