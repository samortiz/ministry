   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>VI.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>THE PARADISE OF GOD</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The New Jerusalem will also be the paradise of God.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>According to the Bible there is more than one kind of paradise.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Many Christians consider the garden of Eden as a paradise Gen 2:8 .</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>However, the Bible does not call the garden of Eden a paradise.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Thus, in the Bible, there are just two paradises, the paradise mentioned by the Lord Jesus in Luke 23:43 and the New Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>To the thief who asked the Lord to remember him when He came into His kingdom, the Lord Jesus said, Truly I tell you, today you shall be with Me in Paradise Luke 23:43 .</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Only by studying a number of other verses can we locate this paradise.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Luke 23:43 reveals that immediately after His death, the Lord Jesus went to paradise.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Acts 2:27 and 31 reveal that after the Lord Jesus died, He went to Hades, and Matthew 12:40 indicates that Hades is in the heart of the earth, where the Lord Jesus went for three days and three nights after His death.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>In Hades there is a pleasant section likened to Abraham s bosom, where Lazarus went Luke 16:23 .</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Thus, the paradise mentioned by the Lord in Luke 23:43 is the pleasant section of Hades.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>According to the Lord s word in Luke 16, there are two sections in Hades, and between these sections there is a great chasm.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>When Lazarus died, he went to the pleasant section of Hades, where Abraham was.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>But when the rich man died, he went to the section of torment.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Some Christian teachers, such as Dr. Scofield, believe that at the time of Christ s resurrection the pleasant section of Hades was transferred to the third heaven.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The original Scofield Reference Bible has a note on Luke 16:23 to this effect.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Second Corinthians 12:2-4 is also used as a ground for saying this.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Some interpret Paul s word in these verses to mean that paradise is now in the third heaven.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>However, if you read this portion of the Word carefully according to the Greek text, you will see that it proves the opposite.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>In this chapter Paul was testifying that he had received a complete vision of the entire universe, which is divided into three sections: the heavens, the earth, and the region under the earth See Phil 2:10 .</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Paul had come to know the things on earth, the things in heaven, and the things in paradise.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>This is the correct understanding of 2 Corinthians 12:2-4.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>See message twenty, pp.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>242-245 .</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Paradise, the pleasant section of Hades, is still in Hades underneath the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The teaching that the Old Testament saints in paradise were transferred to heaven on the day of Christ s resurrection is not accurate.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>On the day of Pentecost, fifty days after the Lord s resurrection, Peter said, David is not ascended into the heavens Acts 2:34 .</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Even at that time, David was still not in heaven.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Hence, the traditional teachings regarding this matter are neither accurate nor trustworthy.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>According to the accurate word of the Bible, there is a pleasant section in Hades, called paradise, where the disembodied spirits and souls of the saved presently are, waiting for the time of resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>In principle, for a soul to be disembodied means that it is naked, and no naked person can come into God s presence.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Thus, the spirits and souls of the departed saints are in the pleasant section of Hades waiting for the day of resurrection that they may put on a glorious resurrection body and be clothed again.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The New Jerusalem as the paradise of God is different from the paradise in Hades.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The paradise of the New Jerusalem, which is eternal, will be vastly superior to the paradise in Hades, which is merely a temporary lodging.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The paradise of God in the New Jerusalem will be a reward to the overcomers in the kingdom age 2:7 and a common portion to all God s redeemed in eternity 21:7 .</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>All the dead saints will be resurrected, will put on a resurrection body, and eventually will enter into the New Jerusalem, which will be their paradise.</S>
