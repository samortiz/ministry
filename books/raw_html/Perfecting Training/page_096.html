 <h2 class="head1">HOW THE LAW OF THE SPIRIT OF LIFE WORKS</h2>
<p>The next question is this: How does this law work? This is a harder question. You must realize it is altogether inexhaustible. We cannot tell to the uttermost how this law works. We can only say that according to our experiences we realize how this law works. It works through divinity, the divine nature. It works through humanity, the human nature. It works through incarnation. Incarnation must be repeated again and again daily in your experience. And it works through crucifixion, through the wonderful all-inclusive death. It works through the defeat of Satan and the destruction of the Devil. It works through resurrection. It works through ascension. It works through all these ingredients of today&rsquo;s processed God who is the indwelling Spirit. When the indwelling Spirit works in us, He works through all these things. When this law works in you, it spontaneously brings you the divine nature and the human nature. It spontaneously functions to do the killing, the defeating, and the destroying. In the next message we have to find out the scientific knowledge of the way this law works in us. It is somewhat like modern medicine, like an antibiotic. It works through many different ways to heal you. Romans 8 gives us an all-inclusive scientific dose. It works within us in a scientific way.</p>
<p>Christians today are far off although they teach many things. Few have touched the very focus of the Bible. This is why Romans 8 remains nearly untouched. But today I believe the Lord would unveil and uncover this chapter to show us the depths of His economy in very much detail. We have to spend the time to consider how the law works through divinity and through humanity and through the crucifixion and through the defeating of Satan. Due to the ignorance and blindness of the Christians throughout the centuries, this chapter has remained closed. For this reason there has been very little Body life. We all have to admit that through the centuries there has been very little Body life. Even up to this day there is little Body life because the secret of how to have the Body life has not been unveiled. It has been under the cover here in Romans 8. We must see how this law is just the processed, all-inclusive God as the all-inclusive Spirit indwelling us. This is the law. We also must see how this law works scientifically through all the ingredients which are incorporated in this wonderful Being. As long as this wonderful Being exists in us, He Himself as a law works through all that He has and all that He is.</p>
<p>Many of us can testify that our prayer to overcome sin was seldom answered. Our prayer not to lose our temper was seldom answered. This is why among Christians there is little victory. Although the Christians who have received mercy of God try their best to love the Lord, actually not much really works within them in an effective way. Why? Because Romans 8 has been still shut up. It has not been opened up. I hope that we can all see there is a living Person who is the law. And this law as a living Person works through whatever He is and whatever He has.</p>
