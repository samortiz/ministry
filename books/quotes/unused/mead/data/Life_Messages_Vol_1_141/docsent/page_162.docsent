   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>DRINKING OF THE SPIRIT</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Besides being the word for you to eat, Christ is also the Spirit for you to drink.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>To drink, spiritually speaking, is to breathe.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>To breathe is to pray.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>By praying you breathe.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>By breathing you drink.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Mingle your reading of the Bible, then, with praying.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>In your ten minutes in the morning, read your verses, then reread them with prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>There is no need to compose a prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Simply pray the words of the verses.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Repeat them as your prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Use the text of the Bible as your prayer book!</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>If you are reading in John 1, you can say, "In the beginning.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Thank You, Lord, You were there in the beginning.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>In the beginning was the Word.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Lord, You were the Word and You were in the beginning."</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>By pray-reading in this way you will be eating and drinking.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>To eat without drinking is dry.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Our reading needs to be mingled with our praying.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>After you pray and read, read and pray, you will be full of food and water.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>You will have taken in Christ Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>PAYING ATTENTION TO CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>It may have been your former practice to seek the Lord's will, to find out what is right or wrong, and what you should or should not do.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Do not follow that way any longer.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Simply keep your whole being turned to Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Do not ask, "Lord, should I stay here or go?" or "Lord, what shall I speak?"</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Pray rather in a simple way, "Lord, are You staying here, or are You leaving?</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Lord, are You going to speak?</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>I am not interested in whether this is right or wrong, whether I should speak or not speak.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>I only want to know, is this You?"</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>If your wife offends you, check with the Lord, "Lord, I'm annoyed with my wife.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Are You mad at her too?"</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The Lord will say, "No, I am not annoyed with her."</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Since the Lord is not annoyed, there is nothing for you to do.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>DOING EVERYTHING WITH HIM</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Learn not to do anything without the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Do everything with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>In God's economy it is not a matter of what to do and what not to do.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The question is, Who is doing it, you or He?</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Even when it comes to loving others, your love is not acceptable to God.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>It must be Christ who loves.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Whatever you are doing, keep checking with the Lord, "Lord, is this You or me?"</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Do not be concerned about the world, Satan, your sins, weaknesses, and mistakes.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Keep your whole attention centered on Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>"Lord, apart from You I would not do anything.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>I would not even say a word to my wife.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>I would not hate people; neither would I love them.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>I would do nothing without You.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Apart from You I am jobless; I have no life to live; I am through."</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>We have tried other ways.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>We read and practiced what Christian books advocated as the way to victory or holiness.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>The books were of little help; the ways did not work well.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Eventually we found out that Christ is the only way that really works.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>When you do everything in Him and with Him, the flesh, sin, and worldliness will flee away.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>"Lord, grant me the grace that day by day this matter of doing everything with Christ may not be a mere teaching.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>I want it to be my moment-by-moment practice.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>All day long I would not live apart from You.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>I want to do everything with You and in You."</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>If you will practice this daily and hourly, you will find that Christ will be your life practically.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Apart from Him we can do nothing John 15:5 , but we can do all things through Him who empowers us Phil 4:13, Gk.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>. This is the Christian life.</S>
