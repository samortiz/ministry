It has rendered great help to me. May glory be to the One who sits on the throne and to the Lamb! Since the political change last winter, when Hung Dao School in Lu-Teng was disbanded, I returned to Shu County in Anhwei. Half a month later, I was led by the Lord to work with Mr. John Sung in Honan. I have been here for six months. (Mr. Sung has returned to Shanghai.) Although the churches have a few decades of history, they are still very immature. Please remember them much in your prayer.</p><p>Recently my spirit felt the need for evangelistic work in the remote border regions. I have had this desire for a long time but have never received God's clear light. I am hesitant to move presumptuously. May the Lord accomplish His will in this matter! Miss Peng Mei-fang and Missionary Song Bu-kwang have temporarily moved to the China Inland Mission in Yeh County and do not intend to go anywhere during the summer. Brother Peng Shao-shen has left Fang- Cheng to work with the China Inland Mission in Fu-Gou. Sister Lan Shou-lien is presently in Ji-Gung-Shan. Sister Lan Shou-pu has gone to Szechuan. Mr. and Mrs Kao Yu-shen are still working in Yeh County. They intend to return to England this winter. Brother Adeney has gone to work in Fang-Cheng. The few of us in the Evangelistic Crusade are still in Wu-Yang; we will not go anywhere during the summer. We also have Miss Riffel and Miss Miller with us, who have rendered us much help spiritually. I am enclosing a check of X dollars from the China Inland Mission, of which X dollars are from Mr. and Mrs. Kao Yu-shen. We want to give this small sum for use in evangelistic work in Yunnan province. It expresses our sympathy for the evangelistic work in remote border regions. Please remember my whole family in Shu County, Anhwei. I wanted to return home to take care of them, but the war has blocked our travel. Thank the Lord that He has comforted me. May the Lord strengthen the work in your hands, and may God establish them. Amen!</p><p>The least of all brothers in the Lord,<br />Hwai-an, May 19<br />[Address omitted]</p><h2 class="head2">Yeh County, Honan Province</h2><p>Dear friends:</p><p>I am very grateful to you for sending me The Open Door issue by issue. Thank the Lord that He has shown you so many pathways. We were very glad to hear of the Lord's grace in Yunnan, and we pray to see greater works being done. While the gospel is gaining victory in China, we can prove that the Lord is real! We have also discovered that hungry hearts are ready to receive His salvation. We pray for you, and may you pray for us also. Enclosed please find X dollars for use in the work, and may the lines of your tents be extended and the stakes of all the work and life of all the workers be strengthened. Peace be to you!</p><p>Nancy B. Gaursen<br />May 27</p><h2 class="head2">Tsingtao</h2><p>When the political situation was tense late last August, most of the residents were dispersed. Before my colleagues from my company left, they asked what I was going to do. I told them that I had not received a letter yet, meaning a letter from heaven. One morning in my morning watch, the Lord laid before me the story of Abraham praying for Sodom, and I immediately prayed for Tsingtao. After my prayer I felt very peaceful and believed that God had heard His child's prayer. By the end of November, the political situation changed, and my colleagues again asked me for my opinion. My answer was, "I will see after I have prayed." I was afraid to move presumptuously and lose my testimony. I laid the matter before the Lord and inquired of Him earnestly. Thank the Lord, He gave me a word: "Sojourn in this land, and I will be with thee" (Gen. 26:3). Hallelujah! Since the Lord made such a promise, I did not leave Tsingtao. Brother Witness Lee is in Kao-Mi to work for a few days at the invitation of the brothers there; he will also pass by Tsingtao. We hope that we can have a few days of meeting with him. Please pray for us.</p><p>A small brother in the Lord,<br />Lee She-sin, June 10<br />[Address omitted]</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_010.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_012.html">Next</a> </body></html>
