   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER TWENTY-EIGHT GIFTS, MINISTRIES, AND OPERATIONS Date: November 21, 1935, afternoon</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Place: Chuenchow</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Scripture Reading: Acts 6:2-4 GIFTS, MINISTRIES, AND OPERATIONS</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>First Corinthians 12:4-6 says, "But there are distinctions of gifts, but the same Spirit; and there are distinctions of ministries, yet the same Lord; and there are distinctions of operations, but the same God, who operates all things in all."</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Three things are mentioned here: gifts, ministries, and operations.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Gifts are of the Spirit, operations are of God, and ministries are of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>These three things are related to the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>In the past many people have paid attention only to gifts and neglected ministries and operations.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>We have to understand the position of ministries and operations before we can understand the value of gifts and the operations of these gifts.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Gifts produce the ministries, and ministries produce the operations.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>A gift is the skill of a person.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>A ministry is the work of a person, and an operation or function is the result of a person's work.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>For example, in a construction company, there may be concrete workers, stone masons, and carpenters.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The three kinds of craftsmen each have their own skill.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Actually, there are different skills just among carpenters.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Some are good at floor work, and others specialize in making windows or doors.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>These different skills are like the different gifts mentioned in the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Every servant of God has a certain kind of skill derived from his gift.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The gifts are given by the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>There are distinctions of gifts, but the same Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Everyone has his own gift, but all these gifts must be under the control of the Spirit v. 11 .</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The Holy Spirit has not distributed gifts to men for them to work on their own.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>He dispenses gifts according to a certain plan.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>We receive gifts from the Spirit for the purpose of participating in certain works according to the Lord's assignment.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The works that we receive from the Lord become our ministries.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>This is like saying that the construction company is building houses in many places, and many people are assigned to various places.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Some are experts in floor work, and the foreman will assign them to work on floors.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Others are experts at making doors, and the foreman will assign them to various places to make doors.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>They are still under the direction of the foreman.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>All the ones who are assigned have their own skills, which are their gifts.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The works assigned to them are their ministries.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>A man's craft is his gift, while the work assigned to him is his ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The end result is not for anyone's personal gain but for the achievement of the common goal which the foreman set out to achieve.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>What is the difference between the work of Paul and the work of Apollos?</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Paul planted and Apollos watered, and God caused the growth 1 Cor 3:6 .</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>This is the operation.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Paul and Apollos each had their own skill and ability, and the Lord assigned them work according to their abilities and skills.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>According to their different assignments, they ended up with different ministries.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>If you have a skill, then you have a gift.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>When you engage in the work assigned to you by the masterbuilder, you have a ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The end result of the works of all the ministries is the operations.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Today we must all ask the Lord what kind of gifts we have received from Him and what our ministry is.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>If we have received a gift and a ministry, we should ask the Lord to bring out our operation.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>In this universe, God has a great operation.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>How is He going to accomplish this great operation?</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>He accomplishes it through the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The Spirit distributes the gifts, and God directs everyone to use these gifts for the accomplishment of His goal.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Our responsibility is to work faithfully in the ministries assigned by the Lord according to the gifts we have received.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>We do not have to worry about our functions, because we cannot do anything about them.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>That is God's business.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>First Corinthians 12 puts gifts together with the Spirit, ministries together with the Lord, and operations together with God.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>This reveals that gifts are from the Holy Spirit, ministries are assigned by the Lord, and operations are realized through God.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Paul could plant and Apollos could water, but God caused the growth.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Paul had the planting ministry, and Apollos had the watering ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>However, even with the planting and the watering, God still must give the growth.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>This is entirely different from the work of laying floor tiles or making windows and doors.</S>
