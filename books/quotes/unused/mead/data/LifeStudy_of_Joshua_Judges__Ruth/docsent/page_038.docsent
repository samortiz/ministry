   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>LIFE-STUDY OF JUDGES MESSAGE FOUR THE MISERABLE HISTORY</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>OF ISRAEL S FORSAKING OF GOD</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>CHAPTERS 2 16 2 THE FIRST THREE CYCLES</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>OF THE MISERABLE HISTORY OF ISRAEL Scripture Reading: Judg.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>3:7 5:31</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Before we come to 3:7 5:31, I have the burden to speak a word concerning the intrinsic significance of this portion of Judges.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Prior to the history recorded in these chapters, the people of Israel had never had a female leader.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Then, suddenly, God raised up a female, Deborah, as a judge of Israel.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Regarding this, we need to realize that in the Bible, whenever God does something which stands out as being extraordinary, it is very significant.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>It indicates, first, man s failure, and then, God s excellent act.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>At the time of Judges 4, all the men of Israel had failed, so God raised up a woman.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>That raising up of a female changed the entire condition of Israel.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>In the Bible a proper female indicates one who is in submission to God, one who keeps God s ordination.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>This is the position that Israel should have taken before God, but the situation in Israel had become fully abnormal.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The men had left their position before Jehovah.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Hence, Israel violated God s ordination, leaving her position as God s wife and forsaking Him for hundreds of idols.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>This brought Israel into a miserable situation and condition.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>According to God s creation, Deborah was a very capable person.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>By reading her song in chapter five, we can see that she was full of ability, capacity, insight, and foresight.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>But such an excellent person was very submissive.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>God made her the leader, yet she kept the proper order and took Barak as her covering 4:6-9 .</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>She realized that she needed a man to be her covering.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Actually, Barak did nearly nothing, yet Deborah took him as her head covering.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>When she took this kind of standing, the whole nation became different.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>In their miserable situation no one would take the lead to fight for Jehovah s interest, and no one would be willing to follow.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>But when this excellent, extraordinary woman took the lead to practice the female submission to the man, the entire country came into the proper order.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Everyone returned to his or her proper position.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Thus Deborah could say in her song, Then a remnant of the nobles went down; / The people of Jehovah went down with me against the mighty 5:13 .</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>All the leaders took the lead, and all the people followed; the army was formed.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>At first, only some of the people followed, but eventually they all followed.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>From this we see that the entire country came into an excellent order, assuming the proper position before Jehovah.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Judges 5:15-16 speaks of great resolutions in heart and great searchings of heart.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>In Israel s miserable situation, no one was searching his heart.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>But the people needed a great searching of their hearts, and they needed to make great resolutions in their hearts to rise up and follow the others to fight for God s kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>We may apply this to our practice of the vital groups today.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>For the vital groups we need much prayer with repentance.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>In our prayer spontaneously the searching of the heart comes to us.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>This issues in a resolve to live for the Lord and to fight for the Lord according to the present need in His recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>In particular, we need to make a resolution before the Lord concerning gaining persons for His increase.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>This is great resolutions in heart.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Judges 3:12-13 says that Jehovah strengthened Israel s enemies, but 4:6-16 reveals that Jehovah was fighting for Israel.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>This shows that God is a God of incarnation.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>God wants man to match Him so that He can move.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>If Israel had not fought, God would not have fought for them.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>However, because Israel did fight under Deborah in a proper order, God fought for them.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The principle is the same with us today.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>If we do not go out to gain sinners, God will not go, but if we go, God also will go.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>However, this kind of going out needs a searching of our heart and a resolution in our heart.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>God will not work until we become active in this searching of our heart and making resolutions in our heart.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>This is the way to fight the battle; this is the way to preach the gospel; and this is the way to gain sinners to become members of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Judges 5:31b says, May those who love Him be like the sun / When it rises in its might.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>For the sun to rise in its might means that it shines brightly, brilliantly, and gloriously.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>We need the searchings, the resolutions, and the rising up to shine like the sun.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>If all the churches would be like this, they surely would enjoy the victory.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>May all the dear saints in the Lord s recovery have great searchings and make great resolutions, and may they all, by loving the Lord, rise up like the sun to shine brightly.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Let us now consider the first three cycles of the miserable history of Israel in 3:7 5:31.</S>
