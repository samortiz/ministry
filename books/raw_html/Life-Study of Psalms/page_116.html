<H2 CLASS=HEAD2>D. Asking God, as the Strength of His People<br>and the Stronghold of Salvation to His Anointed,<br>to Save His People, Bless His Inheritance,<br>Shepherd Them, and Carry Them Forever</H2><P>David also asked God, as the strength of His people and as the stronghold of salvation to His anointed, to save His people, bless His inheritance, shepherd them, and carry them forever (vv. 8-9). Psalm 28 does not reveal anything that is up to the standard of God's New Testament economy.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>V. IN PRAISING GOD FOR HIS GLORY AND MAJESTY</H2><P>Psalm 29 reveals the mixed expressions of David's sentiment in his praising God for His glory and majesty.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>A. Exhorting the Sons of God, the Mighty One,<br>to Ascribe to God Glory and Strength and Worship Him in Holy Splendor</H2><P>David exhorted the sons of God, the Mighty One, to ascribe to God glory and strength and worship Him in holy splendor (vv. 1-2).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>B. The Powerful and Majestic Voice of God&#151;<br>the Thunder of the God of Glory</H2><P>In verses 3-9 David speaks of the powerful and majestic voice of God&#151;the thunder of the God of glory. According to David, God's powerful and majestic voice is like thunder. He said that the voice of Jehovah was over the waters (v. 3), breaking the cedars of Lebanon, making them to skip like a calf, like a young wild ox (vv. 5-6). He also said the voice of Jehovah cleaves out flames of fire (v. 7) and shakes the wilderness, even the wilderness of Kadesh (v. 8). Furthermore, according to David, Jehovah's voice causes the hinds to calve and strips the forests bare, and "in His temple all say, Glory!" (v. 9).</P><P>As God's people in the New Testament, do we need this kind of prayer and praise to the Lord? We should be able to see that the standard, the level, on which this psalm was written is low. There is no comparison between David's praise and blessing in this psalm and the utterance in Paul's prayers in Ephesians 1 and 3. The New Testament does not have any prayer or praise according to David's way in Psalm 29. This psalm is too much in the material and physical realm.</P>
