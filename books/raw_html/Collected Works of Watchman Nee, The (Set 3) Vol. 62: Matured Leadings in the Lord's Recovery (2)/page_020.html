<h2 class="head1">THE IMPORTANCE OF VISITING NEW ONES</h2><p>We have to take care of visiting new believers in a proper way. This is a very important work. If a hired worker takes care of another person's sheep in Kuling and the sheep begets an ewe, the hired hand can claim half of the ewe. If the mother lamb begets two ewes, the hired worker can claim one of them, but if the sheep dies, he will have to pay for the loss. The master will only accept more when he receives back his entrustment; he cannot settle for less. In the future we will have to give an account at the judgment seat of Christ. The Lord has entrusted a certain number of people to the church. We should hand back at least that many people to Him. The elders must charge the responsible ones in a district to make proper arrangements for visiting new believers. They must never lose or drop anyone. The Lord has entrusted men to the church, not just to the elders. The brothers in all the districts should have this kind of feeling. They should feel the pressure to not lose anyone, realizing that they will have to give an account to the Lord.</p><h2 class="head1">A LOVE FOR THE BROTHERS</h2><p>It is not a happy thing to see a brother stumble. It is neither something to be angry about. We feel sorry and sad at the loss of any brother. Do not think that it is a light thing to lose a brother. Over ten years ago, a group of brothers and sisters wept continuously for six full days over the excommunication of a co-worker. Their tears were more bitter than anything they had experienced previously. Eventually, they decided to carry through with the excommunication. The excommunicated one was very angry. He wrote a long letter rebuking me. I only answered with a few words. I told him that while he was rebuking us, we were weeping for him for six full days. He was in wrath, but the brothers and sisters were in sorrow. We were hoping that this brother would turn, and we grieved over his excommunication. Our hearts were sad over this loss.</p><p>If a church builds up itself in love (Eph. 4:16), it will become a channel through which God will save all men. It will be able to look beyond itself to save other souls. If a church rises up and is up to the standard, many men will be brought in, and God will save many. For this reason we all have to learn to love the brothers, care for them, help them, and perfect them. We should do everything we can to gain every brother.</p>
