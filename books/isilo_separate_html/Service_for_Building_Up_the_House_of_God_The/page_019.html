<p>We have been blessed by the Lord in the years past, and we are still being blessed. We must beware lest we depend on the blessings. Once we depend on the blessings, they will become a snare and a danger to us. Many things are encompassed in the blessings. For example, when a locality begins to meet, there may be only three or five saints. Under such difficult circumstances the responsible ones might pray desperately and have much fellowship with the Lord. As a result, the locality might be blessed; that is, the number of saints might increase, and there is an increase in material offerings. The responsible ones might depend on such blessings. With the coming of these blessings, the responsible ones might pray less, have fewer dealings with God, and, as a result, have less fellowship with Him; that is, they depend less on God. This is the beginning of degradation, and the church has fallen into a snare. This can happen in a local church and also in the work of the Lord.</p>
<p>Some saints say that the work in Taiwan is easier now than it was when we began the Lord&rsquo;s testimony six to seven years ago. At that time, there were very few serving ones, and the situation in every locality was difficult. As a result, the serving ones were desperate. Now it is as if we have support that we can depend on. With over fifty localities in the province, we can bear the problems corporately; hence, the burden is not too heavy. On the one hand, it is good to bear the burden corporately, but on the other hand, this has become a snare that may cause us to lose our heart toward God and our willingness to be dealt with. Consequently, although the church is blessed, it may lose God&rsquo;s presence.</p>
<p>The Lord&rsquo;s presence is not a trivial matter. The value of our service and our way depends on His presence. Once we lose God&rsquo;s presence, we are finished. Our way and the ground can become a shell without the true content. Without the content, we lose the reality of the Body of Christ. This means that we lose both the fullness of Christ and the expression of Christ. This is one of the main factors of the degradation of the church.</p>
<p>We must be fearful and humble in spirit so that we do not depend solely upon God&rsquo;s blessings. We should fear the blessings more than anything else. We should not celebrate because of the blessings that God has given us. We must realize that blessings often become idols, which cause us to lose God&rsquo;s presence; that is, they can become a wall between us and God. It is possible to have God&rsquo;s blessing yet be without His presence.</p>
<p>We must look to the Lord for His mercy so that we may guard against the dangers and deal with them. There are still other dangers, such as staleness and oldness. We need to comprehend the principle of these dangers.</p>
<h2 class="head1">AVOIDING THE DANGERS</h2>
<p>The way to avoid the five dangers is to not let anything or anyone become a barrier between us and God. The responsible ones in the churches and the workers must learn to contact God in all things. No matter how good or spiritual something may be, we should not let it come into our relationship with God. We should learn to live always in His presence and not let anything cause Him to hide His face from us. We must not have an &ldquo;Isaac&rdquo; who keeps us from loving God. Regardless of what blessings or gifts God gives us, we must place them on the altar. The ministry books that benefit us must be placed on the altar, and the blessings that the church receives must be placed on the altar. We need to be dealt with by God and not remain in the blessings. The work may spread and raise up more churches, but the work and the issue need to be put on the altar; they must not come between us and God. Anything that becomes a wall between us and God should be demolished. The way to avoid any danger is to contact God, live in the light of His face, and touch His presence.</p>
<p>When we live before God, every institution, system, and organization will lose its position. Institutions, systems, and organizations cannot remain in the light of His face. When we touch the light of His face, doctrines disappear, and systems and organizations cease to exist.</p>
<p>As those who have been called by the Lord and led to serve Him, if we lose our fellowship with Him and do not live in His presence, our service will become a form of employment. We must learn to live in the light of His face, to touch His presence, to fellowship with Him continually, and to let Him touch our problems and our intentions. Then we will be burdened to accept the commission of the Holy Spirit, and our service will be saved from the danger of becoming an employment. If we covet God&rsquo;s blessing and remain in it, there will be snares everywhere in our path. The only way to avoid the dangers is to be before the Lord and let Him have authority over all things.</p>
<p>May the Lord have mercy on us so that we may learn to live before His face continually and let the Spirit have His rightful place among us. Then the dangers will disappear. Otherwise, the very things that we condemn today will transpire among us in the future. I hope that the saints in every locality will pray concerning this fellowship and ask the Lord to deliver us from the many dangers in our path and from losing His presence.</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_018.html">Prev</a> | Next </body></html>
