   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>OVER TWO HUNDRED MILLION COPIES SOLD</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>What is the circulation of such a book?</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Last year 1935 , more than two hundred million copies were sold.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Can you name another book that has such a high circulation rate?</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>This statistic, moreover, is not limited to just last year; every year the number has remained approximately the same.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In one sense this book is very popular.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>In another sense it is like a thorn in your hand; it pierces you.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>This book gives you a headache.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>It creates an unspeakable uneasiness within man.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>It even causes man to oppose it.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>In spite of this, its annual sales are still over two hundred million.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Furthermore, this book is translated into more than seven hundred twenty languages.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>In every country and among every race, there is a translation of this unique book.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>It is extremely easy for anyone to obtain a Bible anywhere in the world.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>If the Rig-Veda were God's book, then more than half of the world would perish due to a failure in obtaining it.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Even if you put the Rig-Veda in my hand, I would still be unable to understand it.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>If only the educated ones can contact God, then I am destined to go to hell.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>If only the Indians have the opportunity, we Chinese, as well as other races, are out of hope.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>If God speaks through the Rig-Veda, then where can we find that book?</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Maybe we can only find the original copy in the London Museum.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>And even that may not contain the original meaning of God's revelation to man.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>A COMPLETE BOOK</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>This is not all.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The Bible contains sixty-six books and it is divided into the Old and New Testaments.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>It was written by no less than thirty people.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The span from the time the first book was written to the time when the last book was finished is more than sixteen hundred years.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The places where they were written are also different.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Some were written in Babylon, some in Italy, some at one end of Asia Minor, others at the other end of the Mediterranean.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Furthermore, the writers themselves differed in their backgrounds.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Some were lawyers; some were fishermen.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>There were princes, and there were shepherds.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>All these writings by men of different backgrounds, languages, environments, and periods are put together.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The amazing thing is that it is still a complete book.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>All those who have had some experience of editing know that in order to put together a few articles written by different authors, it is necessary for the authors to be of comparable level of academic achievements and viewpoints.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Even when the academic standard and viewpoints are similar, there will still be conflicts and contradictions when you put five or six articles together.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>But the Bible, though complex in contents, contains history, poetry, laws, prophecies, biographies, and doctrines and was written by so many different ones at different times and under different circumstances, yet when you put them together, they surprisingly run as one continuous volume.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>There is no conflict or contradiction.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>They are written in one breath.</S>
