[1]  CONTENTS THE CHRISTIAN 1934-1940 Preface Waste and Pragmatism Issue No.
[2]  The Christian was first published in November 1925 and discontinued in 1928 after twenty-four issues.
[3]  There are many significances to this portion of the Scripture, and I will not repeat what I have said.
[4]  Last Monday evening during the Bible study meeting, I said that, the Lord willing, we would specifically speak on this passage on the Lord's Day.
[5]  But the Lord told them that if they would not take up their cross to follow Him, they could not be His disciples, and that if they loved their parents more than they loved Him, they were not worthy to be His disciples, or if they would not leave behind everything in this world, they could not be His disciples.
[6]  Many believe in Christ, not because they realize that Christ is the goal, but because they think that through Christ they can go to God and heaven.
[7]  Her pouring of ointment on the Lord's head and body was for His burial.
[8]  Mary thought: "I have seen my brother being raised from the dead, and He has stayed in our house many times.
[9]  He has told His disciples four times that He will die Matt 16:21; 17:22-23; 20:17-19; 26:1-2 , but the disciples did not understand what He meant.
[10]  For this could have been sold for much and given to the poor" vv.
[11]  Judas was the first to say this, and the disciples followed and echoed his words.
[12]  He is telling us one thing: "For the poor you have with you always, but you do not always have Me."
[13]  In other words, He is telling us that there will be much time for us to work, but the opportunity to love Him is only here while the Lord is living.
[14]  I am not saying that we will not love the Lord in eternity anymore, but I am saying that the opportunity to demonstrate our love to Him is today.
[15]  2 and 3 Scripture Reading: Gen 2:17; 3:12; 4:3; 25:30; Luke 15:18; John 3:18; 16:9; Acts 2:36-38; Rom 1:21, 24, 26, 28; 3:10, 23
[16]  This morning, by the grace of God, I would like to deliver a gospel message to you.
[17]  My focus today is on the one unique sin in the Bible.
[18]  They say that man needs a Savior because he has sinned, and if man had not sinned, he would not have needed a Savior.
[19]  If there is anyone here who has not believed in the Lord, you may not have committed any other sin, but you are a sinner already.
[20]  Friends, I am not asking how you are doing in your homes.
[21]  I am not asking if you get along well with your brothers.
[22]  You may not have fought and gone to court with your brothers over your inheritance.
[23]  But I have to ask you one thing: can you say that there is no problem between you and God?
[24]  You may have handled many problems with the world properly, but if your relationship with God is not proper, there is still one problem that is unsolved, and you are still a sinner.
[25]  Chapter one, verse 21 says, "Because though they knew God, they did not glorify Him as God or thank Him, but rather became vain in their reasonings, and their heart, lacking understanding, was darkened."
[26]  Men know that God is God, but they do not want to call God God.
[27]  They know God, but they do not glorify Him as God.
[28]  Verses 29 through 32 say, "Being filled with all unrighteousness, wickedness, covetousness, malice; full of envy, murder, strife, deceit, malignity; whisperers, slanderers, hateful to God, insolent, arrogant, boasters, inventors of evil things, disobedient to parents, senseless, faithless, affectionless, merciless; who, though fully knowing the righteous judgment of God, that those who practice such things are worthy of death, not only do them, but also have fellow delight in those who practice them."
[29]  Please ask yourself if there is something wrong between you and God?
[30]  Perhaps you think that you are physically well neither your heart nor lungs are sick and will not perish.
[31]  You have to consider what you are before God.
[32]  Our attitude toward this man from Nazareth becomes our attitude toward God, because Jesus of Nazareth is the Word becoming flesh; He is God coming to the world in the form of the flesh.
[33]  Acts 2:36 through 38 says, "Therefore let all the house of Israel know assuredly that God has made Him both Lord and Christ, this Jesus whom you have crucified.
[34]  A black woman was working as a housemaid and living poorly.
[35]  Yet she was a Christian, and she was always happy.
[36]  In her mouth there was always a "Hallelujah" and "Praise the Lord."
[37]  If your mistress does not want you anymore, if you get back pain and cannot do the laundry anymore, if your son becomes sick, if the money you have earned is stolen, if you have some accidents, or if..."
[38]  CONFESSION Issue No. 4 Scripture Reading: Lev 6:1-5; Psa 32:1-7; Prov 28:13; Matt 5:23-26; 3:7-8; Luke 3:10-14 THE SIGNIFICANCE OF CONFESSION
[39]  The subject of confession is an important matter after one's salvation.
[40]  First, we must be clear that no Christian in this world can be saved through confession.
[41]  Some have said that without confession, there is no salvation.
[42]  We should not hate sin because we are afraid of losing our face, because we do not have the "capital" to sin, or because we are afraid of the consequence of sin.
[43]  If I sin against both God and my brother, it is not enough for me to just confess to God, without confessing to my brother also.
[44]  I must confess that although I am a preacher of the Word, I am also ashamed to confess.
[45]  However, I can tell you some of my past experiences.
[46]  5 and 6 Scripture Reading: Gen 6:1-9; 8:1a, 4-5, 13-21; 1 Pet 3:20-21; Mark 16:16a
[47]  We are all familiar with the story of Noah.
[48]  Some cases have to do with our fellowship with God, while others have to do with our position in the world.
[49]  Sin against God is mentioned in chapter three; it is a sin before God, a sin of disobedience against God.
[50]  Because the world is full of sin, some groundwork must be done before the Holy Spirit can operate.
[51]  After man fell into sin, it became difficult for the Holy Spirit to do anything.
[52]  The first thing God did after man sinned was to send the Lord Jesus to the world.
[53]  The Lord Jesus must first judge a sinner before the Holy Spirit can begin His work.
[54]  This is why the first parable in Luke 15 is on the good Shepherd, the Lord Jesus, who came to seek the lost sheep.
[55]  As long as you have a part in the worldly realm, organization, tradition, or system, you are at enmity with God, and you are in need of being saved from it.
[56]  At that time, Noah and all the living creatures the fowls, cattle, and creeping things were saved.
[57]  Noah is a type of the Savior, and the ark is also a type of the Savior.
[58]  Noah is a type of the Son of God, while the ark is a type of the Son of Man.
[59]  The ark was made of gopher wood, and it is a type of the humanity of the Lord Jesus.
[60]  You may try to do this in secret, but God will not allow you to do this before Him.
[61]  There are two great communities in this world: one is the world community, and the other is the community of those who are saved in Christ.
[62]  Being saved is being delivered out of the world community which opposes God, which is sinful and unclean, and entering into the community of Christ.
[63]  Of course, we must first believe in the Lord.
[64]  You may know that you have life, and you may be very clear that you have believed in the Son of God as your Savior.
[65]  I have to say a few words to those who are not saved.
[66]  It is an undeniable fact that we cannot improve the world and God will judge it.
[67]  Let me ask: If you acknowledge the redemptive work of Christ and believe that His crucifixion on the cross is for your redemption, why are you afraid to declare that you are saved?
[68]  Mr. Moody told him the Scripture says that those who believe have eternal life, and that he who comes to the Lord will not be rejected, and that God will save to the uttermost those who come to Him.
[69]  Therefore, you must not only be faithful to serve God, but you must be faithful to do what you testified at the time of your baptism.
[70]  In the mind of many people, Mark 16:16 reads, "He who believes and is saved shall be baptized."
[71]  They think that as long as they believe in the Lord, they will be saved, and that after they are saved, they should be baptized.
[72]  This means that it is not enough for a person to believe; he must also be baptized before he can be saved.
[73]  The question today is not whether you have believed, but whether or not you have been baptized.
[74]  We are not asking if you have received the Lord, but if others have seen this change in you.
[75]  Believing involves a breakthrough in your spiritual life and passing from death unto life inwardly.
[76]  Believing is to pass from death unto life before God, while being baptized is to pass from death unto life before men.
[77]  Believing is to inwardly receive the eternal life, while being baptized is to outwardly announce to others that from now on, you have opened up yourself to showing others that you are a Christian, that you are hidden no more.
[78]  Prior to this, you were a hidden Nicodemus, but now you are telling others openly that you are saved and different from them.
[79]  Therefore brothers, please do not carry me to places where I do not want to go, and please do not do what I do not want to do.
[80]  Today we will speak on the food of God's people.
[81]  Is eating the meat of the lamb all that we have to do?
[82]  We may have left Egypt, but there is still a wilderness journey which we have to take.
[83]  I would like to ask you a very frank question: Since the time you received the Lord Jesus as your Savior, how much experience have you had of eating the manna?
[84]  Since this is the case, drinking the water must mean the enjoyment of life.
[85]  But if we only have these two things, there is not much enjoyment, and a Christian will have a long face all day long.
[86]  God told Moses to go up to Mount Horeb, which is one of the peaks of Mount Sinai, and He said, "Behold, I will stand before thee there upon the rock in Horeb; and thou shalt smite the rock, and there shall come water out of it, that the people may drink" v. 6 . Our water comes from the rock before God.
[87]  7 and 8 Scripture Reading: Psa 5:3; Isa 50:4
[88]  The matters we have covered during the past few weeks are related to young believers.
[89]  Please note that "young" refers to spiritual age not actual age.
[90]  We have covered what they should do so that they can be perfected and grow in God.
[91]  Last week we spoke on confession and its necessity for our growth before God.
[92]  If you want God to speak to you, you have to go early in the morning to the place where Jehovah speaks with you.
[93]  Joshua 6:12 says, "And Joshua rose early in the morning, and the priests took up the ark of Jehovah."
[94]  This is a record of Joshua leading the Israelites to take the city of Jericho.
[95]  All those who want to overcome their enemies must rise up early.
[96]  Joshua 8:10 says, "And Joshua rose early in the morning and mustered the people; and he and the elders of Israel went up before the people against Ai."
[97]  If we do not rise up early, what harm will it do to us?
[98]  Even our time is the Lord's. If we spend our time in bed, we offend the Lord.
[99]  Would it not be better if we rose up early and used the time to pray for others, to testify, to draw near to the Lord in fellowship, and to study the Bible?
[100]  If we do not spend time before the Lord in the morning to be properly taught by Him, but rush to our work office workers rushing to the office, students rushing to school, doctors rushing to the hospital, and shopkeepers rushing to the shops we will not have any spiritual strength.
[101]  In order to rise up early, one must go to bed early.
[102]  If you cannot overcome the habit of going to bed late, you cannot rise up early.
[103]  If you go to bed late and rise up early, your health will be affected; you will be tired all the day, like one floating in the clouds.
[104]  9 and 10 Scripture Reading: Matt 9:9-17; Luke 5:27-39
[105]  In these two passages the Lord mentions five parables.
[106]  You may think that there are only two parables: the new garment and the new wine.
[107]  These five parables deal with: 1 the unfulled cloth, 2 the old garment, 3 the new wine, 4 the old wine, and 5 "no one who has drunk the old desires the new, for he says, The old is better."
[108]  Let us consider how these five parables show us the salvation that God has prepared for us in His Son, Jesus Christ.
[109]  Perhaps you think that just because there are times when you do not know what you are doing or saying, the Lord Jesus is also the same.
[110]  The worst thing that can happen to a patient is to avoid the doctor.
[111]  But unless a sick person admits that he is sick, he will not consult a doctor.
[112]  John 1 says that the law was first given by Moses, and then grace and reality came through Jesus Christ v. 17 . God took four thousand years to show man that he is sick.
[113]  When the Lord Jesus said this, the Pharisees immediately raised a question.
[114]  They did not care if they were sick or well.
[115]  They wanted to say what they said because they had judged that the Lord Jesus and His disciples were gluttons.
[116]  We have met some so-called evangelistic ministries or some preachers who have said that Jesus was not born of a virgin, that He is not the Son of God, that His blood is not for redemption, that He had died but did not resurrect, that His deeds and works before His death were patterns, and that His death is not important.
[117]  The people who say this only care for what the Lord Jesus did during His thirty-three years on earth.
[118]  They do not see the necessity of the Son of Man being lifted up.
[119]  They have not seen that the Son of Man would be lifted up just as Moses lifted up the bronze serpent in the wilderness John 3:14 ; they do not realize how important this matter is.
[120]  They consider the Lord Jesus' death to be nothing more than the death of an ordinary person.
[121]  They do not believe that the Lord's death is the death of God.
[122]  They do not realize that if the Lord had not died, we would have to die.
[123]  If you ask whether their Christian conduct is as good as the Lord's, they will readily answer no. But if you ask them what they should do, they answer that they have to donate more money to the church or do more good works.
[124]  I will try not to lie or go to movies, and I will try to be good and answer to my conscience so that the world will say that I am an upright and clean person and God will be pleased with me."
[125]  The picture that Luke presents to us is different from the picture that Matthew and Mark present.
[126]  Luke 5:36 says, "And He also spoke a parable to them: No one tears a patch from a new garment and puts it on an old garment; otherwise, he will tear the new garment."
[127]  Suppose a man has two garments, one old and the other new.
[128]  On returning home, he sees that the old garment is torn.
[129]  Can he say that he loves his old garment so much, and has been wearing it for so long, and is so attached to it, he does not want to throw it away?
[130]  I asked them what they would do if they could not make it all the way, and they answered that they would ask the Lord for help because the Lord had accumulated so much merit already.
[131]  Our only way lies in removing the goodness of our flesh and everything that we consider good, that is, in removing our own torn garment, and acknowledging that the Lord Jesus Christ is the Savior, and that His cross has accomplished the work of redemption.
[132]  All that we have to do now is to acknowledge that our garment is torn, that we are corrupt and cannot perform any good, and that we need the Lord to give us a new garment.
[133]  We can live before God because of this righteousness, and there is no need to add anything to it.
[134]  When I am in Christ, God sees me as He sees Christ.
[135]  I can present Christ before God and say, "God, I can come to You because I am in Christ."
[136]  The garment speaks of the Christ from God who has become our righteousness for us to live before God.
[137]  Why can new wine not be put in the old wineskin?
[138]  Some have said that we are the old wineskin.
[139]  GOD INTERRUPTING MAN'S SPEAKING Issue No. 13 Scripture Reading: Luke 9:33-35; Matt 17:24-27; Acts 10:34-35, 44-46
[140]  Many portions in the Bible are God's direct speaking.
[141]  Although other portions are not God's direct speaking, they are nevertheless spoken by God.
[142]  Consequently, the Bible says that these other portions are also the word of God.
[143]  One interesting thing that the Bible shows us is that God is not only the best at speaking; He is also the best at listening.
[144]  The Lord Jesus asked him, "From whom do the kings of the earth receive custom or poll tax, from their sons or from strangers?" v. 25 . Peter answered, "From strangers." Jesus answered, "So then the sons are free" v. 26 . When the Lord said that the sons do not need to pay tax, He annulled Peter's word outside the house or in the courtyard.
[145]  Peter did not have the intention at first to go to the house of Cornelius in Caesarea.
[146]  He went because he saw the vision; he saw a big sheet coming down from heaven.
[147]  The first is that now is not the time for us to speak; this is the time for us to listen.
[148]  The second meaning of this word is that even though there are Christ, Moses, and Elijah, we should hear only Him.
[149]  If we did not set our eyes on him or if he was not there, there was no rule, and we would not know what to do and not do.
[150]  Nee, in your opinion, should we do this?"
[151]  I ask why they have asked, and they say, "When I read the Bible, I found that one person expounded this passage one way, and another person expounded it another way.
[152]  Many times theologians who have a very good knowledge of the Bible and who are very educated make judgments that are worse than those of illiterate, simple people who cannot read the Bible and who have no knowledge of the Bible.
[153]  Peter felt that Moses and Elijah were very important.
[154]  He felt that a tent should be made for Elijah also.
[155]  He thought that it was important to have the prophets, and that a place should be reserved for the prophets.
[156]  In God's eyes, the prophets could not be allowed; there could no longer be any prophets.
[157]  Peter said, "You are the Christ, the Son of the living God" v. 16 . Jesus said, "Upon this rock I will build My church" v. 18 . Upon what is the church built? The church is built upon the foundation of "You are the Christ, the Son of the living God." The Lord said something wonderful after this: "The gates of Hades shall not prevail against it." Why? Because the church is built upon this rock; it is built upon the words "You are the Christ, the Son of the living God." I have often asked myself who Jesus of Nazareth is.
[158]  Peter saw the tax collectors coming, and he made up his mind to tell them, "Yes, yes.
[159]  I can guarantee that we will pay the tax.
[160]  I have been with the Lord for so many years.
[161]  If the Lord Jesus paid the tax, it would mean that the Son of God required redemption just as we do.
[162]  This means, "Lest we stumble them, lest we offend them, you should go and fish, and take the fish that you catch and open its mouth, and you will find a stater; take that and give it to them for Me and you."
[163]  The Mount of Transfiguration involved the matter of the content of Christianity, the house involved the matter of the foundation of Christianity, and Caesarea involved the matter of the sphere of Christianity.
[164]  LEAKING AND DRIFTING Issue No. 14 Scripture Reading: Heb 2:1-4
[165]  The book of Hebrews contains various passages of warnings.
[166]  Every time there is a word of warning in Hebrews, we can find an important teaching immediately preceding or following the warning.
[167]  Because the Lord Jesus, as spoken of in chapter one, is so lofty, glorious, and excellent, because He is such a God, full of glory, and above all men and even the angels, we have to give heed to the things that we have heard.
[168]  I do not know who the writer of Hebrews was.
[169]  Some have said that it was Paul, and others have said that it was Luke.
[170]  Since it does not tell us who he was, we do not need to say anything about it.
[171]  God did not tell us his name, and we do not have to guess it.
[172]  The word pararrhueo not only means leaking; in the original language it also means drifting past.
[173]  Drifting means that there is no need of exerting any strength.
[174]  But if one drifts along with the current, there is no need to exert any strength.
[175]  If you do, you have to show me your faith, and you have to press forward all the way to the end. You have to set your eyes on the goal, and you must resolve to reach your goal.
[176]  Let us consider some of the dangers a Christian can face.
[177]  According to the apostle, the greatest dangers are to drift and to leak.
[178]  Let us take this first warning as our reminder.
[179]  If we live in jesting and laughter every day and if we are careless in everything, without seeing the need of fearing God, and if we do not have any feeling for anything, but are nonchalant and unconcerned about spiritual matters and ignorant of their value to us, we have not seen our need and have not realized our danger.
[180]  If the law was spoken through the angels, and those who transgressed against it suffered great punishment, "how shall we escape if we have neglected so great a salvation, which, having had its beginning in being spoken by the Lord, has been confirmed to us by those who heard, God bearing witness with them both by signs and wonders and by various works of power and by distributions of the Holy Spirit according to His will"?
