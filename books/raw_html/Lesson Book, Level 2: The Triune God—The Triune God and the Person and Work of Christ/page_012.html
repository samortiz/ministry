<h1 class="msg">Lesson Six</h1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>THE COINHERENCE OF THE TRIUNE GOD<br>AND HIS BELIEVERS</H1><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>Scripture Reading</H2><H1 CLASS=SCRIPTURE>Jn. 17:21; Eph. 4:6; Gal. 2:20; Col. 1:27; Jn. 14:17; 1 Jn. 2:23; Rom. 8:9-10; Matt. 28:19; 1 Cor. 1:30; Rom. 6:3; 1 Cor. 12:13.</H1><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>Outline</H2><ol class="upper-roman"><li>The Triune God being in us</li><li>Our being in the Triune God</li><li>Living in this coinherence</li></ol><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>Text</H2><P>God's economy is to dispense Himself into us. Because the Triune God is essentially one, the whole Triune God has entered into us. Not just one-third of God has entered, but the whole God has entered into us. At the same time that the Triune God entered into us through our believing and calling on His name, He also put us into Himself. So now the Triune God is in us and we are in the Triune God. Hallelujah, we are coinhering with the Triune God! Not only the Father, Son, and Spirit are coinhering, but also we His believers coinhere with the Triune God. In John 17:21 the Lord Jesus prayed, "Even as You, Father, are in Me and I in You, that they also may be in Us."</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>I. THE TRIUNE GOD BEING IN US</H2><P>Ephesians 4:6 tells us that the Father is in us: "One God and Father of all, Who is over all and through all and in all." The Son, Jesus Christ, is also in us, as revealed by Galatians 2:20: "Christ lives in me," and Colossians 1:27: "Christ in you, the hope of glory." Before His crucifixion, the Lord Jesus pointed out to His disciples that the Spirit would be in them: "Even the Spirit of reality...shall be in you" (John 14:17). From these verses we can clearly see that the Father, Son, and Spirit are all in us. But how many are in you? Do you have three Gods in you? No. You just have one God in you. Who is this One? He is the Triune God&#151;Father, Son, and Spirit. We do not have three Gods in us; our experience tells us that we have just one in us. The Father is in the Son to be in us, and the Son who is in us is the Spirit. The Spirit in us is the Son in us, and the Father is in the Son to be in us. Therefore, as long as we have the Spirit, we have the Son and the Father too.</P><P>First John 2:23 says, "Everyone who denies the Son does not have the Father either; he who confesses the Son has the Father also." Romans 8:9-10 further reveals that the Spirit of Christ in us is Christ Himself. Therefore, when man has the Spirit, he also has the Son; and when man has the Son, he also has the Father. The Father is in the Son, and the Son is the Spirit who comes into us that we may have and enjoy such a Triune God. In words there are three, but in experience there is only one. This is really a mystery.</P>
