   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER ONE CONCERNING THE GOSPEL IN SCHOOLS 1</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>There are close to eight hundred saints who are burdened for the work in the schools.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>This is unprecedented among us.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>We rejoice that the saints are burdened to focus on the gospel work.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>We must fellowship and pray together concerning the way to advance in the gospel work in the junior high schools, high schools, and colleges.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>AN UNPRECEDENTED OPPORTUNITY</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>TO SPREAD THE GOSPEL</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>According to statistics, in Taipei there are about one hundred schools that are either junior high school, high school, or college.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>If we count only the colleges with a day curriculum, there are twenty-one colleges with about one hundred ten thousand students.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>If we include the students in junior high school and high school, there are a total of three hundred and seventy thousand students.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>This means that in the city of Taipei alone, there are three hundred and seventy thousand young people between the ages of twelve and twenty-two.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>We are in a big fishpond!</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>This is a great matter.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>With regard to spreading the gospel, this is an unprecedented opportunity in the Lord s recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>With regard to the environment, we thank the Lord for giving us a country that is thriving in every aspect.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>This country has good security, a calm society, and advanced education.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The government grants much freedom to the church and does not interfere with the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The past two thousand years of history show that the gospel, the truth, and the church are a great help to any country or society.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Whenever the gospel, the truth, and the church enter a country or a society, they bring in blessing.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Furthermore, the propagation of the gospel is aided by the availability of education in Taiwan.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>When Western missionaries went to China to preach the gospel a hundred years ago, the first problem they encountered was the lack of knowledge among the people, because education was not available.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Therefore, most people could carry on a general conversation only about simple things.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>It was difficult for a person to talk about deeper things.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Not many people were educated, and the schools were mostly private.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Thus, when Western missionaries went to China to preach the gospel, their preaching was restricted by the ignorance of the people.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>This forced the missionaries to establish schools.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Today the educational standard in Taiwan is very high.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Most Westerners are aware of the fact that the Taiwanese people pay attention to education and that all the parents push their children to study hard.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>There are also many advertisements in the newspapers for additional help in all kinds of subjects.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>In fact, education has nearly become an idol in Taiwan.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>This higher educational standard is a great help to the spread of the truth of the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>We do not have to labor to establish schools like the Western missionaries.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The church in Taipei has been here for thirty-five years, and the number of saints in the church life is close to seven thousand with around three to four thousand in regular attendance.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>We can say that the church is full of resources.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>We have three hundred seventy thousand fish around us, and many saints are burdened for the gospel in the schools.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>This standard of education and the backing of the church are our capital.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>With this capital, we need to spend time to study a scientific way to preach the gospel in the schools.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>In the past we distributed gospel tracts at the gate of a school and smiled even when we were mocked.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Although this conduct was noble and we could say we had the Spirit of Christ, our method was primitive.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>It was not scientific.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>In every aspect the world is improving and progressing even in the way companies package their products.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>In the earlier days fruit stores used old newspaper to wrap their products for their customers, but today the packaging is very refined.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Preaching the gospel like we did thirty-five years ago is an indication that the church has fallen behind the times.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>THE TRUTH BEING UNCHANGEABLE</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>BUT THE METHODS OF PREACHING THE GOSPEL</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>BEING CHANGEABLE</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>We can never change the truth in the Bible, but there is room for change in the way we preach and spread the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Before the nineteenth century, there were no trains or steam ships.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>There were only wagons on the land and sailboats in the water.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>In the 1930s I was laboring in northern China.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>When I was preparing to travel to the inland area with several co-workers to preach the gospel, the Sino-Japanese war broke out following the Marco Polo Bridge Incident, and the entire country was thrust into a state of preparing for war.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>All domestic trains were stopped.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>In order to travel to the inland area, we had to use an ox cart.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>We set off at seven o clock in the morning, but by nine o clock in the evening we had covered less than thirty miles.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>With all the jolting and tossing on the way, my joints were quite sore by the time we arrived at our destination.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Nowadays a direct flight from Los Angeles to Taipei takes only twelve hours, and the journey by plane is smooth.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>This is an indication of the improvement in the means of transportation.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>We cannot change the shape of the earth, but we can improve the means of transportation.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>This is the age of science in which everything should progress.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Therefore, the way we preach the gospel and spread the truth should also progress.</S>
