   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE INWARD FILLING</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Since there is an inward and an outward aspect in the Holy Spirit s relationship with the believers, there is an inward and an outward aspect to being filled with the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The different aspects of the filling of the Holy Spirit are even referenced in the New Testament with different words in Greek.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>These words were chosen by the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>In Greek two different words are used to speak of the Holy Spirit s inward filling and the Holy Spirit s outward filling.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>When the Bible speaks of the inward filling of the Holy Spirit, it uses the word pleroo.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The original meaning of this word is to fill, as when water or air fills a vessel.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Therefore, it refers to the Holy Spirit s inward filling.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The Lord s Commandment</S>

   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>This verse speaks of the Holy Spirit s inward filling.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>According to the Lord s commandment in the Bible, the believers are charged to be filled in spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>When we are filled with the Holy Spirit, we are following the Lord s commandment.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>If we are not filled inwardly, we are disobeying the Lord s commandment.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>We should pursue the inward filling of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The Inward Filling of the Holy Spirit</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Being for Spiritual Living and</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Causing Our Spiritual Life to Mature</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Being filled inwardly by the Holy Spirit is for spiritual living, and it causes our spiritual life to mature.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>This is the spontaneous function of the Holy Spirit s inward filling.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>If we are not filled with the Holy Spirit inwardly, we cannot have a daily life that is according to the Spirit, and it will be impossible for our spiritual life to mature.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Both a spiritual living and spiritual maturity depend upon our being filled with the Holy Spirit inwardly.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>1.</S>

   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The early disciples were filled with joy and with the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Joy comes out of life, and it is expressed through living.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Therefore, the filling of the Holy Spirit in this verse refers to the inward aspect of life, which is for life and living.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>2.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Look therefore carefully how you walk...Understand what the will of the Lord is.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>And do not be drunk with wine...but be filled in spirit,...being subject to one another in the fear of Christ Eph 5:15-21 .</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The conditions spoken of in these verses, including walking carefully, understanding the will of the Lord, not being drunk with wine, fearing Christ, and being subject to one another in the fear of Christ, are all part of a spiritual living.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Therefore, there is an aspect of being filled with the Holy Spirit that is related to our spiritual living.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>We must be filled with the Holy Spirit inwardly, allow the Holy Spirit to have the authority, and receive the discipline of the Holy Spirit so that we can have a spiritual living that is pleasing to God.</S>

   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>After we are filled with the Spirit inwardly, we are full of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Fill is a verb, and full pleres in Greek is an adjective.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Thus, filling is the process, and being full is a condition that results from passing through the process.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>To be filled is to go through a gate, but to be full involves maintaining a condition constantly.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>We need to be filled with the Holy Spirit to arrive at the level of being full of the Holy Spirit, and we need to maintain a condition of being full of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The Lord Jesus was filled inwardly with the Holy Spirit and full of the Holy Spirit.</S>

   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>They chose seven men who were full of the Spirit and of wisdom.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Overseeing the daily dispensing requires not only wisdom but also a proper living.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Therefore, the men who were chosen were full of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>They were not filled with the Holy Spirit for a short period of time; they were constantly full of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>As a result, their life was rich and full of wisdom.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>This enabled them to bear the burden of the very difficult matter of overseeing the daily dispensing for many people.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>3.</S>
