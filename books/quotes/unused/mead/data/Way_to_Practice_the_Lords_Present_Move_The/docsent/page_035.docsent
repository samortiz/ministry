   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>WATCHING UNTO PRAYER</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In the New Testament watchfulness is wrapped up with prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Ephesians 6:18 tells us that we should be those watching unto prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>We need to be watchful, on the alert for our prayer life.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Watching unto this in verse 18 refers back to prayer and petition.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>There is no other way to get the oil except by praying.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>If you do not pray, that means you do not pay the price to buy the oil.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Through prayer we receive more Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Every time we pray we have the deep sensation that some amount of the Spirit has been gained by us in our prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>To spend our time for prayer rather than for so many other things means to pay the price to get the oil.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>BUYING THE OIL FOR OURSELVES</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>All ten virgins were raised up from the dead, but their rapture after their resurrection was according to how much oil they had in their vessels.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Our initial receiving of the Spirit at regeneration is not a ticket for us to enter into the wedding feast.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The sufficient oil, the adequate oil, will become our entry, our ticket, to the wedding feast.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The foolish virgins discovered that they did not have the adequate supply of oil, so they wanted to borrow from the wise ones 25:8 .</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Then the wise virgins indicated that what they had was only sufficient for them 25:9 .</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Here is a principle we can never borrow others spirituality.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>One s spirituality can only qualify himself.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>You cannot borrow another s eating, and another person cannot eat for you.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>It is impossible.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>You cannot even borrow another person s study.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>You cannot ask someone to go to school for you and borrow whatever he learns.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The wise virgins told the foolish ones they had to buy the oil for themselves.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>When they were going to buy, the ready ones who had the sufficient oil were raptured.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>No doubt, that was before the tribulation.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The foolish ones were charged to go to those who sell the oil.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>According to Zechariah 4:11-14 and Revelation 11:3-4, the two witnesses during the great tribulation, the two olive trees and the two sons of oil, will be the oil sellers.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>That means they will give people more Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The foolish virgins have to go to these oil sellers in the great tribulation to buy the oil.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>At that time the entire world will be a place of tribulation.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>As long as you are there, you are suffering; you are passing through the tribulation.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>If the foolish ones do not go to these oil sellers in the tribulation, they could never get the oil.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>This shows us that the foolish virgins will have to pay some price in suffering to get the oil, a price which they had never paid in their entire Christian lives.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Even after the resurrection, they will still have to go through the suffering to pay the price for the oil.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Finally, the foolish ones came 25:11 , but their coming, their rapture, was too late.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The point again is this since the time we were saved, every day should be redeemed by us to buy the oil.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>We all need to rise up from today to buy the oil.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>NOT GRIEVING THE HOLY SPIRIT OF GOD</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Ephesians 4:30 tells us not to grieve the Holy Spirit of God.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Do not make Him unhappy.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The Holy Spirit who is now sealing us unto the redemption of our body is in us.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>We must make Him happy.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Because He has really joined us with Him as one 1 Cor 6:17 , when we are unhappy, this indicates that He is unhappy.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>If you do not come to the meeting, or if you come and do not function, this makes the Spirit unhappy.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>At the end of the day you may not feel so good, but when you come to the meeting and function in it, you feel so happy.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>This means the Holy Spirit is happy within you.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>If you do not feel happy, this is an indication that you have grieved Him.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Why have you grieved Him?</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Because you did not buy Him.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>You did not pay the price for Him.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>He is the oil.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>NOT QUENCHING THE SPIRIT</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>First Thessalonians 5:19 says, Do not quench the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Sometimes we even go farther not only to grieve Him but also to quench Him.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Sometimes we may tell the Lord to tolerate us for a certain time and not to inspire us.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>We may know the Spirit is moving within us, but we may not like it.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>To quench the Spirit is to reject the buying of the oil.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>In many things we do not buy the Spirit, so we miss the chance to accumulate more and more of the Spirit in our being.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>WALKING ACCORDING TO SPIRIT</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Nearly the last charge in the entire New Testament is to walk according to spirit Rom 8:4 , which is our human spirit mingled with God s Holy Spirit cf.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Rom 8:16 , our mingled spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>To walk means to live, to act, to behave, to do things, to have our being.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>We have to have our being according to spirit and this is to buy the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Our thinking, our speaking, the expression of our attitude should be according to spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>If you are having your being according to spirit, this is to buy the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>But to walk, to have your being according to spirit needs us to pay a great price.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>You may need to stop your excessive talking on the telephone and stop your further reading of the newspaper from the first page to the next.</S>
