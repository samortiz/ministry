[1]  God s Desire Being That We Would Live with Him
[2]  THAT WE WOULD LIVE WITH HIM Scripture Reading: John 1:4, 12-14, 29; 14:16-20, 23; 15:4-5; 17:21, 23; 6:57
[3]  We thank the Lord for allowing us to gather once again in His name where we can worship Him and release our spirit.
[4]  I believe that in this series of messages the Lord will grace us and bring us on another step.
[5]  The Lord tells us clearly in John 15, For apart from Me you can do nothing v. 5b . However, I am afraid that many people believe that apart from the Lord they can do many things.
[6]  If a wife is apart from the Lord, she may even steal her husband s money, and if a husband is apart from the Lord, he may even lie to his wife.
[7]  The Lord said, Abide in Me and I in you v. 4 . He also said, Because I live, you also shall live 14:19b . In saying these words, the Lord seemed to say, I want you to live in Me, and I want to live with you.
[8]  My burden in fellowshipping with you concerning this matter is that today we would make the decision that our living will be the living of the Lord Jesus, that our living will be the Lord Jesus living in us.
[9]  We must understand, realize, and know absolutely that the Lord Jesus is within us as our life, Lord, person, God, patience, humility, love, strength, and everything.
[10]  May the Lord have mercy on us to wake us up out of our stupor that we would see clearly that we should not live or do, but that the Lord Jesus the great God who is inside of us, who has become our life, who has put us on, and who is joined with us should be the One who is living and doing.
[11]  What do we need to do in order to live this kind of life?
[12]  What do we need to do in order to live by and with the Lord and to abide together with Him?
[13]  In telling you these two things, I do not wish to give you methods; my intention is simply to tell you the way to live this kind of life.
[14]  In light of this we should consecrate ourselves to Him, stopping all of our own living and moving, and open up to Him by calling on His name, eating His word, and contacting Him, so that He can supply us and cause us to walk in newness of life.
[15]  CHAPTER TWO PRACTICING LIVING WITH THE LORD Scripture Reading: John 21:22; Gal 2:20a, 4:19; 2 Tim 4:22a; 1 Cor 6:17; Gal 5:16, 25; Rom 8:4 THE WONDERFUL LORD
[16]  It is wonderful because it is a record of the wonderful Lord Jesus.
[17]  As those who believe in Him, love Him, fellowship with Him, and draw near to Him daily, we can testify that the more we experience Him, the more we sense that He is rich and wonderful.
[18]  In the two thousand years of the history of the church, countless people have believed into Him, worshipped Him, and followed Him, yet no one can fully describe who He is or thoroughly experience Him.
[19]  Today the more we experience the Lord, the more we discover that the one item that is most precious and lovable about Him is that, as the Lord of all creation and the omnipotent God, He has passed through creation, redemption, death, and resurrection to become the life-giving Spirit 1 Cor 15:45b .
[20]  The Lord s desire today is that we would receive Him as our life, and live, move, and walk by Him and with Him.
[21]  We all admit that the Lord Jesus is real, living, and concrete, that He is with us and is living in us, that He is our life and our everything, and that He wants us to live by Him and with Him.
[22]  Today, however, we are not only walking with the Lord but also living with the Lord.
[23]  God was outside of Enoch while Enoch walked with God, but today the Lord is within us, and we live with Him.
[24]  We need to have the real practice of living with the Lord, not only living with Him in the meetings, but also in our daily lives in our home, on the street, and at our office.
[25]  We should not abandon the Lord Jesus when we get busy and then eighteen hours later come to the realization that we have left Him and hurriedly pray, Lord, forgive me for not drawing near to You, and then three minutes later go back to our busy life of not living with the Lord.
[26]  While we are brushing our teeth, washing our face, and getting dressed, we can begin living with the Lord by contacting Him, praying, Lord, what will You do today?
[27]  Today our greatest lack is that we do not exercise to live with the Lord.
[28]  If you go to buy a suit, you should say, Lord, what should I do in this situation?
[29]  You should never again give a message that the Lord Jesus is not giving, and you should never again give a message with words that the Lord who is in you would not say.
[30]  Living with the Lord is according to the same principle as that of marriage life, which is not based upon coercion but upon love.
[31]  Our Beloved is the Lord Jesus whom we love, and we are His lovers.
[32]  Now I would ask you, Do you love the Lord?
[33]  I believe that like Peter many of the brothers and sisters would say to the Lord, Lord, You know that I love You.
[34]  How do you know that you have believed into the Lord Jesus and that God has accepted you?
[35]  We often hear the saints say, Once I believed into the Lord, I touched the Lord.
[36]  Once I believed into the Lord, I gained the Lord.
[37]  Perhaps you may not yet know how to love the Lord and, according to your inner feeling, you do not feel that you love Him.
[38]  We may think that only little children call upon the Lord, but even I, an elderly man who is over seventy years old, call out I love the Lord Jesus every day.
[39]  Since we all love Him, we should live with Him.
[40]  Moreover, not only will we sense that the Lord does not want to go, but we will also say, Lord, You do not want to go?
[41]  The breadth is the Lord Jesus, the length is the Lord Jesus, the height is the Lord Jesus, and the depth is the Lord Jesus.
[42]  Instead of thinking, we should forget our thoughts and exercise our spirit to call on the name of the Lord from deep within O Lord Jesus, I love You.
[43]  OF THE SPIRIT TO GROW, TO BE TRANSFORMED, AND TO BE CONFORMED Scripture Reading: Rom 12:1-2; Eph 4:22-24; 2 Cor 3:18; Rom 8:29; 11:17; Phil 1:19; John 6:57 GOD S SALVATION BEING
[44]  The most wonderful aspect of the Lord s salvation is that He works Himself into us.
[45]  We may not have sensed anything and may not have known that anything happened, but when we believed in Him, the Lord Jesus entered into us.
[46]  In addition, God s divine attributes, the human virtues, the elements of redemption, His all-terminating crucifixion, His all-inclusive death, His resurrection, His ascension, and righteousness, holiness, light, life, love, and victory are all in Him.
[47]  God s goal is not merely to supply us; God s goal is to transform us.
[48]  The Lord wants you to eat a little bit of Him every day and receive a little bit of Him into you every day.
[49]  This is the church that the Lord wants today.
[50]  The church that the Lord wants is a church in which the saints are standing on the ground of oneness and also eating Christ, enjoying Christ, absorbing His rich supply, and receiving His bountiful supply.
