   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE NECESSITY OF CHRIST BEING OUR LIFE</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The all-inclusive Christ is to be our life 3:4 .</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>If Christ does not become our life, then all He is and all He attained and obtained remain objective.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>He is He, and we are we.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>In that case He has nothing to do with us in a practical way, nor we with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Therefore, in our actual daily experience, Christ must be our life.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>However, we may have the doctrinal knowledge from the Bible that Christ is our life without living by Christ in a practical way day by day.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Instead of living by Christ, we live too much of the time by our natural life.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>We all should be willing to admit that we love our own life, our natural human life.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>We may claim to hate our life, but actually we love it very much.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Even as you testify of your hatred for your natural life, deep within, you still appreciate your life and consider it better than that of others.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>For example, deep within, a sister may feel that her life is better than her husband s life.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Of course, a brother will have similar feelings toward his wife.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>We all are alike in thinking highly of our natural life.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>REFINING THE NATURAL LIFE</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>In addition to appreciating our natural life, we all are in the habit of using it, that is, of living according to it.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Over the years we have become accustomed to living by our own life.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Moreover, we have even endeavored to refine the natural life.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Through the training we have received at home, our natural life has been somewhat refined.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>It has been refined further through education and religion.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>We must admit that the natural life has even been refined by our participation in the local church.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>A brother who has been in the church for several years truly is much more refined than he was before coming into the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Some of the most refined people in this country are to be found in the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>However, instead of carrying on such a refining work, the church should terminate and bury the natural life.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>But most of us have not been buried by the church; instead, we have been refined.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Before you came into the church life, you may have been like unpolished copper.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>But now that you have been refined by the church life, you are like shiny, polished copper.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Although polished copper may look like gold, it is not gold.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Likewise, although our natural life may be refined and polished, it is still not Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>In the churches, there is too much refined copper and too little gold.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>There is too much of the natural life and not that much of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Christian preachers often give people the wrong kind of advice.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>They may be like doctors who prescribe the wrong medicine.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>In the early years of my ministry, I would tell those who were about to get married that they needed to be balanced and subdued.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>I told them that the Lord would use their husband or wife and their children to subdue them.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>I regret having given out that kind of teaching, for it leads to the refinement of the natural life, not to living by Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>In my early ministry I could not clearly discern between gold and copper that had been refined and polished.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Now I see that no matter how much copper is refined and polished, it will not become gold.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>In the same principle, refining our natural life will not transform it into Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>What God desires is that we live Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>He has no intention merely to refine our human life.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>When we do not live Christ, we live according to our own philosophy.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>When I told the saints that in their married life they needed to be balanced and subdued, I was ministering philosophy to them, not the riches of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>My philosophy at that time was a mixture of the Bible and certain ethical teachings according to which I had been raised.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Thus, what I shared with the saints concerning married life was culture; it was not Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>In certain respects my philosophy was quite good.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>I could defend it by appealing to those verses in the New Testament which charge wives to submit to their husbands, and husbands to love their wives.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>It seemed to me that in some ways my philosophy was better than that of Confucius.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Confucius never taught that a wife needs to be balanced by her husband and that a husband needs to be subdued by bearing the burden of his wife and children.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>If we consider the matter of married life apart from Christ, we may agree with this philosophy.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Nevertheless, even if this philosophy is right, it is not Christ, and it serves only to refine the natural life.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>MINISTERING CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Even we in the church life have been short of the heavenly vision concerning God s desire that we live Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Because the vision has not been clear, we have spent a good deal of time refining our human life instead of living Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Therefore, I am burdened to point out that the local church should not be a place where the work of refinement is carried out.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Rather, the church should be a place where Christ is ministered.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>When the young people come to me for fellowship about marriage, I now tell them that they need to experience Christ as their grace.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>I no longer tell them that they need to be balanced and subdued according to God s sovereign arrangement in their married life.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>I wish to tell all the saints that our unique need is Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Christ lives in us, and we are one spirit with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Oh, our need today is for the indwelling Christ!</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>If we would enjoy Christ and experience Him by being one spirit with Him, we should turn from all the standards, rules, regulations, and principles we have made for ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>To tell others that they need to be balanced and subdued is to fellowship with them according to a standard.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Today I do not minister standards I simply minister Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>I would encourage all the saints to no longer set up standards and regulations, but continually contact Christ as the life-giving Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>If you are a slow person, do not try to be quick; if you are quick, do not try to slow down.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Instead of trying to balance yourself, just live Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Let Christ be your standard, regulation, principle, and goal.</S>
