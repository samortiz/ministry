   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE LORD'S PURPOSE AND HIS COMMAND</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The Lord said, "You did not choose Me, but I chose you."</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>This choosing transpired in eternity past.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Before the foundation of the world, the Lord chose us in Himself Eph 1:4 .</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Then in time we were born, and eventually we heard the gospel and believed.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>By this we know that we have been called, yet we must realize that we have also been appointed.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>In Greek the word "appointed" really means "set."</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The Lord set us in a certain position and in a particular environment.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The Lord said, "I appointed you that you should go forth and bear fruit."</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The Greek for "should" in this verse has two moods.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>One is the mood of purpose; the other is the mood of command.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The word "that" denotes purpose, and the word "should" denotes command.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>We see the Lord's purpose, and we also have a command from the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>We should go forth, and we should bear fruit.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>These are commandments.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The Lord set us in a certain position because He has a purpose that we should go forth and bear fruit.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Yet this is not only the Lord's purpose; it is His command we should go forth and should bear fruit.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Furthermore, the Lord continues, "and that your fruit should remain."</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>How could our fruit remain?</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>It depends upon us.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>We have to do a lot to carry out the Lord's commands.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>We should go forth, we should bear fruit, and our fruit should remain.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Otherwise, the Lord's purpose cannot be accomplished, and His goal cannot be reached.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>To bear remaining fruit is not easy, yet it is the Lord's command.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>If you do not go forth, you are disobeying the Lord's command.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>When the Lord comes, you will have to face Him and give Him an account.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The Lord may ask, "How much fruit have you borne?"</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>You may say, "Lord Jesus, it was too hard.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>I never went forth."</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>In John 15, following abiding, that is, following the enjoyment of Christ, there is the matter of fruit-bearing.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The Lord may say, "In John 15, I charged you that you should go forth and bear fruit, and that your fruit should remain."</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>If you do not go today, one day you will be judged by the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Even if you do go forth, yet you would not endeavor to bear fruit, the Lord will condemn you.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>To go forth is one thing; to bear fruit is another.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>To get married is one thing; to deliver a child is another.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>To get married is not hard; it is an enjoyment.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>But to deliver a child is a kind of suffering, travailing.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The mother must suffer not only on the day of its delivery; she has to suffer for nine months.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>After the child is born, she must spend all her time and energy so that it will grow and be healthy.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Not only should her child "remain," but it must remain in a proper way.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The Lord Jesus spoke in a detailed way concerning bearing fruit because this is not a simple thing to do.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>OUR PRAYER FOR REMAINING FRUIT</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Now we must consider the remaining portion of verse 16: "That whatever you ask the Father in My name, He may give you."</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Again the Lord uses the word "that."</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The Lord appointed us that we should go forth and bear fruit, that our fruit should remain, and that whatever we ask in His name, the Father may give us.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The last point in this verse is to pray not merely in a general way but to "ask in My name."</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The Lord does not intend for us to ask for material things.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The Lord's intention is for us to pray purposely for remaining fruit.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Even if we would go forth and bear fruit, and even if we were able to labor much to keep the fruit, our fruit still might not remain.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>After doing so much, one thing remains we have to ask.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>We may be able to preach, baptize, and bring people to the church meetings, but we cannot give life.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Paul said, "I planted, Apollos watered, but God made to grow" 1 Cor 3:6 .</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>We must admit our dependence upon the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>We can and should do a lot, but whatever we do will not produce the result.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>The result comes from the Lord's direct work.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>However, His direct work depends upon our work.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>We have to go forth, we have to bear fruit, and we have to work that the fruit will remain.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>However, whatever we do without His additional doing means nothing.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>The final thing that is needed is our asking.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>We have to pray in a particular way.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>To ask in His name is to ask for remaining fruit.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>We must pray: "Lord, I went forth.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>I worked hard.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>I preached the gospel to this one.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>I baptized him and visited him regularly for more than one year.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>I even brought him into the church meetings, but thus far, there is nothing promising that I can see within him.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Lord, what is needed is Your work.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>I can do a lot, but I cannot give life.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>I may bring a hundred into the church life, but without Your additional work, the giving of life, my labor is vain."</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>This does not mean our labor is not needed.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Without Paul's planting and Apollos' watering, the Lord could not have given life.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>We must lay the base with our labor.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Then the Lord can give life.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>We need to ask the Lord for remaining fruit.</S>
