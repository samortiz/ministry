The Husband</H2><P>In 2 Corinthians 11:2 Paul said, "For I am jealous over you with a jealousy of God; for I betrothed you to one husband to present you as a pure virgin to Christ." Christ is the unique Husband to us, the believers, and we have been betrothed as a virgin to Him. Therefore, we should belong only to Him, and we should present ourselves to Him to love Him, to appreciate Him, and to enjoy Him as our life and everything. We should not allow anything to replace His position in our hearts. When our entire being is focused on Him, is attracted by Him, and is single and pure toward Him, we will be preserved and be sanctified unto Him and will enjoy Him as our unique portion.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>46. The Bridegroom</H2><P>Christ, our portion, is not only our Husband but also our Bridegroom. In the Gospel of John, John the Baptist introduced the Lord Jesus as the Lamb of God (1:29), who takes away the sin of the world, and as the Bridegroom, who has the bride (3:29) and who is the most pleasant One. Through regeneration we, the believers in Christ, not only receive the life of God and have the satanic nature in our flesh annulled, but also have become a corporate bride as Christ's counterpart for Christ's increase. As the unique, genuine Bridegroom in the universe, Christ is our attraction, delight, and satisfaction.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>SUMMARY</H2><P>Christ to us is the treasure with the excellent power. He as the embodiment of God enters into us, the earthen vessels, to be our life and everything, and from these earthen vessels He will manifest the divine power of excellency. He is also the depths of God, foreordained, prepared, and given to us freely by God as our eternal portion. He is also our model who, with all the riches of His life, is reproducing Himself in us that we may become His reproduction for His expression. He is also the Author and Perfecter of faith to transfuse us with the faith that He has originated and perfected until He finishes the faith that we need for the running of the heavenly race. He is also the Author of salvation, who was made perfect through sufferings and who took the lead to enter into glory. Now we, as His followers, are taking the same way and will be brought by Him into the same glory ordained by God for us. He is also the Forerunner, who took the lead to pass through the stormy sea and enter the heavenly haven, the Holy of Holies within the veil. Now we need to follow Him in our spirit and go on to enter the Holy of Holies that we may reach God's New Testament goal. He is also the Apostle, who came to us with God to share God with us that we may partake of His divine life, nature, and fullness. He is also the High Priest, who went back from us and with us to God to bear us in the presence of God and to care for all our needs. He is great, merciful, and faithful, and He is always living to intercede for us to save us to the uttermost. He is also our unique Husband; we should belong only to Him, love Him, appreciate Him, and enjoy Him as our life and everything. He is also the Bridegroom, and we, the believers in Christ, are the corporate bride. Hence, He is our attraction, delight, and satisfaction.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>QUESTIONS</H2><ol class="decimal"><li>Explain the issue of our experience of Christ as the treasure with the excellent power.</li><li>Briefly state the significance of Christ as our model.</li><li>How does Christ serve as the Author and Perfecter of our faith?</li><li>How does Christ serve as the Author of our salvation and the Forerunner?</li><li>Briefly state the relationship of Christ to us as the Apostle and the High Priest.</li></ol><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_044.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_046.html">Next</a> </body></html>
