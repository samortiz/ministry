In this prophecy the Lord indicated that He would rebuild God&#8217;s house in resurrection. This rebuilding of the house of God in resurrection was to be an enlargement of God&#8217;s house. This is proved by the fact that not only was Christ Himself resurrected, but the entire new creation was resurrected with Him.<p>This resurrection was both a rebuilding and a birth. With respect to the house of God, it was a rebuilding in resurrection. With respect to the new man, it was a birth in resurrection. By this we see that, in one sense, the resurrection of Christ was a birth and, in another sense, it was a rebuilding.<p>In John 14:2 the Lord Jesus said, &#8220;In My Father&#8217;s house are many abodes; if it were not so, I would have told you; for I go to prepare a place for you.&#8221; This word is a fulfillment of the prophecy given by the Lord in 2:19. In chapter two the Lord prophesied that He would build the house of God in resurrection and that He would build it in an enlarged way. If we did not have chapter fourteen, we would not see where the prophecy given in chapter two is fulfilled. If we say John 14:2 refers to a heavenly mansion, then the Lord&#8217;s prophecy in 2:19 has no fulfillment. But in 14:2 is the fulfillment of 2:19. The concept of a heavenly mansion is far off the line of the divine thought in John&#8217;s Gospel.<h2 class=head1>DIVINE THINGS</h2><p>John&#8217;s writings are concerned altogether with divine things. Basically, in his Gospel John does not write of physical things. With divine things there is no physical element. Likewise, with divine things there is no element of space or time. The words what, when, and where are related to physical matters. The word &#8220;what&#8221; refers to the physical element; &#8220;when,&#8221; to the time element; and &#8220;where,&#8221; to the space element. But with divine things, especially with the divine life, there is no where, when, or what. These three matters do not have any position in the divine life.<p>As an example of what we mean in saying that there is no what, where, or when with divine things, let us consider the crucifixion of the Lord Jesus. When was the Lord crucified? Concerning this question, we should pay attention to the fact that Revelation 13:8 speaks of the &#8220;Lamb slain from the foundation of the world.&#8221; When was Christ actually crucified-nineteen centuries ago, or from the foundation of the world? The proper way to answer this question is to say that from the human viewpoint He was crucified nineteen hundred years ago, but from the divine viewpoint He was slain much earlier, even from the foundation of the world. To say that Christ is the Lamb slain from the foundation of the world means that from the time creation came into existence Christ was slain.<p>The reason Revelation 13:8 can speak of Christ as the One slain from the foundation of the world is that there is no time element with God. In His foreknowledge God saw that His creation would become fallen. From His point of view, the Lamb of God was slain from the foundation of the world.<br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_175.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_177.html">Next</a> </body></html>
