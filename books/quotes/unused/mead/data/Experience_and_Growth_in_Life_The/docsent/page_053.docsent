   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Question: Having seen something of Christ and His all-inclusive death and resurrection, why does it seem so difficult to experience these things?</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Answer: The reason for this is that our vision is often very vague.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>We see something, but not so clearly.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>We must realize that genuine believing is based upon what we see.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>When we preach the gospel, we must hold the realization that we are presenting something of reality to people.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Our speaking is the presentation of reality.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>When our listeners hear our presentation, they see something and believe.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>What they see becomes their faith, their believing.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The problem is that often our speaking is weak and the hearing is also weak; therefore, the believing and seeing become very weak.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The strength of what we see and believe depends upon the strength of our hearing.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Whether our hearing is strong or not depends upon the strength of the speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Question: Does the vision of Christ and His death and resurrection come suddenly as a one-time experience or does it come gradually over some period of time?</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Answer: Often it is difficult to determine whether what we see today is a sudden revelation or something which has come gradually through our experience.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>As we are walking down a certain street, we are able to see the things on that street because we are in the position to see them.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>One day we see one thing, and another day we see something more.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>In the same principle, as we attend the meetings of the church, we may not see very much at first.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>But as we continue to attend the meetings and hear the speaking, gradually we begin to see something month after month and year after year.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>We do not often have the experience of seeing something in a sudden way.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Actually, according to my experience, the sudden or instant vision is not very valuable.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The most valuable vision is something which has been built up within you.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>If from the day you are saved, you build up a habit of always being in the meetings, big or small, year-round, this will constitute something of a vision within you, which will become something very stable within you.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Through the meetings something is sown into you.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The accumulation of what has been sown into you is your seeing, your vision.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>To gain such a vision requires time.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>We should not expect to see the vision of Christ, His death, and His resurrection in a sudden way.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Gradually, as we go on in our experience with the Lord, we see more.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The disciples, especially Peter, are a good illustration of this.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Many teachers and students of the Bible throughout church history have tried to determine when Peter was saved.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>On several occasions Peter had some very significant experiences with the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The first experience was when he was brought to the Lord by his brother, Andrew John 1:40-42 .</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>On this occasion, the Lord changed his name from Simon to Peter, a stone.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>This experience, however, did not change Peter very much, because shortly thereafter he went back to fishing.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Then the Lord went to the sea of Galilee and called Peter as he was casting a net into the sea Matt 4:18-19 .</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The Lord attracted him, perhaps by the miracle recorded in Luke 5:4-11.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>At one moment he was casting a net for fish, and the next moment, having been called by the Lord Jesus, he began to follow the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>After perhaps three years of following the Lord, Peter and the other disciples were led by the Lord to Caesarea Philippi Matt 16:13 .</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The Lord asked them, "Who do you say that I am?" v. 15 . Peter responded, "You are the Christ, the Son of the living God" v. 16 . This was another significant experience.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>After these experiences, Peter denied the Lord three times, even before the Lord's face Luke 22:54-61 .</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>And on the day of Christ's resurrection, the angel specifically mentioned that Peter should be told about the Lord's resurrection Mark 16:7 .</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Then on the evening of the day of resurrection, the Lord came back to breathe Himself into the disciples John 20:22 .</S>
