   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER FIVE BEARING FRUIT AND</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>CARING FOR THE NEW BELIEVERS</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>To go on in the Lord s new way, the God-ordained way to meet and to serve, requires much study.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>We have had much speaking and teaching concerning the new way, and we have discovered many crucial points related to it.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>This speaking has been printed in messages and is available to read.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Although we have been going on steadily in the new way, our going on has been too slow.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>We now need to rise up to practice the new way.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>CONTACTING PEOPLE</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>FOR THE PREACHING OF THE GOSPEL</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The first step in the Lord s new way is to contact people to bring them the gospel of the kingdom, which is the gospel of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>In order to contact people for the gospel, we should not merely stay home to pray for them and invite them to come to us.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>We have learned that this is not adequate.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>One effective and time-saving way to contact others for the gospel is to use the telephone.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>This way has been used very much by the marketing industry.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Some saints have begun to call people to make appointments to share the gospel with them.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>This is an improved way to contact others.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Some people may not be willing to make an appointment, but due to the telephone calls, they may come to the Lord s Day morning meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>One church has begun to keep a guest book to record many details concerning each new one who comes to the meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Once a new one comes to the meeting, the saints will write them a letter or visit them.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>We should not trust that the new ones will contact us.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Rather, we must exercise to contact them by many means.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>There are many ways to visit people, and we still need more learning in this matter.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>If we are going to gain people, we must contact them.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>If a business receives only three replies for every one hundred brochures they mail out, they will recover their expenses.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Likewise, for us to gain even one person out of five hundred contacts would be profitable and worthwhile.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>We do not expect a large increase.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>We only expect that each member in the Lord s recovery will gain one person yearly.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Through this onefold increase we will double our number every year.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>However, according to our study of church history, it is hard to find a church that has had even a thirty percent annual increase.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>BEARING FRUIT</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>It is not good to be barren and unfruitful.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The biggest commission from the Lord to His disciples is to go and disciple all the nations Matt 28:19 , and the greatest charge to the New Testament believers is to bear fruit John 15:4-8 , to get people saved.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>It is not right to be a Christian for many years, and yet be without fruit.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>We should not take any excuse for not bearing fruit.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>It is a joy to have some dear ones under our care who are younger or weaker than we are.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The people in the world seek amusements to make them joyful.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Our joy is Christ, but we cannot enjoy Christ well without fruit bearing.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Without fruit bearing our enjoyment of Christ is in vain.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>To have children physically is a joy, but in the eyes of God spiritual children are much more precious than physical children.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>If we have two or three spiritual children under our care, they will be our comfort, strengthening, encouragement, and daily joy year-round, and we will feel that we know the meaning of our Christian life better.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>On the other hand, if we do not have anyone under our spiritual care, we may wonder what the purpose of being a Christian is, and the enjoyment of Christ will eventually lose its taste.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>We all have to pray, saying, Lord, I hate barrenness, and I love to bear fruit.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>If I cannot have two or three of Your children to be my children, I will not be happy.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Year after year I always want two or three younger Christians under my care.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>We must endeavor to reach the goal of fruit bearing.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Then our Christian life will be meaningful, and our enjoyment of Christ will always be fresh.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Whether or not the enjoyment of Christ is fresh to us depends on fruit bearing as the result, the issue, of our enjoyment of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>To abide in Christ is the main charge in John 15 v. 4a , but this charge is for another charge to bear fruit vv.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>4b-8 .</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Abiding is for fruit bearing.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>It is impossible for a branch to abide in the vine and enjoy all the riches and life juice from the root of the vine without bearing fruit.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>The thought that we can abide in Christ without bearing fruit is a self-deceit from the source of Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>We must condemn this thought.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>We cannot promote the enjoyment of Christ without fruit bearing.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>We should not be satisfied with the enjoyment of Christ in vain.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>The enjoyment of Christ must have an issue.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>This issue is not merely the growth of the branch but fruit bearing.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>We must have fruit bearing, and we must have children to care for.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>In John 15:16 the Lord said, I appointed you that you should go forth and bear fruit, and that your fruit should remain.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>To go forth is to contact people, and to have our fruit remain is by taking care of the young ones.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Without our caring for the young ones, our fruit cannot remain.</S>
