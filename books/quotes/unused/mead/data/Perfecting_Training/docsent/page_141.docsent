   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE ULTIMATE EXPRESSION OF THE TRIUNE GOD</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>When Paul says the Spirit of the One Who raised Jesus, he indicates that the One who raised and the Jesus who was raised both are one with the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The Spirit who resides in you doesn t reside in you just by Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>He resides in you with the One who raised and with the One who was raised.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>When you have the residing One you also have the Father and the Son.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>When you have the residing One you have the ultimate expression of the Triune God who has been processed through incarnation, human living, crucifixion, resurrection, and ascension.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Today such a One is the Spirit who resides in you.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>A FULL REALIZATION OF THE TRIUNE GOD</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Many believers still consider that the Holy Father is in the heavens, and the Son is there with Him, and His Holy Spirit is now working in us.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>If you still hold this kind of concept, whether intentionally or unintentionally, you have no way to get into the real experience mentioned in Romans 8.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>You could never get to chapter twelve.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>You could never get into the realization of the Body life because you still are not matured in the sonship.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>You need a full realization of the Triune God within you.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Such a full realization of the Triune God will mature you in the sonship.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Paul s repetition in verse 11 is to impress us that while the Spirit is residing in us, the Triune God is within us.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The One who did the raising up is in you, and the One who was raised up is also in you.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Both of them are now the residing Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The residing Spirit is comprised of the raising One and the One raised up.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>This realization makes a big difference.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>This realization would make it easy for you to put the practices of your body to death.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>You would have a kind of habitual living all the time putting the practices of your body to death.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Then while the putting to death of the practices of the body is going on within you, the life giving would be there.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The life would flow and even flood in.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The Spirit today is the life-giving Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>But you would have to admit that you don t have much experience of the life giving.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>You may have a doctrine concerning the life-giving Spirit, but you don t have much of the actuality of the life giving itself.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Why?</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Because you are short of the putting to death.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>And you are short of the putting to death because you don t realize that the Spirit residing in you today is a composition of the raising One and of the One raised up.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>He is now the raising One, and He is now also the One raised up.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>He is both.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Both are included in Him, and now He is residing in you.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>If you realize this, there would be a spontaneous putting to death all the time.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>So first of all, these verses stress the residing Spirit of the Trinity.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Secondly, these few verses stress the matter of the life giving.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>This One gives life not only to your spirit, not only to your mind, but also even to your body.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The third thing that these verses stress is the matter of your putting to death.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>There are three parties with three things: there is the residing of the Spirit, there is the giving life by the One who raised Jesus from among the dead, and there is the putting to death by you.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>You have to put these three things together.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>When you put these three things together, you have the leading of the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>This leading will mature you into the sonship.</S>
