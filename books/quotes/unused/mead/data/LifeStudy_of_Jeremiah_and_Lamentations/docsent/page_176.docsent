   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE CONTENT OF THE NEW COVENANT</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>THE PROCESSED AND CONSUMMATED TRIUNE GOD</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The content of the new covenant is the Triune God, who has been processed and consummated to become everything to God's chosen people.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>This new covenant was promised to Israel in Jeremiah 31:31-34 cf.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Heb 8:8-13 , and it was absolutely, thoroughly, and completely fulfilled by the Lord Jesus when He established His table Matt 26:26-29; Mark 14:22-25; Luke 22:19-20; 1 Cor 11:23-26 .</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In instituting the table, the Lord Jesus made a covenant with the New Testament believers.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>THE IMPORTANCE</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>OF THE BOOK OF JEREMIAH</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The most important part of the book of Jeremiah is the portion on the new covenant.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Since Jeremiah spoke regarding the new covenant, this book, in a sense, is more important than the writings of Moses, which do not say anything about the new covenant.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Although Moses prophesied very much concerning Christ, the covenant God made with Israel through him had nothing to do with Jesus Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Based on the fact that the book of Jeremiah prophesies concerning the new covenant, the book of Jeremiah may be considered an Old Testament book that is also a New Testament book.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>THE POSITION AND FUNCTION</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>OF THE OLD COVENANT OF THE LAW</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>At this point, we need to say a word regarding the position and function of the old covenant of the law.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Its Position</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The position of the covenant of the law was that of a concubine.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>In Galatians 4 Paul tells us that Abraham had two wives, representing two covenants.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Sarah, the proper wife, represents the new covenant, and Hagar, the concubine, represents the old covenant of law.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Because Hagar, the concubine, symbolizes the old covenant of the law, the position of this covenant is the position of a concubine.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>As Abraham cast out Hagar, when Christ came He put aside the old covenant and made it of no effect, replacing it with the new covenant.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Furthermore, in Romans 5:20 Paul tells us that "the law entered in alongside."</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>This means that the law was added later, that it was not God's original intention to have the law.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Rather, the law later came in alongside of something that was present before the law came.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>This indicates that the main line of God's economy was there already.</S>
