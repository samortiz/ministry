Grant us Your rich blessing. We need Your presence. Your Spirit is just Your presence. Lord, open Yourself to us. We open ourselves to You and to one another. Grant us an open fellowship, a fellowship that is so free, so refreshing, in the spirit, a fellowship that overcomes all kinds of frustrations. Lord, thank You that we are here with You, believing that You are here with us. We are not only one with You, but today we are just You. We are parts of You. Lord, bless Your Body. Amen.</P><P>Since the autumn of 1987 there has been a turmoil in the Lord's recovery. In this turmoil a number of crucial terms among us have been devastated. The most devastated term is the ministry. Those who are carrying on the present turmoil have misunderstood, wrongly applied, and evilly interpreted this term. Two other crucial terms among us that have also been damaged are the teaching of the apostles and the fellowship of the apostles. In this message we will consider the matter of the ministry of the New Testament. In the subsequent message we will consider the teaching of the apostles and the fellowship of the apostles.</P><P>From the beginning of the Lord's recovery with Brother Nee there have been turmoils in the recovery caused by the evil one, Satan. In order to face the turmoils at his time, Brother Nee gave a number of messages that dealt with particular terms that were being misunderstood and misapplied by the dissenting ones. During that time Brother Nee spoke very much concerning the matter of the ministry. A number of books on the ministry were published by Brother Nee, and a number have also been published by us in the United States in the past thirty years (see The Normal Christian Church Life, by Watchman Nee, and Elders' Training, Book 1&#151;The Ministry of the New Testament, by Witness Lee, published by Living Stream Ministry). The speaking of the ministry in the Lord's recovery has covered this matter in full. Those who are devastating these terms among us have a purpose. What they are doing is neither fair nor reasonable nor considerate. In order to carry out their particular purpose, they have done their best to devastate the term the ministry.</P><P>In order to consider this matter, we need to come back to the Word. The Word is our "constitution." To come to the Word is to come to the heavenly court. We do have a constitutional book&#151;the Bible&#151;in our hand with a number of good verses concerning the matter of the ministry. We need to be familiar with these verses and pray-read these verses. Whenever people who know the law touch the constitution, none would do it carelessly. No one would do it without thorough, adequate consideration. Likewise, we need to come to the Word concerning the matter of the ministry and touch this matter carefully and with a thorough consideration.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>TWO COVENANTS AND TWO MINISTRIES</H2><P>No other portion in the Bible shows us the matter of the ministry more clearly than 2 Corinthians 3 and 4. First, in these chapters Paul touches the matter of the ministry based upon God's covenants, the new covenant and the old covenant. Without God's covenant, there is no possibility to have any ministry. A ministry is to carry out what God has covenanted with His people. Without God's covenant, we do not have any work to do. Without God's covenant, whatever we may do cannot be considered a ministry. The ministry is just the service that we render to God to carry out God's covenant. Whatever we may do to carry out our own preference or desires is not a ministry of God but is merely a human work.</P><P>In the whole universe only two covenants are crucial. In the New Testament time God covenanted only once with His people. This covenant is the new covenant, which the Lord Jesus enacted at His table. At the time when the Lord Jesus established His table, He enacted the new covenant with the blood that He would shed for us (Matt. 26:28; Mark 14:24; Luke 22:20). In the Old Testament time God covenanted with His people a number of times (see Truth Lessons, Level Two, Volume 1, published by Living Stream Ministry), but the main covenant was the law. In the New Testament the covenant of the law is called "the old covenant" (2 Cor. 3:14). In Jeremiah 31:31-34 God told His people that the old covenant of the law did not work well and did not serve His purpose, so He would make a new covenant, not with the Israel of the Old Testament but with His New Testament people, the believers in Christ, and with the remnant of Israel at the end of the New Testament age. This is not a covenant of law but a covenant of grace. Based on the old covenant of the law, there was an old covenant ministry, and based on the new covenant of the New Testament, there is the ministry of the new covenant (2 Cor. 3:6).</P><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_001.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_003.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>The Ministry of the New Testament and the Teaching and Fellowship of the Apostles &nbsp; pg 2</div><br></body></html>
