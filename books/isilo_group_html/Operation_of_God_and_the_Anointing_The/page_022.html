in Our Environment</h2>
<p><em>Question: Because some circumstances are from Satan and others are natural, I am afraid that I would confuse his attack with the discipline of the Holy Spirit and that my suffering will be in vain. What can prevent me from receiving my circumstances foolishly?</em></p>
<p>Answer: This kind of analysis is unnecessary. When we ate breakfast this morning, we did not consider whether the food came naturally or was sent by Satan, or whether it was prepared by God or by the self. Do we consider how we came here? Were we sent naturally, or were we sent by the devil? Does God want us to be here, or were we brought by the self? Why were we born as Chinese and not as Americans? The more spiritual a person is, the less he will consider such things, because these things are not in our hands. Some people have attempted to commit suicide five times, and they are still alive. There are others who took every precaution against tuberculosis but still contracted it. We need to see that we are in the Lord&rsquo;s hand, not in our own. Everything that comes upon us has an element of the discipline of the Holy Spirit, and we should accept it. Without our heavenly Father&rsquo;s permission, nothing will come upon us; it does not matter whether it is a natural law, our own doing, Satan&rsquo;s attack, or the discipline of the Holy Spirit.</p>
<p>It is rare for a suffering situation not to be from Satan. Job&rsquo;s afflictions came from Satan. All the suffering situations are caused by Satan. We might say, &ldquo;I do not accept anything from Satan; I only want things from God,&rdquo; but we should realize that Satan&rsquo;s attacks are permitted by God. One day God had a council in heaven to discuss how to deal with Job, and Satan came too (Job 1:6-7). God said to Satan, &ldquo;Have you considered My servant Job? For there is none like him on the earth, a perfect and upright man, who fears God and turns away from evil&rdquo; (v. 8). Satan answered, &ldquo;Does Job fear God without cause? Have You not set a hedge around him and his household and all that he has?...Stretch forth Your hand and touch all that he has, and he will surely curse You to Your face&rdquo; (vv. 9-11). God replied, &ldquo;Here is all that he has, in your hand; only do not stretch forth your hand against him&rdquo; (v. 12). God let Satan attack Job. This was the stripping that God wanted for Job.</p>
<p>We should not try to avoid our environment. Some people try to avoid the natural man and the self, but eventually they are the ones who suffer the most. Because we are in God&rsquo;s hand, we will suffer if we try to rely upon our own intelligence and wisdom. If we try to dodge different situations, we will end up in a place where we will really suffer. Hence, we must give up and admit that we are in the Father&rsquo;s hand and that there are no mistakes associated with the discipline of the Holy Spirit. We make mistakes, but He never does.</p>
<p>We must remember that the discipline of the Holy Spirit is not to correct our wrongdoings or to subdue us. The book of Job concerns discipline. Initially, Job could not submit, much less be broken, but in the end he abhorred himself and repented in dust and ashes (42:6). Without the attacks from Satan, Job would have been a good man but not a broken man. He was a perfect man as well as a whole person. God does not want us to be perfect and whole. Hence, He raises up situations in our environment to discipline us. The Holy Spirit did not want Job to submit. The discipline of the Holy Spirit had the unique goal of breaking him. The purpose of the breaking was for Job to know God. Hence, Job was able to say, &ldquo;I had heard of You by the hearing of the ear, / But now my eye has seen You&rdquo; (v. 5).</p>
<p>We do not need to analyze whether the discipline of the Holy Spirit has a natural source, is of our own doing, is sent by the devil, or is permitted by God. We may be able to avoid some difficult situations, but we cannot avoid every situation. There is no need to analyze the situations that we cannot avoid. We can fire a maid who does not listen to our instructions, but we cannot dismiss our precious wife when she is unbearable. This is the discipline of the Holy Spirit. If an employee does not listen to us, we can fire him according to the terms of his contract. However, if a brother with whom we labor causes us hardships, we cannot avoid him. We must coordinate with him and receive what the Holy Spirit has arranged. We can avoid only the difficulties that God allows us to avoid. We must believe that we are in His hand.</p>
<p>Let me repeat: The more spiritual a person is, the more he believes that he is in God&rsquo;s hand, and the less he fears adverse environments or circumstances. Those who try to run away from discipline are not spiritual and are not willing to receive discipline. We do not need to analyze the circumstances in our environment.</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_021.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_023.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>The Operation of God and the Anointing &nbsp; pg 22</div><br></body></html>
