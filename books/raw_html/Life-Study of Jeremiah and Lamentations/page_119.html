<H2 CLASS=HEAD2>B. From the Land of the North<br>and from the Uttermost Parts of the Earth</H2><P>Jehovah promised to bring them from the land of the north and to gather them from the uttermost parts of the earth (31:8a).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>C. A Great Assembly<br>Returning to the Land of Israel</H2><P>A great assembly will return to the land of Israel. This assembly will include the blind, the lame, the pregnant woman, and the travailing woman (v. 8b).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>D. They Coming with Weeping<br>and Jehovah Leading Them with Supplications</H2><P>They will come with weeping, and with supplications Jehovah will lead them. He will cause them to walk by the water brooks in a straight way, in which they will not stumble; for He is a Father to Israel, and Ephraim is His firstborn (v. 9).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>E. Jehovah Redeeming Israel<br>from the Hand of One Stronger than Them</H2><P>According to verses 11 through 14, Jehovah will redeem Israel from the hand of one stronger than them. They will come and sing in the height of Zion, and they will flow forth to the goodness of Jehovah&#151;to the grain, to the new wine, to the fresh oil, and to the young of the flock and of the herd. Their soul will be like a watered garden, and they will not languish any more. Then the virgin will rejoice in the dance, and the young men and the old men together, and Jehovah will turn their mourning to gladness, comfort them, and cause them to rejoice after their sorrow. He will fill the soul of the priest with abundance, and His people will be satisfied with His goodness.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>F. He Who Scattered Israel<br>Gathering Them and Keeping Them</H2><P>He who scattered Israel will gather them and keep them, as a shepherd his flock (v. 10).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>G. There Being Hope for Israel's Latter End</H2><P>There will be hope for Israel's latter end, that their children will return to their own border (v. 17).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>H. Jehovah Creating a New Thing in the Earth</H2><P>"Set up road markers for yourself; / Make signposts for yourself; / Pay attention to the highway, / The way you went; / Return, O virgin of Israel; / Return to these cities of yours. / How long will you wander here and there, / O apostate daughter? / For Jehovah has created a new thing in the earth: / A female will encompass a mighty man" (vv. 21-22). When the children of Israel are brought back, something new will happen. A female, a weaker one, will encompass, will help, a mighty man.</P>
