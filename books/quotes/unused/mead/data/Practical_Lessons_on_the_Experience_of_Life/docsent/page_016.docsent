   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Calling on the Highest Authority for a Person</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>A second issue of a person's consecration is that he may have offered himself in a shallow way.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>After his consecration, he neglected it.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The best way to help him is to pray, not in a general way but by calling on the Lord as the highest authority to deal with this person.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>We may pray, "Lord, this is a brother who prayed in Your name.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>You have to honor Your name, raise up Your name, and claim this person."</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Many times this kind of prayer is prevailing.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>We should not pray this way in our self, because many times the Lord will do something such as bring a certain kind of hardship to that person.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>He will answer this call to the highest authority and come in to intervene and deal with the person for whom we pray.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Then something may happen to him, and he will come to us for help.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>It is not like this every time, but this is a principle.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Being Defeated by the Lord and Following the Inner Anointing</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The third issue of a person's consecration is that it is real and normal without any doubt.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>This is wonderful, but we still must know how to help such persons, not legally but according to the principles of the spiritual life.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>We should tell them that consecration is not a once-for-all matter.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>It is not only a crisis to pass through but a way to go on.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Day by day we must keep our consecration real, living, and available.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>This means that day by day we need to consecrate ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Then after we consecrate ourselves to the Lord, there will always be some struggle between us and the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Whenever this happens, we must be defeated by the Lord; we must never defeat Him.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Always let Him win the victory, and be willing to be defeated.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>We should pray, "Lord, I want to be defeated by You.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>I do not want to defeat You."</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>We should also help such a person to realize that his inner consciousness, the anointing of the indwelling Holy Spirit, will now be very living and keen.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>All day long he must walk, live, and do things in the way of caring for this inner consciousness.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>As long as we care for the inner consciousness, we will keep a living fellowship with the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Strictly speaking, therefore, the next experience after consecration is the sense of the inner anointing.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>It is a great thing to help the brothers and sisters pass through a crisis of consecration and enter into the stage of the inner sense of the anointing.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>OUR NEED FOR TRAINING WITH DEFINITE TEACHING CONCERNING THE EXPERIENCES OF LIFE</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Too often we help the brothers in the church only in a general way.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>This is why I tell the co-workers that the proper way to learn something is in courses.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The proper way to learn mathematics, for example, is by completing one course and moving on to another.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>If we do not learn by courses, we can study for our whole life and never learn much.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>In the church we may have message after message every week, but some brothers have been listening to messages for fifty years without learning much because the teaching is too general.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The writings of the apostles, especially of the apostle Paul, are not general; they are very definite.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Today in the church we need definite teachings.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>This is why we need trainings.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>It is right to take a certain period of time in a local church to deal with the stages of spiritual experience.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>We may need six months to deal with the real experience of regeneration, helping people to be clear what regeneration is and how they can know its experience.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>We need another period of time to deal with consecration.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>We need period after period in this way for a number of years.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Then we will see a local church built up with a group of believers who have the real experiences.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>They know what regeneration is, they have experienced it, and they know how to help people with it.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Likewise, they know what consecration is, they have this experience, they live in it, and they know how to help new converts to go on.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The believers will have not merely a certain desire or love but the experience of life, the genuine learning, the discipline, and the practice.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Such a church is a proper church.</S>
