<h1 class="series">LIFE-STUDY OF FIRST PETER</h1><h1 class="msg">MESSAGE EIGHTEEN</h1><h1 class="title">GROWTH IN LIFE AND ITS RESULTS</h1><h1 class="title">(4)</h1><h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: 1 Pet. 2:5, 9-10</h1><h2 class="head1">GROWING UNTO SALVATION FOR THE BUILDING</h2><p>In this message we shall consider 2:5, 9 and 10. Verse 5 says, &ldquo;You yourselves also, as living stones, are being built up a spiritual house, into a holy priesthood, to offer up spiritual sacrifices acceptable to God through Jesus Christ.&rdquo; In reading this verse we need to take care of grammar. Verse 4 is a modifier of the subject of the sentence in verse 5. The main part of the sentence in verse 5 is this: &ldquo;You...are being built up a spiritual house.&rdquo; Hence, the main thought here is that of the building. This thought continues the thought in verse 2 of growing unto salvation. This means that following salvation we have the building. Growing unto salvation is for the building. This indicates that here salvation involves not only transformation, but also includes being built up. As a totality, salvation in 1 Peter 2 indicates transformation for building up.</p><p>Salvation at the end of verse 2 is related to transformation for the building. Notice that at the end of verse 2 there is a comma, not a period. In verse 3 we have a condition related to drinking the milk of the word: &ldquo;If you have tasted that the Lord is good.&rdquo; Verse 3 concludes with a semicolon, and verse 4 ends with a comma. Therefore, the punctuation indicates that the main clause in the second part of the sentence is in verse 5. Actually, verse 5 is the direct continuation of verse 2. Verse 2 ends with the thought of growing unto salvation, which implies that salvation includes transformation. Then verse 5 continues by indicating that this transformation is for the building. For this reason we say that salvation in verse 2 is a matter of transformation for building.</p><p>I believe that we have touched the thought in Peter&rsquo;s mind and heart as he was writing. In these verses Peter seems to be saying, &ldquo;You believers have all been regenerated, and now you are as newborn babes. As newborn babes, you should hunger and thirst for the milk in the word so that you may grow unto salvation. This salvation is transformation for building up.&rdquo; These must have been Peter&rsquo;s thoughts as he was writing this Epistle.</p><p>Whenever we write a letter or article, we first have certain thoughts within us. Then gradually we write according to these thoughts. This was Peter&rsquo;s situation when he wrote this Epistle. He had the thought that the believers had been regenerated to become newborn babes. Now they should long for the milk in the word. By the guileless milk in the word they could grow unto a salvation that was transformation for their building up. Having these thoughts within him, Peter went on to compose this Epistle.</p><p>On the one hand, Peter&rsquo;s composition may not seem very good. But, on the other hand, spiritually speaking, Peter&rsquo;s composition is excellent. If Peter had not written the way he did, not all of the points covered could have been included. However, because it is sometimes difficult to understand Peter, we need help to grasp the various points he covers in his writings. This is the reason we are having this Life-study.</p><p>I can testify that for more than fifty years I have been digging into the Word of God. In 1956 the Lord began to show me His building. First Peter 2 is a very important section in the New Testament related to God&rsquo;s building. When I was in Manila in 1956, I began to see from 1 Peter 2 that salvation includes transformation and that this transformation is for the building.</p><p>Few Christians have a proper understanding of the building. Furthermore, many have not seen the matter of transformation. Before you came into the Lord&rsquo;s recovery, did you ever hear a message on transformation? But in the recovery many messages have been given on the subject of transformation. In December 1962, I gave a conference on the all-inclusive Christ. Then in 1963 I began to speak in this country on transformation. That year I gave at least twenty messages on transformation. Although the light concerning transformation and building was given to me years ago, this light has never left me. Rather, it has always been with me. It took me years of study to see these things. Therefore, I can say that without the help rendered through these messages, you may find it difficult to understand what Peter is saying about salvation, transformation, and building.</p><p>Praise the Lord that regeneration has made us newborn babes! As newborn babes, we all should long for the guileless milk of the word. Then by this milk we shall grow unto salvation. This salvation is transformation, and transformation is the building. Feeding on Christ by the nourishing milk in the Word of God is not only for growing in life; it is also for building up. Growing is for building up.</p>
