   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE LORD S LAST WARNING</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>AND THE APOSTLE S LAST PRAYER</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Revelation 22:6 through 21 are the Lord s last warning and the apostle s last prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In verse 7a the Lord Jesus says, Behold, I come quickly.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Blessed is he who keeps the words of the prophecy of this scroll.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>How important it is that we keep the prophecy of this book!</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>In verse 10 the Lord continues, Do not seal the words of the prophecy of this scroll, for the time is near.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Although the apostle John did not seal the prophecies of this book, God s enemy, Satan, has sealed this book for centuries.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>This book is an open book, for the mysteries in it have all been unsealed, but to many believers it remains sealed.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>It is very difficult to find any Christians who truly understand this book.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Verse 11 continues, Let him who does unrighteousness do unrighteousness still; and let him who is filthy be filthy still; and let him who is righteous do righteousness still; and let him who is holy be holy still.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>We must be careful.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>If we are unrighteous or filthy and do not deal with this problem, the Lord may allow us to remain in this condition.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>In verse 13 the Lord says He is the Alpha and the Omega, the First and the Last, the Beginning and the End.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>That this word is similar to the word of God Himself in 21:6 proves that the Lord Jesus is the very God.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Verse 15 goes on to speak of those who are outside the city.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>This refers to the lake of fire where the sinful ones who cooperate with Satan will be.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Verse 16 continues, I Jesus have sent My angel to testify to you these things for the churches.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>I am the Root and the Offspring of David, the bright morning star.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>In His divinity, Christ is the Root, the source, of David, and in His humanity Christ is the Offspring, the issue, of David.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>This reveals the two natures of the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The bright morning star mentioned here will appear only to the watchful ones.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The slumbering believers will not see the morning star; they will see Christ only as the sun in a general way.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Verse 17 says, And the Spirit and the bride say, Come!</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>And let him who hears say, Come!</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>And let him who is thirsty come; let him who wills take the water of life freely.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The first two instances of come refer to the Lord s coming, while the third come refers to the thirsty ones.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>On the one hand, Come! is the cry of the Spirit and the bride and of all those who hear this response.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>On the other hand, the Spirit and the bride yearn that the thirsty sinner also will come to take the water of life for his satisfaction.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Finally, verses 18 to 21 say, I testify to everyone who hears the words of the prophecy of this scroll: If anyone adds to them, God will add to him the plagues which are written in this scroll; and if anyone takes away from the words of the scroll of this prophecy, God will take away his part from the tree of life and out of the holy city, which are written in this scroll.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>He who testifies these things says, Yes, I come quickly.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Amen.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Come, Lord Jesus!</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The grace of the Lord Jesus be with all the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Amen.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>SEEING THE HEAVENLY VISION</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>AND TAKING GOD S ULTIMATE INTENTION</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>AS OUR UNIQUE GOAL</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>May we all look to the Lord that He will reveal these things to us in our spirit, that from this day on we will have a heavenly vision.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Then, once we have seen the heavenly vision, we can never say that we have not seen it.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>We must be able to say to the universe, I was not disobedient to the heavenly vision Acts 26:19 .</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>May the Lord be gracious to us that we may truly see that God s ultimate intention, eternal purpose, and ultimate goal is to gain a Body for Christ as the corporate expression of the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Today we must take this as our unique goal and give ourselves to it.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>May the Lord be merciful to us.</S>
