   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>A. Spirit and Soul and Body</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Secondly, we have 1 Thessalonians 5:23.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>We must open to the Word and read it.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Don't listen to any man's opinion.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Don't listen to any man's word.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Come back to the Word of God and read it: "And the God of peace Himself sanctify you wholly, and may your spirit and soul and body be preserved complete, without blame, at the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ."</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>This verse clearly mentions that we have three parts the spirit and the soul and the body.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Two conjunctions connect three things.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>There is no ground to say that the spirit is the soul.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>In Genesis 2:7 "the Lord God formed man of the dust of the ground, and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life; and man became a living soul."</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Even from this verse it is clear that man has three parts.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>God firstly used the dust to form a physical body for man.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Then He used breath to form man's spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The breath of life got into man and became his spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The spirit of man is mentioned in Proverbs 20:27.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Spirit and breath in Hebrew are the same word.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>This indicates that the breath breathed into man became the human spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>When these two parts, the body and spirit, came together, they produced the third part, a living soul.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>B. Joints and Marrow</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Hebrews 4:12 says, "For the word of God is living and operative and sharper than any two-edged sword, piercing even to the dividing of soul and spirit, both of joints and marrow, and able to discern the thoughts and intents of the heart."</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The word divides the spirit from the soul just as the sword divides the marrow from the joints which are the bones.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The marrow is not the same as the bones.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The marrow is something within the bones, the joints.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>In the same principle the spirit is something within the soul.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>It is easy for people to see the bones.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>But it is not so easy for people to realize what the marrow is.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>You have to break the bones to get to the marrow.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>In like manner, the spirit is under the covering of the soul, but it is absolutely different from the soul.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>C. Trichotomy and Dichotomy</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>It is the clear teaching of Scripture that man is tripartite 1 Thes 5:23 .</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Nonetheless, there are two schools of theology which have arisen on this subject.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>One believes, as the Bible teaches, that man is a trichotomy; that is, he is made up of spirit, soul, and body.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The other school maintains that man is a dichotomy; that is, he has an outer part, the body, and an inner part, the spirit or soul.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>In this latter school spirit, soul, and heart are considered synonyms.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>We all must give up the human teaching of dichotomy and come back to the Word of God.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Let us now go on to see the parts of man and their condition at creation, after the fall, and in salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>This will help us to understand the position of our soul in relation to our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>II.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>THE PARTS OF MAN A. At Creation</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>At creation, man as a soul had two organs: the outward organ of his body and the inward organ of his spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Man's body as the outward organ was created to contact the physical world.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Man's spirit as the inward organ was purposed to contact the spiritual world.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Our physical body was made with dust, but our spirit was made with the breath of life.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Therefore, it is not physical, but spiritual.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The human life is not in the body or the spirit, but in the soul, for the soul is the person.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Therefore, at creation, man with his soul was a soul, a human being, who had two organs: his body and his spirit.</S>
