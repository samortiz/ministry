   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER FOUR THE BRINGING FORTH OF THE NEW MAN AND LIVING IN THE SPIRIT Scripture Reading: Eph 2:15; 3:8, 16-17a, 19b; 4:23-24; 2 Cor 3:18 KEEPING UP-TO-DATE WITH THE FLOW OF THE AGE</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>During the Chinese War of Resistance against the Japanese, I traveled to the northwestern provinces of China to visit the churches.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In some of the places I had to ride on a large handcart which could cover only about fifty kilometers after traveling the whole day from dawn to evening.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>At night, upon arriving at an inn, it seemed like all my bones had been detached.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>All I could do was lie down and go to sleep.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Traveling in those days was truly a hardship.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Today, however, both Taiwan and the United States have well-built highways and excellent transportation systems.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Therefore, traveling in these countries is efficient and comfortable.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>This is a very practical illustration of how the age changes.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>I have been a Christian for fifty years already.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>In the first few years it seemed as if I was riding on a large handcart.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>I tried so hard to pursue, yet I did not advance much, I did not learn many lessons, nor did I have much growth in life.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Then, gradually, the Lord led us through many changes, and today we can see that we have covered a great distance.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Our messages and hymns are much more advanced than what we formerly had.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>We are truly in a different age.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Regrettably, the churches in the Far East have not stayed up-to-date with the flow of the age.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>I am deeply concerned that the messages being released in many localities may be short of revelation, not rich enough, and not up-to-date.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Some of the saints refuse to follow the flow of the age.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>They declare that they want to receive everything firsthand instead of learning from others.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>This kind of talk is deceptive.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Only a few people, like Paul, received everything firsthand.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Thus, everything that is taken from the Scriptures is no longer firsthand.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Honestly, I do not care whether or not I receive something firsthand.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>All I care about is the object itself.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>If the object is a diamond, I do not care how many hands it has passed through.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>As long as it is in my hand, it is valuable to me.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>However, if the object were dung, I would not want it, even if I was the first to receive it.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>We all need to be humble, not thinking that we have seen something.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Although we surely have seen some things, what we have seen may be worthless.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>We need to see the central vision, which is the vision that the Triune God became flesh, died for the accomplishment of redemption, and in resurrection became the all-inclusive life-giving Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Today He has entered into our spirit and lives in us.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>He not only gives His life to us but also puts Himself into us to be our person.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>He and we are joined together, having one life, one living, one walk, and one move, and we simply live by Him.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>This is the most important matter.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Some may say that they have learned a particular lesson, such as how to be holy.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>These kinds of lessons, however, are peripheral matters.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>It does not make much difference whether we learn them or not.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Today God has a central purpose, a central vision, which we need to see.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>This is what the children of God lack today.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>This is lacking not only in Christianity but even among us.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>We all need to see this.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>THE CHURCH BEING THE NEW MAN CREATED WITH THE LIFE OF CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Ephesians is a book specifically on the church.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Many people know that Ephesians 1 says that the church is the Body of Christ v. 23 . How many know, however, that the church is the new man? Ephesians 2:15 says that Christ, having solved all the problems on the cross, created the Jewish believers and the Gentile believers in Himself into one new man.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>This new man must be a corporate entity, because there is only one new man, not many new men.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>This new man was created by Christ in Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>What material did Christ use to create the new man?</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>He used Himself as the material.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>The Lord Jesus created all of us into one new man with Himself as the material.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>The Greek word for create implies to create something new.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Previously there was no such thing as the new man in the universe.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Now, however, Christ has created the new man in Himself with His resurrection life.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Before His death and resurrection, our Lord had the eternal life of God, but He did not have the life that had passed through death and resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>The Lord Jesus created the new man not with the eternal life that had not passed through death, but with the eternal life that had passed through death and resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>There is a great difference between the life that has passed through death and the life that has not passed through death.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Before His crucifixion He already had the eternal life, but that life had not entered into death, passed through death, and come out of death again.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>After His resurrection He had the eternal life that had passed through death and entered into resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>It was with such an eternal life that the Lord Jesus created the one new man.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Therefore, anyone who belongs to the new man has passed through death and is in resurrection.</S>
