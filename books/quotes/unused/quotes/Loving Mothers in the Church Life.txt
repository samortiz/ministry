The first time chapter sixteen uses the term church, it is in the way of a local church, the church in Cenchrea
The emphasis in Romans 16 is on the sisters, not the brothers, and there is mention of a mother, but no mention of a father
The mother in verse 13 is a mother in the flesh in relation to Rufus but more important she is a mother not in the flesh in relation to Paul
The Bible tells us that Mark's mother was named Mary, but it does not tell us the name of his father in the flesh
Peter was Mark's father, not his father in the flesh but his father in the spirit, his father in the common faith
The New Testament as a record in the spirit does not tell us about the relationships of the family in the way of the flesh
To have the practical church life to the uttermost, in the local church there should be some real sisters and some real mothers
Yesterday she did not know how to be a mother, but today a child was delivered, and tomorrow morning she will begin to be trained
In his training in 1948 Brother Nee told the saints, especially the sisters, that they should be a mother to another young saint
For the most part, children do not like to respect the word of their own parents, especially when they become teen-agers
No matter how young you are, one or two children in the spirit will be your protection and your support in many ways
Two children would be a protection, a guard, and a limitation to the mother, but they would also keep her from being defeated
She was serving, she was caring for others as a nurse, she was a patroness taking care of all the needs of others
Without a sister as a mother to take care of them, all those who bear the burden for the Lord's service would be sorrowful
They have no mind, no energy, no strength, no heart, no capacity, and no time to talk about who is getting married
If you really love the Lord, you need to look at the church family, with a number of teen-agers who need spiritual mothers to care for them
All the people in that time in the church life had the life transfer through the crucifixion and resurrection of Christ
It is so easy to see that among the early believers there was the second birth with the second family relationship
Among today's Christians there is talk about the second birth, but there is nearly no talk about the second relationship
To take care of others is not an easy thing, and it is even harder to be taken care of by others after we are grown
Until there are the real mothers in the church life, the church life is not practical, and it is not up to the top
All the sisters need to be serving sisters, and whether or not we have children, we all need to be the mothers
When Peter was released from prison, he considered where he should go because he realized that there were many homes with praying groups
Until we could see the real serving sisters and so many mothers, our church life is not practical, it is not on the top
Through this there will be a strong connection in the spiritual building, and a prevailing revival will spontaneously be brought in
We all must pray that the Lord will have mercy upon the church that all the sisters will be Phoebes and will be mothers
