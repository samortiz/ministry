<p>The Lord Jesus told us, “If anyone wants to come after Me, let him deny himself and take up his cross and follow Me” (Matt. 16:24). To deny the self is to take up the cross. When the Lord Jesus was on the earth, He lived a crucified life daily. Although He was holy and without sin, He still denied Himself by putting Himself to death that God might live in Him and be lived out of Him.<p>Christ took up His cross daily by dying to Himself. Likewise, as God-men who pursue Him, we should bear the cross and live under the cross daily. This means that we should put our natural life on the cross by daily dying to our self and putting to death all the practices of our natural man and our flesh. We have a short hymn (Hymns, #631) which says:<p class=hbody>If I’d know Christ’s risen power,<br>I must ever love the Cross;<br>Life from death alone arises;<br>There’s no gain except by loss.</p><p class=hbody2>If no death, no life,<br>If no death, no life;<br>Life from death alone arises;<br>If no death, no life.</p><p class=hbody>If I’d have Christ formed within me,<br>I must breathe my final breath,<br>Live within the Cross’s shadow,<br>Put my soul-life e’er to death.</p><p class=hbody>If God thru th’ Eternal Spirit<br>Nail me ever with the Lord;<br>Only then as death is working<br>Will His life thru me be poured.</p><p>This kind of living requires our pursuit. A God-man is one who lives under the cross daily. Hence, to have merely the teaching of the cross is not enough; the cross must become our experience.<p>Such a living in the shadow of the cross touches the deepest part of our being and every detail in our life. We all know that we need to be careful when we talk to others. We brothers who are married, however, realize that we become very careless when we are talking to our wife. If we are those who live in the shadow of the cross, even our talking to our wife needs to be checked. Are we under the death of the cross when we talk to our wife in a certain way? If we are willing to check in this way, we will see that ninety-nine percent of the things which we say to our wife should never be said. They are things which we speak out of ourself; they are not spoken by the indwelling God in us, but by our natural man. It may be that we do not criticize, judge, or condemn others; instead, we speak nice things about others. But is it Christ who speaks, or is it we who speak? We have to admit that most of the things we say are by ourself without passing through the cross.<p>If this can be practiced among us, all troubles will disappear. This not only means that we should not engage in gossip, speaking idle words, but also means that we should not even speak nice words, because we are those who need to die and be in the shadow of the cross. We should not speak but allow the Lord to speak. If we truly have this experience, regardless of what we say, we have the cross checking in us: “Is this spoken through the cross? Is the mold of the cross here?”<p>The principle is the same in our shopping. We all like to buy things. It is not a matter of whether we should buy a certain item but a matter of the cross. Even in small matters such as buying a necktie we need to be in the shadow of the cross. We are those who belong to Christ; in other words, we are God-men. Therefore, we should live under the death of the cross in all things. It is in this way that the resurrected Lord can manifest His power from within us.
