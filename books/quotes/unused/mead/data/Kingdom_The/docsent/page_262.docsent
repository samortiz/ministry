   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE WISDOM AND JUSTICE OF GOD</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The kingdom is also related to the wisdom and justice of God.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The kingdom proves both the wisdom and the justice of God.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Without the kingdom, God's wisdom and justice cannot be proved to the fullest extent.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Also, apart from the truth concerning the kingdom, it is very difficult to solve the debate between Calvinism and Arminianism.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The Calvinists stress eternal security, while the Arminians stress that one can lose his salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>For many generations these two groups have been quarreling and debating.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Both of these sides have their points.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The Calvinists can point out many passages which prove eternal security.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The Arminians, however, will bring up other passages such as Hebrews 6 and 10 which seem to indicate that a person could be saved and then could fall and be lost again.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Without the kingdom truth, these two extremes can never be reconciled.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>There is no doubt that once we have been saved, we are saved forever.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Our salvation is eternally secure.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>But on the other hand besides God's salvation, there is God's wisdom.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>There is the truth concerning the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>In addition to salvation, there is the matter of the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Today the kingdom is an exercise for us.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>After we were saved, God set the kingdom before us as an exercise.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>In a sense we are born in God's home, but we are exercised in God's kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The home is a place for birth and enjoyment, but the kingdom is a place for exercise and responsibility.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>After we have been regenerated, we must be exercised.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The home is the place to enjoy grace, but the kingdom is the place to exercise responsibility.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>We should not take one and neglect the other.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>We have to take the grace, and we also have to take the responsibility.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>We have to take the home, and we also have to take the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>We enjoy and share in the home by partaking of the grace.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>We share in the kingdom by being exercised to take the responsibility.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Today, in the church age, the kingdom is an exercise to us.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>In the age to come, the millennium, the kingdom will be a reward to us.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>If we exercise well today, the Lord will reward us at that day.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>If we do not exercise well today, we will lose the reward of the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>By this the wisdom of God is proved, and the justice of God is maintained.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>THE EXERCISE OF THE KINGDOM</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>We need to read a number of passages which indicate that in addition to salvation there is the exercise of the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>First Corinthians 3:12-15 says, "Now if any man build upon this foundation gold, silver, precious stones, wood, hay, stubble; every man's work shall be made manifest: for the day shall declare it, because it shall be revealed by fire; and the fire shall try every man's work of what sort it is.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>If any man's work abide which he hath built thereupon, he shall receive a reward.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>If any man's work shall be burned, he shall suffer loss: but he himself shall be saved; yet so as through fire" lit.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>. These few verses show clearly that if we exercise properly, we shall receive a reward, but if we do not exercise properly we shall suffer loss.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>It does not mean that we shall lose our salvation, but that we shall suffer a loss.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Both the reward and the loss are something in addition to salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Once we receive salvation, we have it eternally.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>But besides salvation there is the matter of the reward or the loss.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>We must realize that after we are saved, we are put into the kingdom to exercise.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Because we are born again we must be under the control of the heavenly kingdom, under the heavenly rule and government.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>For this exercise, there will be a reward or a loss.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>There is no problem concerning salvation, but there is a problem concerning the exercise.</S>
