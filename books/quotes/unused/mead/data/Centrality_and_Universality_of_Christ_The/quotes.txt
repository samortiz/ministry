[1]  CONTENTS Christ Is All and in All The Subjective Christ Contacting the Lord by Praying in the Spirit Entering the Holy of Holies PREFACE
[2]  In this short book, we want to fellowship about the centrality and universality of Christ Christ as the center and Christ as everything.
[3]  Christ is the center, and Christ is the circumference.
[4]  Christ is the hub, the center; Christ is the rim, the circumference; and Christ is the spokes of this wheel.
[5]  Now let us read Colossians 2:2-3: "That their hearts may be comforted, they being knit together in love and unto all the riches of the full assurance of understanding, unto the full knowledge of the mystery of God, Christ, in whom all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge are hidden."
[6]  In Christ, who is the mystery of God, are hidden all the treasures of spiritual wisdom and divine knowledge.
[7]  Verses 22 and 23 say, "And He subjected all things under His feet and gave Him to be Head over all things to the church, which is His Body, the fullness of the One who fills all in all."
[8]  Christ has been made by God the Head over all things, not only for the church but to the church.
[9]  Now let us read Ephesians 4:13-16: "Until we all arrive at the oneness of the faith and of the full knowledge of the Son of God, at a full-grown man, at the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ, that we may be no longer little children tossed by waves and carried about by every wind of teaching in the sleight of men, in craftiness with a view to a system of error, but holding to truth in love, we may grow up into Him in all things, who is the Head, Christ, out from whom all the Body, being joined together and being knit together through every joint of the rich supply and through the operation in the measure of each one part, causes the growth of the Body unto the building up of itself in love."
[10]  If we consider before the Lord the above verses from Ephesians 4, we will have a clear vision that God's intention is to work Christ into us, to make Christ everything to us, and to cause us to grow in Christ.
[11]  The first item we want to consider is Christ in the Godhead.
[12]  Now we come to the last item concerning Christ as everything in God's intention Christ in the Christian life or Christ in the Christians.
[13]  In the Christians, or in the Christian life, we should not have anything other than Christ.
[14]  Third, today's Christianity is full of gifts, full of the seeking for healings and speaking in tongues.
[15]  In the beginning of the New Testament, in Acts, there are the gifts, signs, and miracles.
[16]  All these books deal much with the matters of knowing Christ and of being worked on by God, by the Holy Spirit, through the cross that Christ may be wrought into us, that we may be mingled, blended, filled, and saturated with Christ.
[17]  In the previous chapter, we saw from the Word that in the Godhead, in God's plan, in the universe, in the church, and in the Christian life Christ is everything.
[18]  All the New Testament gifts are instruments and means used by God to bring people to Christ and to lead people to know Christ, to express Christ, to experience Christ, and to realize Christ.
[19]  I do not oppose any kind of gift, but I am fighting because these gifts have been greatly utilized by the enemy to frustrate people from knowing Christ in a deeper way.
[20]  In this chapter I want to go on further and fellowship about the subjective Christ.
[21]  The all-inclusive Christ is more subjective than objective to us.
[22]  Likewise, if Christ is merely in the heavens and not in you and me, if Christ is just the objective Christ and not the subjective Christ, then Christ has nothing to do with us.
[23]  Today is Christ merely objective to you, or is He the subjective Christ to you?
[24]  I have no doubt that Christ is in the heavens, and I can give you the Scripture verses which tell us this.
[25]  But the New Testament also tells us many times that Christ is in us and we are in Him.
[26]  The book of Ephesians mentions repeatedly that Christ is in us and we are in Christ.
[27]  I regret to say, however, that in today's Christianity there is a lot of talk about Christ in the heavens but very little talk about Christ in us.
[28]  The Gospel of John speaks of Jesus Christ, the Son of God.
[29]  After you read through the entire book from chapter one through chapter twenty-one, where did this Christ go?
[30]  But the Gospel of John, the Gospel of Christ being life to us, does not say that the very Christ who is life in us has gone to the heavens.
[31]  In the preceding chapters we have seen clearly not only what Christ is in Himself but also what Christ is to us.
[32]  First of all, we have to know that if we are going to contact Christ, the living Christ, the subjective Christ, we have to realize what He is.
[33]  The Spirit of God is the Spirit of Christ, and the Spirit of Christ is Christ Himself.
[34]  Many Christians know that Christ is the bread of life, the living bread, but nearly no one can tell you how to take Christ as the bread of life.
[35]  Now we need to consider how we can exercise our spirit to turn on the spiritual switch.
[36]  Now I believe we are clear that Christ is the Spirit, and this Spirit, who is Christ Himself, is in our spirit.
[37]  The best way, and in fact the only proper way, for us to contact such a Christ is to exercise our spirit to pray.
[38]  The more you pray in this way, the more you will enjoy Christ.
[39]  The primary thing is that while you are praying in this way, you enjoy Christ and absorb Christ.
[40]  We have seen the centrality and universality of Christ Christ as the central One and the universal One.
[41]  Furthermore, we have seen that He is the all-inclusive and subjective Christ to us.
[42]  We pointed out before that the New Testament speaks a number of times about Christ's ascension, but it also says many, many times in various ways that Christ is in us, Christ is dwelling in us, and Christ is making His home in us.
[43]  We know that we are identified with Christ and one with Christ.
[44]  However, we have to realize that this oneness is possible only in the spirit, not in the body nor in the mind nor in the soulish life.
[45]  Now let us read 2 Corinthians 4:7: "We have this treasure in earthen vessels that the excellency of the power may be of God and not out of us."
[46]  Now as Christians, we need to check and see where we are today.
[47]  Are we in the flesh, in the soul, or in the spirit where Christ is and which is the Holy of Holies to Christ?
[48]  Yes, Christ is wonderful, but if you are going to enjoy Him, you have to deny yourself.
