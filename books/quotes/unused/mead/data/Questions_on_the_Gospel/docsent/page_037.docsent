   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>After the Lord Jesus had spoken these three sentences, there was darkness over all the land.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>God heard the prayer of the Lord, and He laid all the sins of the world upon the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>God made Him who knew no sin become sin on our behalf.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>God not only saves us according to His grace; He also saves us according to His righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>God not only has mercy on us; He also paid the price for us and repaid everything we ever owed.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>At about three in the afternoon, the Lord spoke four more sentences.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Fourth, He said, "My God, My God, why have You forsaken Me?"</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Matt 27:46 .</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Many martyrs, who experience man's persecution and severe punishment, do not show any sign of sorrow or self-pity.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Rather, they feel that God is very near to them.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Our Lord was obedient to God all His life.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Therefore, if He was only crucified on the cross through the persecution of man, God should have been much nearer to Him!</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>How could God ever forsake Him when man forsook Him?</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Thank and praise God!</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>On the cross our Lord did not die a martyr's death; rather, He died bearing the sins of all mankind.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>God put our sins upon Him, and God crucified Him.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>After the Lord spoke the first three sentences, God heard the Lord Jesus' prayer and put all the sins of mankind upon Him.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Then the Lord knew that God had forsaken Him.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Fifth, He said, "I thirst" John 19:28 .</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Thirstiness is a condition of hell, a characteristic of the suffering of hell.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The rich man in Luke 16 was in the fire of Hades without a drop of water.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>There is no other place that causes more thirst than hell.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>At that moment the Lord suffered the punishment of hell on man's behalf and tasted death for every man because He bore our sins Heb 2:9 .</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Sixth, He said, "It is finished!"</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>John 19:30 .</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>This indicates that the work of redemption was finished.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The Lord had borne the sins of man and received the penalty of sin for man.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Seventh, He said, "Father, into Your hands I commit My spirit" Luke 23:46 .</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Earlier the Lord had said, "My God, My God, why have You forsaken Me?"</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>He said this because He was standing on the ground of bearing man's sins.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>But here He was able to say, "Father," because after the redemptive work was accomplished, His fellowship with the Father was instantly restored.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The Lord laid down His life voluntarily, and He committed His life to God.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>He said, "No one takes it away from Me, but I lay it down of Myself.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>I have authority to lay it down, and I have authority to take it again" John 10:18 .</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>If He had not done so, not even a hundred crosses could have taken the Lord's life away.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Our sins have been taken away by the most righteous Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>According to His righteousness, God can no longer choose to forgive or not forgive us; He must forgive us because Christ has already died and become the sin offering.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Since the Lord did not accomplish the work of redemption until His death on the cross, perhaps some will ask how He could have forgiven man's sins before His death.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>This is possible because God reckoned the cross as an accomplished fact even before Christ's death.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>John 3:15 says, "That every one who believes into Him may have eternal life."</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>John 6:54 says, "He who eats My flesh and drinks My blood has eternal life."</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>These passages show us that even when the Lord was on the earth, everyone who believed in Him could have eternal life.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Revelation 13:8 says, "The Lamb who was slain from the foundation of the world."</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The Lord is the Lamb who was slain from the foundation of the world.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Therefore, the church is not limited by space for the Body of Christ is one , while the cross is not limited by time for even in the Old Testament, God could forgive people .</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>In the Old Testament, anyone who killed another person accidentally could flee to a city of refuge where no one could seize his life, and he would be free when the high priest died Num 35:25-28 .</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>This signifies that even before Christ's death, if anyone hid in Christ, he would be safe and free upon the death of Christ.</S>
