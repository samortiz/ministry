   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Christ Being Our Life</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The fourth point in the apostle Paul s line of thought is that Christ is our life.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In the past we may have realized that Christ is our life, but did we realize that the Christ who is our life is such a Christ?</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>This Christ, who is so much to God, to the old creation, and to the new creation, is our life.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>This is why we must walk in Him, live in Him, take hold of Him, and beware of being captured away from Christ by anything else.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>This world is full of thieves, robbers, and enemies, all trying their best to make us a prey and to capture us away from Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>In this book these things do not refer to bad things but to many good things, such as philosophy, human knowledge, and human wisdom.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>History tells us of one group of people who put a very high value on philosophy.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>These people are known as the Gnostics.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>They appreciated Greek literature, Greek philosophy, and Persian thought very much.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>These items may seem to be very good from the perspective of human ethics, but they are enemies of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>All these things will make us prey, capture us, and carry us away from Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>This is why we must hold fast to Christ as our life.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>When I was very young, around eleven or twelve years of age, I studied at an elementary school established by the Baptist mission.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Then I went to a college that had been started by the American Presbyterian mission.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>As a result of attending these two schools, I met many missionaries.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>My impression of them was that nearly all of them appreciated the teachings of Confucius very much.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Once I heard one of them say, The teachings of Confucius correspond with the teachings of the New Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The teachings of Confucius may appear to be good, but actually they are enemies of Christ, capturing people and carrying them away from Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>During the time that I attended the Presbyterian college, every weekday from eleven thirty to twelve noon we had what was referred to as chapel time.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>During this time someone would give a sermon, and we would listen.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Of all the sermons that I heard, I never heard a single one that told us how to practice taking Christ as our life or how to experience Christ as our life.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Instead, we heard only teachings.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>These teachings were substitutes for Christ and enemies of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>All of the teachings were good, fundamental, and scriptural, but they were enemies of Christ because they kept those who heard them away from Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>We all must realize that Christ is a living person.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>He is the image of the invisible God, the center of the whole universe, the Head over all things, and a real person to be our life.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Our concern should not be with doctrines or teachings but with this living person.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>We must deal with, contact, and fellowship with this living Christ moment by moment.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>We are not here just to learn His teachings; we are here to learn how to live in Him, with Him, by Him, and through Him.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Christ is a living person to be our very life.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>We are here to learn how to take Him as our daily life.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>This is the apostle s thought in telling us that Christ is our life.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Christ Being the Reality</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>After revealing that Christ is our life, the apostle makes this very practical.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>He writes, Let no one therefore judge you in eating and in drinking or in respect of a feast or of a new moon or of the Sabbath Col 2:16 .</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>All these items eating, drinking, feasts, a new moon, and the Sabbath are all good things.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>No one can live without eating and drinking; everyone likes to enjoy a happy day of feasting; everyone likes a new moon, which represents a new beginning with new hope; and everyone likes to have rest, which is typified by the Sabbath.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>After listing all these positive items, the apostle goes on to say, Which are a shadow of the things to come, but the body is of Christ v. 17 . Paul s thought here is that all these things are just a shadow, the reality of which is Christ Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Christ is our real food, our real drink, our real time of feasting, our real new beginning, and our real rest.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Thus, the way to experience Christ as our life in our daily life is to take Him as all these items.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>To illustrate how we can take Christ as so many things in a practical way, I would like to share with you the following testimony.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>I believed in the Lord over forty years ago.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>At that time the Chinese New Year was very important to the Chinese people.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The custom was that everyone would rise up early in the morning some even did not sleep the night before , put on new clothing, and begin to do many things to celebrate the New Year.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>I also participated in many of these things until around two years after I had been saved.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>After I had been saved for around two years, when the New Year arrived, I no longer had the heart to enjoy all those things.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>My heart was wholly on the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Before I went to bed the night before the first day of the New Year, I spent much time studying the Scriptures.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>When I went to sleep that night, I was so happy and full of joy, and the next morning when I rose up, right away I knelt down to pray.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>The moment I knelt down, I was full of the feeling that the Lord was with me.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>The Lord s presence was so near to me, and the Lord seemed so sweet to my heart.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>While I continued kneeling in prayer, my mother came to my room and said to me, Come and put on your new clothes.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>At that time I was still under my mother s hand, so I went to my mother s room where she had laid out a complete set of new clothes for me.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>After putting on all the new clothes, I went back to my room and knelt down to pray again.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>This time, however, the Lord was gone.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>According to my feeling, the Lord was far away from me.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>I simply could not pray, and I knew that something was wrong with my new clothes.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>After some time I got back up and returned to my mother s room.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>I said to her, Mother, I am sorry, but I have to take off these new clothes.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>When my mother heard this, she looked at me and asked, Are you mad?</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>What are you saying?</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>I answered her, Please forgive me, but I simply cannot wear these new clothes.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Then I went and took off all the new clothes, put my old clothes back on, and returned to my room to pray once more.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>When I knelt to pray, my eyes were filled with tears, and once again I sensed the full presence of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Through this experience, I learned that from that day on I should no longer celebrate New Year s Day.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>After I stopped celebrating New Year s Day, several times my friends came to me and said, We feel so sorry for you.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>You never celebrate New Year s Day, and you never go to the movies.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>When they said things like this to me, I would answer them, I feel even more sorrowful for you.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>There is no need for you to be sorry for me.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Every day is a New Year s Day to me, because I have Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>I do not need a feast day, because every day is a feast to me, and every day is a good time to me.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>I also do not need to go to movies, because Christ is my pleasure.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>Do not be sorrowful for me; just be sorrowful for yourself.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>I have Christ, and He is everything to me.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>By telling us that Christ can be all these things to us, the apostle Paul gave us a practical way to experience Christ as our life.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>Christ is the real food, the real drink, the real feast, the real new moon, and the real Sabbath.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>Christ is also the real light.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>If we do not have Christ as our light, then we are in darkness.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>We should tell people, If you do not have Christ as your clothing, then you are naked.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>Your clothing is merely a shadow.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>Christ is our real covering.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>This should not be merely a doctrine to us.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>This must be our actual experience.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>All positive things are but a shadow.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>Christ is the reality, and by taking Him as the reality of all these things, we can have the practical experience of Christ as our life.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>The book of Colossians reveals that as the mystery of God, Christ is everything.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>As the Son of God s love, the image of the invisible God, and the One in whom God s fullness dwells, Christ is everything to God.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>As the Firstborn of creation, the One in whom, through whom, and unto whom all things were created, and the One in whom all things cohere, Christ is everything to creation.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>Finally, as the Firstborn of resurrection and the Head of the Body, Christ is everything to the new creation, the church.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>Colossians also unveils that Christ is our life and the reality of every positive thing in the universe.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>Since Christ is so rich and all-inclusive, we need to experience and enjoy Him every day.</S>
