O. Box 84, Hankow, April 1938)</h2><h2 class="head1">NEWS CONCERNING THE WORK</h2><h2 class="head2">A Letter from Brother Hsu Dah-weh, Chekiang</h2><p>To my brother in the Lord, Kwang-rong:</p><p>I received your letter of the thirteenth. I returned to Wu-Yi from Jinhua on the fifteenth. I went first to the Ho home in North County of Wu-Yi and was stranded there for eight days by the rain and snow, so I did not come into the city until the day before yesterday. If the Lord allows, I might go to Hsuan-Ping to do some work and then from there go to Wenchow and Ping-Yang to see the brothers. If I do not go there, I will go to Ning-Po or Shanghai. Presently, I cannot go to Shanghai, so I will lose this opportunity to see Brother Nee according to God's decision. I have really wanted to see Brother Nee and have considered writing a letter for some time. For the past few months, I have been traveling alone and have given God many opportunities to work in me. (Unfortunately, rotten wood cannot be made into anything useful.) Satan has come to attack me through the power of darkness, but the power of the victorious One has been sufficient to uphold me and take me through the valleys and the depths. The Lord's grace and love are limitless, and their preciousness and practicality are made all the more real! Over the past few months, I have come to realize that it is very important to live a life of faith in God and to have a living knowledge of God. It is not enough to know that we are weak; we must also know the power of His resurrection. I really feel that the heavenly power is so necessary, and the spiritual supply so precious. But one must have a living knowledge of Christ, the Son of God, to meet these needs. A negative realization of oneself is not enough. May the Lord have mercy on me! I dare not say that the knowledge of the truth is useless, but one must have the experience of life to prove it. Otherwise, the truth may be real, but there is nothing to attest to it. Of course, knowledge of the truth is useful in showing the direction. The knowledge of the truth can be compared to light, but life is the experience of walking in the light. Therefore, we should hold life and knowledge on the same level (2 Pet. 3:18).</p><p>In my solitude I really sense the dearness of the Lord! His sympathy refreshes my tiredness. I feel that it is not hard to be one in heart, but very difficult to be one in feeling. One need only to obey to be one in heart, but to be one in feeling, one must also have inward knowledge. Therefore, I really feel that if I am going to allow Christ to live out of me, it is not enough to have just brotherly love. I must have the heart of a father or mother. I like reading the Epistles of Paul because this kind of real emotion is expressed in them. The Lord is dear, not because He died on the cross in obedience to God's command, but because of the love He expressed through the cross and the enlightening He gave us through it. Therefore, He not only died for His earthly ministry, but also gave grace because He sympathized with our poverty. This is what I have been thinking of recently. In recent months I have been practicing walking. Thank the Lord, fifty miles is not a fearful distance to me now. There was a time when I would gasp at the thought of walking ten miles. The Lord's commission often carries us to unexpected places. A slave should always be prepared, lest he give excuse before the battle. When I consider how useless I am, I really feel that I owe the Lord too much and that time is too short! Oh, I can only press forward! Please remember me in your prayer. It is already cold. I will not continue. Peace in the Lord!</p><p>Your brother in the Lord,<br />Hsu Dah-weh</p><p>(This letter arrived in Shanghai on February 3. It was sent to Chungking and did not arrive until the middle of March&mdash;Editor.)</p><h2 class="head2">A Letter from Brother Ma Di-seng, Li-Shui</h2><p>There is only a China Inland Mission here in Li-Shui. There are usually between three and four hundred people in the meetings. Brother David Hsu came from Hsuan-Ping on March 4 and was invited by the China Inland Mission to speak in their village meetings for nine days (in three places). On March 18 he left to labor in Wenchow and Ping-Yang. Thank the Lord for His grace. I testified a few times at the China Inland Mission. May the Lord gain something.</p><p>Your brother,<br />Ma Di-seng<br />March 21</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_088.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_090.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Collected Works of Watchman Nee, The (Set 2) Vol. 31: The Open Door (1) &nbsp; pg 89</div><br></body></html>
