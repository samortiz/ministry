<P CLASS=INDENT1>Our hope is that God will use this little testimony to lead His children to draw near to His living Word, Christ, and to His written Word, the Bible. In this way they will be able to see how to go on today and obey Christ that He might have a larger and fuller place in their lives and work. It is our hope that they will also be helped to see the heavenly pattern&#151;Christ&#151;and turn their attention to His central work&#151;the church&#151;in order that Christ might be exalted and the Body of Christ, the church, be built up. It is also our desire that God would use this paper to declare His will and release His truths that the spiritual life of His children could be nurtured and their problems resolved. Although this responsibility is great and we are poor and weak, we do not look to ourselves nor to anything of ourselves. Rather, we look to Him, to His sufficient grace, and to His overshadowing strength.</P><P CLASS=INDENT1>Today with the church in such a confused, dark, desolate, and apostate condition, to speak the will of God straightforwardly and not to shun His truths will inevitably bring upon us the enemy's attack and men's opposition. But since this earth is one that has rejected the Lord, should not attack and opposition also be the portion of those who follow Him? In the work of serving the Lord, we seek nothing but His pleasure and satisfaction in heaven. We dare not compare ourselves with the apostle Paul, but we desire to follow his faithfulness and say with him, "For am I now trying to win the assent of men or of God? Or am I seeking to please men? If I were still trying to please men, I would not be a slave of Christ."</P><P CLASS=INDENT1>Finally, dear brothers, because of the greatness of this responsibility, the attacks of the enemy, and our own weaknesses, we do need you to pray for us with the same heart, in the same mind, and under the same yoke. May God bless you all!</P><P style="text-align:center">________________________________________________________________________________________________________</P><P>The following is the announcement in the same issue of the magazine concerning the resumed publication of The Christian:</P><P style="text-align:center">________________________________________________________________________________________________________</P><P CLASS=INDENT1>THEME: To speak forth God's will and to cultivate a Christian's spiritual life.</P><P CLASS=INDENT1>CONTENT: Notes on the Scriptural Messages, Twelve Baskets Full, Stories, Testimonies, Questions and Answers, and Bible Studies.</P><P style="text-align:center">________________________________________________________________________________________________________</P><P>The Christian continued until 1940. It was then suspended until it was replaced by The Way in 1948.</P>
