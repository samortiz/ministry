   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>3.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Revelation 7:3</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>"Saying, Do not harm the earth or the sea or the trees until we seal the slaves of our God upon their foreheads."</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>"The slaves of our God."</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Here God begins to acknowledge the Jews.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>He is returning to the position in the Old Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>In the church age, there is no difference between Jews and Gentiles.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>In the Old Testament, all the people were servants 1 Sam 8:17; 17:8; 1 Kings 10:5-8 .</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>In Revelation the emphasis is God's throne.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Servants do not have the position of children, but of responsibility.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Revelation 7:1 through 3 mentions the wind; Revelation 8:6 through 9 mentions the fire.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Wind and fire are very much related.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>To have a fierce fire, there must be a strong wind.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>4.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Revelation 7:4-8</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>"And I heard the number of those who were sealed, a hundred and forty-four thousand, sealed out of every tribe of the sons of Israel: out of the tribe of Judah, twelve thousand sealed; out of the tribe of Reuben, twelve thousand; out of the tribe of Gad, twelve thousand; out of the tribe of Asher, twelve thousand; out of the tribe of Naphtali, twelve thousand; out of the tribe of Manasseh, twelve thousand; out of the tribe of Simeon, twelve thousand; out of the tribe of Levi, twelve thousand; out of the tribe of Issachar, twelve thousand; out of the tribe of Zebulun, twelve thousand; out of the tribe of Joseph, twelve thousand; out of the tribe of Benjamin, twelve thousand sealed."</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Who are the people mentioned in 7:4-8?</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>They are not the church but the people of Israel.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The Seventh-Day Adventists assert that they are this people because they keep the law and are, therefore, the real Jews.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>But we have ten reasons to prove that the people in Revelation 7:4-8 are Jews in the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>1 If "the sons of Israel" in Revelation 2:14 are to be interpreted literally, then "the sons of Israel" in 7:4 should be interpreted literally also.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>2 "The tribe of Judah" in Revelation 5:5 is interpreted literally, so "the tribe of Judah" in 7:5 should be also.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>3 The names of the twelve tribes are unique to the Israelites.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Of the people in the church, which denomination belongs to which tribe?</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>4 Israel is divided into twelve tribes, but the church is one.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>How can it be split into twelve tribes?</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>5 Since Revelation 7:9 speaks of "every nation," how can "the sons of Israel" in 7:4 not be a nation?</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>6 The great multitude in Revelation 7:9 could be numbered by no man, but in 7:4 the sealed ones were exactly a hundred and forty-four thousand.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Can we say the saved ones in the church are only a hundred and forty-four thousand?</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Besides, this hundred and forty-four thousand is clearly the sum of twelve twelve-thousands.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>How can we not interpret this literally?</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>7 In Revelation 6:15 "the kings" are interpreted literally.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>How then can we say "the sons of Israel" in 7:4 do not refer literally to a nation?</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>8 In Revelation 7:13-14 John did not know where the countless multitude in verse 9 came from.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Therefore, he answered the elder, "My lord, you know."</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>John did not ask about those people in Revelation 7:4-8.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>This shows that he already knew who they were.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>9 In Joel 2:12-27 God told only the Israelites the way to escape the locusts.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>In Revelation 9:3-4 only those who were sealed were not hurt by the locusts.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>This proves that the sealed ones are the children of Israel.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>10 The sheep in Matthew 25 are those who treat their little brothers well.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>These little brothers are the Jews and those brothers who remain on earth.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Those little brothers, the Israelites, will become a test to the Gentiles on earth.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The following are the different groups of people among the Israelites.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Before we mention these different peoples, we must take note that no mention is made in Revelation 7:4-8 of the name of Dan In Ezekiel 40 48 the scene in the coming kingdom is described.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Ezekiel 48:1 clearly says that the land of Dan is in the north during the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>In the Chronicles, however, the tribe of Dan is also not mentioned among the twelve tribes.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>What is the reason for this?</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>This does not mean that there is no more tribe of Dan, but that perhaps the relationship between Dan and the serpent is too close.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>In Genesis 49 Jacob prophesied concerning his sons.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>When he came to Dan, he spoke of Dan's existence in verse 16 and of his behavior in verse 17.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Then in verse 18 Jacob suddenly prayed as if he saw danger in Dan's future behavior.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Jacob did not pray for the other children in that way.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Perhaps during the great tribulation the tribe of Dan will be especially united with the Antichrist.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>The people spoken of in Revelation 7:4-8 are:</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>1 The Jews who are to reign with Christ on earth in the future.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>They are, however, not the kings.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Since the number twelve thousand is composed of twelve times ten times ten times ten, this number is eternally complete in God's administration.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>2 The suffering Jews who are part of the least of the brothers in Matthew 25:34-40.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>3 The Jews who are part of those who endure unto the end in Matthew 24.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>4 The Jews upon whom the Spirit will descend in the future.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>The former rain already fell in Acts 2.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>The latter rain of Joel 2:23, 28, and 29 has not yet fallen.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>The blood and the fire in Joel 2:30 correspond to the first trumpet.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>The pillars of smoke correspond to the fifth trumpet.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>So we see that the second outpouring of the Holy Spirit occurs between the sixth seal and the fifth trumpet.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>The great tribulation begins with the seventh trumpet.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Before the seventh trumpet there are merely calamities.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>5 The Jews who will receive the new covenant which the Lord Jesus will establish with them on earth Jer 31:31-34 .</S>
