   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The last part of Matthew 1 deals with the names of Jesus and Emmanuel.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Jesus was the name given by God, whereas Emmanuel was the name called by man.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Three elements are in the name of Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>First, the name Jesus includes the name Jehovah which means I Am I Am Who I Am Exo 3:14 .</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The verb "to be" in Hebrew not only refers to the present, but also includes both the past and the future.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Hence, the correct meaning of Jehovah is I Am Who I Am, the One who is now in the present, who was in the past, and who will be in the future and in eternity forever.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Because the name of the Lord is the I Am, we may say, "Lord, You told me that Your name is I Am.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Then, what are You?"</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>His answer will be, "I am whatever you need."</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The second element included in the name of Jesus is the Savior.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Jesus is Jehovah-Savior, the One who saves us from all negative things.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Third, Jesus is not only the Savior, He Himself is also our salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Do not ask Him to give you salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Instead, you should say, "Lord Jesus, come to me and be my salvation."</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The name of Jesus is above every name Phil 2:9-10 .</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The exalted name of Jesus is for us to do many things.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Firstly, the name of Jesus is for us to believe in John 1:12 .</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>We should not only say that we believe in the Lord Jesus, but also declare that we believe in the name of Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The name of Jesus is for us to be baptized into Acts 8:16; 19:5 .</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>To be baptized into the name of Jesus means to be baptized into His Person.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The name of Jesus is also for us to be saved.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Acts 4:12 says, "Neither is there another name under heaven given among men in which we must be saved."</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Both Acts 3:6 and 4:10 testify that the name of Jesus is also a healing name.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The name of Jesus has been given to us so that we may be washed, sanctified, and justified 1 Cor 6:11 .</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>If the name of Jesus were an empty name, how could it wash sanctify and justify us?</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>This would be impossible.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>However, this name is linked to the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The Spirit is the Person of the name and the reality of the name.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Therefore the name can wash us, sanctify us, and justify us.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The Spirit is one with the name.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Jesus is the name of the Lord, and the Spirit is the Person of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The name of Jesus is for us to call upon Rom 10:13; 1 Cor 1:2 .</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>If you call on His name, you will taste Him and enjoy Him.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Because Satan and all his demons hate the name of Jesus, we must proclaim it all the more.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Moreover, we must learn to suffer for this name Acts 5:41; 15:26, and never deny the name of Jesus Rev 3:8 .</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Now we come to the second name, Emmanuel 1:23 .</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>When we experience Jesus, He is Emmanuel, God with us.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Whenever we are gathered together into the name of Jesus, He is with us 18:20 .</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Jesus is with us all the days, even until the consummation of the age 28:20 .</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Jesus is not only among us; He is in our spirit 2 Tim 4:22 .</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>According to Isaiah 8:7-8, the enemy may try to take over the land of Emmanuel.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>But Isaiah 8:10 tells us that because God is with us, the enemy can never take over the land of Emmanuel.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Although Satan has tried his best to take you over you are still here because of Emmanuel, because of God with us.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>This Emmanuel is Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Today we may enjoy Jesus and experience Him as our Emmanuel.</S>
