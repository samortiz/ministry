<h2 class="head1">BEING DELIVERED FROM LIVING<br />
ACCORDING TO FEELINGS</h2>
<p>In their experience many serving ones still cannot tell the difference between living according to feelings and living by faith. They may know the difference in words, but very few know the difference in their experience. Most still live in their feelings; it is hard to find a serving one who lives by faith. Some have served for a number of years, but not many have been delivered from their feelings, and even fewer can live by faith.</p>
<p>This conclusion is based on two conditions that we have observed among the serving ones. A few are living and fresh. They testify of the Lord&rsquo;s presence and of touching Him and sensing His sweetness in prayer and in the Word. Most of the serving ones, however, have lost this sweet experience. They sense neither the Lord&rsquo;s presence nor His sweetness. Instead of being fresh and living, they are down and oppressed and want to withdraw from the service. It seems that there is a difference between these two conditions and that the first condition is better than the second. However, both conditions show that the saints are living according to their feelings. Their spiritual journey is according to their emotions; that is, their relationship with the Lord is based on their emotions.</p>
<p>Those who have spiritual experience know that it is difficult to come out of the stage of living according to one&rsquo;s emotions. This stage can last for a long time. Furthermore, believers in this stage are confused by the trials that they pass through. According to his biography, Brother Hudson Taylor experienced such trials. For a period of time he did not sense the Lord&rsquo;s loveliness when he read the Word, prayed, or fellowshipped with the Lord. Brother Hudson Taylor did not understand the cause of this condition. Most believers have had such an experience. A brother might have wonderful fellowship with the Lord and feel sweet, fresh, and revived, but when he goes through a trial, he becomes low and oppressed and loses his freshness. It is possible for a believer to have this kind of experience many times, that is, to emotionally rise and fall like a wave in the ocean. The amount of rising and falling is related to his natural disposition. A believer who is very emotional tends to fluctuate more noticeably than a believer who is not very emotional. Some believers are delivered from such a life after a few experiences, but others remain in this stage even after numerous experiences.</p>
<p>I have a deep sense within that the Lord wants to lead us to experience something new and wonderful. He wants to lead us out of living according to our feelings, because such a life is a great hindrance.</p>
<p>According to Song of Songs, there are six stages in our spiritual experience. The first stage is from 1:2 through 2:7, the second stage is from 2:8 through 3:5, the third stage is from 3:6 through 5:1, the fourth stage is from 5:2 through 6:13, the fifth stage is from 7:1 through verse 13, and the sixth stage is from 8:1 through verse 14. The first stage is the fundamental stage. If we can understand the first stage, Song of Songs will be an open book to us. A particular point in the first stage is that there is not much revelation of the beloved to his seeker. The content of this stage is mainly the speaking of the seeker, based on her experience and feeling. At the beginning of her speaking, she says, &ldquo;Your love is better than wine&rdquo; (1:2). This is her experience as well as her feeling; it is not a revelation. Hence, our knowledge of the Lord in the initial stage is mainly from our experience; it is not based on revelation. The seeker says that her beloved is like &ldquo;a bundle of myrrh,&rdquo; &ldquo;a cluster of henna flowers,&rdquo; and &ldquo;the apple tree among the trees of the wood&rdquo; (vv. 13-14; 2:3). These words are based on feelings realized in her experience.</p>
<p>Hence, this stage of our spiritual pursuit is altogether involved with feelings. The seeker says, &ldquo;Tell me, you whom my soul loves, Where do you pasture your flock? / Where do you make it lie down at noon? / For why should I be like one who is veiled / Beside the flocks of your companions?&rdquo; (1:7). These words imply that those who do not pursue the Lord are starving and are wandering and that she also is not satisfied and does not have rest; hence, she is put to shame. She is not different from those who do not pursue the Lord. However, she feels that there is no reason to be put to shame. She should be fed and thus have satisfaction, and she should lie down where the Lord pastures His flock and thus have rest.</p>
<p>In the first stage a seeker&rsquo;s praise to the Lord, knowledge of the Lord, and pursuit of the Lord originate from feelings. The seeker lacks objective vision and revelation. Her praises and pursuit are an expression of her subjective experience and subjective feelings. She lacks objective knowledge and utterance; everything is subjective. Believers who fall into subjectivity tend to become shallow. If we desire to be deep, we must have objective visions. Our knowledge and seeing must be from above; they should be apart from our feelings. In the first stage of spiritual experience portrayed in Song of Songs, the seeker does not have such a seeing. On the one hand, it is good that her words are based on her experience. She is not like most people who utter empty doctrines. On the other hand, however, her experiences are shallow and lack revelation.</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_004.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_006.html">Next</a> </body></html>
