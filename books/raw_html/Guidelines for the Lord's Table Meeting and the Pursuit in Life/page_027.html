 <h2 class="head1">NOT NEEDING TO ANALYZE WHETHER OUR RECEIVING<br />
IS ACCORDING TO KNOWLEDGE OR THE SPIRIT</h2>
<p><em>Question: Is there a distinction between receiving that is according to knowledge and receiving that is according to the spirit?</em></p>
<p>Answer: Concerning the declaration of Japan&rsquo;s surrender, was there a distinction between receiving this news as knowledge and receiving it by the spirit? When people heard of Japan&rsquo;s declaration of surrender, did anyone wonder whether he received the news as knowledge or in the spirit? We have these kinds of questions in our mind because we have not seen the Lord&rsquo;s all-inclusive death on the cross. Therefore, we ask ourselves: Is this subjective or objective? Is this knowledge or the spirit? Seeing is seeing. Japan&rsquo;s surrendering simply meant Japan&rsquo;s surrendering. Christ&rsquo;s death simply means that Christ died. His death which terminated all things simply means Christ&rsquo;s death terminated all things. The simpler we are when we apply these matters in our experience, the better. There is no need to analyze, because we cannot enter the spirit by analysis. The fact that Christ died means that Christ died; that all things were terminated on the cross means that all things were terminated on the cross; that we died in Him means that we died in Him. All analyses come from the mind.</p>
<h2 class="head1">TOUCHING GOD DEPENDING ON HIS MERCY<br />
AND OUR STOPPING DISTRACTING THOUGHTS</h2>
<p><em>Question: Why is it that spiritual matters sometimes seem so real and at other times so distant from us?</em></p>
<p>Answer: This is exactly right. Spiritual matters can be very near, as near as &ldquo;in your mouth and in your heart&rdquo; (Rom. 10:8). They can also seem so distant that they are beyond our reach our entire life. This same principle applies to hearing the gospel and receiving salvation. One person may receive the gospel immediately upon hearing it the first time, whereas another person may not receive the gospel after hearing it numerous times. Suppose there are two brothers, and the younger one receives the gospel, but the older one does not. The older brother may ask the younger, &ldquo;How did you receive the gospel?&rdquo; The younger brother may reply, &ldquo;I simply received it.&rdquo; The older brother says that it is difficult to receive the gospel, but at the same time the younger brother says that it is easy. This shows that God will have mercy on whomever He will have mercy, and He will have compassion on whomever He will have compassion (Rom. 9:15). Our salvation is truly a matter of mercy. We are saved because God showed us mercy.</p>
<p>It is difficult for God to work in a person who does not think clearly. It is strange, however, that some people&rsquo;s minds are clear when we speak concerning subjects such as engineering, machinery, and economics. However, when we speak to them concerning God&rsquo;s salvation, no matter how hard we try, we cannot get through with them. They are easily distracted in their thoughts. This is truly a matter of God&rsquo;s mercy.</p>
<p>What can we do to receive God&rsquo;s mercy? If we want to give a lofty answer, we can say, &ldquo;If God will have mercy on me, I will be shown mercy; if God will not have mercy on me, I will still ask Him for mercy.&rdquo; We need to be humble to say, &ldquo;O God, enable me to see. Let me see today; if not today, then let me see tomorrow.&rdquo; However, our eagerness to see is often a hindrance to seeing. Yet at the same time a lack of eagerness to see can also be an obstacle. Hence, when the apostle Paul wrote Ephesians, he prayed for the saints, &ldquo;That the God of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of glory, may give to you a spirit of wisdom and revelation in the full knowledge of Him&rdquo; (1:17). Paul&rsquo;s responsibility was to write the Epistle, but whether or not the saints would know the Lord Jesus depended on God&rsquo;s mercy.</p>
<p>For this reason, whenever I give a message such as this, I am reluctant to exhort or incite people with words; by the Lord&rsquo;s mercy I would like to unveil this mystery so that perhaps some could hear and receive mercy to see it. Similarly, when we preach the gospel, we do not know who will be shown mercy. In this matter we can do nothing to help. Man&rsquo;s salvation is of God&rsquo;s mercy; no one can help in this matter.</p>
<p>We may think that we are very capable, but have we gained anything? We have preached the gospel, but our number has not increased. We have not gained what we thought we were capable of gaining. We need the light. In the book of Job, God did not speak until Job&rsquo;s friends had finished their speaking (38:1-2). When man stops speaking, the light comes. We are often bothered if we do not do something for the Lord, but even when we do, we often have no impact. This is because we do not have the light. God wants simplicity. Our words and thoughts need to be purified; they need the shining of God&rsquo;s light.</p>
<p>The most successful people in the world are the simplest people. This is the same in spiritual matters. We must stop our distracting thoughts and worship before the Lord, saying, &ldquo;Lord, You are the Lord. Whether or not I see, You are still the Lord.&rdquo; Then our problem will be solved. We must be able to stop and not try to analyze whether something is this way or that way. If we think that we can find a solution by our analysis, we are finished. We need to learn to be simple. Since the Lord has said so, we should simply stop and receive. In response some might ask, &ldquo;What if I receive it but nothing happens?&rdquo; This continual asking of questions is like being presented with food but still asking, &ldquo;Is there bacteria in the food? What if I eat it and have a stomachache? Should I see a doctor? What if the doctor is inexperienced?&rdquo; Questions like these can be endless.</p>
<p>Many people are like this. They may have heard the words of the faith many years ago, but in their mind they have one question after another. Thus, they can neither touch nor receive the reality in God&rsquo;s Word. We need to stop our distracting mind, stop wandering in our mind, stop all our questions, and simply come back to God&rsquo;s Word to allow the light in God&rsquo;s Word to shine on us. Once we have the light and have seen the light, our being will spontaneously be terminated.</p>
