<H2 CLASS=HEAD3>4. Their Dead Living,<br>and the Earth Bringing Forth the Deceased</H2><P>In 26:19 there is a word concerning the resurrection of the dead. "Your dead will live; my corpses will rise./Awake and give a ringing shout, you who dwell in dust,/For your dew is like the dew of the dawn,/And the earth will bring forth the deceased." The dead ones, who dwell in the dust, will awake and give a ringing shout.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>5. Jehovah Having Increased the Nation</H2><P>Isaiah 26:15 says, "You have increased the nation, O Jehovah;/You have increased the nation&#151;You are glorified;/ You have far extended all the edges of the land." To increase the nation is to increase the people, and to extend the edges is to enlarge the territory. In this restoration the Holy Land will extend from the Mediterranean to the Euphrates (cf. Deut. 11:24).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>6. The Moon Being Abashed,<br>and the Sun Being Ashamed</H2><P>The light of the sun and the moon will fade because of God's shining glory. According to Isaiah 24:23, the moon will be abashed, and the sun will be ashamed, for Jehovah of hosts will reign in Mount Zion and in Jerusalem, and His glory will be before His elders.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>7. Jehovah of Hosts Making on the Mountains<br>for All These Peoples a Feast of Fat Things</H2><P>"Jehovah of hosts will make on the mountains/For all these peoples/A feast of fat things,/A feast of wine matured on the lees,/Of fat things full of marrow,/And of filtered wine matured on the lees" (25:6). Here the word peoples refers to the nations. In the restoration God will make a satisfying feast for the nations. I believe that in the restoration Jerusalem with Mount Zion will be the most joyful place on earth. It will be a center in which all the peoples of the earth will find enjoyment and satisfaction. From throughout the earth, people will come to Jerusalem to enjoy the feast.</P><P>"On this mountain He will swallow up/The covering that covers up all the peoples,/Even the veil that veils all the nations" (v. 7). Today the people on earth are covered with a veil that keeps them from seeing God's economy, but in the restoration God will take away this covering. Then all the people will see something concerning God's eternal economy. Furthermore, God will swallow up death forever, and He will wipe away the tears from all faces. Also, He will remove the reproach of His people from all the earth (v. 8).</P>
