<H1 CLASS=MSG>CHAPTER TWENTY-THREE</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>THE TESTIMONY OF THE CHURCH</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>TALKS (4)</H1><p>Date:Morning, January 13, 1948<br>Place:Swatow, Kwangtung<br>Speaker:Witness Lee</p><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>REMOVING THE VEIL AND HAVING A PURE HEART</H2><P>The veil mentioned in 2 Corinthians 3 refers to anything that hinders us from seeing the glory of the Lord. Anything that frustrates us from beholding the glory of the Lord is in principle a veil. Our husbands, wives, children, fame, the world, and riches can all become veils. Anything that causes us not to see the Lord's glory is a veil. To turn our hearts to the Lord means to have a pure heart for the Lord; only people with such a heart do not have veils. The Lord says that the pure in heart are blessed, for they shall see God (Matt. 5:8).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE WORK OF LIFE</H2><P>The Christian living and work issue from life. An artificial flower looks much the same as a real flower. But the artificial flower cannot withstand the scorching of the sun or the beating down of the rain, whereas a real flower can withstand them. If a Christian's living and work do not issue from life, they are like artificial flowers and will not be of much use.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE TESTIMONY OF THE CHURCH</H2><P>There are four categories of work in Shanghai. The first is the gospel work, the second is the children's work, the third is migration, and the fourth is the work of visitation.</P><P>Brother Sparks emphasizes a personal ministry today. But our work today is to maintain a testimony of the church, which is why we have to build up everything at the same time.</P><P>The co-workers should do their best to transfer the work to the local brothers and sisters. Our work should produce more apprentices, instead of just producing the products.</P><P>In the coming days, we need to put out three kinds of hymnals. The first is the general hymnal, which only Brother Nee himself can be responsible for. The second is the gospel songs, which I will be responsible for. The third is the children's songs, which Sister Ruth Lee and others will be responsible for.</P><P>There is one kind of work which only Brother Nee can do, and for which no other person can substitute for him.</P><P>In the future, the work in central China and southern China should have more fellowship.</P>
