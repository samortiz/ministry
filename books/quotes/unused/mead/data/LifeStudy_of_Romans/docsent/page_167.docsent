   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>LIFE-STUDY OF ROMANS MESSAGE FORTY-EIGHT REIGNING IN LIFE OVER DEATH</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In the two foregoing messages we have seen that by grace we can reign in life over sin, death, and Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In this message we shall consider the matter of reigning in life over death.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Before we do this, however, let us review the difference between sin and evil and that between grace and the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Sin is the nature of Satan injected into man, and evil is sin in action.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>When Satan injects himself into man, that is sin.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>But when sin is present and active in us, that is evil.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>In the same principle, grace is God coming into man and being embodied in man.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>But when grace is present and active, it becomes the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>THE PRESENT WORKING OF DEATH</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The Bible reveals that death comes from sin.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>As 6:23 says, The wages of sin is death.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>This means that death is the result of sin.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>It is possible that our understanding of death may merely be doctrinal.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>When I was young, I was taught that there were two deaths: man s physical death and the lake of fire, which is the second death.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>I did not regard death as something in which I was subjectively involved daily.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Gradually, however, I discovered that in the Bible a number of verses indicate that death is presently working in us.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Death is like a worm that is constantly eating us.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Sin ruins us, but it does not eat us.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Death is the worm that is devouring us day by day.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Death has a number of aspects, the present aspect and the future aspect, the subjective aspect and the objective aspect.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>After the millennium, all the unbelieving dead will be raised and will stand before the white throne to be judged Rev 20:12 .</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Those whose names are not found in the book of life will be cast into the lake of fire, which is the second death Rev 20:15 .</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Our burden in this message is not with this future, objective aspect of death; it is with the present, subjective aspect.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>At this very moment, the element of death is within our being, endeavoring to kill us.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>In chapters five through eight of Romans the subject of death is covered in a full way.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>In Romans 5 we see that death entered the world through sin and then passed to all men.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Furthermore, as verse 14 makes clear, death also reigns.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>In 6:21 and 23 Paul says that the end of the things of which we now are ashamed is death and that death is the wages of sin.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Romans 7 is a chapter not only on law, but also on death.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>In verses 10 and 11 Paul declares, And the commandment which was unto life, this was found to me to be unto death.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>For sin, taking occasion through the commandment, deceived me, and through it killed me.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Furthermore, in verse 13 Paul says that sin works death to me through that which is good.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Therefore, in verse 24 he cried out, Wretched man that I am!</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Who will deliver me from the body of this death?</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The death that Paul is speaking about in chapter seven is not the death coming in the future; it is the death working within us right now.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Paul s situation in Romans 7 was very different from David s in Psalm 51.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Psalm 51 is a psalm of repentance that followed a particular act of sinning.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>In Romans 7, however, Paul was not repenting because he had sinned.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Romans 7 is concerned not with repentance, but with death, with the continual working of death within him.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Repentance was of great help to David in Psalm 51, but it would have been no help to Paul in Romans 7.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>It could not have delivered him from the death in his mortal body.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>THE STING OF DEATH</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>In 1 Corinthians 15:55 and 56 Paul says, O death, where is thy sting?</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>O grave, where is thy victory?</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The sting of death is sin; and the strength of sin is the law.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Death is likened to a scorpion, and sin is likened to the scorpion s sting.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>According to Hebrews 2:14, the one who has the power of death is the Devil.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Once we are stung by the scorpion of death, the Devil exercises his power to kill us.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Thus, Satan has the power of death, and sin is the sting of death.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Whenever we are stung by sin, the poison of death gets into us.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>The result is spiritual killing, spiritual death.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>A CONTRAST</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>At this point it may be helpful to see a sharp contrast between the negative side and the positive side.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Satan is opposed to God.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>When Satan injects himself into man, the nature of Satan in man becomes sin.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>On the contrary, God wrought into man becomes grace.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Hence, sin is opposed to grace.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>When sin is present and active within us, it becomes evil.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>But when grace is present and active, it becomes the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>The result of the activity of evil is death, whereas the result of the activity of the Spirit is life.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Therefore, Satan, sin, evil, and death are opposed to God, grace, Spirit, and life.</S>
