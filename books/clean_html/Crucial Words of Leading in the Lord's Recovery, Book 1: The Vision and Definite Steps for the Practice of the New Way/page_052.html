<h2 class="head1">HAVING AN AGGRESSIVE, BOLD, AND DARING SPIRIT</h2>
<p>I hope that we will have the boldness and the confidence to open our mouth to speak for the Lord. We must not be afraid, and we must not be shy. Such are not the attitudes of one who is serving the Lord. What I mean is that when we go to a home meeting, we should fire up the meeting. We must not be afraid if the meeting does not have fire. We must not worry when instead it pours cold water on our head. We must have a strong determination that anytime we go to a meeting, we must light a fire in that meeting. If we are shy and hesitating, we will only quench the fire, even quenching it quicker than any other person will. We will not be able to fire up anyone. We are all young people. If we want to work, we must work with enthusiasm and impact. We need to be like Elijah, who called fire down from heaven even when the ground was covered with water (1 Kings 18:33-38). We all need this kind of attitude, this kind of spirit.</p>
<p>Twenty-three years ago I went alone to America as a sixty-year-old Chinese. I did not have any theological qualifications, and I never studied in America. That was the first time I worked in America. I had to learn their language in order to preach to the Americans. At that time I encountered cold water everywhere. All around me was chilling ice. Yet I did not care for any of these frustrations. I had the confidence within that as long as I was selling treasure, someone would buy it. In the end, the water was dried up by the fire; everywhere I saw churches being raised up.</p>
<p>When the Chinese went to Brazil thirty years ago, the easiest way for them to make money was to carry a knapsack on their back and sell their wares from their sack. The Chinese who had just migrated to Brazil had very little else they could do because they could not understand Portuguese. At that time a favorite item for the Brazilians was embroidery work. This was the only kind of business the Chinese knew to do. They would wrap all kinds of Chinese goods inside a sheet and carry it on their backs, going from house to house to make sales. The Brazilians are very hospitable people. Whenever they saw someone coming to their door with a knapsack, they would open the door and invite the person to come in for tea. The Chinese may not have known the language, but they surely could communicate with their hands. After unwrapping their sack and settling on the price, they would make their sale. Sometimes they were able to sell their goods in this way by the hundreds. In time, they could communicate in the native language and were able to make even more sales.</p>
<p>Today in working for the Lord, we should be like those who carried their goods on their back. It does not matter if we cannot communicate very well. As long as we can open up our &ldquo;sack&rdquo; and show people our &ldquo;goods,&rdquo; that is sufficient. It does not matter if we are not able to make ourselves clear; we should simply repeat the same words a few more times. We have the goods. If we have this spirit and this attitude, surely we will be able to sell our goods. If we go to the home meetings with the same spirit, I guarantee that every home will be fired up. Even if it was dead before, we can do what Elisha did; he laid mouth to mouth, eye to eye, and palm to palm, stretching himself over the one who was dead and dispensed life to him (2 Kings 4:32-37). At most, we need to do this for two or three weeks; then the people will come alive. We must believe that the eternal and incorruptible life is within all the brothers and sisters. As long as we work aggressively enough, they will come alive. I believe that we can all testify to this.</p>
<p>Many times some co-workers asked me, &ldquo;Brother Lee, what is the secret of your work?&rdquo; I can say that the secret of my work is that I do not know what difficulty is. I know only to give myself to work. I do not care for the result; I care only to labor diligently. We can say that my secret is simply to work. I do not care about the circumstances; I care only to work. The result of this work during the past sixty years can be seen. As long as we work, there will be the result.</p>
<p>Thirty-seven years ago, the situation in mainland China changed suddenly. At that time all the co-workers gathered together in Shanghai to prepare for the change. Brother Nee said specifically in that co-workers&rsquo; meeting that I should leave the country. Eventually, I was the only one who left; all the rest stayed behind for the Lord&rsquo;s testimony. At that time, Shanghai was the largest city in all of Southeast Asia. The church in Shanghai was the leading church among more than four hundred churches in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery. Every week we published one periodical. All of this work was under my care. We even spent one hundred five thousand dollars (U.S.) to buy a piece of land and were prepared to build a three-thousand-seat meeting hall that would also accommodate two thousand people outside. Then suddenly I was sent to the small island of Taiwan.</p>
<p>When I first arrived in Taiwan, I did not know where I should meet. The brothers in Taipei invited me to speak on the Lord&rsquo;s Day. When I went to the meeting place, I found out that it was a run-down house that occupied only a few square feet. As I entered the door, I had to take off my shoes. I was from north China; according to our custom it is impolite to take off one&rsquo;s shoes. I had never taken off my shoes in public, but on that day I had to speak without my shoes on. I was afraid that I would not be able to deliver my message and that my spirit would be gone, but I went against my will and spoke. There were only a few dozen people sitting around in a scattered way. I groaned within. When I returned to my dwelling, which was a small place with only two rooms, I fell on my bed and stared at the ceiling. I asked myself, &ldquo;What am I doing here in Taiwan?&rdquo; As I looked at the pebbled streets outside the window and listened to the sound of the wooden clogs clattering on the road, I wondered what kind of work I could do there. I did not understand the native Taiwanese dialect, and everything around me was disappointing and discouraging.</p>
<p>However, since I was already in Taiwan, I reasoned, &ldquo;What can I say?&rdquo; The Chinese have a saying that when the goods arrive at the doorstep, the deal is done. Since I had already moved my &ldquo;goods&rdquo; to Taiwan, I had to &ldquo;sell&rdquo; them. If I did not sell my goods, they would spoil. After two months a thought came to me, and I believe that it was of the Lord. I asked myself, &ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you take a trip along the railway route?&rdquo; At that time there were a few hundred brothers and sisters in Taiwan who had just moved from mainland China. They were scattered in the few major cities along the railway route. So I took the train and visited Shin-ju, Taichung, Zhia-yi, Tainan, and Kaohsiung along the way. That visit gave me a burden. I felt that much could be done. When I returned, I fellowshipped with the brothers, and we decided to begin the work there.</p>
<p>I believe the senior co-workers among us remember that at the beginning of our work in Taiwan the first meeting hall in Taipei was only one-half the size of what it is today. The land was donated by two overseas Chinese brothers, and we erected a temporary canopy with wooden beams for our meetings. Once we began our work, God&rsquo;s blessing was there. We decided to preach the gospel, but the meeting place was not large enough. The land across the street from the hall was an unassigned plot, and nothing was on it yet. We decided to contract some people to enclose it with bamboo fences, bricks, and wooden props. It provided a temporary overflow space for meeting. That space later became the &ldquo;Workers&rsquo; Home.&rdquo; This was how we began our work in Taiwan.</p>
<p>We should not allow any circumstance to quench our burden for the Lord&rsquo;s work. We work even if the worst hardship befalls us. We work even if harsh poverty meets us. As long as we are clear that we are serving the Lord, we should charge forward without any fear. Do not think that if we are rejected, we will have no more places to go. Do not say that it is impossible to have a home meeting that has only one believer because the rest of the household worships idols. This is to pour cold water on ourselves. This is to quench the fire. If we do that, it is no wonder that we cannot bring life into the situation. No matter how difficult the situation is, as long as we have the Lord&rsquo;s presence, we can go against all odds. One characteristic of a Christian is that he can go against the tide and move forward by beholding the Lord&rsquo;s face. When the missionaries came to China, they also faced trying situations. Everywhere they went, they faced opposition and cold water. Rocks were thrown at them, and some were even martyred. Yet they were not discouraged. They pressed on and did not turn back for a moment. Eventually, they opened the door of the gospel in that old, conservative land.</p>
<p>Today to spread the Lord&rsquo;s gospel in Taiwan and to evangelize the whole island, we need the spirit and perseverance of the missionaries who went before us. If we sit here hoping that evangelization will come, that is a dream. If we wait until all things are ready, and if we think that we can preach the gospel from an easy chair, we will never see anything of the gospel. When the Lord charged the disciples to preach the gospel, He told them not to bring any shoes, staff, or money. This means they needed to have the attitude that if there was no food, they would simply press on in hunger. If there were no shoes, they would simply move on bare feet. If we have such a spirit, the gospel will surely prevail.</p>
<p>Dr. Mateer, the chairman of the translation team that put out the Chinese Union Version, was one of the seven renowned scholars in the East Pacific region. When he came to China, he lived in a carpenter&rsquo;s home in Penglai in Shangtung province in north China. The father of one of our senior co-workers was a student of his in oceanography. When Dr. Mateer first came to China, he and his companions could not find a place to live. No one was willing to rent, much less sell, a room to him. In the end, some among them had to live on the streets, and some were forced to take shelter in idol temples. This was how they persevered in the gospel. I say this to show that we are not qualified to do the Lord&rsquo;s work if our intention is to wait for all things to be ready before we preach the gospel. If we want to be in the Lord&rsquo;s work, we must learn to strive even when there is nothing for us to work with.</p>
<p>In short, we should not be deterred by anything. Rather, we should charge forward with no thought of turning back. We must not allow anything to cripple our aspiration to build up the home meetings. We must have the will to &ldquo;do or die.&rdquo; I hope that the co-workers, the elders, and all the full-timers will pick up this burden and spirit. The home meetings are not a product of our imagination but they come from the Lord&rsquo;s revelation. As long as we are willing to work, something will be worked out in a proper way.</p>
