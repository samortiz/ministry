        <h1 class="msg">CHAPTER FIVE</h1>
<h1 class="title">THE ACCOMPLISHING<br />
OF GOD&rsquo;S REDEMPTION</h1>
<h1 class="title">(1)</h1>
<h1 class="title">INCARNATION</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Matt. 1:20-23; Gal. 4:4; John 1:1-3, 14; 1 Tim. 3:16; Heb. 2:14; Phil. 2:6-8; Rom. 8:3; 5:14; 1 Cor. 15:45</h1>
<p>In the Old Testament, before accomplishing redemption, God spoke of His redemption in detail through prophecies and types. In this chapter we will consider how God intended to accomplish redemption according to His plan.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE NECESSITY OF INCARNATION</h2>
<p>The first step that God took toward accomplishing redemption was to become flesh (John 1:1, 14). God desires to gain man; He wants man to receive His life, to be joined to Him, to be the brothers of Christ, and to deal with His enemy, Satan. This was God&rsquo;s purpose in creating man, but the created man sinned and fell. God intended for man to be His expression, but man sinned and fell short of God&rsquo;s glory (Gen. 1:26; Rom. 3:23). God also desired that man would cooperate with Him to destroy His adversary, Satan, but man rebelled against God and followed Satan.</p>
<p>Under these circumstances God could have responded in several ways. He could have chosen to destroy both the man, whom He had created and who sinned and rebelled against Him, and Satan, whom man followed. This would have been easy. The more difficult way involved rescuing the man who had sinned and followed His enemy. If God had chosen the easy way, it would not have been possible for His eternal plan to be accomplished, but since God chose the difficult way of rescuing man, His eternal plan could be accomplished. In order to accomplish redemption for man, therefore, God had to become flesh. The accomplishment of redemption required the incarnation of Christ for at least six reasons.</p>
<p>First, in order to satisfy the requirements of His righteousness, holiness, and glory, God had to deal with man&rsquo;s sins. However, in order to deal with man&rsquo;s sins, God had to stand in the position of a man, according to the status of a man. In order to bear the curse of sin, receive God&rsquo;s righteous judgment, and suffer the pain of death on behalf of man, God had to become a man through incarnation so that He could be in the position and status of a man.</p>
<p>Second, God had to deal with corruption in man&rsquo;s nature, which was an issue of the fall. On the one hand, God needed to rescue the man whom He had created, but on the other hand, He needed to terminate the man who was corrupted. Hence, God was incarnated to become flesh and to put on humanity in order to bring humanity with Him through death and into resurrection. God terminated corrupted humanity through His death on the cross, and He rescued created humanity in His resurrection.</p>
<p>Third, God had to deal with Satan, who corrupted man. Satan was originally an archangel created by God, but he rebelled against God and became the adversary of God. God does not want to come as the Creator in order to deal with one of His creatures. Instead, He wants man, another creature, to deal with the creature who rebelled against Him. Regrettably, man was deceived by Satan and entered into an illicit union with him. Man was corrupted by Satan. In order to rescue the Satan-deceived man from Satan&rsquo;s hand and also to destroy this rebellious archangel through man, God had to become a creature through incarnation. Colossians 1:15 says that He is &ldquo;the Firstborn of all creation.&rdquo; In order to deal with the creature who had rebelled against Him, God assumed the status of a creature and was joined to humanity.</p>
<p>Fourth, God had to enable fallen men to come near to Him. As a result of the fall, human beings were far from God. It was impossible for them to come near to God. Because fallen sinners have no way to approach or stand before the God of glory, God came in the flesh in the likeness of men (Phil. 2:7), concealing His glory in the flesh of His humanity. This enabled men to come near to Him, because they were approaching a man, not God.</p>
<p>Fifth, God had to reveal Himself so that men could know Him. Men can perceive God&rsquo;s eternal power and divine characteristics through the things that He created (Rom. 1:20). Furthermore, men can know God&rsquo;s ways and see His wisdom through the Scriptures. But unless He came out of His sanctuary in the heavens to be among men as a person in the likeness of a man, it would not be possible to see God or know Him directly. Therefore, God became a man in order to be comprehensible to men. He presented Himself to men in bodily form so that men could see and know Him.</p>
<p>Sixth, God had to become a man in order to be joined with man. God&rsquo;s intention in creating man was for man to be one with Him, but man sinned and thus could not be joined to God. Therefore, God joined Himself to man so that man would be joined to Him. This was accomplished through incarnation.</p>

 	<h2>Noise Words</h2>
 	<p>Common words, such as "and", "is", "but", and "the", also known as noise words, are bypassed in a search. The search string, the Spirit &amp; who, would result in an error since who, which stands by itself, is a noise word. The following is a list of noise words:</p>
	<p>$, a, also, an, and, another, any, are, as, at, be, because, been, being, both, but, by, came, can, did, do, each, for, has, had, he, have, her, here, him, himself, his, how, if, in, into, is, it, like, make, me, might, much, my, of, on, or, our, out, over, said, should, since, some, still, such, take, than, that, the, their, them, then, there, these, they, this, those, to, too, very, was, way, we, well, were, what, where, which, while, who, with, would, you, your</p>

  	<h2>Ranking</h2>
  	<p>Rank is a value from <strong>0</strong> to <strong>1000</strong> indicating how closely a match scored or ranked against the original search string. Rank values are affected by the following factors:</p>
		<ol>
            <li><span>The total number of occurrences of the original search words/phrases in a portion of a book.</span></li>
            <li><span>Content that includes the search words in close proximity to each other are ranked above those that do not. Therefore, a portion of a book that has the search words in close proximity may have a higher ranking than another portion of a book that has a higher hit count but the words are not in close proximity to one another. Therefore, we also include a search word hit count for reference.</span></li>
            <li><span>The rank values are relative to each other. Therefore, it is not possible to interpret the RANK value as a percentage or group the rank values into high/medium/low ranges. Think of rank as a method to order the results for a specific search.</span></li>

 	<h2>Search Scope</h2>
 	<h3>Include All Word Forms</h3>
	<p>This option breaks out the search string into its individual words and generates all conjugations and declensions for each word in the search phrase. A search on the word, dwell, would search for dwell, dwelling, dwelling's, dwells, dwelt, and dwelled.</p>
	<p>There is no need to use ^ (inflectional search) or * (prefix search) when using the Include all word forms search scope.</p> 
	<h3>Specified Word Forms</h3>
	<p>This option searches for exact matches of the specified words or phrases used in the search string. Use of ^ (inflectional search) with a particular word in the search string will broaden the search for that given word in that all conjugations and declensions for that word will be searched. Similarly, use of * (prefix search) with a particular word in the search string will broaden the search for that given word in that all words with that prefix will be searched as well.</p> 
	<h3>Note</h3>
	<p>Common words, such as "and", "is", "but", and "the", also known as noise words, are bypassed in a search. A list of all noise words is as follows:</p>
