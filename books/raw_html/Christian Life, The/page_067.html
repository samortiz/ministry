<P>The Spirit is the totality of God, of the Triune God, of the uplifted Man, of the death of Christ, of the effectiveness of this death, of the resurrection of Christ, and of the power of this resurrection. This is why the New Testament charges us to live by the Spirit, to walk by the Spirit (Gal. 5:16, 25), and to do everything according to the spirit (Rom. 8:4). The only way to exalt Christ, express Christ, manifest Christ, and live Christ is to live, to walk, and to do things according to the spirit. If we love others in ourselves, we exalt ourselves. But if Christ loves others in us and through us, He is exalted.</P><P>John Wesley thought that holiness was sinless perfection, but according to the principle of the Bible, even if we could arrive at sinless perfection, that would not exalt Christ but ourselves. That would not express Christ but ourselves. To live by the Spirit, walk by the Spirit, and do things according to the spirit is to live Christ, to magnify Christ, to manifest Christ, to express Christ, to exalt Christ, and to glorify Christ.</P><P>In the compound Spirit, we experience the killing of Christ's death. When we live and walk by the Spirit, the Spirit becomes a killing to our soul, our natural man, and our body with its practices. The Spirit is an all-inclusive dose which both nourishes us and kills the negative things in our being. Even the physical food that we eat nourishes us and helps to kill the germs in our being. Today the pneumatic Christ, the all-inclusive Spirit, is our life, light, food, drink, and air so that we can be spiritually nourished and so that the negative things within us can be killed. We have to eat, drink, and breathe in the pneumatic Christ, who today is the life-giving, compound Spirit. I would consider the life-giving Spirit as the seventh major item in the history of the universe.</P><P>The eighth item is the church, and the ninth item is the New Jerusalem. The issue of our enjoyment of the compound Spirit first is the church and consummately will be the New Jerusalem. These nine items are the real history of the universe.</P>
