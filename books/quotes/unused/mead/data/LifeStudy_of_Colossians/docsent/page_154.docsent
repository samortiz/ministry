   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHRIST DWELLING IN US SUBJECTIVELY</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The book of Colossians presents both the objective aspect of Christ and the subjective aspect.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>On the one hand, this book reveals the extensive, all-inclusive Christ objectively.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>On the other hand, there is the definite indication that this Christ dwells in us subjectively.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>We have already referred to 1:27, where Paul says that Christ in us is the hope of glory.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The extensive, all-inclusive Christ is actually dwelling within us.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>How subjective this is!</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>According to Paul, the Christ who is the mystery of God s economy is not merely the Christ at the right hand of God in the heavens, but also the Christ who is within us.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>According to God s economy, Christ must be dispensed into us for our subjective experience.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>If He were only on the throne in the heavens, we could not experience Him.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>We could look to Him, trust in Him, pray to Him, and rely on Him, but we could not experience Him.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Praise the Lord that the extensive Christ lives in us to be our hope of glory!</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>This is the focal point of God s economy, the center of God s dispensation.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Some Christians do not believe that Christ is in us.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>They claim that He is on the throne and is represented in us by the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>This is a twisting of God s holy Word, which clearly says that Christ is in us.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>What right does anyone have to say that Christ is only in the heavens and not also in the believers?</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>What ground does anyone have to twist God s Word to mean that Christ is merely represented in us by the Spirit?</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Those who deny that Christ actually dwells in us oppose us for teaching that Christ today is the life-giving Spirit 1 Cor 15:45; 2 Cor 3:17 .</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The Bible clearly and definitely says that Christ is in us.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>If Christ were not the life-giving Spirit, how could He indwell us to be our life?</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>HIDDEN WITH CHRIST IN GOD</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>In 3:3 and 4 Paul says, For you died, and your life has been hidden with Christ in God.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>When Christ our life is manifested, then you also shall be manifested with Him in glory.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Colossians 3:3 says that our life is hidden with Christ in God.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>To be with Christ in God means that we are one with Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>In the words of 1 Corinthians 6:17, he who is joined to the Lord is one spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>We are with Christ in God because we and Christ are subjectively one.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Colossians 3:3 is a deep, mysterious verse.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>With Christ we are hidden in God.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Is it not a mystery that we are with Christ and that we are hidden in God?</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>This is not something merely objective; it is also very subjective.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>CHRIST, OUR LIFE</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>In 3:4 Paul goes on to say that Christ is our life.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Nothing is more subjective to us than our life.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Our life is actually we ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>How can you separate a person from the life of that person?</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>It is impossible!</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>A person s life is the person himself.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Thus, to say that Christ is our life means that Christ becomes us.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>This is subjective to the uttermost.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>WALKING IN CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>In 2:6 and 7 Paul says, As therefore you have received Christ Jesus the Lord, walk in Him, having been rooted and being built up in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>After we receive Christ, we should walk in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>This is to live, act, behave, and have our being in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>This also is subjective.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>If Christ were only on the throne, how could we walk in Him on earth?</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>We can walk in Christ only if He is subjective to us in our experience.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Colossians 2:7 speaks of having been rooted in Christ and of being built up in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>These expressions are related to our walking in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>We walk in Him, having been rooted in Him and being built up in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>This implies that we are plants rooted in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>We need to see more of what it means to be rooted in Christ and to be built up in Him in order to walk in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Our burden in this message has been to point out that Paul s intention in Colossians is to help the saints realize that there should not be any replacements for Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Rather, everything else must be replaced by Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Christ is in us as our life, and we need to walk in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>If we have been rooted in Christ, and if we are being built up in Him, we shall walk in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>We shall live, behave, and have our being in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>This is to live Christ.</S>
