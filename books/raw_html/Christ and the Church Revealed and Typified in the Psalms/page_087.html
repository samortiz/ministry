<h1 class=msg>CHAPTER TWENTY-FOUR</h1><h1 class=msg>A CONCLUDING WORD</h1><p>I believe we have all been deeply impressed with these four words, Christ, house, city, earth. Let us forget about the negative one, the law. We must always remember God’s Christ, the house of God, the city of God, and the earth. We have seen clearly that the entire book of the Psalms just covers these main points in a wonderful sequence. We have also seen that the picture given us by the book of Psalms is exactly the same as that portrayed by the entire Bible. The whole Bible reveals only Christ, then the church, and then the reigning of Christ over the whole earth with the New Jerusalem as the center.<h2 class=head1>CONCERNING CHRIST</h2><p>Let us consider now all the main aspects of Christ in the Psalms:	<ol class="decimal">	<li>His divinity—Psalm 45:6; Heb. 1:8</li>	<li>His incarnation—Psalm 8:4; Heb. 2:6</li>	<li>His humanity—Psalm 8:4; Heb. 2:6</li>	<li>His human living—Psalm 16:1-8</li>	<li>His death—Psalm 22:1-21</li>	<li>His resurrection—Psalms 2:7; 16:10; 22:22; Heb. 2:12; Acts 2:25-32; 13:35-37</li>	<li>His ascension—Psalm 68:18; Eph. 4:8</li>	<li>His exaltation—Psalms 80:17; 110:1</li>	<li>His crowning—Psalm 8:5; Heb. 2:9</li>	<li>His enthronement—Psalm 2:6</li>	<li>His dominion, kingship, and authority—Psalms 2:8; 8:6; 47; 72; 89; 110</li>	<li>His priesthood—Psalm 110:4</li>	<li>His fighting—Psalms 110:5, 6; 45:3-5</li>	<li>His victory—Psalm 110:5, 6</li>	<li>His indwelling—Psalm 22:22</li>	<li>His shepherding—Psalm 23</li>	<li>The stone for the building—Psalm 118:22</li>	<li>His coming—Psalms 72; 96; 110</li>	<li>His reigning—Psalms 93—101</li>	</ol><p>The main Psalms concerning Christ: Psalms 2, 8, 16, 22, 23, 24, 45, 68, 80, 91, 110, 118<p>These are just the main aspects; there are many details which could be filled in. It is clear that through the Psalms we can know Christ much better than through the New Testament.
