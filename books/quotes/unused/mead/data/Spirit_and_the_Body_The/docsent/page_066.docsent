   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>BEING SPIRITUAL BY SPEAKING IN THE MEETINGS</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>First Corinthians 12:2 says, "Ye know that ye were Gentiles, carried away unto these dumb idols, even as ye were led."</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>If you remain silent in the meetings, you are a dumb idol.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>But all the attendants at a church meeting must be very spiritual.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>To be spiritual means to be bubbling.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>This is the opposite of being dumb.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>As those attending the meetings of the churches, we need to make a joyful noise to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>This noise should not be a performance; it should be spontaneous.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>In this verse Paul seemed to be saying to the Corinthians, "You were Gentiles, carried away to dumb idols in the idol temple.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>You were dumb and made no noise because you were worshipping dumb idols.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Because the idols could make no noise, you did not make any sound either.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>But now when you come to the church meeting, you come to the living God, to the speaking God, not to a dumb idol.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Therefore, you also must speak."</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>To speak in the meetings is to be spiritual.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>But if you do not speak in the church meetings, it is an indication that you are not spiritual.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Suppose three brothers who live together in the brothers' house come to the meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>In the meeting all three are dumb.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>When others pray, they do not even say amen, because they do not agree with their way of praying.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>When they get back home, they may speak about the meeting in a critical way.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>In the meeting they were dumb, but at home they are very talkative.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>These brothers definitely are not spiritual.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>However, in their own estimation they may be the most spiritual brothers in the church.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Whether or not we are spiritual is tested by whether or not we speak in the meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Speaking in the meetings will make you spiritual.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Suppose these three brothers come to the meeting and lay aside their opinions.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>One says, "Lord Jesus, I love You."</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Simply by saying this much we all become spiritual.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>It means a great deal to utter something in the meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Hence, we all must learn to speak in the meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Do not be dumb.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>If you are dumb, it means that you worship a God who does not speak.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Our God is the bubbling God, the speaking God, the One who speaks constantly.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Whenever you speak concerning the Lord, you immediately release your spirit and increase your spiritual capacity.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The best way for the sisters to conquer their temper is to utter thanks and praise to the Lord in the meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>But if the sisters are always silent in the meetings, they will find it easy to argue with their husbands at home after the meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>If their husbands speak in the meetings, that will make them angry.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>But if the sisters speak in the meetings, they will be stirred up in their spirit and their temper will disappear.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>To speak in the meetings is not an insignificant matter.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>By speaking we make the Body very practical.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>As a member of the Body, are you silent or bubbling?</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Are you one who is praising, shouting, and calling on the name of the Lord?</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>If we all are like this, our meetings will be uplifted to the heavens.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The most spiritual meeting is the meeting in which everyone speaks.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>In such a meeting everyone is nourished and edified.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>However, when we are silent, we easily fall into our mind and begin to criticize others.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Then it is easy to be in the self.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>When you are critical and in the self, you first kill yourself, then others, and then the meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Unsatisfied with this, you will go home and kill either your wife, husband, or roommate.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Because certain brothers and sisters were silent in the meeting, the dumb idol got into them, and after the meeting they killed their wife or husband.</S>
