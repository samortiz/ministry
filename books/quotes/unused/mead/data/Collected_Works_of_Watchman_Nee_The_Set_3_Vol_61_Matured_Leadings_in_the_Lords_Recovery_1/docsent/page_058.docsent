   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Marriage</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The second matter is marriage.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Before speaking about this, let me relate some facts to you.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Marriage is a very important matter.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>In looking back over the past thirty years, I realize that marriage has brought about greater changes to young people than travel.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Before you are married, your parents treat you as a child; you do not have many responsibilities, and you do not have to take care of a family.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Many Christians enter marriage without a proper concept and a readiness for responsibility.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>As a result, they fail in their Christian life.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Marriage and family are the beginning and source of God's blessing.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>At the same time, you have to remember that they are also the beginning and source of looseness.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>When a man is single, it is easy for him to serve the Lord zealously, but once he is married, he enters a new world.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Changes begin to come, and he begins to relax.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Marriage is a blessing from God; it is also the beginning of human happiness.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>At the same time, you have to remember that marriage is also the beginning of relaxation for many people.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>For this reason, you have to have the proper attitude before and after marriage.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>You should have only one aim for getting married to serve together with your spouse, which is always better than serving alone.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>In looking for the right person to marry, the first condition is that you both have to like each other, and your dispositions should match.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Each should be able to bear the other's weaknesses and shortcomings.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>You should not be distracted by other factors before you are married.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Pay attention to whether or not you can coordinate together in spiritual service.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Second, after you are married, you always experience a psychological change.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>This change is many times greater than the change that accompanies travel.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Once you are married, there is a pit right next to your house; you have to prepare for days of danger.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>During the first two or three months, do your best to control your mind; do not allow it to become loose.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>After the first two or three months, the danger is less acute.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>You must always maintain your balance psychologically.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>You have to learn to control yourself in your psychology.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Third, never despise your spouse before the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Many brothers and sisters discover after they are married that some characteristics of their spouse are intolerable; they despise these characteristics.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>At such times, you have to learn to worship God.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Do not become agitated in your mind.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Always remember that God has given you a "match," not a "sweetheart."</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>You have to learn to serve in coordination with your spouse, and not nit-pick or rebuke.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Occupation</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The third frequent cause of failure among young people is their choice of occupation.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>When a young person begins a career, his first month's salary must be treated with great care.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>When the first month's salary falls into your hand, whatever its amount, you sense power rising within your mind.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>There is nothing in this world which cannot be bought with money.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Some can even buy the human soul with money.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Once you have money, there will be many things you want to buy.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>This is a great, psychological change and a temptation for dissipation.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Therefore, I exhort you to learn to guard against the power of money.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>You should be conscious only of the power of the Christian life.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Always remember that we live on this earth for the gospel, for coordination with other brothers and sisters, and for serving the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>OUR RELATIONSHIP WITH</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>MATERIAL GOODS AND MONEY</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>When these three things occur, many people become loose and dissipated.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Actually, all three have to do with money and material possessions.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>In travel, one is always tempted to buy special things.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>After marriage, money is a means of pursuing a couple's happiness.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>When a man does not have a job, he is careful about the money he receives from his parents, but once he starts earning his own money, he begins to act according to his own preferences and forgets the vow he made before the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Man always seeks to exchange material things for his own and others' happiness.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>He is always inclined to act according to what pleases his heart.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>As a result, the more he acquires, the less he is satisfied.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>His interest and concern will be sucked into the material things.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Month after month, he will plan more purchases.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>With these three things, the first few months are the most dangerous period.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>If you do not handle these changes properly, you will fail miserably.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>THE RESPONSIBILITY OF THE OVERSEERS</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>The elders and the older brothers in the church bear a great responsibility over these young brothers and sisters.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>You have to change their attitude toward money.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Every time they reach a turning point, you have to remind them.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>The fathers and the co-workers in the church are the overseers.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>The work of the overseers is to exercise oversight.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>This means they have to perch on high to observe how others act.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Before anything happens to a person, you have to see clearly, accurately, adequately, and far-sightedly.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>You have to anticipate the changes that will happen to a young person and intercede for him, exhort him, and teach him ahead of time.</S>
