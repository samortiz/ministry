   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>5 Not Giving Place to the Devil</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In Ephesians 4:27 Paul says, "Neither give place to the Devil."</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>This immediately follows Paul's word, "Be angry, and do not sin; do not let the sun go down on your indignation" v. 26 . According to the context, to continue in anger is to give place to the Devil.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In nothing should we give any place to him.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>If we hold on to our anger, we are actually welcoming the Devil.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>But if we relinquish our anger, we close the door to the Devil and give him no place.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>6 Not Taken Advantage Of by Satan, Not Ignorant of His Devices</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>In 2 Corinthians 2:11 Paul says, "That we may not be taken advantage of by Satan, for we are not ignorant of his thoughts."</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>This verse discloses that the evil one, Satan, is behind the scenes in everything and works in everything.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The Greek word translated "thoughts" here means plans, plots, devices, schemes, designs, wiles, intentions, purposes.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Even in the church life Satan may be behind the scenes.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>As the context indicates, even a matter such as forgiving a brother may involve not only the church but also the devices of Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Even behind a matter such as this, Satan may be crouching, looking for a way to execute his evil plans and devour the weak ones.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Therefore, we need to be aware of the subtlety of the enemy.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Satan is subtle in taking advantage of the believers.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>He often comes to us through someone else.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>When Satan came to Eve, he came in a serpent.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>When he came to the Lord Jesus in Matthew 16 he came through Peter.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>However, the Lord was on the alert and realized that Satan was right in front of him.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>For this reason the Lord said to Peter, "Get behind Me, Satan!" v. 23 . Just as Satan came to the Lord Jesus through Peter, Satan may come to us through a certain person.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Therefore, we need to be on the alert and know the devices of the Devil.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>7 Guarded by the Faithful Lord from the Evil One</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The believers can overcome Satan because they are guarded by the faithful Lord from the evil one.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>In 2 Thessalonians 3:3 Paul says, "The Lord is faithful, who will establish you and guard you from the evil one."</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>We are guarded by eternal encouragement and good hope 2 Thes 2:16-17 .</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Only the eternal life can guard us from the evil one.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The whole world lies in the evil one 1 John 5:19 , but the divine life with which we have been born of God keeps and guards us from him 1 John 5:18, 4; 3:9 .</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>We have a part within us that has been regenerated, born of God.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>That part, which is actually the Lord Himself, always guards us from the evil one.</S>
