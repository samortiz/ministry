   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE RECOVERY OF THE INNER LIFE</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In addition, there was the recovery of the inner life.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Madame Guyon, Father Fenelon, and others brought in a recovery of the spiritual condition.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>These ones are now generally called the mystics.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>They practiced denying their self, joining themselves with God to oppose their self, giving no excuse to the self, and not asking God to spare His hand on them.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In every age we can find followers of their practice.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>In addition to these, there were also the Pietists and the Quietists.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>THE RAISING UP OF THE PURITANS</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Later, the Puritans were raised up.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Among them, some from Holland and England migrated separately to America.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The Mayflower was one of the ships that carried these Puritan immigrants to the new land.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>THE RECOVERY OF THE BRETHREN The Heavenly Calling of the Church</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>In the last century God began to have a special recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>First, He recovered the heavenly calling of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The church is like the Israelites in the Old Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>It should not look to earthly blessings at any time.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The church is a group of people who have been called by heaven.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>It is not their aim to reform society.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>God's people are those who take the heavenly way on earth.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>They have given up all hope for the world and society.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>To them, the world is passing away, and everything therein will be judged.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The church's view is different from that of the world.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>What the church expects is heaven, not world reforms.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>These words are familiar to us today, and we may not feel the power behind these words.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>But at the beginning, this matter was a tremendous recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The Oneness of the Church</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Second, the Brethren recovered the oneness of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>They saw the oneness of the Body of Christ and realized that the church is in a state of ruin today.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Expositors such as J. N. Darby and F. W. Grant all agreed that the church is in a state of ruin today.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>THE RAISING UP OF JOHN WESLEY</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>THE RECOVERY OF SANCTIFICATION BY FAITH</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>These recoveries occurred among the Brethren.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>In addition to them, John Wesley was raised up.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>He recovered the truth concerning sanctification.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>A man is not only justified by faith, but is also sanctified by faith.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Wesley was indeed a servant of God, a dear brother, and a man greatly used by God.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>He bore the right testimony, but quoted the wrong verses to prove his message.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Although his quotations were wrong, the doctrine he preached was right.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>For example, he quoted 1 John 1:7 as a reference to sanctification.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>For this reason, some rejected his teachings altogether.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>This is to go too far.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>It is possible for a man to quote the wrong verses.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>However, if he is the right person and he preaches the right doctrine, the mistake is not fatal even if his quotations are wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>However, if the quotations are correct but the person is wrong, the problem is much more serious.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>We would rather see the person right and the quotations wrong than see the quotations right and the person wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Although he quoted the wrong verses, God was still able to cause men to be sanctified.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>THE RECOVERY OF SANCTIFICATION BY CONSECRATION</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Then there was Robert Pearsall Smith, a porcelain merchant.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>He was the husband of Mrs. Hannah Whitall Smith, the writer of the book The Christian's Secret of a Happy Life.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>At that time men were not very clear concerning the doctrine of sanctification.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>He preached that man is not just sanctified by faith, but by consecration as well.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Sanctification does not come merely by faith, but by consecration.</S>
