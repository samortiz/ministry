   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>D. A Purchased Slave of a Priest and Those Who Were Born in a Priest's House Being Permitted to Eat the Holy Things</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>"But if a priest buys a slave, the purchase of his money, that one may eat of it; and those who are born in his house may eat of his food" v. 11 . This signifies that the ones purchased by Christ with His precious blood and born of God in His house may enjoy Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Since we have been purchased by Christ and since we were born of God in His house, we are surely qualified to enjoy Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>E. The Priest's Daughter Who Married an Outsider Was Forbidden to Eat the Heave Offering of the Holy Things, but If She Became a Widow or Was Divorced, and Had No Child and Returned to Her Father's House, She Was Permitted to Eat Her Father's Food</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>"And if the priest's daughter marries an outsider, she shall not eat of the heave offering of the holy things.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>But if the priest's daughter becomes a widow or is divorced, and has no child, and she returns to her father's house as in her youth, she may eat of her father's food; but no outsider shall eat of it" vv.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>12-13 .</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>This signifies that a believer who is attracted away by an outsider may not enjoy the ascended Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>But if he cuts off his relationship with the outsider without leaving any connection and returns to the church, he may still enjoy Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>For one to be a daughter of the priest means that such a one belongs to the priesthood.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>If we who belong to the priesthood are attracted by an outsider, we are finished with the priesthood and with the enjoyment of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>However, if that attraction dies and we return to the church life, then our enjoyment of Christ will be recovered.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>F. A Man Who Ate a Holy Thing through Ignorance Adding One-fifth More to It and Giving It to the Priest</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>"If a man eats a holy thing through ignorance, then he shall add one-fifth more to it and give the holy thing to the priest" v. 14 . Here we see that if someone ate a holy thing without knowing that it was holy, he was required to make restitution by adding one-fifth more to the holy thing and giving it to the priest.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>This signifies that our careless enjoyment of Christ should not be considered a real enjoyment of Christ but should be dealt with before God.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>It is possible for us to be self-deceived regarding the enjoyment of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>We may think that we are enjoying Christ, when that enjoyment is not the real enjoyment of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Such a false enjoyment of Christ needs to be dealt with before God.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>II.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>THE ACCEPTABLE WAY FOR THE OFFERING OF A VOW AND A FREEWILL OFFERING</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>We have briefly covered the need of holiness for the enjoyment of Christ as the holy things.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Now we shall consider from verses 18 through 33 the acceptable way for the offering of a vow and a freewill offering.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>A vow is much stronger than a freewill offering.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Once made, a vow is something very stable, and it must be kept.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>A freewill offering, on the contrary, is a matter of our free will.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>We may make a freewill offering and then not follow through with it or even forget it.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>We may have a freewill offering toward God and later want to change it.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>This refers to a kind of consecration that is not stable or sure.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>A vow, however, is like an oath made with God that cannot be retracted.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>It must be kept.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>A saint may consecrate himself to God of his free will, but after a period of time, he may forget about it.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>But a vow cannot be cancelled.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Hence, the offerings for a vow are stronger than those for a freewill offering.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Furthermore, a certain offering may be accepted as a freewill offering but not as an offering for a vow.</S>
