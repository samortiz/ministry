   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>God allowed Satan to touch man.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>This is God's wisdom.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>God even permitted Satan to enter into man, but not to go so far as to enter man's spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Satan was permitted to deaden and darken man's spirit, but never to enter into it.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>However, Satan came into man's physical body.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>This is why such chapters as Romans 7 tell us that sin and all of its lusts are in the members of our body.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Sin and its lusts are in the members of our body because our body is the dwelling place of Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Satan dwells in our physical body as sin personified Rom 7:17, 20 .</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Only a living person can dwell somewhere.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>From his base in our physical body, Satan wants to take over our soul, to place our soul under his absolute control.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>But, hallelujah! not one verse in the whole Bible tells us that our spirit is under Satan's control.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>When you preach the gospel to people, you should touch their spirit; you should touch their conscience which is the main part of their spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>In your preaching, never argue with people.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The more you argue, the more they will have something to say in response and the more their minds will be stirred up.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>When you argue with people, you strengthen their souls.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>It is impossible to convince sinners by arguing with them.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Rather, by the grace and power of God, touch their conscience.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Their conscience is a part of their spirit, and when you touch their conscience, their spirit will be moved.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>I have seen many cases of people who continued to argue with God in their mind, but condemned themselves in their conscience.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>In their mind they argued with God, but in their spirit they repented before God.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Whenever you are trying to help other people, never touch their mentality, because the human mind is the stronghold of Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The generals in an army know not to strike the enemy's strong point in a battle.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>They always attack the weak point.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Do not touch a person's mind.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>If you touch his mind, the whole kingdom of Satan will rise up against you.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Suppose a husband and wife begin to argue and to exchange bitter words.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Then afterward, the wife comes to you for help in solving their problems.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>It is not easy to listen to a sister talk about her husband without being stirred up in your mind or trapped by Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>However, if you know the subtlety of the enemy, you would not approach the brother by touching his mind.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>You would not fight against the stronghold.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>You would take another way.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>You would turn to another side and touch a weak point.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Don't touch the problem with his wife.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Don't talk about his wife at all, because the wife problem is fully occupying his mind and filling his thoughts.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The way to deal with him is to touch his spirit, to touch his conscience.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Don't talk about his wife; talk about loving the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>His mind is filled with thoughts of his wife, and this is a very touchy, explosive issue.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Talk to him about the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Touch his spirit and his conscience.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>After ten minutes he may he able to pray.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The more you pray with him, the more his spirit will be touched.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Eventually, the Lord will have a way to come out of his spirit and spread into his mind.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Then he will repent and confess, even weeping before the Lord about the way he has dealt with his wife.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Satan has come into our body, and from our body he exercises his control over our soul.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Thus, Satan works from the outside in. The Lord works in the opposite direction, from the inside out.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>One day He came into our spirit, the center, the hub, of our being, making it His dwelling place Rom 8:16; 2 Tim 4:22; 1 Cor 6:17 .</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>From this dwelling place in our spirit, He works outward toward the soul.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Satan works in our body toward our soul; the Lord works from our spirit toward our soul.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Now we can see that all three parties God, man, and Satan are in man.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>In the garden of Eden, Adam had two choices facing him: the tree of life and the tree of the knowledge of good and evil.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>In the church today, the tree of knowledge is in our body and the tree of life is in our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>The two sources are now within us.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>We must realize that we are complicated persons, having three parties within us.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>We know that we have three parts to our being the spirit, the soul, and the body.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Do you realize that in your body, that is, your flesh, Satan has made his abode?</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>And do you realize that in your spirit the Lord has made His dwelling place?</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Between the body and the spirit is the soul, the self.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>You yourself dwell in your soul.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Therefore, Satan dwells in your body, the Lord Jesus dwells in your spirit, and you dwell in your soul.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>This makes for a very complicated situation!</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Before you were saved you were not that complicated; you were rather simple because you continually went along with Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>However, a controversy began the day you believed in the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Now there is a constant struggle because within you there are three dwellers: Satan in your body, Christ in your spirit, and you yourself in your soul.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Perhaps even today you have had some difficulty because of this complicated situation within you.</S>
