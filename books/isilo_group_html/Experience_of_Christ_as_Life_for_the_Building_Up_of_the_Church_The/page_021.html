Chapter one tells us that Christ is the power of God and the wisdom of God (vv. 24, 30). Wisdom is for planning, purposing; power is for carrying out, accomplishing, what is planned and purposed. A rich person's capital is his power. But even if you are rich, powerful, you still need the wisdom to carry out things with your riches. If a car does not have gasoline, it does not have the power. But if a person does not have the adequate wisdom, he cannot drive the car. Both power and wisdom are needed to drive the car. In God's economy Christ is God's power and wisdom.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>Christ as Our Righteousness,<br>Sanctification, and Redemption</H2><P>In the wisdom of God, three main things are included: righteousness, sanctification, and redemption (v. 30). Righteousness is for our past. Our past was a mess, but Christ is our righteousness for our past. Sanctification is for our present. We have to be holy, sanctified, but not by ourselves. Christ Himself is our sanctification. He is our sanctifying life for the present. In the future He will be our redemption for the redemption of our body.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>The Lord of Glory, the Depths of God,<br>and the Mind of Christ</H2><P>In chapter two there are many wonderful items. Here Paul speaks of the mystery of God and of the things God foreordained and prepared for us which no eye has ever seen, no ear has ever heard, and which have not come up in man's heart (v. 9). But God has revealed them to us through the Spirit, and they have been graciously given to us by God (vv. 10-12). God has foreordained, prepared, revealed, and given Christ to us as the Lord of glory (vv. 7-8) and the depths of God (v. 10). First Corinthians 2 also says that we have the mind of Christ (v. 16).</P><P>I hope that we would remember five items in chapter one: power, wisdom, righteousness, sanctification, and redemption. All of these items are Christ Himself given to us as our divine portion from God. In chapter two we have to remember three things: the Lord of glory (v. 8), the depths of God, and the mind of Christ.</P><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_020.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_022.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>The Experience of Christ as Life for the Building Up of the Church &nbsp; pg 21</div><br></body></html>
