   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>B. Pleasing Our Neighbor unto Building</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>as Christ Did</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Let each of us please his neighbor unto what is good for building.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>For even Christ did not please Himself, but as it is written, The reproaches of those who reproached You fell upon Me vv.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>2-3 .</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>We have to please others that they may be built up in the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>We do not need to please others for any purpose other than the purpose that they be built up in the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>For the sake of this purpose, we must pay the price that we may please others.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Christ did not please Himself; He pleased the Father by bearing the reproaches which should have fallen upon the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Likewise, we should not please ourselves; we should please others by bearing their weaknesses that they may be built up in the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>C. Being Likeminded One to Another</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>according to Christ</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>For whatever was written before was written for our instruction, that through endurance and the encouragement of the Scriptures we may have hope.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Now the God of endurance and encouragement grant you to be likeminded one toward another according to Christ Jesus vv.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>4-5 .</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Whatever was written refers to what is quoted in verse 3 concerning Christ and is for the instruction that produces endurance and encouragement with hope.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The record concerning Christ in the Scriptures surely is full of instruction.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>If we receive its instruction, we will be supplied with the endurance and encouragement of Christ that we may have hope.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>In receiving the believers, we need this kind of endurance and encouragement with hope.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>In receiving the believers, we need to endure the weaknesses of the ones whom we are going to receive.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>We also need to be encouraged with the hope that they may improve and be empowered in faith by the Lord s grace.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>In receiving the weaker believers, we have to realize that our God is the God of endurance and encouragement who can cause us to endure others weaknesses and to be encouraged with what He can do in others by His grace.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>If we are so encouraged by such a God, we shall be likeminded one toward another according to Christ Jesus, not according to anything else.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Since there is only one Christ Jesus, if we are all according to Christ, we shall be likeminded with one another.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>However, if our mind is in accordance with teachings, concepts, gifts, religious practices, or any other such thing, we shall be divided.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The only way to be likeminded toward one another is to be according to Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>To receive the believers according to our teachings, concepts, gifts, or religious practices does not need any endurance or encouragement with hope.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>But to receive all believers according to Christ does need an amount of endurance and encouragement with hope which the very God of endurance and encouragement will supply us if we care for the keeping of unity and the building up of the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>D. Glorifying God with One Accord</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>and with One Mouth</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Verse 6 says, That you may with one accord and with one mouth glorify the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Some versions say with one mind and with one mouth.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>However, in Greek the word is accord, not mind.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Nevertheless, the word accord actually means one mind.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>We all need to be likeminded.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>When we are likeminded, we shall be in one accord and shall have one mouth, meaning that we shall have the same concept and the same way of speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>There will be many believers, but only one mouth.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Whenever we have the same mind and are of one accord, we all say the same thing.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Therefore, with one mind and one mouth we glorify God and the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>In chapter 9:5 it says that Christ is the over-all and ever-blessed God.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>That is according to His divinity.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>But here it speaks of the God of our Lord Jesus Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>This is according to His humanity.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>According to His divinity, He is the over-all and ever-blessed God; according to His humanity, God is His God.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>If, in receiving the believers, we behave ourselves according to the Lord Jesus, we shall glorify God as He does.</S>
