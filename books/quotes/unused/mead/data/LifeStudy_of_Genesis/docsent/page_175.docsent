   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>To Believe in God</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Although the Bible says little about Enoch, what is revealed in Genesis, Hebrews, and Jude is sufficient for us to appreciate his life.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Hebrews 11:5-6 shows us that before Enoch was taken by God, he believed in God.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>This indicates that Enoch not only walked with God, but that he also believed God.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>"By faith Enoch was translated so that he should not see death" Heb 11:5 .</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>What does faith mean?</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>According to the context of Hebrews 11, faith means that we believe that God is Heb 11:6 .</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>This means that we believe that there is a God.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>God exists, God is real, God is living, God is present, and God is God.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>We all must believe this.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>We hope that no one reading this message has any difficulty with this matter.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>We do believe that God exists and that He is living today.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Hebrews 11:6 says that if you believe in God, you will also believe that He is a rewarder.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>He not only exists, He is a rewarder.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Why does God reward people?</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Because He is anxious to have man living for and fulfilling His purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>We should not only believe that God exists, but also that He rewards all those who seek Him out.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Although the King James Version says "diligently seek Him," the Greek text actually means "seek Him out."</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>God is in this universe, and no man can see Him, but we must seek Him out.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Do you believe that there is a God, that God exists?</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Then what should you do?</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>You must seek Him out.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Enoch did this.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>He believed that there was a God and he sought God out by believing that God was a rewarder.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>It must have been his believing in God and his seeking God that motivated him to walk with God.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Enoch was God's seeker, and God was his rewarder.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>He sought God and walked with God, and God rewarded him.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>What reward did God give Enoch?</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>God gave him the highest degree of life escape from death.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>"Enoch was translated that he should not see death."</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>What a reward that was!</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>For quite a number of years I have told the Lord, "Lord, I don't want to see death.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Lord, come quickly.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Keep me until the time of Your coming.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>I do not want to see death, I want to see You."</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>This desire has caused me and still causes me to seek the Lord out.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>I am not boasting, but speaking the truth I must say that I am a seeker of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Are you not one of His seekers?</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>By His mercy and grace we are all seekers of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>When I first began, in this country, to use the term "seeking saints" in my fellowship and prayer, many who heard this term were surprised by it.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Later I shortened this term to "seekers," the Lord's seekers.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Although some of the saints hesitated in adopting this term, today it is used in all the churches.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Many would pray to the Lord, saying, "Lord, You have so many seekers in Orange County.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>O Lord, capture all Your dear seekers."</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The Lord is a rewarder, and we need to be His seekers.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Enoch believed this and practiced it.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>He believed that God was and that He would be a rewarder to him if he sought Him out.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Enoch did seek the Lord and obtained the reward.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Jude speaks about the environment in which Enoch lived, using the word "ungodly" four times in describing the people and the deeds of Enoch's generation Jude 15 .</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Nevertheless, Jude records one of Enoch's prophecies in which Enoch used a wonderful word saints.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>"And Enoch, the seventh from Adam, prophesied also of these, saying: Behold, the Lord came with myriads of His saints" Jude 14 .</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Enoch did not say that the Lord is coming with myriads of sinners or ungodly ones or even believers or saved ones.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Enoch said that the Lord was coming with myriads of His saints.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>As the record of Jude reveals, Enoch prophesied what was within him.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>He realized that his whole generation was ungodly.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>The neighborhood, the people, and everything else were ungodly.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>However, he was godly and holy, leading a holy life.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Otherwise, he could not have prophesied of the Lord's coming with myriads of His saints to execute His judgment upon the ungodly.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>The saints mentioned in Jude 14 are versus the ungodly in verse 15.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Although the generation, age, society, environment, people, and everything were ungodly, Enoch still lived a godly and holy life.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Among ungodly people in an ungodly situation, he lived a godly life.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>He did this in faith, believing that God was and that He was a rewarder.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Enoch walked with God in faith.</S>
