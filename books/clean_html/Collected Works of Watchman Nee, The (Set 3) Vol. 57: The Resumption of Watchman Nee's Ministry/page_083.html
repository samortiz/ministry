<h2 class="head1">FELLOWSHIP CONCERNING BROTHER NEE'S<br />OPERATION OF HIS PHARMACEUTICAL BUSINESS</h2><p>I think I have to say a few words to the brothers who are holding jobs. Among those with whom I have been having fellowship, the matter I am about to share has been quite clear. My personal affairs should also be handed over to the brothers and sisters and be left to their arrangement. It is a long story, and there is no need for me to go into the details of it. But there are certain things that I need to say. At the beginning I told the brothers that if one day I, Watchman Nee, had to go into business, it would be to the shame of all the brothers who are in business. When the co-workers at times tried to go into business together, I always did my best to stop them. As a result, I began to hear words behind my back, saying that I would only allow myself to go into business, but would not allow others to do the same. At that time I said to others, "It is enough that I have gone into it already. There is no need for all of you to do the same.'' Later, I allowed three other co-workers to be involved with it.</p><p>From 1931 to 1937 the number of workers among us increased. At that time many said that they lived by faith. However, they engaged themselves in many "methods'' and "schemes.'' This disgusted me. I told two or three of the so-called co-workers, who are no longer with us, that they are "living by faith,'' but that I am not living by that kind of faith. What I once said to the brothers in business, the co-workers, and the ones who were so-called living by faith, I say again today; I will not change what I have said. I begged these three groups of people not to put up their signboard of living by faith. I was hoping that there could be a fourth kind of people, those who can arrange work for the brothers and sisters, and who can help some brothers to live with a peaceful conscience. Although I dared not hope to give them much money, at least I hoped that I could help them get by in their living and to live with a peaceful conscience.</p><p>At the beginning ninety-eight percent of the pharmaceutical enterprise was in my hand, or in the hands of those who had put their trust in me. Later, this became eighty percent. After some time I was left with only sixty-five percent. After the war some requested to withdraw, and my part increased again to become eighty percent.</p><p>I went into the business at the beginning with one hope. My situation today is like a widow with a few children, who hopes to raise them up, but who fails. Eventually the widow remarries, and after a while the children are all gone. By that time she cannot tell why she had remarried in the first place. My hope today is the same as it was then. In between, however, something happened, and I cannot tell you why there was a "remarriage.''</p><p>For over a year I have not involved myself in many things. When Brother Lee came to Foochow, the fellowship was recovered. But I must say again: My feeling today is the same as it was in 1939. Thank the Lord that in these days Brother Witness has the same feelings that I do. We feel that there are many books we need to write and many hymns we need to put out. We hope to prepare a new translation of the New Testament. Yet these things are left undone. Some young co-workers wanted me to resume some responsibilities, but time does not allow me to do the same things any longer. If I could return to 1939, it might be possible to have another beginning.</p><p>Because of the four turmoils and the four incidents of unfaithfulness, money that would have been enough to purchase two or three meeting halls has slipped out of our hands. Last year, when money was in our hands, it was worth over four hundred thousand dollars. Now, other than the seventy-three thousand dollars that we owe to others, there is still over two hundred thousand dollars in our hands. The money I have in my hands is trust funds; it is what others have entrusted to me. I want to tell you that I am not running away from anything. From now on this trust fund will be entirely in your hands. Twenty or thirty percent of the shares is in my hands...I cannot do it now, and perhaps you will not allow me to do it now either....What we personally feel in these days is a small thing. Nevertheless, my personal feeling is that, as I have been telling you these days, there must be some to come forward to offer.</p><p>Concerning the brothers who are in business, forgive me for saying a few uncomplimentary words: You have taken too much upon yourselves. It seems as if somebody is telling me something. Actually, no one is telling me anything....One sister, Amy Carmichael, who went to India to preach the gospel, was much helped financially by some others....Everyone is needed.</p><p>I have to say a few words for my co-workers. I know how Brother Lee spent his days in Chefoo. Some co-workers' children could not go to school and were starving at home. Among us we have five widows who are without any care. Even today Brother Tseng Li-san's child is still unable to graduate from elementary school. Today, among us, the number of widows left behind by former co-workers is not five, but twenty. While the husbands of these sisters were alive, they gave up their positions and their jobs. After they died, they were all forgotten. My co-workers, I cannot say that I am good. I admit that I have my shortcomings. We come short in the work, in offering, and in the Lord's grace. But I ask myself, "Why is it that among my co-workers, other than Brother Li-san who was killed by the Communists, ninety percent have died of tuberculosis?'' On the one hand, I have to say that we have not been responsible enough. On the other hand, I thought that it was I who persuaded them to leave their jobs. You may say that you trust in God and that God can take care of them. But when I saw them one by one passing away and dying, I was angry. I may have done many wrong things, but God knows why I have done them....[Editor's note: At this point, Brother Nee wept, and everyone wept bitterly.] You may say that I have not been frugal enough. But you do not know my position. If this matter is not settled, many other things cannot be settled.</p><p>I do not count on receiving my reward before God. I admit that I had my mistakes. I looked for a way. I told others that CBC [the pharmaceutical enterprise] is a business corporation. I was hoping that I could render some help to those brothers and sisters in need. But I have no liberty in this matter. There should not have been the need for me to say all these things. But since you have handed yourselves over, I also should hand myself over.</p><p>We spent fifty thousand dollars on Kuling, another forty thousand dollars on Foochow. For the purchase of the land in Shanghai, we spent four hundred seventy thousand dollars. We have to give everything we have for the gospel. If possible, in the future, please do not force me to do the same thing as I have done. If my co-workers have to do the same thing again, the responsibility falls on the shoulders of you brothers who are in business.</p>
