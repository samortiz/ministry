   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The Door of the Sheep</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Verses 1-4 and 9 show us that Christ is the door of the sheep.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>1 For the Old Testament Saints</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>to Go into the Law as the Custody</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Christ was the door of the sheep for the Old Testament saints to go into the law as the custody v. 9a . The fold in John 10 signifies the law and also Judaism, the religion of the law.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Before Christ came, God put His chosen people under the custody of the law.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>God did this through Christ as the door by which God s elect entered into the custody of the law.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The law was the fold where God s people as the sheep were kept and protected temporarily until the pasture, the permanent place for the sheep, was ready.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>2 For the Saints under the Law</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>to Go out of the Custody</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Christ is the door not only for God s elect to enter into the custody of the law, as did Moses, David, Isaiah, and Jeremiah in the Old Testament time, before Christ came, but also for God s chosen people, such as Peter, John, James, and Paul, to come out of the fold of the law now that Christ has come.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Thus, the Lord Jesus indicated in verse 9 that He is the door not only through which God s elect may go in but also through which God s chosen people may go out.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>God no longer intends to keep His chosen people in the fold of the law.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>He wants them to come out of the law into Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Now, during the New Testament age, God intends to bring His people out of the law through Christ as the door.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Christ has come, and the pasture is ready.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>There is no need for the sheep to be confined any longer in the custody of the Judaic law.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>They must be released from the fold of the law to enjoy the riches of the pasture.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Christ is the door through which His believers may come out of any kind of fold and come into Him as the pasture.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>As the door of the sheep to leave the fold, Christ is our freedom from legality.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>In Christ we have the freedom to go in and to go out.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>This means that we do not have any legality.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The freedom we enjoy is Christ Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Because Christ is our freedom, our door, we are not bound by any legality.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>This, of course, does not mean that we are free to indulge the flesh Gal 5:13 .</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>In Christ we are not in bondage to legality.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Because Christ is our door, we have true freedom.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>c.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The Pasture of the Sheep</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Today we may experience and enjoy Christ not only as the Shepherd and the door but also as the pasture.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>For Christ to be the Shepherd of the sheep, He has to be the door for the release of many sheep of God s flock in Judaism.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Now after setting them free from the Judaistic fold as the door of the sheep, Christ feeds them with Himself as the rich pasture of the sheep.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>John 10:9 says, I am the door; if anyone enters through Me, he shall be saved and shall go in and go out and shall find pasture.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The pasture here signifies Christ as the feeding place for the sheep.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>When the pasture is not available, the sheep must be kept in the fold temporarily.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>When the pasture is ready, there is no further need for the sheep to remain in the fold.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The sheep should come out of the fold and remain in the pasture permanently.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>To be kept in the fold is transitional and temporary.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>To be in the pasture enjoying its riches is final and permanent.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Before Christ came, the law was a ward, and being under the law was transitional.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Now that Christ has come, all God s chosen people must come out of the law and come into Him to enjoy Him as their pasture Gal 3:23-25; 4:3-5 .</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>This should be final and permanent.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The Lord Jesus said that He came that we may have life and have it abundantly.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>This means that, because Christ is the pasture of the sheep, He came to impart Himself as life into the sheep.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>As long as the sheep stay in the pasture, they will have the supply of life abundantly.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>By feeding on the pasture, the sheep experience and enjoy the pasture as their abundant life supply.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>In order to be the pasture of life to the sheep, Christ had to die for them.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Hence, He laid down His life for His sheep, dying for the sheep in order to minister Himself as life to them and thereby be the pasture to them.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Today our pasture is the resurrected Christ as the life-giving Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>In our daily life we should have the definite realization that we are in the pasture experiencing and enjoying Christ as the rich supply of life.</S>
