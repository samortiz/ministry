   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>All the Churches through the Centuries</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Needing to Imitate All the Churches</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Unveiled in the New Testament</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>All the churches through the centuries should imitate all the churches unveiled in the New Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Today there are those who are promoting differences among the churches, but the Bible indicates that the churches should imitate one another.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>To imitate is to follow something that is better than what we are, what we have, and what we do.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>All the churches differ in degree in the positive things related to the practices in the church.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Thus, they should imitate what is better in any church, that they may have some improvement and some advancement in the interest of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>It is not a matter of legality; it is a matter of the degree in the growth of life.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>A STRONG ENCOURAGEMENT</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>TO THE PRACTICE OF THE PROPER ONE ACCORD</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>All the above eight points are a strong encouragement to the practice of the proper one accord in the church for the keeping of the genuine oneness of the Body by all the saints and all the churches universally.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>We must consider that all these points came sovereignly into existence that we may be one in all things related to God, Christ, and the church, that we may spontaneously be exercised to practice the one accord according to all the attributes of oneness in the divine and spiritual interests.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>May the Lord bless us and grace us to practice the one accord according to these attributes of oneness.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>A DISCOURAGEMENT TO THE ONE ACCORD,</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>ENCOURAGING AND PROMOTING DIVISION</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Any teaching contrary to the above eight points, such as the teaching of the absolute autonomy of the local churches, is a discouragement to the one accord in the church and encourages and promotes division among the saints and among the churches.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>All our teachings should be in the nature and with the intention to encourage and promote the practice of the one accord for the keeping of the oneness.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>We should do our best in any teaching to avoid any discouragement to such a practice, so that the churches in all the localities can be built up in peace, without any disturbance, frustration, and distraction.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>May the Lord have mercy on all of us that we may practice the one accord to be kept from causing any kind of division and to have His economy carried out in the building up of His Body in oneness.</S>
