<h2 class="head1">DEALING WITH OUR NATURAL DISPOSITION<br />
TO BECOME FLEXIBLE IN CARING FOR PEOPLE</h2>
<p>We must all be tested by the church life, by fruit-bearing, and by lamb-feeding because these are the three matters that kill our natural disposition. The church life is a killing, not of the good things but mostly of our disposition. Likewise, fruit-bearing and lamb-feeding are a killing. All these are killing &ldquo;knives&rdquo; for our disposition. Passing through these three tests causes us to become right, because after passing through them we become persons who have dealt with our natural disposition. Then we will be flexible. To care for little children requires much flexibility. Any mother who is not flexible should not expect to have good children. Her children will all be damaged by her inflexibility. To bear fruit among our in-laws, cousins, and schoolmates requires us to be flexible. We should not speak of inconvenience or say that we do not have time. Whether we have time depends on our desire. We may illustrate this by the need to answer correspondence. In the early years of my work, I would often apologize for not answering people sooner, telling them that I had been too busy. However, something within condemned me, saying, &ldquo;It is not because you were too busy; it is because you did not have the desire.&rdquo; Everyone is busy. Even a sister with no husband, children, job, or school can stay busy every day. She can tell people she does not have the time for this or that. This is absolutely due to our dispositional inflexibility.</p>
<p>If we are not flexible, we cannot bear fruit. In order to bear fruit, we need to be flexible, available at any time, and never claiming to be too busy. We should always have time to talk to people. If we wait until we have time to help people to be saved, we may wait forever. We have all been cheated in this regard. We have said, &ldquo;This week I am very busy; let me see how next week will be,&rdquo; but the next week we are busier and have even more things to do. Then the following week is worse, and we are never free. Being busy or available is a matter of our disposition. Therefore, we first need a thorough dealing with the Lord, and then we need to become available, flexible, and fully dealt with in our disposition.

<h2 class="head1">HAVING THE CONSCIOUSNESS OF THE BODY<br />
IN OUR SERVICE IN COORDINATION</h2>
<p>In our service to God, we must be brought by God to the point where we have the consciousness of the Body and do not serve individually but in coordination with the brothers and sisters. We must be brought to a point where the brothers&rsquo; move is our move, and our move is the brothers&rsquo; move. Regardless of the circumstance we are in, our feeling should always be that what the brothers are doing is no different from what we are doing. The two should be the same.</p>
<p>Not only so, whenever there is a problem in our coordination with the Body, we should sense it immediately. When our coordination with all the members is normal, we may not have much feeling that we are in coordination. This is similar to the coordination in our body. In a normal situation the members of our body do not have much feeling about each other&rsquo;s existence. However, when a certain member has a problem, then there is a consciousness. Therefore, if we sense the existence of a certain member, then that member must have a problem. When we are particularly conscious of our eyes, something must be wrong with our eyes.</p>
<h2 class="head1">LIFE ISSUING IN<br />
SPONTANEOUS COORDINATION</h2>
<p>We must realize that there are two kinds of coordination. One kind is the coordination involved in outward arrangements such as sweeping the floor, cleaning the chairs, and dusting the windows. This kind of coordination is not very deep. The other kind of coordination is a coordination that grows out of the life within and is spiritual. This coordination is deeper and more real. This kind of coordination requires that our natural being, the world, our disposition, and our flesh all be dealt with so that the Lord can grow out of us. When He grows out of you and me, we are spontaneously in coordination.</p>
<h2 class="head1">COORDINATION MAKING<br />
OUR SELF MANIFEST</h2>
<p>While learning to serve the Lord, many have had the experience that as soon as they were put in the coordination, their condition was exposed. When they were at home praying, reading the Word, or pursuing the Lord, they did not sense their own condition very much. When they went out by themselves to preach the gospel and distribute gospel tracts, they also were not very conscious of their condition. However, once they began to serve together with the saints, their self immediately became manifest, particularly in their opinions, because opinions are the best representative of a person&rsquo;s self.</p>
