   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>7.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In His Strong Speaking</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Finally, Christ appeared to Daniel in His strong speaking for judging people.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>His strong speaking is signified by the sound of His words being like the sound of a multitude v. 6e .</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The Christ whom Daniel saw was such a One.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>He is precious, valuable, complete, and perfect.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>As a man He is the very centrality and universality of God's move to carry out His economy.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>He is so precious, bright, shining, enlightening, and testing.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>As the Priest He is taking care of us, and as the King He is ruling over us.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>How wonderful He is!</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>It was not with his physical eyes that Daniel saw this vision of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Verse 7 says, "I, Daniel, alone saw the vision, for the men who were with me did not see the vision."</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Because the vision of Christ was spiritual, not physical, it was seen only by Daniel and not by those who relied on their physical sight.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Concerning seeing the vision of Christ, the physical view avails nothing.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>For this reason, in the eyes of the worldly people, Jesus is merely a human being.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>But under God's mercy and with a spiritual view, we may see how dear and precious Christ is.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>We all need to see the Christ Daniel saw.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>May we all see the vision of the excellent Christ in chapter ten of Daniel.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>C. The Evil Prince of the Kingdom of Persia</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Withstanding the Sent Angelic Messenger</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Following the vision concerning Christ as the precious One in God's move, we see something regarding the spiritual struggle in the air.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>According to verses 10 through 17, the evil prince of the kingdom of Persia withstood the sent angelic messenger, probably one of the chief princes, for twenty-one days.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Michael, one of the chief princes, came to help the sent angelic messenger, and the sent messenger remained there with the kings of Persia.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The evil prince of the kingdom of Persia must have been an evil spirit, a rebellious angel, who followed Satan in his rebellion against God and who was commissioned by Satan to help Persia.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>This evil spirit struggled against the sent angelic messenger for twenty-one days.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>This means that while Daniel was praying for all those days, a spiritual struggle was taking place in the air between two spirits, one belonging to Satan and the other belonging to God.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>They were fighting because the sent angelic messenger he might have been Gabriel had been sent by God in answer to Daniel's prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Michael came to help the sent angelic messenger.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Just as the archangel Michael fought in Jude 9, so he came in to fight here in Daniel.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The crucial point we need to see is that behind the scene a spiritual struggle, a struggle not seen with physical eyes, was taking place.</S>
