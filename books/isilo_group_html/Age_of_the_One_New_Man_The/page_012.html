TO PRODUCE THE NEXT GENERATION<br />
FOR THE LORD</h2>
<p>The co-workers should not lead the church themselves, nor should they replace the responsible brothers in the localities. If we know the Lord&rsquo;s way, we would do our best to transfer everything to the younger saints. We should help them and perfect them. Eventually, they will be better than we are. We may have the experience of running a school, but if we hold that experience in our hand, the school will eventually close down. If the responsibility for running the school is transferred to some younger adults, the school will flourish. Students are happy when they are taught by younger adults. The young adults, however, must learn from the experiences of the older saints. We must perfect the younger saints, pass everything we have on to them, and let them do everything.</p>
<p>The effectiveness of the co-workers&rsquo; work is related to perfecting the younger saints. The co-workers have been working for the Lord for many years. They should consider whether their work is effective. Whatever does not match the age will not be effective. For this reason we need to turn. If we turn, our work will be effective.</p>
<p>We should not merely hold on to old principles. These principles are not wrong, but holding on to these principles is not sufficient. There are many situations that need to be adjusted and overturned. For example, if the elders in a locality are eighty years old, there is a desperate need to perfect younger saints. In this situation the co-workers should recommend several younger saints and spend two to three months to perfect them so that they may progress. After a few more months these younger saints might become elders. The co-workers who do this know how to work, and they are for &ldquo;the perfecting of the saints&rdquo; (Eph. 4:12).</p>
<p>The co-workers should not hold things in their hands. For instance, the co-workers should not handle everything related to hospitality. Rather, they should hand over things related to hospitality to the local saints. The co-workers should always stand in the position of perfecting and helping others, not taking their place or replacing them. The handling of the details of the international conference held in Taipei was a great move in this direction. It is wonderful that the co-workers handed all the practical responsibilities to the younger saints. The co-workers were in the background; they only supported and guided the younger saints. This is the way for the co-workers to achieve something and to develop the function of the younger saints. A country that can bring everyone into function will be strong. Likewise, in the church we should let the younger saints develop their ability and function. If all the affairs in the church in Taipei are handled by a few elderly co-workers, the function of the younger saints in the church in Taipei will be wasted rather than developed.</p>
<p>If a locality does not have that many younger saints, those who are seventeen or eighteen years old can be brought into function. Some might feel that these ones are too young. However, whether they are young depends on the situation at the time. Suppose a grandfather and father in a family both pass away, and the eldest son is only seventeen years old. Although he is only seventeen years old, he must rise up to take care of things. If an uncle feels that the son is too young and takes care of everything for him, the uncle is replacing him, not helping him. If we do not know how to perfect the younger saints in the churches, we do not know how to work. As long as someone can be perfected in a locality, we should help him and let him function. After a period of time he will rise up.</p>
<p>While perfecting the younger saints to function in the churches, the co-workers can tell them what to pay attention to and give some tips regarding any shortage. After a short period the younger saints will be perfected. If the younger saints must get approval for every decision, even small ones, nothing will be accomplished. If the co-workers are very cautious in considering everything, matters will be delayed. Time is of the essence in carrying things out. A war may be lost because a decision is one minute late, and a war may be won because a decision is one minute early. Food can burn if it is left to cook for just one extra minute. Therefore, the co-workers should not control anything. Instead, they should perfect everyone to take the initiative in order to produce the next generation for the Lord.</p>
<h2 class="head1">LEARNING HOW TO CONDUCT ONESELF<br />
AND HOW TO WORK</h2>
<p>Having a high spiritual life and a deep knowledge of life does not mean that our work will be effective. However, an effective work requires a high spiritual life and a deep knowledge of life. An effective work also requires much learning. In 1953, while I was conducting a training in Taipei, I said, &ldquo;If you do not know how to conduct yourself, you will not know how to do things, and if you do not know how to do things, you will not know how to do a work.&rdquo; Hence, we must also learn how to conduct ourselves and how to do things. If we do not know how to conduct ourselves and how to do things, we will not be able to carry out any work. As long as we are willing to learn and to change, we will still be useful to the Lord.</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_011.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_013.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>The Age of the One New Man &nbsp; pg 12</div><br></body></html>
