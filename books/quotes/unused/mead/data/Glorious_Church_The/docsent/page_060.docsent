   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>What is the meaning of embroidery?</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Originally, there is a plain piece of material with nothing upon it.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Later, something is sewed into it with thread, and by this sewing work, the original material and the thread become one.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>This means that when the Spirit of God works upon us, He constitutes Christ into us this is the embroidery work.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Then we will not only have a garment of gold, but also a garment embroidered by the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>By this work Christ will be constituted in us and expressed from us.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>This embroidered garment is the righteous acts of the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>It is not done once for all, but repeatedly carried on day after day until God says that it is ready.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Perhaps some may ask what the righteous acts are that are specifically spoken of here.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The Gospels record many righteous acts, such as Mary's act of expressing her love to the Lord by anointing Him with ointment.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>This righteousness may be one of the crosswise or lengthwise threads in her fine linen garment.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>There were others, such as Joanna, the wife of Chuza, and many other women, who because of their love for the Lord ministered to His material needs and those of His disciples.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>These also are righteous acts.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Our heart is often touched by the love of the Lord, and we make an outward expression of it.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>This is our righteousness, our fine linen garment.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>This is the embroidering work which is being done today.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Any expression which results from our love for the Lord and which is done through the Holy Spirit is a stitch among the thousands of other stitches in the embroidery work.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The Bible tells us that whoever will give only a cup of cold water unto a little one will by no means lose his reward.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>This is a righteous act done out of love for the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>When we have some expression or act of love for the Lord, it is righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Revelation 7:9 says that the garment is a white robe.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>It has been washed and made white in the blood of the Lamb.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>We must remember that we can only be made white by being cleansed from our sins through the blood.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Not only must we be cleansed from our sins, but we must also be cleansed from our good behavior.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>It too can only be made white by being washed in the blood.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Not a single deed of any Christian is originally white.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Even if we have some righteousness, it is mixed and not pure.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>We often have been kind to others, but inwardly we have been unwilling.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>We often have been patient with others, but when we have gone home we have murmured.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Therefore, after having done some righteous deed, we still need the cleansing of the blood.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>We need the blood of the Lord Jesus to cleanse us from the sins we commit, and we also need the blood of the Lord Jesus to cleanse our righteous acts.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>No Christian can ever make a garment which is pure white.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Even if we could make one which was ninety-nine percent pure, there would still be one percent of mixture.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Before God no man is entirely without blemish.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Even good deeds done out of our love for the Lord need the cleansing of the blood.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>A very spiritual man once said that even the tears he shed for sin needed to be washed by the blood.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Oh, even tears of repentance need to be cleansed by the blood!</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Therefore, Revelation 7:14 indicates that their robes were made white in the blood of the Lamb.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>We have nothing of which we can boast.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>From the outside to the inside, nothing is entirely pure.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The more we know ourselves, the more we will realize how filthy we are.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Our best deeds and our best intentions are mixed with filthiness.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Without the cleansing of the blood, it is impossible to be white.</S>
