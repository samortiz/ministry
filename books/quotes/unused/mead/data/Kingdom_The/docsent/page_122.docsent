   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>NOT TAKING ANY LEAVEN</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Following this, we have the third case in which the Lord Jesus charged His disciples not to take any leaven.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>"Take heed and beware of the leaven of the Pharisees and Sadducees" Matt 16:6 .</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>These three cases should be joined together.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>We need to take in Christ as the crumbs, but we should not accept any leaven.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>We should take the bread and the crumbs of the bread, but not the leaven.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The Lord Jesus only gives us bread; He never gives us leaven.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The Leaven of the Pharisees</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>We must beware of the leaven of the Pharisees.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>What is the leaven of the Pharisees?</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>It is to be religious, scriptural, fundamental, outwardly right, and yet have no life, no Spirit, no reality, and no sincerity.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Please remember all of these words.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The hypocrisy of the Pharisees was not simply that they did evil things while pretending to be good.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The hypocrisy of the Pharisees meant that they were religious, scriptural, fundamental, and outwardly right, yet they had nothing of the Spirit, of life, of reality, and of sincerity.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>This is leaven.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>This kind of leaven can still be found among Christians today.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>People may criticize us for shouting and praising the Lord, saying that we are crazy, while they consider themselves to be sound, good, and fundamental.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>In a sense, they are today's Pharisees, having no life, no Spirit, no reality, and no sincerity.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The Leaven of the Sadducees</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>What is the leaven of the Sadducees?</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The leaven of the Sadducees means to be realistic, reasonable, and philosophical.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>This is like the modernism of today.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>We may say that the modernists are modern Sadducees and that the Sadducees were the ancient modernists.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>They are both in the same category.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>They are realistic and philosophical, but they do not believe in God, in the Word of God, or in resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>They do not believe in anything that is divine because they are so philosophical and reasonable.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>There is no reality among them because they, like the Pharisees, lack the Spirit and the life.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>This is the leaven of the Sadducees.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Today, we are confronted with both fundamentalism and modernism.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The leaven of the Pharisees is simply today's fundamentalism; the leaven of the Sadducees is today's modernism.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>We should eat the crumbs of Christ, but we should not accept any leaven.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Do not wash your hands outwardly; that means nothing.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The washing of hands represents outward correction, improvement, and adjustment.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>To change, improve, and correct our behavior is signified by the washing of hands.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The Lord Jesus is not concerned about the outward change.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>He is concerned about your inward being.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>What is within you?</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>What is in your heart?</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>That is what really matters.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Whatever we perform outwardly will never change us.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>But we have the Lord Jesus who is good for our eating.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>He can come into us.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Although we are not qualified to eat the children's bread, we are fully qualified to eat the dog's crumbs.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>If the dogs eat the crumbs, they will be transformed into children.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>However, don't eat any leaven.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>While you are eating the crumbs, there is the danger you may take in the leaven.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>We should separate these two things.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>We should take the bread, but reject the leaven.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>We look to the Lord that in the local churches there may be many crumbs of Christ, but no leaven of fundamentalism or modernism.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>May there be the Spirit, the life, the reality, and the sincerity.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>These are the crumbs for us to enjoy.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>This is for the kingdom life.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>While we are following the Lord Jesus in the wilderness during the time of His rejection, we must take care of our eating.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>If we have seen the vision from Matthew 15, we will not be concerned for the outward washing of hands.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>We will only care for the inward eating of the crumbs.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>I don't care for any outward washing.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>I only care for how much you have eaten the crumbs of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>While you are eating, beware of the leaven.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>When you are hungry, you need to be careful what you eat.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>It is wonderful to eat the crumbs, but it is better to remain hungry than to eat leaven.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Both fundamentalism and modernism are leaven.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Even if you are starving, do not accept any leaven.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Only take Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>The crumbs of Christ may not have such a good appearance, but they are so nourishing.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>You should gladly take them in. However, regardless of how good or nice it appears, never take in leaven.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Don't be concerned for the outward washing of hands.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Only care for the inward eating of the crumbs of Christ.</S>
