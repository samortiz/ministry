   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER ONE MEETING TO SPEAK THE WORD OF GOD Scripture Reading: Acts 5:42; 1 Cor 14:23-24, 26; Heb 10:25; 1 Cor 12:8, 10 OUTLINE The proof of the Scripture and the manifestation of the Spirit: The proof of the Scripture Acts 5:42; 1 Cor 14:23-24, 26; Heb 10:25.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The manifestation of the Spirit 1 Cor 12:8, 10.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>I would like all of you to know that this training is not just to train the elders, or the co-workers, or the full-timers, but this training is to train all the brothers and sisters.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The intention in this training is to tear down hierarchy and eliminate class structure among us.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>ONE SPEAKING WITH MANY LISTENING</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>PRODUCING A SUNDAY SERVICE</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Chapter fourteen of 1 Corinthians says that whenever we come together, each one has a psalm, has a teaching, has a revelation, has a tongue, has an interpretation v. 26 . Has is used five times here; five is the number for responsibility.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>What each one has is not definitely set.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>In following the Spirit, nothing is definitely set.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Nevertheless, we have to be responsible to prepare.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Only when we have fallen into a degraded condition will the meeting follow a set pattern.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Forgive me for exposing your weakness.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The concept of rank, the thought of class structure, this way of taking the lead these things have entered into our blood.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>We are too accustomed to depending on the leading ones to direct the meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>In church history, the matter that is most condemned by the Lord is the matter of the Nicolaitans, which later developed into religious organization.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>For example, in Catholicism the pope is at the top; under the pope are the cardinals; under the cardinals are the archbishops and bishops; and under the bishops are more levels.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>This is religious organization.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Among us it seems that there is no religious organization, but the germ is still here.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>In our concept, a meeting is led by the elders with a few co-workers.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Then what do the rest of the brothers and sisters come to do?</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>They come to do nothing, because the leading ones and the responsible ones are present.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>When prayer is needed, someone will do it.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>When a message is needed, even the more, there are the experts who will do it.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>So the brothers and sisters have nothing to do except to sit there, producing a Sunday service.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Some look around, some look at the ceiling, and some stare at the floor.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>A carpenter produces chairs, a shoe factory produces shoes, and a church with its pastor and congregation produces a Sunday service.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>I describe these situations to show you that the Lord s church on the earth has degraded to such an extent.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Christians come to the meetings and sit motionless in their chairs.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>It seems as if their tongues have been cut off, their teeth have fallen out, their lips have been removed, and even their vocal chords have become mute.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Do not think that I am joking.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>If you come to the meetings without opening your mouth, allowing only one person to speak while the rest listen, you are producing a Sunday service.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>ALL THE LORD S PEOPLE BEING PROPHETS</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>I have been studying the Bible for sixty years, but there is one verse that I noticed only very recently.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>This verse is Numbers 11:29, where Moses said, Would God that all the Lord s people were prophets.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Those who translated the Chinese version did not dare to translate it exactly as all...were prophets ; rather, they translated all...were prophets into all...were inspired to speak.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>If you knew Hebrew, you would see that the original meaning is all the Lord s people were prophets.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The prophet mentioned in this verse is not what we usually think of as a prophet, that is, one who predicts the future.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>In the book of Isaiah, which has a total of sixty-six chapters, all the portions of prediction added together do not exceed six chapters.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>There are still another sixty chapters that are not predictions but speaking for God.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The primary qualification for being a prophet is not predicting, but speaking for God and speaking forth God.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>This was what the prophet Isaiah did and what the prophet Jeremiah also did, that is, speaking for God and speaking forth God.</S>
