<h2 class="head1">THE TRIUNE GOD</h2>
<p>Previously, I told you that all of chapter eight after verse 2 is a full definition of the law of the Spirit of life. Actually, this definition is the Triune God&mdash;the Father, the Son, and the Spirit. Have you noticed that in chapter eight these three terms of the Trinity are strongly mentioned? In verse 2 there is the Spirit; in verse 3 there is the Son; in verse 15 there is the Father. In this chapter there is also the strong indication that these three are one. Verses 9 through 11 speak of the Spirit of God, the Spirit of Christ, Christ, and the Spirit of Him who raised Jesus from among the dead. Because these terms are used interchangeably, it indicates strongly that the three are one. God is the Spirit of God, and the Spirit of God is the Spirit of Christ, and the Spirit of Christ is Christ. So here is the Trinity. Although the Trinity is mentioned clearly in John 14 and 16, actually the most complete and perfect and clear mention and explanation of the Trinity is in Romans 8. In Romans 8 there are the three&mdash;the Father, the Son, and the Spirit&mdash;and there is the strong indication that these three are considered as interchangeable terms, indicating that they are not only three but also one. So they are three-one. No other chapter in the Bible has as many hints and indications concerning the Trinity.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE PROCESSED TRIUNE GOD IN OUR SPIRIT</h2>
<p>Furthermore, in this chapter, there is the clear indication that this Triune God&mdash;the Father, the Son, and the Spirit&mdash; has passed through the process of incarnation, because the Son was sent in the form of the flesh (v. 3). This chapter also indicates or implies the crucifixion because it mentions Jesus being raised from among the dead (v. 11). This chapter also indicates resurrection because it speaks of the Spirit of the One who raised up Christ Jesus from among the dead (v. 11). Furthermore, this chapter includes ascension, because in verse 34 it mentions that the resurrected Christ is now on the right hand of God interceding for us. This chapter also indicates that all Three eventually become the indwelling Spirit who dwells in our spirit. It also indicates the mingling of the indwelling Spirit who is the Triune God, and who after being processed, is with our spirit. He has mingled with our spirit. Verse 10 says when Christ is in you the spirit is life. This indicates that the very Christ is in your spirit. Then verse 16 says that the Spirit Himself witnesses with our spirit. This means the two are mingled as one. How can we tell that these two spirits are mingled? Verse 15 says, &ldquo;You have received a spirit of sonship in which we cry, Abba, Father.&rdquo; The parallel verse in Galatians 4:6 says, &ldquo;God sent forth the Spirit of His Son into our hearts, crying, Abba, Father!&rdquo; Romans says that we cry and Galatians says that the Spirit cries. Surely these are not two cryings, but one. These two verses strongly indicate the mingling. It means that His crying is my crying, and my crying is His crying. When I cry in my spirit, He cries. He and my spirit are mingled as one.</p>
<p>The revelation of the Trinity in Romans 8 is very high. Such a Triune God, processed and becoming the indwelling Spirit, is the law of the Spirit of life. The law of the Spirit of life is just such a God. It is not merely the Jewish God nor the God of many Christians. The Jews have God, but they do not believe that their God is triune&mdash;the Father, the Son, and the Spirit. If they believed this, right away they would believe in Jesus Christ. The Jews believe that God is the Father in a very broad sense, as the source of everything. They don&rsquo;t believe that in the Godhead there is the Son. If they did believe this, right away they would become Christians. They say that Jesus was an illegal son, born before his mother was married. This is their mistaken belief. Of course, they do believe that God is the Creator who created the earth and the heavens. But, the God in whom they believe is short of too many aspects.</p>
