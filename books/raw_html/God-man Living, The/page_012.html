 <h2 class="head1">III. IN HIS SILENCE BETWEEN THE AGE OF TWELVE AND THE AGE OF THIRTY</h2>
<h2 class="head2">A. Growing Up like a Tender Plant before Jehovah and like a Root out of Dry Ground</h2>
<p>The Lord&rsquo;s being a root out of dry ground (Isa. 53:2a) meant that He came from a poor family.</p>
<h2 class="head2">B. Having No Dignity of Attraction<br />
nor Desirable Appearance</h2>
<p>He had no attracting form nor majesty that we should look upon Him, nor beautiful appearance that we should desire Him (Isa. 53:2b), signifying that in both His status and stature He had no dignity of attraction nor desirable appearance.</p>
<h2 class="head2">C. Being Despised and Forsaken of Men</h2>
<p>He was despised and forsaken of men, a man of sorrows and acquainted with grief, respected by no man (Isa. 53:3).</p>
<h2 class="head2">D. His Appearance Being Marred<br />
More Than That of Any Man</h2>
<p>His appearance was marred more than that of any man, and His form more than that of the sons of men (Isa. 52:14).</p>
<h2 class="head2">E. Tempted yet without Sin</h2>
<p>He was tempted in all respects like us, yet without sin (Heb. 4:15b; 2:18).</p>
<p>All of the states and conditions mentioned above make people silent and inactive in social appearance. If you are in all these kinds of states and conditions, you have to be silent, because no one honors or appreciates you. To be a very active person in society, to be so social, is dangerous. When the Lord Jesus was on this earth, He did not have this kind of danger. He was despised, undesirable in outward appearance, and not respected by any men.</p>
<h2 class="head2">F. God Not Yet Commissioning Him</h2>
<p>Although the Lord had a concern for God&rsquo;s house when He was at the age of twelve, God did not yet commission Him to carry out the ministry for the purpose to accomplish His eternal economy in taking care of God&rsquo;s house issuing in the Body of Christ, consummating the New Jerusalem. Man moves too fast, but God is patient. He told Adam that He would come as the seed of woman to destroy Satan, but He did not come until four thousand years later. When the Lord Jesus was born, that was a fulfillment of God&rsquo;s promise to Adam in Genesis 3:15.</p>
<h2 class="head2">G. The Real Ministry Needing the Maturity of Age</h2>
<p>Many servants of God could not tolerate such a time of silence; rather, they failed such a test by God. The real ministry to take care of the house of God issuing in the Body of Christ needs the maturity of life [age] (Num. 4:3). The more maturity you have, the wiser you will be. Elders should be brothers who have grown up to a certain degree in maturity. Then they are qualified to be elders. I hope all of the young people will be trained to go on to grow up according to the pattern of the first God-man, the prototype.</p>
