How does faith work in reality? Please remember that our faith is based on God's Word. Believing in God's Word means that when God says in His Word that certain things have been accomplished, we believe that they have been accomplished. A missionary once asked me, "What is the difference between God's Word and His work?" I was shaking his hand and I had my gloves on. I explained that God's work is like the hand, while His Word is like the glove. When someone holds my glove, he is holding my hand. In the same way, when we hold onto God's Word, we hold onto His work. When I explained it in this way, he became clear. All we have to do is to hold onto God's Word; His work is in His Word. If the hand is not in the glove, it would be useless for anyone to shake the glove. But God's work is now in His Word. We should say to the Lord, "You have said that Your work is accomplished. I believe in what You said." If God's Word says it, we should also say it. God's Word says that our sins are forgiven in Christ. We should respond by saying that our sins are forgiven in Him. God's Word says that our sins have been judged in Christ. We should respond by saying that our sins have been judged in Christ. God's Word says that the old man has died. We should respond by saying that our old man has died. God's Word says that we have received a new life. We should respond by saying that we have received a new life. If we do this, everything in Christ will be ours.</p><p>John 15 says that the Lord is the vine and the Christians are the branches. To outsiders this may not seem like anything sensational, but to a Christian this is a revolutionizing fact. All the sap in the vine flows into the branches. The fruit, leaves, and branches all derive their growth from the tree. A Christian is a branch on Christ the vine. He does not need to struggle to grow leaves or bear fruit. All he has to do is remain in the vine. However, many Christians feel that they do not look like a branch. They pray and ask to become a branch. These prayers are absolutely useless. We are branches already, and there is no need for us to pray to become a branch. We only need to see that we are branches. If we see that we are branches, we will no longer pray to be one, but will acknowledge that we are one already. This is the meaning of faith.</p><h2 class="head1">BELIEVING IN WHAT GOD HAS DONE<br />RATHER THAN IN WHAT HE WILL DO</h2><p>Once I was very sick, and I prayed to the Lord: "Heal me, Lord. The doctors can do nothing about me now. Please heal me." I had seen many promises of God in the Bible prior to this. But the Lord spoke to me through one word. "He Himself took away our infirmities and bore our diseases" (Matt. 8:17). At first I prayed for the Lord to bear my disease. Then He gave me a promise, but my illness was still there. I prayed again and the Lord rebuked me and showed me that this was wrong. He opened my eyes, and I saw that He had already borne my disease. When I believed in this word, I did not pray any longer; instead, I began to praise Him for bearing my disease even though outwardly everything was still the same and the illness was still with me.</p><p>Faith is not believing in what God will do; it is believing in what God has done. It is not believing that God will heal me, but that He has healed me. The Bible does not mention faith as something belonging to the future. Faith is believing in what God has done in Christ. When we believe in what God has done and accept His accomplished facts, we have genuine faith.</p><h2 class="head1">STANDING ON GOD'S WORD</h2><p>There was another time when I was sick. I asked the Lord to heal me, and He told me that the Holy Spirit is living in me and will give life to my mortal body (Rom. 8:11). I knew that the Lord had healed me, yet I could not go to sleep that night. The fever was high and the condition was worse than before. Satan came to me and said, "You say that God has healed you. But look at yourself, your temperature is very high and you cannot sleep. You say that you are healed, but your sufferings are worse than before. How can you say that God has healed you? This is not true." I thought that perhaps I was wrong. But then I realized that this was nothing more than a mood that came from Satan, and I began to ignore it. I told Satan, "God said that He has healed me. My temperature may be high, and I may still feel pain and be unable to go to sleep, but none of these conditions are trustworthy. There is only one thing which is real in this world&mdash;God's Word. All pains and problems are false. Only God's Word is real." After I said this, I fell asleep within a few minutes.</p><p>Satan may say, "Look at yourself! You are so filthy within." You have to tell him, "Yes, I am filthy in myself. But I am in Christ, and everything in Christ is clean." If you stand on God's side, Satan will be defeated immediately.</p><p>In reading the Bible, we have to pay attention to two matters&mdash;being in Adam and being in Christ. There is a great difference between these two things. They have a great deal to do with the way we live our Christian life, and we must deal with these two matters properly. When our life does not match the biblical description of being in Christ, we have to stand on God's Word. We must not trust in our feelings or consider our conditions. We have to stand on God's Word and believe in His Word. If we do this, He will lead us into all the riches that are in Christ.</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_057.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_059.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Collected Works of Watchman Nee, The (Set 2) Vol. 42: Conferences, Messages, and Fellowship (2) &nbsp; pg 58</div><br></body></html>
