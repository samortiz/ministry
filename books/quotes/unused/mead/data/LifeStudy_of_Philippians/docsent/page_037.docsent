   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>I. TO LIVE OUT CHRIST, TO EXPRESS CHRIST,</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>TO WORK OUT OUR SALVATION</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The title of this message is Holding Forth Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>To hold forth Christ is to live out Christ, to express Christ, and to work out our salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>As we have indicated, to work out our salvation is to obey the Triune God who is operating within us both the willing and the working for His good pleasure.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Here we have five important, interrelated matters: working out our salvation, obeying God, living Christ, expressing Christ, and holding forth Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Christians commonly speak of obeying God.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>However, in most cases their understanding of obedience is very superficial.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The other four expressions living Christ, expressing Christ, holding forth Christ, and working out our salvation are unusual and even extraordinary.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>It would be helpful if we would make such expressions part of our conversation in fellowship.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>As we speak to one another, we need to encourage one another to live out Christ and express Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>We need to remind one another to hold forth Christ and to work out our salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Using these expressions will help us in ministering Christ to others, especially to young ones who have just received the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>We should not merely talk about the gospel and salvation in a common, ordinary way.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>We need to use expressions based on Paul s word to the Philippians to stir in others the desire to experience the Lord in their spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>It is very important that we bring these extraordinary spiritual expressions into our daily conversation, prayer, fellowship, and testimonies in the church meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>This will serve to enrich our utterance.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>May we all be exercised to speak of living out Christ, expressing Christ, holding forth Christ as the word of life, and working out our own salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>II.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>DOING ALL THINGS</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>WITHOUT MURMURINGS AND REASONINGS</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>We have pointed out that murmurings issue from the emotion, whereas reasonings proceed from the mind.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Furthermore, murmurings are more of a problem among the sisters, and reasonings more among the brothers.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Again and again we need to be reminded of Paul s word in 2:14.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>When the sisters are washing dishes in the sisters house, they should remember not to murmur.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>As the brothers are taking care of matters in the service groups and the church life, they should remember to do all things without reasonings.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>They should not reason, but simply serve the Lord in the church.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>III.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>BECOMING BLAMELESS AND GUILELESS</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>If we do all things without murmurings and reasonings, we shall become blameless and harmless.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>What a great thing it is not to have murmurings and reasonings!</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>However, I have never met a sister who did not murmur or a brother who did not reason.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The problem of murmurings and reasonings comes out in particular in married life.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>For example, a wife may murmur if her husband does not show appreciation of the love and care she has for him.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Some brothers have learned that one way to eliminate a wife s murmuring is to use two simple expressions: I m sorry and thank you.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Using these simple expressions can make your married life much happier.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>If a brother never tells his wife that he is sorry or if he never says thank you, there is apt to be murmuring.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>If we are successful in eliminating murmurings and reasonings, we shall be blameless and guileless.</S>
