   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Note What is the heresy of tritheism?</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Modalism stresses the side of God being one to a heretical extreme by denying the coexistence and coinherence of the three of the Godhead.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Tritheism, on the other hand, stresses the side of God being three to a heretical extreme by teaching that the Father, the Son, and the Spirit are three Gods.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The Bible is not at either of these extremes; it stands in the center, testifying of the twofoldness of the truth of the Divine Trinity.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Regarding the truth of the Triune God, we also should be balanced and avoid the heretical extremes of both modalism and tritheism.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>It is a great heresy to say that there are three Gods.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The Scriptures clearly, definitely, and repeatedly say that there is only one God 1 Cor 8:4; Isa 44:6, 8; 45:5-6, 21-22; 46:9; Psa 86:10 .</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The tritheists say, "If the Father, Son, and Spirit are not three Gods, then how can They be three persons?"</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Griffith Thomas in his book The Principles of Theology said concerning the Divine Trinity: "The term Person is also sometimes objected to.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Like all human language, it is liable to be accused of inadequacy and even positive error.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>It certainly must not be pressed too far, or it will lead to Tritheism."</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Because the tritheists hold the side of the three and neglect the side of the one, they have no balance or safeguard.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Both modalism and tritheism go to an extreme, but we are in the middle and are balanced.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>When we say that the Son is the Father Isa 9:6 and the Lord is the Spirit 2 Cor 3:17 , we are simply quoting the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Those who deny this fact fall into the danger of being tritheistic.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>But as we have pointed out, we believe all the verses in the Bible which reveal the eternal coexistence and coinherence of the three of the Godhead.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>We condemn both modalism and tritheism as heresies.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>We believe that God is uniquely one for eternity, yet He is the Father, the Son, and the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Some may ask, "How can the Father, the Son, and the Spirit be three and at the same time still be one?"</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>My answer is, "I do not know.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>I cannot tell you.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>If you try to understand this, you will be, in Martin Luther's terms, 'the teacher of God.'"</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The Divine Trinity is a mystery which far transcends our mental apprehension.</S>
