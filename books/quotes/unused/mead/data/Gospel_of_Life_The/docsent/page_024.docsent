   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>EACH INDIVIDUAL'S CONDITION AND NEED</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>All the conditions of these nine cases can also be found in each individual person.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>One person can possess all the conditions of all men.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>For example, you may be a good man, or, at least you have the intention of being a good man.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>You may also be quite religious, fearing God and seeking Him.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>At the same time, however, you may also have done something mean, something which is not honorable.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>You may be a religious gentleman with high morals and yet have done something low.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>On the one hand, you are a high-class person; on the other hand, you are a low-class person.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>You are also sick and about to die morally and spiritually.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>You may be very living physically, but you are dying morally and spiritually.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Even physically you are also dying day by day.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Apparently you are living; actually you are dying.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Another condition of yours is that you are a weak person.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>You know that you should do good and you know what is right, but you lack the strength or the power to do it.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Perhaps you are not yet twenty-five years old, but you have been sick for "thirty-eight years" 5:5 .</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>You know that you should love others, but you are weak; you want to keep all the laws of God and you desire to please God, but you are unable to do so.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>In other words, you have the desire to do good, but you do not have the ability to perform what you desire.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>You need the proper power of life.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Hunger and thirst are also two items of your condition.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Many times you feel that you are a hungry person; many times you are thirsty for education, for money, or for pleasure.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>You need the Lord as the bread of life to satisfy your hunger, and you need the Lord's living water to quench your thirst.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Another condition that can also be found in you as an individual is your sinfulness.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>You are sinful.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>You are a sinner and you commit sin.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>You need the forgiveness of the Lord as well as deliverance from the bondage of sin.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>In another respect, you are in a state of blindness.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Even though you may have perfect vision with your physical eyes, you cannot perceive the meaning of human life, and especially you cannot see spiritual things.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>You are blind and you need the Lord to open your eyes and to give you sight.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Your last condition is that of a dead man who eventually will die.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Have you ever realized that you are a dead person?</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>No one is alive in spirit everyone is dead.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>You need the resurrection life of the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Every person has, in his fallen condition, every aspect of these nine cases.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Every person, to a certain degree at least, is in each of these conditions.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Every condition is an indication of everyone's real need.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>THE LORD'S SUFFICIENCY IN MEETING MAN'S NEED</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>We have seen the condition and need of man in these nine cases.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Now we must see how the Lord is able to come into man's fallen condition and meet his every need.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>In every case, the Lord presents Himself as the One who can fulfill the deficiencies of man.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>These nine cases fully prove the Lord's sufficiency to meet man's every need.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The first case shows that the Lord can afford us regeneration 3:3, 5 , which even a superior person such as Nicodemus needed that he might have the life of God for the entrance into the kingdom of God.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The case of the Samaritan woman, a sinful and unsatisfied woman, reveals how much the Lord can satisfy such a person with His living water 4:10 .</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>For the case of the dying man, the Lord is the healing power of life 4:50 .</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The case of the weak man who had been sick for thirty-eight years demonstrates the enlivening power of the Lord's life 5:8-9 .</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>In the case of the hungry multitude which needed something to feed on, the Lord presents Himself as the bread of life 6:47, 48 .</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>In the case of the thirsty people, the Lord assures them that He can quench their thirst by the flowing river of living water 7:37, 38 .</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>In the case of the woman living in sin, we see that the Lord is able to deliver such a one from her sinful situation and release her from the bondage of sin 8:34-36 .</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>In the case of the blind man, the Lord opens his eyes and gives him sight 9:5-7 .</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Finally, in the case of Lazarus, who had died, had been buried, and was even decaying in the grave, the power of the Lord's resurrection life is fully exhibited 11:25 .</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>In all of these cases the Lord's sufficiency in meeting man's need is adequately proved.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>There is not one of man's conditions that He cannot solve.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>There is not a need that He cannot meet.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>He is able!</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>He is sufficient!</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>He can deal with all our problems and supply all our needs!</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Praise His name!</S>
