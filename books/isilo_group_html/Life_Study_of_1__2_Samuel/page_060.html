We surely need guidance from the Lord, and we also need to know the controlling principles. Otherwise, we may be careless in our interpretation. In studying the books of history in the Bible, we need to be poor in spirit and we need a seeking spirit. We need to pray, "Lord, there is something here that I do not know, but You know. Lord, reveal to me the intrinsic significance of this portion of the Word." This should be our prayer as we continue to consider the history concerning David as one prepared by God to be a man according to the heart of God.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>V. JONATHAN'S LOVE FOR DAVID</H2><P>David was persecuted and tried by Saul. Saul was nearly the unique source of all David's trials. In the trials that God gave to him in His sovereignty, God prepared a provision for David. God prepared Jonathan, Saul's son, who loved David (18:1-5).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>A. Jonathan Loving David like His Own Soul</H2><P>Jonathan loved David like his own soul (vv. 1b, 3b). While the father was persecuting David and plotting to kill him, his son was loving David to the uttermost. It seems that there was discord in the family over David, with the father hating him and the son loving him. If God had not provided Jonathan in such a way, it is doubtful that David could have endured the trials under Saul. David could pass through these trials mainly because of the help that Jonathan rendered to him. From this we see that when we are under God's trial, God knows that we need some provision. On the one hand, we have the trials; on the other hand, we have God's provision to support us and sustain us in the trials.</P><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_059.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_061.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Life-Study of 1 & 2 Samuel &nbsp; pg 60</div><br></body></html>
