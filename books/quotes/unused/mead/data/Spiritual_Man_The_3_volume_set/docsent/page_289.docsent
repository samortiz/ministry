   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>The same is true in the matter of salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>While man is in his flesh, even if he wants to be saved and have eternal life, this will cannot please God.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>"But as many as received Him, to them He gave the authority to become children of God...who were begotten not of blood, nor of the will of the flesh, nor of the will of man, but of God John 1:12-13 .</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Even if man wants to be saved, he cannot make himself saved.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The idea of wanting to be saved must come from God.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Believers think that there is nothing better than a man who is trying to be saved, seek the way of life, and be a good disciple of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>But God tells us that in the matter of regeneration and in everything relating to God, man's will is useless.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>There are many of God's children who do not understand why in John 1, God says that man's will is useless, while in Revelation He says, "Let him who wills take the water of life freely" 22:17 .</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>It seems in the latter case that man's own will is wholly responsible for his salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Furthermore, in John 5 the Lord Jesus spoke of the reason why the Jews were not saved.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>It was because "you are not willing to come to Me that you may have life" v. 40 . Here again man's will is responsible for man's perdition.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Is the Bible contradictory on this matter?</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>What is the purpose of such different speakings?</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>If we understand the meaning of these verses, we will understand what God requires of us in our Christian life.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>God's will is "not intending willing that any perish but that all advance to repentance" 2 Pet 3:9 because He "desires wills all men to be saved and to come to the full knowledge of the truth" 1 Tim 2:4 .</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Therefore, this matter does not involve God making a decision as to who will be saved and who will perish; that question is settled.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Now the question is what kind of attitude do sinners hold toward God's will.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>If a man is naturally religious or not worldly, or if he tries to be a Christian through his tradition, environment, or family, he will see that he is as far from God's life as all the other sinners.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>If he resolves, determines, and chooses to be a Christian on the basis of some sudden excitement or thrilling inspiration, his efforts are still useless.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The main question is how does man treat God's will.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>God loves man, but is man willing to be loved?</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Christ wants man to come to Him, but is man willing to come?</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The Holy Spirit wants to give man life, but does man want to have life and live?</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Man's will is useful in the will of God.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>But the question remains, how will man's will treat God's will?</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Have we seen the difference here?</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>If a man initiates the pursuit of salvation, he will still perish.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Many religionists of this world belong to this category.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>If, upon hearing the gospel, man is willing to receive what God wants to give him, he will be saved.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>One way is for man to consider himself as the source of initiation; the other is to place himself in a receiving position.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>One is for man to initiate; the other is for God to initiate and for man to accept His will.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Therefore, these two do not contradict each other.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Rather, they teach us a very important lesson.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>John 1 speaks of man being willing.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>John 5 and Revelation 22 speak of man accepting God's will.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Hence, we see such expressions as "not willing" John 5:40 and "wills" Rev 22:17 .</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>It is not a question of purpose, but a question of where the purpose comes from.</S>
