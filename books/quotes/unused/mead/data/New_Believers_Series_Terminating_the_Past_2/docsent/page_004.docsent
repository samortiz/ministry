   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Suppose I stole a thousand dollars from someone before I was saved.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>If I have not dealt with the matter clearly, how can I preach the gospel to that person after I am saved?</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>While I am preaching to him, his heart may still be on the thousand dollars.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>No doubt, I have received forgiveness from God, but I do not have a proper testimony before man.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>I cannot say, "Since God has forgiven me, it does not matter whether or not I repay him."</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>No, this matter is related to my testimony.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Please remember that Zaccheus restored four times as much for the sake of his testimony.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>At that time everyone was saying, "How could the Lord lodge in this sinner's home?</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>He has extorted and defrauded many people!"</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>They were all indignant.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>While they were saying this, Zaccheus stood up and said, "If I have taken anything from anyone by false accusation, I restore four times as much."</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>This fourfold restoration was neither a requirement for becoming a son of Abraham nor a requirement for God's salvation coming to Zaccheus's house.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>This fourfold restoration was the result of God's salvation coming to Zaccheus's house and of his becoming a son of Abraham.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Due to this act of restoration, Zaccheus had a testimony before man.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>This was the basis of his testimony.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>I knew a brother who was not very upright in financial matters before he believed in the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Many of his classmates were upper middle-class people.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>After he believed in the Lord, he became rather zealous in leading his classmates to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>But he did not see much fruit.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Although he earnestly preached the gospel to them, they said in their heart, "What is this?</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>What about all the money?"</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>His past had not been eradicated from them.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>This brother did not follow the example of Zaccheus.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>His sins were forgiven before God.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>All his problems were solved.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>But the matter concerning his money before his classmates was not resolved.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>He had to confess and make recompense for all his past wrongdoings before he could testify to others.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The restoration of his testimony depended on the termination of his past.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>As I have mentioned, Zaccheus did not become a son of Abraham by restoring four times as much.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Neither did he gain salvation by restoring four times as much.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Rather, he restored four times as much because he was a child of Abraham.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>He restored four times as much because he was saved.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>By restoring four times as much, he shut the mouths of others.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>They could no longer say anything.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>His fourfold restoration went far beyond what he owed, thus shutting the mouths of others and restoring his testimony.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Brothers and sisters, did you wrong anyone in any way before you became a believer?</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Do you owe anyone anything?</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Have you taken things home which belong to others?</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Have you taken anything by improper means?</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>If so, you have to deal with all these things properly.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The repentance of a Christian has to do with confessing his past wrongdoings, whereas the repentance of ordinary men only involves a change in his present conduct.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>For example, as a human being, if I have a bad temper, I need only to refrain from my temper.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>But as a Christian, in addition to refraining from my temper, I have to apologize for my former temper.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Apart from not losing my temper before God, I must also apologize for my former temper before men.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Only then can this matter be terminated.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Suppose you stole from others in the past.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Your problem before God is settled as long as you no longer steal.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Likewise, if you have ever taken things that belonged to others, your problem is settled once you stop doing it.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>However, this is not enough for you to have a testimony before men.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Even if you have not stolen anything in three years, others may still consider you as a thief.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>After believing in the Lord, you must testify before men; you must deal with all your mistakes in the past.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Only then will your position be clear.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>But here is a difficult problem.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Suppose you stole ten thousand dollars from someone.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>What should you do if you do not even have one thousand dollars now?</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>In principle you have to confess to the person from whom you have stolen.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>You should tell him frankly that you cannot repay him at the present time.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Whether or not you can repay him immediately is another matter; you should still confess and testify to him.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>If you do not testify now, you will not be able to testify for the rest of your life.</S>
