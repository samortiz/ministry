Christ the Son's coming is for the accomplishment of salvation and our full enjoyment of God, so he said, "the grace of the Lord." The Spirit whom Christ became is the transmission into us of all that the Father is and all that Christ has accomplished; thus Paul called this "the fellowship of the Holy Spirit." The whole Triune God is working in oneness to dispense His Being into us. Eventually, our spirit and soul and body will be saturated with Him. Hallelujah!</P><P>Second Corinthians 13:14, then, is strong proof that God is triune for our experience, not just for teaching. Paul did not just say, "The Father, Son, and Holy Spirit be with you all." Yes, he mentioned the Trinity, but as grace, love, and fellowship. This is very experiential and shows God's dispensing. But how do we experience and enjoy His dispensing? And what should be the result? In the church, everyone is encouraged to read God's Word, pray, and call on His name. That is absolutely right; but you should always remember that God's dispensing is for producing His expression. Our reading, praying, and calling should affect our lives at home and at school. Our enjoyment is not just for ourselves; it is for God to be lived out of us. </P><P>What does it mean for God to be lived out and expressed through us? Consider righteousness, for example. God is righteous. He is absolutely right and honest in everything He does. What about us? In ourselves we are not righteous. Suppose you bought something at the store and by mistake the checker did not charge you enough money. Most young people today would never say anything. In fact, they would be so happy to have saved some money. But that is unrighteous. That is the expression of the Devil. You might say that it was the store's fault or that they charge too much anyway. Those excuses just show how much you love your money and how unrighteous you are. Actually, to keep that money is the same as stealing.</P><P>Suppose at that time you prayed: "Lord, I know I should say something, but I can't. Lord Jesus, I am not righteous but You are&#151;I just turn to You." After praying like that do you think you could keep the extra money? No, you would pay the proper amount. That is the Triune God lived out of you as righteousness. In yourself you would just walk out of the store happily, but by turning to the Lord you allow Him to dispense Himself into you so you could pay the money. You take in more of the righteous God. The people in the world express unrighteousness, but because of experiencing God's dispensing you express God as righteousness.</P><P>God's goal is a group of people that are full of Him so they can express Him. The church should have the highest expression in the universe. We should express everything that God is. God is love; He loves even His enemies. God is forgiving; He forgives the worst sin. But we cannot even love our own brother or sister, nor can we forgive the smallest sin. So day by day we need to experience and enjoy the Triune God. We need to pray, call on His name, and read the Word so that He could dispense more of Himself into us so that we could express Him.</P><P>He is so wonderful. He is so experiential. He is so enjoyable. His goal is to make us His sons that we may be members of the Body of Christ to express Him. He can reach His goal through this type of enjoyment. It is so easy. Hallelujah for the dispensing of our Triune God! Praise the Lord for the goal of God's full salvation!</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>QUESTIONS</H2><ol class="decimal"><li>Use 2 Corinthians 13:14 to write a prophesy concerning the enjoyment of the Triune God.</li></ol><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>Quoted Portions from (Lee/LSM) Publications</H2><ol class="decimal"><li>Life Messages, pp. 516-518.</li><li>Life-study of Romans, pp. 628-630.</li><li>Life-study of Second Corinthians, pp. 523-526.</li><li>The Divine Dispensing of the Divine Trinity in Second Corinthians, pp. 67-69, 71-73.</li></ol><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_019.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_021.html">Next</a> </body></html>
