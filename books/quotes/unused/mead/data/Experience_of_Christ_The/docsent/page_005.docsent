   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE SUM TOTAL OF OUR CHRISTIAN LIVING</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The experience of Christ is a mystery, and whatever we experience of Christ is unlimited.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>If we see this vision, it will not only control our life, but also strengthen our Christian walk.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>God's intention is to magnify Christ through us.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The church life is the sum total of our Christian living.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>We all live by Christ, and our Christian living is added together to make the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Our Christian life is a mystery, and whatever of Christ we live out is also a mystery.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>We all are mysterious because Christ lives in us.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>For example, we may speak by Christ, but our speaking by Christ is a mystery.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Although it is a mystery, it is nonetheless a fact.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>What we are experiencing of Christ today is a mystery.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Day by day, our living is mysterious.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Thus, when we come together as the church, we are a complete mystery.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The sum total of all these mysteries is the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>This mystery manifests the One who is unlimited.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>THE MYSTERY OF EXPERIENCING CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>In order for Christ to be lived out by us, He must be in us.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Paul said, "For to me to live is Christ."</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>This means that we can live to be Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>As we are living to be Christ, we still expect to be with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Thus, Christ is present, yet absent.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>This also is a mystery showing that Christ is unlimited.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Because we are limited, we cannot be both absent and present.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The Christ we are experiencing is unlimited.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Therefore, He can be present and absent.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The Christ whom we experience and by whom we live is different from what we think He is.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Experiencing Christ and living by Him is a mystery.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>If you think that you are experiencing Christ, you may not be experiencing Him.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>But if you think that you are not experiencing Him, you are probably experiencing Him.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>As you are experiencing Christ, you may not sense that you are experiencing Him.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>He is not only mysterious, but also abstract, invisible, and intangible.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>When you feel like rejecting Christ and giving Him up, you have a certain sense within.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>This sense is different from the sense you have most of the time.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Perhaps now you do not feel that you are experiencing Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>You may feel that you are just experiencing yourself.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Do not be robbed you may actually be experiencing Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>However, when you abandon Christ and give Him up, you have quite a different sense within.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>When you have that sense, then you can realize that you had been experiencing Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>This shows that the experience of Christ is mysterious.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Those in the Pentecostal movement often try to make Christ someone who is not mysterious.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>But anything that is not mysterious is not real.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>If your experience is not mysterious, it is not the real experience of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Christ is here, yet He is not here.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>It is the same with God.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The Bible says that no man has ever seen Him, yet He has appeared to men.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>It is difficult to say whether Christ is abstract or concrete.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>People always try to make the mysterious Christ so concrete that He is no longer mysterious.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>This is a false performance.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>In the past many of us have claimed to have had wonderful experiences.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>But after a certain period of time, we no longer thought that those experiences were wonderful.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Rather, we realized that they were a performance.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Although we may not have such so-called wonderful experiences in the church life, we cannot deny the fact that we have experienced Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>We have experienced something that cannot be erased from our being.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>This is Christ as our mystery.</S>
