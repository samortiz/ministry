   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>AN ACCOMPLISHED FACT</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The baptism in the Holy Spirit has already been accomplished, as seen in 1 Corinthians 12:13.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>"In one Spirit were we all baptized into one body, whether Jews or Greeks, whether bond or free" ASV .</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Notice that the verb is in the past tense.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The baptism of the whole Body of Christ in the Holy Spirit is something which is already accomplished and still exists.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>It is not to be accomplished in the future or even in the present, but it has already been accomplished and still exists.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>It is the same principle as that which applies for the crucifixion of the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>If we would believe in Him, we need not ask Him to die again for us, because His redeeming death has already been accomplished.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>It is the same with the baptism in the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>This baptism has been thoroughly completed upon the Body and now exists upon the Body, ready for us to take.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>We need not ask the Lord to do something again to baptize us in the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>We have already been baptized by the Lord in the Holy Spirit in and with the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>What we need to do now is simply to take what has already been accomplished!</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The incarnation, crucifixion, resurrection, and ascension of Christ are all accomplished facts, as well as His descension in the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The Lord has not only ascended to the heavens, but He has also descended upon His church in the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The real meaning of His descension is the baptism in the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Ten days after His ascension, He descended in the Spirit to clothe His Body.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Before this time the church was without authority and power.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>But now this wonderful Christ who was incarnated, crucified, and resurrected ascended to the heavens and was there enthroned.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Everything was finished and accomplished; so He descended in the Spirit to clothe His Body as authority and power.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The church was baptized in the Holy Spirit by this ascended and descended Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>This is the baptism in the Holy Spirit which was accomplished at the day of Pentecost and in the house of Cornelius upon the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>We must realize that we were all there!</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>This baptism in the Holy Spirit is ours because we are members of this baptized Body.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>We need to read 1 Corinthians 12:13 again.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>"In one Spirit were we all baptized."</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>We have all been baptized already!</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The Scripture tells us plainly that Christ died for our sins.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>And we are told just as plainly that we were already baptized in the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>We know that the Scripture, as the Word of God, is called the Old and New Testaments.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The Scripture is the Testaments of God.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The word "testament" really means "will," and a will or a testament is more than a covenant.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>A covenant is similar to an agreement or a contract.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>In a contract, certain things are promised if certain conditions are met.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>However, in a will everything is already accomplished.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The Bible is not only a covenant telling us that God will do many things for us, but it is also a testament telling us that He has already done everything.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>All has been finished and accomplished, and He has put all in a will and now leaves it to us.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>A will can only be in force if the giver is dead.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Christ, the Giver of the will, not only has died to make the will good, but as the resurrected Christ, He is also the Executor of the will.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>He was the Giver, and now He is the Executor!</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Everything in the Bible has already been accomplished; it is a will, a testament.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>How do we know that Christ has died for our sins?</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Because in this Will the New Testament we are told, as one of the items, that He has already died and all our sins were laid upon Him.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>We do not need to pray for several days and nights in order to be saved.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>No, we can be saved immediately by simply taking what the Lord has already accomplished and itemized in the Will the Testament of God.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>How may we know that we have been baptized in the Holy Spirit?</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>By the same principle, there is another item in the Will telling us, "For in one Spirit were we all baptized."</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The baptism in the Holy Spirit has not only been accomplished, but it has been passed on to us through the Will.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>It is an item of the Will that has been given to us.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>We need only take it.</S>
