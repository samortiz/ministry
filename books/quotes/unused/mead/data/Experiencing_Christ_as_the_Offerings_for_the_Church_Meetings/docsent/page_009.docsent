   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE GATHERING OF MANNA</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>But you have to remember that in 2 Corinthians 8 Paul reckons our regular job to the gathering of manna.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>You know the story of the gathering of manna.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Some greedy ones gathered more, but afterward the measurement was the same.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Many of us like to gather more, but eventually it comes out the same.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Those who receive more or gather more have no excess.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>And those who gather less have no lack.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>It comes out the same.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Even though you gather so much with all your energy and endeavor, eventually what you get is the same.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>SEEKING FIRST HIS KINGDOM</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>We who are the meeting people do live on manna.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Don t live on your job.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Go to do a job, but don t live on your job.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Live on manna.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Even your job is manna.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>God can take away all the manna.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>God can use just His little finger to touch the American economy and the jobs are gone.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>When the jobs are gone, there is no manna.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>You think this is your job, but this is manna sent by God to you.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The Lord s word is trustworthy.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>He says not to worry about tomorrow.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>He says not to have any anxiety about tomorrow.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Tomorrow is not in your hands.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Don t live a life of tomorrow.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Live a life of today.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Seek first His kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Then what you need for clothing, for drinking, for eating your Father will add to you.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>He will give you the kingdom that you firstly seek plus all the necessities Matt 6:31-34 .</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>This is the manna.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>To lose your job should not worry you, but to miss a meeting should bother you.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>I have been serving the Lord for about fifty years.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>I didn t lose my job at the beginning of the fifty years; rather I quit my job.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>I had a good job, but I gave it up.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>My! when I was about to make the decision to quit my job, that seemed bigger than the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>But fifty years have passed now, and the fact is that the Lord s word is trustworthy.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>We surely don t need to worry about our living.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>We don t need to have any anxiety about our necessities as long as we seek after Him.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>THE PRACTICAL KINGDOM LIFE</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>You have to realize that the practical kingdom life is the meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>If we seek after His kingdom, yet we don t meet, what kind of kingdom is this?</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The practical kingdom is the meeting life.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>To meet is to seek the kingdom first.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>To attend the meeting is to seek the kingdom first.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>DOING THE WILL OF GOD</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Now we come back to the matter of doing the will of God.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>We live on this earth, and our goal, our purpose, is to do the will of our Father.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>How could we know His will?</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>There is no other way except by attending the meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>I can assure you that without coming to the meeting it would be more than hard for you to know God s will.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>The way to know God s will is to come to the meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>When you begin to miss the meeting, you begin to miss God s will.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Then you would begin to go back to that miserable life under Satan s tyranny from which you have been delivered already.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>So we must do whatever we can not to miss any meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>If this would jeopardize our job, let it jeopardize it.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Coming to the meeting must be first.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>I have never seen one saint who eventually really suffered because of coming to the meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>I have never seen one.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Rather I can testify I have seen thousands in the past who kept coming to the meetings and who were much blessed by the Lord, not only spiritually but even physically.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>The Lord is faithful, and His promise is trustworthy.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>OUR DESTINY</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Saints, be encouraged and be assured.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>This is not only the right way, this is also the unique way.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>We have no choice.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>To be a human being, you have to be a Christian.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>To be a Christian, you have to come to the meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>There is no choice.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>This is our destiny.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>To come to the meeting is not only our destination, it is our destiny.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Our Father predestined us this way.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>To come together is our destiny.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>If we go along with God s predestination, surely we will be under His blessing.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>If not, we are kicking against the pricks, and we will suffer.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Some might consider that they sacrifice too much time to come to the meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>They might consider that if they used all their time to do business they would make more money.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>Let them try four or five years and they will see the suffering.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>I have seen too many cases like this.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>This thought is quite deceiving and quite misleading.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>We have to stand on the trustworthy word in God s Holy Scripture.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>We have to trust in His promise, and we have to obey His commandment to come to the meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>If you come to the meeting you are keeping His predestination, and the destiny of blessing will come to you.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>It will come not only to you, one generation, but perhaps even to the third generation, or generation after generation.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>Both you and your children will be under God s blessing.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>This is our destiny, dear saints.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>To meet together is not a small thing.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>It is our destiny.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>We cannot have any other choice.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>Here we know the will of God and here we do the will of God and eventually we fulfill His purpose.</S>
