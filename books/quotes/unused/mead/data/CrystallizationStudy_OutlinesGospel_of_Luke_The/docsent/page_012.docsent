   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>We must learn to hide ourselves in the secret place of the Most High, to hide ourselves in the ascended Christ, taking Him as our dwelling place Psa 91:1; 90:1-11; John 16:33.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>In His heavenly ministry in ascension, Christ as the life-giving Spirit is transforming us with the riches of the Triune God so that we may become a palanquin, the moving vessel of Christ, the carriage of Christ, the car of Christ, for the move of Christ in and for the Body of Christ S. S. 3:9-10; cf.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>2 Cor 2:12-17: We are rebuilt with the Divine Trinity so that our external structure is the resurrected and ascended humanity of Jesus, and our interior decoration is our love for the Lord.</S>

   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Just as the high priest in the Old Testament bore the names of the twelve tribes of Israel on his shoulders and on his heart, Christ as our High Priest is bearing us on His shoulders His strength and holding us on His heart His love Exo 28:9-10, 12, 21, 29: He is a merciful and faithful High Priest in the things pertaining to God Heb 2:17 , a High Priest who is able to sympathize with us in our weaknesses 4:15 .</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Although Christ as the High Priest is taking care of us, we all have our own thought and feeling as to how He should care for us; many times we do not know what is best for us or what the reason is for certain things; only the Lord as the High Priest knows the reason, and His care for us is always positive Rom 8:28-29.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Ultimately, Christ as the High Priest is caring for God s need and interests: God will listen to our prayer when our prayer to God is toward Christ, the kingdom of God, and the house of God as the goal in God s economy 1 Kings 8:48; Dan 6:10.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>No matter for whom we are praying, our prayers should be aimed at the interests of God, that is, at Christ and the church as God s interests on earth, for the fulfilling of God s economy Eph 5:32; 6:17-18.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Christ s heavenly ministry as the High Priest in ascension consummates in the New Jerusalem, which will be the mingling of divinity with humanity to be the very expansion, enlargement, increase, and expression of the Triune God in humanity forever as the ultimate goal of God s economy Rev 21:2, 9-11.</S>
