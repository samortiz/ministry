   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>RELIGION BEING TO DO ANYTHING</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>APART FROM THE INDWELLING SPIRIT</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Religion is to do anything apart from the indwelling Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>To love others apart from the Spirit is religion, and not to love others apart from the Spirit is also religion.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Thus, it is not easy to fully come out of religion.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>After hearing a message, we often make up our mind that we will change.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Husbands make up their minds to be nicer to their wives; saints make up their minds to function in every meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>All this is religion.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>However, to make up our mind not to do anything after hearing a message is also religion.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>To make up our mind apart from the Spirit is religion.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Whatever we do apart from the Spirit is religion.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Only what we do by the indwelling Spirit is not religion.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>THE SECRET TO BE SAVED FROM RELIGION</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>BEING TO UNCEASINGLY PRAY</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The secret to be saved from religion is to unceasingly pray 1 Thes 5:17 .</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The Bible likens our prayer to breathing Lam 3:55-56 , which never ceases.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Whatever we are doing, we are still breathing.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Likewise, we all must learn how to unceasingly pray.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Unceasing prayer cannot be by our mind; we must learn to pray by and in our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Ephesians 6:18 says, Praying at every time in spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>When we learn to pray in our spirit, we will be able to pray without ceasing.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>We should not care primarily for our mind, emotion, or will.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Instead, we need to always exercise our spirit, turn to our spirit, and return to our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Setting aside specific times to pray will help us to exercise our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>When we begin to pray, we may not be in the spirit, but if we keep praying, after a short while we will be in our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The more we pray, the more we will be in spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Eventually, we will become a person who is in spirit all the time.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>BECOMING STRONG IN SPIRIT TO BE PREPARED</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>FOR THE LORD S MOVE</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>We may be stirred up, burdened, and ready to go for the Lord s move to Europe or to a college campus in the United States.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>However, before we go, we have to learn to pray to stir up our spirit, turn our being to our spirit, and call our being back into our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>We have to become a person who is strong not primarily in our mind, emotion, or will but in our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Eventually, we will become those who live, walk, and do everything in spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>NEEDING TO BE CONTROLLED BY THE SPIRIT</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>It is good to be stirred up, but we must learn to be stirred up in our spirit, not in our emotion.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>If we do not exercise our spirit to control our excitement, we will act foolishly.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>We should not go to our college campus and shout what we have seen, nor should we meet with the pastor of a denomination to tell him that whatever he does is religion.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>This kind of excitement is also in religion.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>We need to be stirred up in the spirit and allow the spirit to control our excitement.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Nothing controls us as much as our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>To be wise, proper, bold, or frank, we need to be in the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>When we are in the spirit, we will know the right time to shout and the right time to be quiet.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>When we are in the spirit, we will know the right time to speak at length and the right time not to say a word.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The spirit tells us when to speak and when to be silent.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>We only need to follow the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>THE GRACE OF OUR LORD JESUS CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>BEING WITH OUR SPIRIT</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Galatians 6:18, the last verse of the book, says, The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit, brothers.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Amen.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Galatians opens with our being delivered from the present evil age, and it closes with the grace of the Lord Jesus Christ being with our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>We all need to be delivered from the evil religious age, and we all need to enjoy the grace of the Lord Jesus in our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>We should not care for any kind of religion or even for spirituality or overcoming sins but only for the enjoyment of the Lord Jesus in our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>In our spirit, instead of regulation, ritual, doctrine, or knowledge, there is grace.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Grace is the Lord Jesus as our enjoyment.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Christ, the Spirit, and grace all denote one person our wonderful Savior.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>As Christ, He is in the heavens; as the Spirit, He is within us; as grace, He is our enjoyment.</S>
