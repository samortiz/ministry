        <h2 class="head2">All Redeemed Things Being before God</h2>
<p>In Revelation all the redeemed things are before God. In chapters 4 and 5 the four living creatures who are before God represent not only creation but also redeemed creation. In 4:9-11 the four living creatures give glory and honor and thanks to Him who sits upon the throne, to the God who has created all things, and in 5:9 the four living creatures sing praise to the redeeming Lamb, who was slain and has purchased for God by His blood men out of every tribe and tongue and people and nation. In verse 13 every creature that is in heaven and on the earth and under the earth and on the sea and all things in them says, &ldquo;To Him who sits upon the throne and to the Lamb be the blessing and the honor and the glory and the might.&rdquo; The four living creatures are before God and praise Him as representatives, and all things, which were not merely created but also redeemed, are before God. On the cross Christ accomplished redemption for all creation. God redeemed all creation through the death of Christ on the cross.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Redeemed Creation Hoping to Be Restored</h2>
<p>Because all things have been redeemed by the cross of Christ, they hope to be freed from the slavery of corruption, the result of Satan&rsquo;s rebellion and man&rsquo;s fall, into the freedom of the glory of the redeemed children of God (Rom. 8:21); that is, all creation hopes to be restored (Acts 3:21). During the coming restoration, all things will be freed from the effect and defilement of Satan&rsquo;s rebellion and man&rsquo;s fall. The condition of all things will match Isaiah&rsquo;s words: &ldquo;The light of the moon will be like the light of the sun, / And the light of the sun will be sevenfold, like the light of seven days&rdquo;; &ldquo;the wilderness becomes a fruitful field, / And the fruitful field is considered to be a forest&rdquo;; and &ldquo;the wolf and the lamb will feed as one, / And the lion will eat straw like the ox... / They will not harm nor destroy&rdquo; (Isa. 30:26; 32:15; 65:25). All things will be restored because they have been redeemed by Christ. All things will be freed from the slavery of corruption, which was brought in by Satan&rsquo;s rebellion and man&rsquo;s fall, through the redemption that Christ accomplished on the cross by shedding His blood. His redemption reconciles all things to God and brings them into the freedom of the glory of the redeemed children of God.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Redeemed Man Being Higher<br />
and More Important Than All Things</h2>
<p>Even though the redemption that Christ accomplished on the cross was for all things as well as man, the primary focus of redemption is on man. Man is the most important thing that God created through Christ and for Christ; hence, man is also the most important thing that God redeemed through Christ and for Christ. God determined in His plan that man would be the most important creature and also the center of all created things. Everything that has been redeemed is a means to express the glory of Christ, but redeemed man is more than just a means to express the glory of Christ. Redeemed man is also a vessel to contain Christ&rsquo;s life with Christ&rsquo;s nature (Rom. 9:21-24). All things were reconciled to God through the cross of Christ, but only man also received the life of God through the cross of Christ. Christ redeemed all things on the cross so that all things could express the riches of His glory, but He redeemed man so that man would also be filled with the fullness of His life (Eph. 3:19). All things were redeemed by Christ, but all things did not receive His life and nature; hence, they cannot be the same as Christ. However, through Christ&rsquo;s redemption, man also received Christ&rsquo;s life and nature in order to be the same as Christ and to be His partner in glory (2 Pet. 1:3-4; Heb. 3:14). In relation to creation the death of Christ redeemed all things, but in relation to man the death of Christ gave man the divine life also. Man is the highest and most important creature redeemed by God.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Purpose of Redemption Being to Impart Life</h2>
<p>Christ terminated all things on the cross in order to clear up the defilement in the universe, and Christ redeemed all things on the cross in order to impart His life into man. Among the things that were redeemed, only man received the life of God. Christ accomplished redemption in order to impart His divine, uncreated life into created man. This is the central purpose of redemption. The redemption that Christ accomplished on the cross is to recover man and all things that were lost in the fall so that man could be gained as a vessel and God could impart His life into man.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Christ&rsquo;s Redemptive Death Opening the Way<br />
for Redeemed Man to Receive the Divine Life</h2>
<p>Christ&rsquo;s redemptive death on the cross recovered and redeemed all things, including man, and also imparted the divine life to redeemed man. Christ imparted His divine, uncreated life into the man whom He redeemed through His death. In His redemptive death the divine life in Christ was released and imparted into man. The death of Christ was an all-inclusive death through which the Creator passed so that His uncreated, divine life could be released. In His death created man also died in order to receive the Creator&rsquo;s uncreated life. Before Christ&rsquo;s death on the cross the Creator could not be joined with created man. However, Christ&rsquo;s redemptive death joined the Creator with created man so that the life of the Creator could enter into created man.</p>
<p>This joining in death can be likened to grafting. A tree that produces sweet oranges has little in common with a tree that produces bitter oranges, but through a grafting cut that involves death, the two trees can be joined. Through a grafting cut, the life of a sweet orange tree can flow into a branch from a bitter orange tree. In order for the sweet orange tree to release its life, there is a need for a cut of death, but in order for a branch from the bitter orange tree to receive the life of the sweet orange tree, there is also a need for cutting. Both trees need a grafting cut of death before the life of one can become the life of the other. Christ&rsquo;s redemptive death, which joined and connected God the Creator to man the creature, is likened to grafting in Romans 11:17-24. In and through Christ&rsquo;s wonderful death, the uncreated life in God can enter into created man to be his life.</p>
<p>According to the Bible, the release of the divine, uncreated life in Christ required both creation and redemption in order for this life to enter into created man. In creation God &ldquo;calls the things not being as being&rdquo; (4:17), but creation alone is not enough for Him to be able to impart His life to created man. God created all things out of nothing, but He did not impart His life into all the things He created. All things were created by God, but not all things have the life of the Creator. The life of the Creator entered into created man only through redemption. God&rsquo;s redemption &ldquo;gives life to the dead&rdquo; (v. 17). Furthermore, created man had to pass through death and resurrection in Christ in order to receive the divine life. Death and resurrection are implied in the redemptive death of Christ and in His divine life. The redemptive death of Christ brought created man into death so that the uncreated, divine life of Christ could enter into created man. Christ&rsquo;s redemption makes it possible for created man to receive the life of the Creator and be raised from the dead through faith to become a new creation.</p>
<p>The life of God the Creator can enter into created man because of Christ&rsquo;s redemptive death on the cross. Christ&rsquo;s death removes the barrier between man and God and enables man to draw near to God. His death also brings redeemed man into union with God so that God and man can be joined as one in the fellowship of God&rsquo;s uncreated, divine life. In Christ&rsquo;s death both God and man experienced death so that God&rsquo;s uncreated life could flow out of the creating and redeeming God into created and redeemed man. Without the death of Christ, the life in God would not have been released, and without the death of created man, God&rsquo;s life could not have entered into man even when it had been released. Both Christ and man had to die in order for the divine life to flow out of God into man. Both Christ and man had to be wounded before the life of God could enter into man.</p>
<p>Blood transfusion is an illustration of this. In order for blood to flow out of person A to be transfused into person B, both A and B must be cut. Both A and B must be cut in order for A&rsquo;s blood to become B&rsquo;s blood. Both God and man were cut in Christ&rsquo;s redemptive death on the cross so that God&rsquo;s life could flow into man. When the Lord died on the cross, He accomplished redemption, and His all-inclusive death &ldquo;wounded&rdquo; both God the Creator and man the creature. Thus, the uncreated life in the Creator could flow into created man and become his life. The Creator and the creature were joined not only in His death but also in the life that flowed out through His death.</p>

 	<h2>Noise Words</h2>
 	<p>Common words, such as "and", "is", "but", and "the", also known as noise words, are bypassed in a search. The search string, the Spirit &amp; who, would result in an error since who, which stands by itself, is a noise word. The following is a list of noise words:</p>
	<p>$, a, also, an, and, another, any, are, as, at, be, because, been, being, both, but, by, came, can, did, do, each, for, has, had, he, have, her, here, him, himself, his, how, if, in, into, is, it, like, make, me, might, much, my, of, on, or, our, out, over, said, should, since, some, still, such, take, than, that, the, their, them, then, there, these, they, this, those, to, too, very, was, way, we, well, were, what, where, which, while, who, with, would, you, your</p>

<div id="myModalRanking" class="reveal-modal">
  	<h2>Ranking</h2>
  	<p>Rank is a value from <strong>0</strong> to <strong>1000</strong> indicating how closely a match scored or ranked against the original search string. Rank values are affected by the following factors:</p>
		<ol>
            <li><span>The total number of occurrences of the original search words/phrases in a portion of a book.</span></li>
            <li><span>Content that includes the search words in close proximity to each other are ranked above those that do not. Therefore, a portion of a book that has the search words in close proximity may have a higher ranking than another portion of a book that has a higher hit count but the words are not in close proximity to one another. Therefore, we also include a search word hit count for reference.</span></li>
            <li><span>The rank values are relative to each other. Therefore, it is not possible to interpret the RANK value as a percentage or group the rank values into high/medium/low ranges. Think of rank as a method to order the results for a specific search.</span></li>

<div id="myModalScope" class="reveal-modal">
 	<h2>Search Scope</h2>
 	<h3>Include All Word Forms</h3>
	<p>This option breaks out the search string into its individual words and generates all conjugations and declensions for each word in the search phrase. A search on the word, dwell, would search for dwell, dwelling, dwelling's, dwells, dwelt, and dwelled.</p>
	<p>There is no need to use ^ (inflectional search) or * (prefix search) when using the Include all word forms search scope.</p> 
	<h3>Specified Word Forms</h3>
	<p>This option searches for exact matches of the specified words or phrases used in the search string. Use of ^ (inflectional search) with a particular word in the search string will broaden the search for that given word in that all conjugations and declensions for that word will be searched. Similarly, use of * (prefix search) with a particular word in the search string will broaden the search for that given word in that all words with that prefix will be searched as well.</p> 
	<h3>Note</h3>
	<p>Common words, such as "and", "is", "but", and "the", also known as noise words, are bypassed in a search. A list of all noise words is as follows:</p>
	<p>$, about, after, all, also, an,and, another, any, are, as, at, be, because, been, before, being, between, both, but, by, came, can, come, could, did, do, each, for, from, get, got, has, had, he, have, her, here, him, himself, his, how, if, in, into, is, it, like, make, many, me, might, more, most, much, must, my, never, now, of, on, only, or, other, our, out, over, said, same, see, should, since, some, still, such, take, than, that, the, their, them, then, there, these, they, this, those, through, to, too, under, up, very, was, way, we, well, were, what, where, which, while, who, with, would, you, your</p>
