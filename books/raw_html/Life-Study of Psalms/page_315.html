<H2 CLASS=HEAD1>VII. THE PRAISE OF THE RETURNED CAPTIVES<br>IN THEIR GOING UP TO ZION<br>CONCERNING THE GREAT THINGS<br>WHICH JEHOVAH HAD DONE FOR THEM</H2><P>Psalm 126 is the praise of the returned captives in their going up to Zion concerning the great things which Jehovah had done for them.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>A. They Being like Dreamers Filled<br>Joyfully with Laughter in Their Mouth<br>and with a Ringing Shout in Their Tongue</H2><P>The psalmist said that when Jehovah turned the captivity of Zion, they were like those who dream. Their mouth was filled with laughter and their tongue with a ringing shout (vv. 1-2a). "At that time they said among the nations,/Jehovah has done great things for them./Jehovah has done great things for us;/We are joyful" (vv. 2b-3).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>B. Asking Jehovah to Turn Again Their Captivity</H2><P>"Turn again, O Jehovah, our captivity/Like the streams in the south" (v. 4). Although some of the people had returned, many remained in captivity, and here the psalmist prayed for them. In his prayer the psalmist asked Jehovah to turn again their captivity like the streams in the south. In contrast to the streams in the north, which may be frozen, the streams in the south are flowing.</P><P>"Those who sow in tears / Will reap with a ringing shout. /He who goes forth and weeps, / Bearing seed for scattering, /Will no doubt come in with a ringing shout,/Bearing his sheaves with him" (vv. 5-6). I believe that this refers to the captives. In a human sense, their captivity in foreign countries was a suffering. In a divine sense, however, it was a sowing through their preaching to the Gentiles concerning God. Apparently, God's people were captives; actually, they were preachers. Many of the captives, such as Daniel and his companions, were excellent preachers. Their preaching was a sowing. As a result, a number of Gentiles were brought to God through these captives. For example, Nebuchadnezzar had to admit to Daniel and his companions that their God was the true God (Dan. 2:47; 3:28-29; 4:34-35). This indicates that the captives sowed the seed of the knowledge of God among the heathen.</P><P>Verse 5 of Psalm 126 speaks of reaping with a ringing shout, and verse 6, of coming in with a ringing shout. A ringing shout is a shout of joy, a joyful noise. Whereas the captives sowed in tears, they returned with a ringing shout, bearing their "sheaves" with them.</P>
