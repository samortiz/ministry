<P>There are two great communities in this world: one is the world community, and the other is the community of those who are saved in Christ. Being saved is being delivered out of the world community which opposes God, which is sinful and unclean, and entering into the community of Christ. This is why we have to be baptized. By baptism we are saved. (Of course, we must first believe in the Lord. Those who do not believe in the Lord cannot be saved.) Mark 16:16 says, "He who believes and is baptized shall be saved." Baptism signals a deliverance; it is a great deliverance. It delivers us from the world and everything that is of the world. But baptism is not only a deliverance out of something; it is also an entry into something. Baptism is a grand entry. It is to enter into Christ and enter into His death.</P><P>Everyone who believes will have eternal life because of the blood of the Lord Jesus. We cannot deny this. However, we are saved from the world because of our entry into the ark. Baptism signifies that we are delivered from the world community. Suppose someone asks if you have believed in the Lord. You have to say yes; your sins have been forgiven because of the blood of the Lord. The Bible says that he who has the Son of God has life. You may know that you have life, and you may be very clear that you have believed in the Son of God as your Savior. But suppose you lose your temper, argue, and even fight with two or three brothers. After the fight, if you check with yourself, you will realize that you are still a believer and that you are still saved. You will not have any doubt about this. But the other brothers will doubt that you are saved. What does this mean? I can tell you that many people are qualified to go to heaven, but they are not qualified to live on earth. Many people are qualified to live before God, but are not qualified to live before their family. Many people are good enough to live in heaven, but are not good enough to live on earth. This is why you cannot allow others to baptize you into the water or sprinkle water on your forehead based on what you have believed. You must know yourself what baptism is, before you can be baptized. You must know that you have been delivered from the world already. Baptism is a declaration and an announcement to the world that you are no longer joined to the world and that you are no longer standing on its side. You are delivered from the world, and baptism is your declaration that you are standing on the side of Christ from now on.</P><P>I am not trying to persuade you to be baptized. I am showing you that before you are baptized, you have to realize that there are two opposing camps, the camp of Adam and the camp of Christ. There is no middle ground between these two camps. At the time of Noah, God declared that the world was His enemy and that the world was at enmity with God. He appointed a way of salvationâ€”everyone who entered the ark stood on God's side and obeyed God. It is interesting to see that the Bible refers to the entry into the ark and the deliverance from the flood as a type of baptism. Therefore, we have to speak this word to all the ones who are about to be baptized, as well as to all the other brothers and sisters. Many people are baptized already, and a good number are also baptized among us. Why were you baptized? Was it because it was a church practice, a church ritual, a commandment of the Bible, a sign of seriousness in being a Christian, or because other Christians were doing it? Baptism is turning one's back to the world and facing Christ. It is being delivered from the world community and entering into the community of Christ. There is no middle ground between the world and Christ. There was a door on the ark. This door signifies that everything within the door was in the realm of Christ, and everything outside this door was in the realm of the world. If we see this, we will not need anyone to come and tell us at the time of baptism that we need to change ourselves in certain matters. We will know what to do. We will not have to deal with the world like pulling out hairs, plucking them out one by one; instead we can shave them off all at once. It is a pity that many among us do not see this.</P><P>We try to change the world, but God is giving us a new world. No human method, such as religious dogmas, literature, science, philosophy, or moral teachings, can change this world. God shows us that even though the world is lovable and enjoyable, it is God's enemy. Living in the world means that you cherish the hope that it will change. Yet God has no hope of changing the world. He has no other way of dealing with the world than to judge it. For the world to improve and be reformed through human methods would take many many years. Thank God that He needs only to wash the world with water and it will become the new earth. In the days of Noah, God washed the world with water. In the future He will burn it with fire. Are we like Lot, tarrying in Sodom and Gomorrah, waiting to be burned by fire? Or are we untouched by the world? Unfortunately, many are like Lot's wife; they live in the world. Are we living in the world, or are we letting all these things go and looking forward to the new heaven and new earth, where righteousness dwells?</P><P>On top of the ark was a window or a "light-inlet." This word is used in the Old Testament twenty-four times. The word is translated as noon twenty-three times. This is the only place where it is translated as window or "light-inlet." The light that passed through this window was not a weak light, but a bright light. This is living in the light of God.</P>
