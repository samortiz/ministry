<p class="bold">WEEK 2 — DAY 4</p><h2 class="uhead1">Matthew 3:1-3, 7, 11</h2><p class="bold">1 &nbsp;Now in those days John the Baptist appeared, preaching in the wilderness of Judea</p><p class="bold">2 &nbsp;And saying, Repent, for the kingdom of the heavens has drawn near.</p><p class="bold">3 &nbsp;For this is he who was spoken of through Isaiah the prophet, saying, “A voice of one crying in the wilderness, Prepare the way of the Lord; make straight His paths.”</p><p>7 &nbsp;But when he saw many of the Pharisees and Sadducees coming to his baptism, he said to them, Offspring of vipers, who prompted you to flee from the coming wrath?</p><p class="bold">11 &nbsp;I baptize you in water unto repentance, but He who is coming after me is stronger than I, whose sandals I am not worthy to carry. He Himself will baptize you in the Holy Spirit and fire.</p><h2 class="uhead1">Portions from Life-study Messages</h2><p>Matthew chapter three covers the recommendation and the anointing of the King.…John came preaching…in the wilderness, in a “wild” way, not keeping any old regulations [Matt. 3:4].…The wilderness here indicates that the new way of God’s New Testament economy is contrary to religion and culture. It also indicates that nothing old was left and that something new was about to be built up. The dispensation of law was terminated by the coming of John the Baptist (11:13; Luke 16:16).…[His preaching] was the beginning of the gospel (Mark 1:1-5). Hence, the dispensation of grace began with John.</p><p>John’s message was, “Repent, for the kingdom of the heavens has drawn near” (Matt. 3:2).…The first significant word in this verse is the word “repent.”…To repent is to have a change of mind issuing in regret, to have a turn in purpose.…The second crucial word in verse 2 is kingdom.…[John the Baptist] did not say to repent that we might go to heaven or even to obtain salvation. He said that we must repent for the kingdom. The kingdom denotes a kind of reign, rule. Before we were saved, we were not under any rule…we did not have a king. But after we turned to the Lord, He became our King.…Today we are the kingdom of this King. The third crucial word in verse 2 is heavens.…The term “the heavens”…refers to the highest heaven, which according to the Bible is the third heaven…where God’s throne is.…This heavenly reign must descend to earth to be the authority over the earth.</p><p>John’s word [in verse 7] to the Pharisees and Sadducees who came to him reveals our need to have our nature changed.…Because the age had changed, it was no longer a matter of the natural birth, but of the second birth, the spiritual birth.</p><p>[In verse 11,] according to the context, fire here is…of the lake of fire (Rev. 20:15), where the unbelievers will suffer eternal perdition.…John’s baptism was only for repentance, to usher people to faith in the Lord. The Lord’s baptism is either for eternal life in the Holy Spirit or for eternal perdition in fire.…To be baptized in water is to have our natural life and our past terminated. To be baptized in the Spirit is to have a new start by being germinated with the divine life. This germination is only possible through Christ as the life-giving Spirit.</p><p>[The last part of verse 3 says,] “Prepare the way of the Lord; make straight His paths.”…[This] is to change people’s minds, to turn their minds toward the Lord and make their hearts right, to cause every part and avenue of their heart to be straightened by the Lord through repentance for the kingdom of the heavens (Luke 1:16-17).…The fact that John paved the way and straightened the paths means that his ministry dealt with the mind and the heart.…Genuine repentance prepares the way and straightens the paths…for the Lord as the King to enter in. (Life-study of Matthew, pp. 96, 99, 106-108, 113-114, 118-120)</p><p>Suggested daily reading: Life-study of Matthew, pp. 93-120; Hymns: #744</p><p>Enlightenment and Inspiration:</p>
