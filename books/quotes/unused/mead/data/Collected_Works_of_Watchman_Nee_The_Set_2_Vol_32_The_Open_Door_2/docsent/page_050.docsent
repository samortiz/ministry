   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Lung-Ju-Tsai, Shensi Province</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Dear brothers and sisters in the Lord:</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>I left Sian and traveled through the churches in Shing-Ping, Shang-Jen, Mei County, Kwei-Ya-Jen, and Sin-Chuang and met many brothers and sisters.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Although they live in remote and inaccessible mountain regions, they love the Lord very much, and I was very touched.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>I spent two weeks on the road and then returned to Sian.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>I stayed in Sian for a week, going to the houses of the believers and fellowshipping with them.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>This has reaped much benefit for me.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>On July 16 I went from Sian to Shang-Chow Union.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>I stayed there for five or six days and conducted meetings every morning, afternoon, and evening.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>They all witnessed the Lord's blessing.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>On the twenty-second I came to the church in Lung-Ju-Tsai.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Let me relate a little concerning the condition among the Tsinghai natives of this inland region.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Four years ago the Lord led me into the inland regions of Tsinghai to preach the gospel to the natives.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>I was born in Honan, and prior to this, I had never traveled far.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>In 1932 the Lord directed Brother Duan Chai-ju and myself to go to Tsinghai.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>We set out on September 11, 1932, from Shantung and walked by foot to the west through the provinces of Hopeh, Honan, Shansi, Shensi, and Kansu.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>In 1934 the Lord led us into Tsinghai and the western part of Tsinghai to preach the gospel to the natives.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The interior of Tsinghai province is inhabited exclusively by nomadic tribesmen.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Their cultures and habits are vastly different from ours, the Han Chinese.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>I spent about a year in Tsinghai and cannot enumerate all the benefits and help I received through my stay.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>It has been almost seven years since I was commissioned by the Lord to preach the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Everywhere we went, we saw the Lord's power, glory, and wonderful work.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>When I consider all these things, my heart is filled with joy.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Hallelujah.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Praise our precious Lord Jesus!</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>I will probably not be able to stay here for long.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Later, I will go west again.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The meetings here will begin September 1.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>I ask the brothers and sisters in the Lord to pray much for me.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Peace to you in the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Brother Hu Tien-en, August 24</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Gao-Mi, Shantung Province</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Dear brothers and sisters in the Lord:</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>In April, I related the condition here to you briefly.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>I trust that you have remembered us in your prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>There has not been much progress within the past few months.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>We do not know how to obey and how to deny ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>There is still much need for your prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Presently, we have Bible study meetings on Monday and Wednesday.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>We are studying the truth concerning the church.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>On Friday we have a prayer meeting, and on the Lord's Day we hope to start a bread-breaking meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>There are many difficulties, and we are still praying.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>In everything we are learning.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>We only have a little spark within our heart, and the enemy is already becoming indignant.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>He is attacking us from all sides through small matters.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Please remember the church in Gao-Mi and your weak brother often.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>In April Brother Chang Tze-jieh had some meetings in Gao-Mi, and one brother was saved.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>His condition is very good now, but we still need much edification.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Brother Witness Lee may come later.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>We can only ask the Lord of the harvest to send His laborers to come quickly and to accomplish His work so that His name may receive much glory.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>May the Lord's grace abound.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Brothers in the Lord,</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Wang Shu-ge and Hu Shen-fu, August 15</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Foochow</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>The various places in Fukien are at peace, except Foochow, which experiences occasional air raids.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>There was a large-scale air bombing in the city the day before yesterday.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>All of the neighboring houses were destroyed.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Our house was shaken and slightly damaged, but on the whole, it was preserved.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>From this we see the Lord's care of His people.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>He is worthy to be praised!</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>We have moved into Chang-Chien-Shan.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>If there are no further changes in Foochow, we will remain.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>If we move, we will inform you.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>All the brothers and sisters in Foochow are well.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Some have moved to the upper regions in the rural areas.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>The Lord has brought the gospel to the remote regions through these tribulations.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Greetings to the brothers and sisters in Chungking.</S>
