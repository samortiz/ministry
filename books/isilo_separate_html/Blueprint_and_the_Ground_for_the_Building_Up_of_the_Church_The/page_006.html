Needing to Be for God&rsquo;s Building</h2>
<p>God&rsquo;s intention is to gain the builded church; therefore, the work of the apostles is for the building up of the church. We need to examine ourselves in order to know how much of the reality of the building of the church we have. We first need to ask how much we are built up. Building is different from edification. Edification is to make that which is improper in us proper, but building is to join us together with others. It may be difficult for us to be joined to others, but through building we are joined with others. Building not only makes us proper but also delivers us from individuality and joins us with others. Hence, the first question we need to answer concerns our relationship with others. With whom do we have the real building? Are we built together with all the saints? Second, we have to ask whether our work builds up the church. Are we satisfied with merely leading people to salvation so that they are regenerated, transformed, and changed into God&rsquo;s image? Is there a building element in our work? After we lead people to salvation and help them experience transformation so that they can become valuable material&mdash;gold, pearls, and precious stones&mdash;we need to help them to be built up. However, we often do a work only of edification, not a work of building.</p>
<p>The Bible presents a clear picture that God not only wants to gain valuable materials, but He also wants these materials to be built up into a dwelling place. God does not want these valuable materials to be individual items for exhibition. He wants these valuable materials to be built up into a dwelling place. Hence, we must ask whether we have been built up and whether the result of our work can complete this building. Even if we are satisfied that those under our care are gold, pearls, and precious stones, God is not satisfied. Gold is precious, pearls are lovely, and precious stones are beautiful, but God is not satisfied with just this. God wants a building. While He certainly does not want anything of clay, He wants gold, pearls, and precious stones that have been built up.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Building Being a Matter of Today,<br />
Not of the Future</h2>
<p>Ephesians speaks particularly concerning the church and uses many spiritual utterances, including, &ldquo;blessed us with every spiritual blessing in the heavenlies&rdquo; (1:3), &ldquo;chose us in Him before the foundation of the world&rdquo; (v. 4), &ldquo;sealed with the Holy Spirit&rdquo; (v. 13), &ldquo;His Body, the fullness of the One who fills all in all&rdquo; (v. 23), and &ldquo;being built together into a dwelling place of God in spirit&rdquo; (2:22). Many believers focus their attention on the spiritual blessings, on choosing, and on sealing, but they do not pay enough attention to the building of the Body. We cannot treat the words concerning the church as abstract or as being spiritual and heavenly and only for the future. If the things concerning the church were indeed for the future, for the heavens, God would have no need to speak about them, because there are many things in heaven that God does not make known to us. God makes known to us the things concerning the church because they are for today, for the present. However, where is this building? Where is the builded church today? There are groups of Christians everywhere. It is not hard to find lovers of the Lord, and many believers pursue spirituality, but where is the builded church?</p>
<p>In 1 Corinthians 3 the apostle Paul says that we are God&rsquo;s fellow workers for building the saints into God&rsquo;s temple (vv. 9, 17). Therefore, this building work is not something of the future. If it were something of the future, then 1 Timothy 3:15 would not make sense. This verse says, &ldquo;If I delay, I write that you may know how one ought to conduct himself in the house of God, which is the church of the living God.&rdquo; If this house were not for today, why would Paul tell Timothy how to conduct himself in the house of God? If there were no such building on the earth, how could there be a house of God? If building is for the future, God&rsquo;s house would also be for the future; God would not have a house on the earth in this age, and we could only hope that God would have a house in the future. Such an interpretation is erroneous, because today on the earth God has a house, and this house is the church of the living God.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE CENTER OF THE BIBLE BEING<br />
THE HOUSE OF GOD</h2>
<h2 class="head2">The Center of the Old Testament<br />
Being the Tabernacle and the Temple of God</h2>
<p>On the one hand, Genesis 3 through Revelation 20 speaks negatively of a serpent bringing in sin and death and positively of Christ the Son of God bringing in righteousness and life. On the other hand, however, the Bible speaks of the house of God, the temple of God. The center of the Old Testament is the tabernacle and the temple. The tabernacle is the precursor of the temple. The temple and the tabernacle are actually one. The tabernacle was erected in Exodus after the children of Israel left Egypt. From the time of their exodus from Egypt, the tabernacle was among them. From the time the tabernacle was erected until the temple was built to replace the tabernacle, the move of Israel was focused on the tabernacle. In the age of the kings, the temple was the center of Israel. When the temple was built, the glory of God filled the temple, and the temple had God&rsquo;s presence (1 Kings 8:10-11). Later, the temple was destroyed and became desolate, and the children of Israel were taken into captivity and scattered. After a period of time, the temple was rebuilt and remained through the end of the Old Testament age.</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_005.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_007.html">Next</a> </body></html>
