In the New Testament, God's heart and will in His economy is revealed in the books of Ephesians, Hebrews, and Romans
The purpose of God made by Him in Christ is such an eternal purpose, and this is according to the counsel of God's will
We may think that marriage is a great matter, but compared to God's will in the divine revelation it is a small thing
Some may seek to know whether it is the Lord's will to buy a certain pair of shoes in the morning or in the afternoon
The church as the Body of Christ is the enlargement of Christ, and this enlargement of Christ is Christ's expression
The processed Triune God is embodied in Christ, and this Christ today needs a Body for His enlargement and His expression
God's heart and will is also to have a church to be the organic Body of Christ for the manifestation of His multifarious wisdom
We should focus our entire being on God's will to have the church, which is the Body of the embodiment of the processed Triune God
How could this Body of Christ, the church, which is the enlargement and expression of God's embodiment, come into being?
Christ came to do God's will by replacing all the sacrifices and offerings in order that He could be everything to us
By this will we have been sanctified through the offering of Christ's body once for all, to enjoy and partake of Him as our everything
We partake of Christ as our Apostle, typified by Moses and Joshua, leading us into the good land, the all inclusive Christ
Christ is our God in His humanity, and He is our Apostle bringing God to us and our High Priest bringing us to God
He is all the riches, the contents, the bequests, of the New Testament, and He is our Forerunner, the Accomplisher, who has run the course
We do not have the Old Testament sin offering, trespass offering, meal offering, burnt offering, or peace offering; we have Christ
We must offer our body, and then we must have our mind, which is part of our soul, renewed, dealt with thoroughly
By doing this we exercise many gifts, and each one of us will become fully occupied in the exercise of our gifts
If we are such persons, we will have the practice of the Body life and a life of the highest virtues by God's divine life and love
Try to enjoy Christ, not individualistically but corporately, and try to live a corporate life, a Body life, a church life
If you live a corporate life, however, you will enjoy Christ in His fullness, which eventually is the church, the very expression of Christ
We all have to see that God wants a Body, and to be a part of the Body we have to take Christ as our everything
We must continue to go to bring all these nourished young Christians together to form a group that they may do the same thing as we do
From the verses that we pray-read in the morning, we can compose a prophecy for the Lord's Day morning meeting
The prayer of the Lord in John 17 shows that the organic oneness of the Body of Christ is the organic oneness in the Triune God
No word can adequately explain it, but there is the example of the divine oneness among the Three in the Godhead
The Father is in the Son and in the Spirit; the Son is in the Father and in the Spirit; and the Spirit is in the Father and in the Son
Before we believed in the Lord Jesus, we were separate from the coinhering Triune God, but now we are in the Triune God
In the entire universe there is such a oneness, and this oneness is that the believers are mingled and wrapped up with the Triune God
We are in the Father, in the Son, and in the Spirit at the same time because the Three of the Godhead mutually indwell one another
The divine oneness was once only among the Three of the Godhead, but now we the believers have joined this oneness
In verse 21 the Lord prays that we would be one so that the world may believe that the Father has sent the Son
Suppose that we are meeting together in the wonderful way of being not only one with one another but also one with the Triune God
Now that we believe in God the Son, we have become not only one with one another but also one with the Triune God
There is a oneness on the earth today, not only among human beings but also between human beings and the Triune God
Now that we have the divine life within us, what is needed is for us to live by this life, not by our natural life
The divine life within us is continually increasing, and that we are growing in this increasing of the divine life
The more we grow in the increasing of the divine life, the more we are perfected and the more oneness we live out
We may be accustomed to calling the prayer in Matthew 6 the Lord's prayer, but the prayer in John 17 is also the Lord's prayer
Although the believers in Christ come from many different countries and cultures, they all have the same unique divine life
These lights in the ceiling are separate from one another until the switch is turned on and the electricity begins to flow in them
The proper oneness among us Christians is a oneness in the organic union among one another and a oneness between us and the Triune God
God is the Father the Father is in the Son the Son is the Spirit and the Spirit is the consummation of the Triune God the consummated Spirit
As the consummated Spirit, He is the consummation of the Triune God reaching us by entering into us, so the Triune God is in us
We need to go on to see the oneness in practicality, which is the oneness of the faith and of the full knowledge of the Son of God
Recently among us there has been a different opinion concerning the apostles' relationship with the churches that they have established
Some have said that once the apostles establish churches and appoint elders, they should keep their hands off the churches
According to the Bible, after the apostles established churches and appointed elders in them, they still took care of the churches
While Paul was on his way to Jerusalem, he sent some from Miletus to call the elders in Ephesus to come to him
He told them that some would rise up from among them, speaking perverted things to draw away disciples after themselves
In 1 Thessalonians 2:1-12, Paul told the saints that he was a nursing mother and a teaching, exhorting father to them
How could a father leave his children who are under his care, his teaching, and his raising up, to themselves?
To say that the apostles stayed away from the churches after they established them and appointed the elders is not scriptural
They will see more light and eventually see that the thought they hold today concerning the churches being absolutely independent is wrong
We also need to arrive at the oneness of the full knowledge of the Son of God concerning the all-inclusive person of Christ
The oneness of the faith refers to Christ's work, and the oneness of the full knowledge of the Son of God refers to Christ's person
In 1949, we came to Taiwan from mainland China, and we began the work there with a strong understanding of the unique ground of the church
To say that the apostles should not touch the churches or the elders once they have been established is also a wind of teaching
Although we might experience the winds and the waves, the Lord is in our 'boat,' which means that He is in the church life
Regardless of how strong the storm is, eventually the church comes out with a profit and is built up in resurrection
Eventually, we will arrive at the oneness in practicality-at a full-grown man and at the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ
A newborn child is not brought into being by organization but is begotten, conceived, and formed organically in his mother's womb
The church is not something organized, but something that comes out of Christ and grows into His counterpart with His likeness
These four books show that the building up of the Body of Christ must be organic because the Body is altogether a matter of life
We can make an addition to a physical building or house because it is inorganic, but we cannot make an addition to a tree
Anything inorganic that is added to the church is false like a false denture that has been added to our own body
The inorganic, organizational way does not work, but whatever is organically begotten of the church or for the church really works
The fruit is not something just attached or added but something begotten by the outflow of the life from within
Because Paul begot them through the gospel of Christ, he was their father, and they were the fruit of the vine tree brought forth by him
We need to realize that the preaching of the gospel to save sinners is the dispensing of the very elements of Christ into them
To be the fruit-bearing branches of Christ, we must be living by the riches of Christ, which we will minister, impart, or dispense to others
Our preaching is to minister a living One, the life-giving Spirit, into others so that others may have the same life that we do
After we contact the Lord, it will be easy for us to reach people in our freshness and newness to bring forth fruit
You may have been in the Lord for many years, yet still there are people in your family who remain unbelieving
We have to start our preaching of the gospel from the center to those who are closest to us, that is, to our in-laws and relatives
The Lord Jesus chose us and appointed us that we should go forth and bear fruit and that our fruit should remain
After mothers give birth to children, they have to spend time to cherish them, nourish them, and take care of them for a long time
Proverbs 4:18 says, 'But the path of the righteous is as the dawning light, that shineth more and more unto the perfect day'
We must look to the Lord for the salvation of our in-laws, relatives, friends, neighbors, classmates, and colleagues
We do not necessarily need to knock on 'new doors' when so many of those related to us and around us need the Lord's salvation
Once they have been begotten, we need to be like nursing mothers to nourish them so that our fruit will remain
We need to do our best to go to visit people to save them and to go to the homes of the saved ones to meet with them
Our meeting with them should not be in a legal, dead way but in a living and flexible way, which is the organic way
In these home meetings, we can cherish the newly baptized ones as a nursing mother for the organic building up of the Body of Christ
We may bring people to Christ for their salvation, but they may not have anything to do with the church organically
We need to go on from nourishing the new ones in the home meetings to perfecting the saints, to equipping them
If we teach the truth to them for fifteen minutes a week, they will accumulate the proper knowledge of the truth
In these meetings are fellowship, prayer, mutual care, the teaching of the truth, and the encouragement to seek after the growth in life
After six months of these kinds of meetings, the new ones will be equipped to carry out the practical church life
They will be perfected to go to preach the gospel to gain new ones, to take care of home meetings, and to take care of small group meetings
If a church of one hundred saints doubles every year, this church can grow to one million within thirteen years
The unbelievers spend their leisure time on worldly entertainment and amusement, but the best entertainment and amusement is the church life
According to the New Testament revelation, four crucial matters are needed to build up the church as the organic Body of Christ
God's economy is His arrangement to gain a Body for Christ, built up with human beings mingled with the divinity of the Triune God
Without the church without God and without Christ human life is a continuous cycle of birth marriage and death from generation to generation
After such hard labor, they must face the responsibilities of a job and a family life that are full of troubles and problems
We cannot tell how long, how broad, how high, and how deep the universe is, but Christ fills all, and He is in all
They can come to Him through our going to them to contact them with God and bring God Christ the Bible the gospel and justification to them
Recently in Orange County, IBM made the decision to send out two thousand of their sales personnel to knock on doors
They were not satisfied with the amount of their sales, so they sent out their sales personnel to visit people in their homes
If we endeavor to preach the gospel by visiting people where they are, the church can be doubled within a year
If a church of two hundred saints doubles every year, there will be over two hundred thousand saints in ten years
One day we will all have to stand before the judgment seat of Christ , and we will have to give an account to the Lord
If we go in a desperate way people will be begotten through us with the gospel with God with Christ and with His divine marvelous salvation
We need to go back to them as soon as possible and then continue to go back to them again and again until they are established
We can bring the new ones who live in the same neighborhood together for a small group gathering of perhaps twelve to twenty saints
In the small group gatherings, we also need to teach the saints, giving them particular instructions concerning their daily life
After half a year, these new ones will grow up and can be raised up to bear some burden to do what we are doing
Because we love Him, we have to cooperate with Him to accomplish His desire for the organic building up of His Body
Now we want to go on to see the fourth crucial matter for the organic building up of the Body of Christ-prophesying
Verse 12 says, 'Since you are zealots of spiritual gifts, seek that you may excel to the building up of the church'
It excels all the other spiritual gifts, and it is the particular gift for the organic building up of the church
When one person speaks and the rest listen, some general help can be given, but the riches of Christ can come only from a certain individual
In the New Testament, to prophesy is to speak for the Lord, to speak forth the Lord, and to speak the Lord into people
Every morning we should spend ten minutes to pray-read two verses, dwell upon them, and enjoy the Lord in them
If we pray-read two verses a day for six days a week, we can be saturated with six hundred twenty-four verses in a year
We should practice our prophesying at home and either shorten it or lengthen it so that it is between two and a half to three minutes long
In the past the elders may have charged the saints to function, but the saints did not know what to speak or how to speak
We do not read what we have composed, but at the opportune time we speak what we have composed in a living way
We have the scriptural way of begetting people, nourishing the saints, perfecting the saints, and prophesying, speaking for the Lord
If we practice these four crucial matters, the church will be increased in number and everyone will function to speak
In the organic building up of the Body of Christ, we need the Spirit as our spiritual drink and the Word as our spiritual food
God's intention is to have all of us built up together as the Body of Christ by the dispensing of Himself into our being
Not many Christians realize that God has been dispensed into them and that He wants to continue dispensing Himself into them
He went to the cross and accomplished an all-inclusive death, a death that solves all of our problems and takes care of all our needs
The Spirit of Jesus Christ, who is Christ Himself as the life-giving Spirit, is the consummation of the Triune God
When we call 'O Lord Jesus,' the very Spirit that indwells our spirit will be stirred up to anoint us with Himself as the ointment
By this anointing, we are fed, nourished, satisfied, supplied, and supported, and we grow with the divine essence of God
The essential Spirit dwells in us as our life and person , and the economical Spirit has been poured out upon us as our power and authority
We must pray by calling on the name of the Lord, and we must read the Bible so that we can have both the Spirit and the Word
If we merely read the Word without much prayer by calling on the Lord, we will only have the Word without the Spirit
We should not just read, understand, and receive the Word in a doctrinal way, but we have to take the Word in by eating it
We should not merely exercise our eyes to read the Word and exercise our mind to understand and receive the Word in a doctrinal way
Throughout the history of the church, many godly saints, although they did not have the term pray-read, had the reality of pray-reading
To understand the Word is to exercise our mind, to receive the Word is to exercise our heart, and to pray is to exercise our spirit
After eating the word in our spirit, spontaneously something of God's essence will be assimilated into our spiritual being
If we only exercise our mind to read a verse like John 1:1 without exercising our spirit, it may be very dry and empty to us
By this we are altogether enlightened, exposed, and supplied, being ministered to by God to enjoy Him as our bountiful supply
Because the word prevailed to grow and multiply in Acts, the number of the disciples in Jerusalem multiplied exceedingly
For the number of the church to increase, we all have to learn not only to enjoy the word but also to speak the word
The apostles did not leave the word , the believers preached the word , the apostles spoke the word , and people listened to the word
In the previous chapter, we saw the crucial need for the Spirit and the Word in the organic building up of the church
According to the thought of many, to save sinners is merely to rescue them from hell so that they may go to heaven
The entire Bible, both the Old and New Testaments, unveils that God's heart's desire is to build up a Body for Christ
Christ is the embodiment of God , and He needs a Body for His expression that God may also be expressed in Christ
Paul told us in Ephesians 3:8 that he was given grace to preach the unsearchable or untraceable riches of Christ as the gospel
To save sinners is also to beget them as children of God that they may become the members of the organic Body of Christ
Do we preach the gospel with the understanding that we are going to make people members of the organic Body of Christ?
The Lord's gospel is not to invite sinners to go to heaven, but the Bible does tell us that we are going to make sinners God's children
We are not preaching the gospel to save sinners into heaven but to make them the living members of the Body of Christ
If the branches enjoy the rich supply of the inner life juice, the inner life juice will have an issue, and this issue is fruit
Do we have the thought that our preaching of the gospel is a dispensing of the life element within us to someone else?
To preach the gospel is to impart, to dispense, the very inner life from within us to others for their regeneration
We all have to build up a habit of preaching the gospel in the prevailing way revealed in the Scriptures, not in our natural way
Because our concept was too low concerning the preaching of the gospel, the concept of the ones whom we brought to the Lord was also low
We did not have the concept that the preaching of the gospel is for the organic building up of the organic Body of Christ
Neither the preachers nor the saved ones have the proper concept of preaching the gospel for the organic building up of the Body of Christ
From the first day of their Christian life, they will have received the proper understanding and realization of what it means to be saved
To minister the riches of Christ is to bring all the blessings of Christ, with Christ, and through Christ to the pitiful sinners
Such preaching is divine preaching and corresponds with what is unveiled to us of the Lord in the four Gospels
We may even tell the ones to whom we are preaching that our speaking to them is a flowing, an issue, of the divine life within us
In recent years, many of us have been helped to preach the gospel by using the booklet, The Mystery of Human Life
That booklet is written according to the divine thought that we are containers and God wants to be our content
The nations do not know anything concerning God, so we have to disciple them firstly by putting God's life into them
As those who are speaking by God, with God, and in God, we are qualified and able to put people into the consummated Spirit
When we go to preach the gospel, we have to speak with the understanding that we are speaking in the Triune God and with the Triune God
Because we are in the Triune God, who is the consummated Spirit as the air, we can put people into the Triune God
When she picks him up and puts him in her bosom, he will soon stop crying because he has been fostered with tender care
We must preach the gospel in the organic way to beget sinners as children of God, making them the regenerated members of the Body of Christ
When Peter told the Lord that he did love Him, the Lord told Peter to feed His lambs, shepherd His sheep, and feed His sheep
We have to abide in the Lord that we may bear fruit, and we have to love the Lord that we may have a heart to take care of His flock
In the next chapter, we will see that we need to go further to perfect them to do what we are doing to serve the Lord
In Acts 20 we can see that after Paul established the church in Ephesus and appointed the elders there, he did not leave that church alone
During those three years he taught them publicly and from house to house , admonishing each one of the saints with tears day and night
Through this perfecting, everyone is enabled to do the work of an apostle, a prophet, an evangelist, and a shepherd-teacher
We also need to take care of the spiritual need of the new ones and their need in practical affairs, sicknesses, and other afflictions
When some hear this fellowship, they may think that there is too much demand upon them and that all they want to do is to enjoy Christ
We have seen in chapter one that the good pleasure of God's will is to gain a Body for Christ so that God can be expressed in Christ
We have seen that we need to cooperate with the Lord to save sinners and to nourish and cherish the newly baptized ones
Our concept may be only that the Head gave all these persons as gifts to His Body so that they could do their work
To see this crucial matter of the perfecting of the saints we have to look at the Apostle Paul in the book of Acts
We do not have the concept of a gifted person coming to us and staying with us for an extended period of time for our perfecting
If we merely hold big meetings, we can only pass on general messages and do a general work, but we cannot do a particular work
An apostle's perfecting of the saints is his equipping of the saints so that they are qualified to do the same work that he does
In other words, many saints have attended meeting after meeting for years, without being perfected to do what the gifted persons do
Eventually, all the saints will have the ability of the apostles, prophets, evangelists, and shepherds and teachers
After being perfected, the perfected saints do the work of the ministry to build up the Body of Christ directly
In 1 Thessalonians 2:11 we see that Paul exhorted the believers, consoled them, and testified to them as a father
On the other hand, we have to realize that many of us have received some perfecting in our years in the church life
When we go to visit the newly baptized ones, we should not shepherd them and teach them in the traditional, natural, and old way
Sometimes we may have a lesson from the Truth Lessons or Life Lessons but we should not come to the home meeting merely to teach that lesson
We can talk with them about the contents of that message and at a certain point, let them read a certain paragraph
After listening to the fellowship, we can realize that a certain brother may have difficulties in his financial situation
After a year of these group meetings, we can encourage the new ones to bear the burden to carry out the church life
In this way everyone will be occupied in the Lord's service, and spontaneously the entire church will be the universal priesthood
Because the Lord has shown us His scriptural way to practice the church life, we will be successful if we rise up to cooperate with the Lord
The shepherds and teachers shepherd the believers by feeding and taking care of them that the believers may grow up in life
They also teach the believers in the knowledge of spiritual things and the things concerning God and His New Testament economy
After being perfected, the parts will be enabled to do what the gifted persons do and they can become the joints
Through the joints being joined closely together and the parts being knit together, the Body will be built up in love by the growth in life
In the previous chapters, we have seen our need to help sinners to be saved and become the organic members of the Body of Christ
After the sinners have been saved, we should continue to take care of them by nourishing and cherishing them continually
If we do not nourish and cherish a newborn babe and take good care of him, it will be very difficult for him to remain alive
After the new ones are established, we should bring them together with other saved ones in small groups of fifteen to twenty or twenty-five
Now that we have brought meetings to them, we have to bring them out of their homes to gather with other Christians
The cherishing, entreating, and consoling of the believers for their perfecting takes place in the small groups
In 1 Thessalonians 2:7 Paul firstly said, 'But we were gentle in your midst, as a nurse would cherish her own children'
Martin Luther said that in disciplining children we sometimes must first spank them and then give them an apple
Paul said he was a nursing mother feeding the believers with milk and an exhorting father disciplining teaching instructing and charging
We should build up an atmosphere in which all the attendants of the small groups are anxious to know the truth
In the small group meeting a newly saved and established one who is not yet strong in life may ask something concerning seeking after life
After they baptize people, they should right away go back to their homes in the way we did for them the previous year
Now we need to have a bigger meeting for the saints to come together to display the very Christ whom we have experienced
If we are one spirit with the Lord and the Lord is one spirit with us, we will speak the Lord with His word, being inspired by Him
We have to pursue love and desire earnestly spiritual gifts, but we should rather speak the Lord out from within us into others
Verse 12 says, 'So also you, since you are zealots of spiritual gifts, seek that you may excel to the building up of the church'
The characteristic of prophesying is that prophesying ministers Christ for the organic building up of the church
Once a week we should come together to practice speaking forth the Lord, to minister the Lord to all the saints
By doing this every morning we will receive inspiration, and we can take notes on the spiritual inspiration we receive
When our time comes, we will speak, not read, our prophecy, and when we speak, we may add something to make it richer and more living
If we are living a revived and overcoming life and are one with the Lord, we will always be ready to receive instant inspiration
We need to put all the foregoing principles concerning prophesying into practice for the organic building up of the church
We have to gain the new ones so that the Lord can regenerate them and make them the living members of the Body of Christ
Through being perfected, every saint needs to prophesy, to speak the Lord forth into others in the larger meetings of the church
In this concluding chapter, we want to see the life and prayer needed for the organic building up of the Body of Christ
In our natural man, we like to be highly appraised by others, but we need to realize that we cannot do anything apart from the Lord
In Luke 17 the Lord Jesus told us that even though we may serve Him in many things, we still have to say that we are unprofitable slaves
Whatever is revealed in the New Testament concerning our service to the Lord requires another life, the divine life, not our life
Whatever is revealed in the New Testament needs a super life, a higher life, the divine life, the eternal life, not our life
We received our natural life by our first birth, but what we are charged to do for God should not be carried out by that life
To change from our old, traditional, and unscriptural way of serving to the New Testament way demands us to change our life
To say that we need the divine life does not mean that we take away our life and replace it with the divine life
The divine life of Christ is the life that can accomplish everything that we have fellowshipped in the previous chapters
Christ as the embodiment of God is the mingling of the human life with the divine life, and this life today is the life-giving Spirit
The life that we need is also the resurrection life, which is the pneumatic Christ in resurrection with the resurrection power
When we live on the cross, being conformed to the death of the cross, the resurrection life rises up from within us
Whenever we go out to knock on doors for the preaching of the gospel, we need to go on the cross in the mold of Christ's death
We realize that we need another life, that we have been made by God as vessels as the means through which God can work
In the book of Acts, we can see the prayer of the early saints for the organic building up of the Body of Christ
The disciples prayed with one accord according to the word of God , claiming the divine power through the name of Jesus
When we pray in such a way, we will be filled with the economical Spirit, and we will have the boldness to speak the word of God
Preaching the gospel having home meetings having small group meetings or prophesying in the big meetings are all for ministering the word
When we get into a trance, we are in a conversation with the Lord in which we talk to the Lord and the Lord talks to us
Peter went to the home of Mary after he was released from prison, and there was a group of saints praying in that home
Acts 12 also indicates that there were many small groups praying for Peter at that time in the homes of the saints
They were in chains in the stocks in the inner prison, but instead of worrying, they sang hymns of praise to God
The book of Acts is a record of the activities of the apostles, and the apostles' activities were always matched by their prayers
All the kinds of prayers that we have fellowshipped about in the book of Acts, show us what kind of prayer we need to pray
If we always depend on gifted persons or on people from other churches to help us in our local church, this can spoil us
As we all function organically in the priesthood, we will see the practical and organic building up of the church
