   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>LIFE-STUDY OF FIRST THESSALONIANS MESSAGE EIGHTEEN COOPERATION WITH THE DIVINE OPERATION 1 Scripture Reading: 1 Thes 5:12-28</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Chapter five begins with the word "but."</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>This indicates that the last part of chapter four, which is concerned with the rapture, needs a further word about another matter.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>According to 5:1, this further word is related to the times and the seasons.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>As a young believer, when I heard messages about the Lord's coming, I was very excited.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>It is common for new believers to be excited when they hear about the Lord's coming back.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>They may expect the Lord to come at any moment.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>For this reason, they need Paul's further word in chapter five.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The "times and the seasons" in verse 1 refer to the Lord's coming.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>This is confirmed by the expression "the day of the Lord" in the following verse.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The coming of the day of the Lord is different from what we imagine.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Actually, it is a mystery.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The Lord Jesus even said that, as a man, He did not know the time of His coming.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The date of the Lord's coming is absolutely hidden as a mystery in the Father's heart, and this mystery has not been revealed.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Therefore, in 5:2 Paul says that the day of the Lord "so comes as a thief in the night."</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>To be sure, no thief would give an advance warning that he is coming to steal something.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>In the same principle, the day of the Lord will come suddenly and unexpectedly.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Thus, we need to be watchful and sober.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Because we have no way to figure out the time of the Lord's coming, we need to be watchful and sober.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>After covering the matter of watchfulness and soberness in 5:1-11, Paul turns in 5:12-24 to our cooperation with the divine operation.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>In these verses Paul covers a number of items in an elementary way.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>In the New Testament there is no book that ends in such a marvelous and all-inclusive way as 1 Thessalonians.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Paul's concluding word includes a number of crucial things, which Paul did not have the time to cover in detail.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Therefore, he listed them together in one section toward the end of this Epistle.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>RESPECTING THE LEADING ONES</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Verse 12 says, "Now we ask you, brothers, to know those who labor among you and take the lead among you in the Lord, and admonish you; and to regard them most highly in love because of their work.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Be at peace among yourselves."</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The word "know" here means first to recognize and then render respect and regard.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>According to Matthew 7:23, when the Lord Jesus comes back, He will say to certain ones, "I never knew you."</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The expression, "I never knew you" means not to appreciate or respect what was done.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>In the same principle, in verse 12 the word "know" means to appreciate and respect those who labor among us and who take the lead among us.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Here Paul probably refers to the elders who labor in teaching and take the lead among the believers 1 Tim 5:17 .</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>To take the lead is not mainly to rule, but to set an example in doing things first that others may follow.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The elders should not only labor in teaching, but also do things as an example.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The example may become a ground for their admonition.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>It is indeed marvelous that, although the church in Thessalonica had been in existence less than a year and Paul had spent only three Sabbaths working there, some leading ones had been raised up.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>In a short period of time a church was established, and some leading ones were produced.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Paul surely was a qualified and skillful Christian worker.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>In verse 13 Paul charges us to regard the leading ones most highly in love because of their work.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The word "regard" here means to lead the mind through a reasoning process to a conclusion; hence, it is to think, consider, estimate, esteem, regard.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The leading ones should regard themselves as slaves serving the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>But the believers should regard them highly in love because of their work.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>As Paul was writing this Epistle, one thought followed upon another.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>As we have pointed out, the subject of the preceding section 5:1-11 is watchfulness and soberness.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The Christian life is a life of fighting for God's interests, and we need to be watchful and alert.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Then Paul goes on to say that we must learn to respect, honor, the leading ones in the church.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>It seems that the matters of watchfulness and soberness and respecting the leading ones have no logical connection.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>However, they are related in a very practical way.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>If we are on the alert, full of watchfulness in spiritual warfare, we shall surely honor the leading ones.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Those who have had experience in military service know that soldiers must respect their commanding officers.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>If they have no respect for the officers, the leaders, the army will not be able to fight properly.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>The first thing a soldier must learn in order to fight is to respect the one leading him.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>I believe that this was Paul's concept in turning to the matter of respecting the leading ones at this point.</S>
