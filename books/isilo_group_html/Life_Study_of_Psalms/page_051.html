We have seen that Psalms 1 and 2 were sovereignly arranged as a pair. Psalm 1 says that the man whose delight is in the law of Jehovah is blessed (vv. 1-2). Psalm 2 says that the man who takes refuge in the Son is blessed (v. 12). Thus, we see the human concept of being blessed by the keeping of the law versus the divine concept of being blessed by taking refuge in the Son. The comparison in Psalms 1 and 2 is between the law and Christ.</P><P>Psalms 15 and 16 also present a comparison. The end of Psalm 15 says, "He who does these things will not be shaken forever." These things refer to the good things according to the law in the foregoing verses. On the other hand, Psalm 16:8b says, "Because He is at My right hand, I shall not be shaken." Psalm 15 says that if you do all the good things according to the law, you will never be shaken. Then Psalm 16 says concerning Christ that because God is at His right hand, He will not be shaken. No doubt, Psalms 15 and 16 were arranged together to show us a comparison between the keeping of the law and the participating in the Son. Do we keep the law or do we partake of Christ? Do we keep the law or do we enjoy Christ as our portion?</P><P>At this point I would like us to read Psalms 15 and 16 together so that we can see the different concepts in these psalms. Afterward, we will cover them in more detail.</P><P>At the beginning of Psalm 15, the psalmist asks, "O Jehovah, who may sojourn in Your tent?/Who may dwell on Your holy mountain?" The tent refers to God's house, the temple. David says that this one is "He who walks in integrity/And does righteousness/And speaks truth from his heart./He does not slander with his tongue;/He does not do evil to his friend,/Nor does he take up reproach upon his neighbor./In his eyes a reprobate is despised,/But he honors those who fear Jehovah./Should he swear to his harm,/He does not change./He does not lend his money on interest,/Nor accept a bribe against the innocent./He who does these things will not be shaken forever" (vv. 2-5). This may seem like an excellent psalm, but actually it is a psalm in the line of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil.</P><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_050.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_052.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Life-Study of Psalms &nbsp; pg 51</div><br></body></html>
