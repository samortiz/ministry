   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>for the Building Up of the Body of Christ</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>in the Annulling of the Old Way</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Related to Christianity</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>If we practice to prophesy, we will carry out the God-ordained way for the building up of the Body of Christ and annul the old way related to Christianity Eph 4:12 .</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The way to defeat the old way of Christianity is to speak.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>If we have a meeting full of everyone speaking, such a meeting defeats the old way of Christianity and is the victory of the Lord's Body.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>II.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>THE LOSSES OF NOT PRACTICING TO PROPHESY</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>We have seen the benefits of practicing to prophesy.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Now we must see the losses of not practicing to prophesy.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>A. Cooling Down the Believers' Interest</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>in the Lord's Service</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Not practicing to prophesy cools down the believers' interest in the Lord's service.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>I am afraid of a meeting in which very few speak.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Such a meeting will scatter the audience.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Those who come to a meeting of silence will be discouraged from coming to a meeting again.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>This is because they are cooled down by the silence.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Silence cools down, but speaking always stirs up.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>B. Annulling the Believers' Capacity</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>in the Divine Life</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The practice of one man speaking and the rest listening has annulled the capacity of the believers in the divine life.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Every life has a capacity.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>All believers have the divine life, but if they do not speak, their capacity will not be developed.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>This is the reason for the poverty of today's situation.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>C. Burying the Believers' Spiritual Function,</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Making the Church's Service to the Lord</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Poor in the Lord's Economy</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Not practicing to prophesy also buries the believers' spiritual function.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>This makes the church's service to the Lord poor in the Lord's economy.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>D. Leaving the Believers Unedified</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>in Undergrowth and in Ignorance</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Another loss of not practicing to prophesy is that the believers are left unedified in undergrowth and in ignorance.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>When children are being raised, they need to speak all the time.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Otherwise, they will be left in undergrowth and ignorance.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Without the practice of speaking, there is no growth.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>But the more the children speak, the more they learn and are instructed by their parents.</S>
