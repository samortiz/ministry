   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>It was so strange that on the night of the 9th, we received a promise, which was "Where is the God of Elijah?"</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>This was related to God's glory.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>On the eve of the 11th, that is, the night of the 10th, we prayed again.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>If it did not rain the next day, it would be impossible for us to preach the gospel to the ten thousand or more people in Plum Flower Village again, and the door of the gospel would be closed there.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>No one would get in again.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>One or two among us who were weaker in faith thought that they should ask God to send rain right then.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>To them, it was better for it to rain that very night.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>We went to bed and did not get up until very late the next morning.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>I slept beside a window, and when I woke up, the sun was shining in my eyes.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>I thought, "Too bad!</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The sun has come out.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>What shall we do?"</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>I did not bother to even put on my clothes, and I knelt down to pray.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Later all the brothers woke up one by one, and everyone knelt down to pray, saying, "O God, today is the day for You to manifest Your glory.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Please send the rain and prove that You are God."</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>We all prayed earnestly.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Later we all rebuked ourselves for praying so desperately, knowing that God had already heard our prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>We went down to take our breakfast.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>I was the leader among them, and in order to boost their morale, I told the brother who took care of the food, "There is no need to prepare any sack lunch today; we will not be able to go out because it will rain."</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>We blessed the food.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>After we blessed our food, one brother went on and prayed, "Lord, may You keep our faith and prove that You are God."</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Of course this was a spontaneous prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>After this, we went to fill our bowls with porridge.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>I sat facing the window.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Shortly after we finished our first bowl, the sound of dripping was heard on the roof.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>We looked at each other and began to understand what was going on.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>We went ahead for our second bowl.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>I asked, "Should we pray?"</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>One brother said, "Why not?</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>This rain looks too small.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>It has to rain very hard before others will see that this is a clear act of God and not an accident."</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>We then proceeded to pray again.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>After our prayer, the sky turned dark and the rain increased.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The sound of the rain on the roof became louder.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The rain was pouring down harder and harder.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>After breakfast, we stood outside the shop to watch the Great King come out for its parade.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The Great King was scheduled to come out at 9 a.m. But the rain did not stop from nine o'clock until eleven o'clock.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Since the parade could not take place beyond a certain hour, the villagers reluctantly carried the great god out.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The rain was truly a torrent that day, and two- or three-foot deep puddles of water were everywhere along the way.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>When the Great King came out of the temple, it only managed to move a few steps.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>One of the bearers slipped and fell into the water, and the great god fell with him also.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Three of its fingers and an arm were broken, and its head was twisted.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The villagers lifted up the Great King again, turned the head back to its original position, and tried to press on.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>By then many young people were shouting at the back: "The Great King is in trouble this year.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>It is in trouble this year."</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>They shouted as they marched on.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The rain became heavier and heavier, and it was obvious that they could not go on anymore.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>They moved the Great King into an ancestral hall that belonged to a Chan clan.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Some elders of the village went in and asked the Great King why it had rained this year.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>What a trick they came up with eventually!</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>They managed to tell everyone, "The Great King did not intend in the first place to come out for the parade on this day.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>You people have made a mistake.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>The Great King said that he had intended to come out at 8 p.m. on the 14th.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Today is only the 11th."</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>The elders proposed that the parade be changed to the 14th.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>But the young people asked, "Why then did the Great King trip, and why were his arm and fingers broken?"</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>At lunchtime we prayed that God would give us a clear day so that we could go out to work again.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>We became strong in our faith and prayed also that the Lord would send another rain on the 14th.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>After we ate, we went out to preach again.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>That afternoon, the sky was clear, and the quantity of books we took with us was not enough to meet the need.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>In a minute they were all sold out.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>We had to leave the village and return home on the 15th.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Therefore, we prayed for a clear sky on the 12th, 13th, and 14th so that we could work.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>We also prayed that it would rain on the evening of the 14th so that everyone would know that the Great King was not God.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>The 12th, 13th, and 14th were all clear days.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>We decided to hold a gospel meeting in the herbal shop on the evening of the 14th.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>By then the owner believed.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Today he is still a good brother.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>On the evening of the 14th it began to rain, and many people were waiting outside the shop.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>We went up to the attic and prayed that God would send more rain.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Praise the Lord, the rain became heavier and heavier.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>When the villagers moved the Great King out of the temple, seventeen or eighteen men were following it.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>But they tripped five or six times.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>Many young people were behind it, shouting, "There is God.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>There is no Great King."</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>We were able to finish a fine work there.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>On the morning of the 15th, we left before the day broke.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>Praise the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>We have received many answers to prayers.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>These answers prove that there is a God.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>Our spiritual experiences prove to us that our God is living.</S>
