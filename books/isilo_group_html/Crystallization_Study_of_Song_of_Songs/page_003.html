There is no other way except by pursuing after Christ, because Christ is the very embodiment of the Triune God. He is the reality of God. He is God in reality, God's embodiment, coming to earth to give people the opportunity to receive Him for satisfaction.</p><p>Peter may be counted as the first one among the apostles and Paul was a later one. They were seekers of God, but initially they took the wrong way. Eventually, both Peter, a fisherman, and Paul, a learned scholar, found the way to seek Christ for satisfaction. Paul told us in Philippians 3 that we have to pursue Christ to gain Him (vv. 12-14) because He is the most excellent way. All things other than Christ are dung (v. 8). Only Christ is excellent. Whatever we obtain or have obtained other than Christ is vanity. Paul says that it is dung. Do you like dung? But today many worldly people are gaining dung day after day. Dung is their food. Solomon says that they are pursuing vanity. Vanity of vanities is what they are eating. That is their food. Paul's desire was to gain Christ, and he instructed us how to gain Christ as he did.</p><p>In this message our point is that we have to pursue Christ for satisfaction. Song of Songs opens in this way: &ldquo;Let him kiss me with the kisses of his mouth!&rdquo; (1:2a). The seeker longs for kisses, not just one kiss. The most impressive thing about weddings in the Western world is the time of kissing. The bridegroom opens the bride's veil to kiss her with his own mouth. He does not kiss the ears or the nose of the bride but her mouth. This is the most personal and affectionate thing. Here is a book in the Bible that opens in such a way: &ldquo;Let him kiss me with the kisses of his mouth.&rdquo; This is what it means to pursue Christ.</p><p>According to the New Testament, God's ordained way for man to receive Him in this kind of personal and affectionate way is first to believe in Him. To believe in Him is to receive Him as the divine life into us that we may have an organic union with God in the divine life. Regretfully, very few Christians know what believing in Christ means. They know that they need to take Him as Savior and Redeemer, but they do not know that to believe in Christ is to receive Him as the divine life into us so that we can have an organic union with God in His divine life. This is the first step.</p><p>Now that we have received Christ into us, what does God want us to do? Many Christian teachers teach people in the wrong way. They say that after one has believed in Christ, he should do many things. This is wrong. According to the New Testament, after we believe in Christ, after we receive Him as the divine life into us, we have to love Him (see 1 Cor. 2:9 and note 3&mdash;Recovery Version). Paul told us that the Lord's grace super abounded to him with faith and love in Christ Jesus (1 Tim. 1:14). Faith is to receive Christ, and love is to pursue Christ.</p><p>&ldquo;Let him kiss me with the kisses of his mouth.&rdquo; This word indicates that to some extent the seeker has obtained a part of Christ's love, but now she wants something more intimate. She wants to be kissed not just with one kiss but with the kisses of His mouth. Someone who is affectionate with another may kiss him on the cheek, but this expression of affection is not the first category of love. On the wedding day who would want to see the bridegroom kiss his bride on the cheek? He is expected to kiss his bride on the mouth as the expression of his utmost affection.</p><p>In her desire to be kissed with the kisses of His mouth, the seeker goes on to say, &ldquo;For your love is better than wine&rdquo; (1:2b). She does not say that His love is as good as wine but that it is better than wine. Wine cheers but Christ's love cheers us in an unrivaled way. No wine can compare with His unrivaled love. Nothing is so cheering as Christ's love.</p><p>Verse 3 says, &ldquo;Your anointing oils have a pleasant fragrance; / Your name is like ointment poured forth; / Therefore the virgins love you.&rdquo; Christ's name signifies Christ's person, His being, and Christ is the compound Spirit signified by the anointing ointment in Exodus 30. &ldquo;The last Adam became a life-giving Spirit&rdquo; (1 Cor. 15:45b). This indicates that Christ's name as His person is the anointing ointment. An ointment is always a compound. Christ is compounded with God, with man, with His death, with the effectiveness of His death, with His resurrection, and with the power of His resurrection. At least these six things are compounded together to be the anointing ointment, signifying Christ in His resurrection as the compound Spirit. If someone says your name, you respond because you are the person of that name. Christ's charming name, His person, is the all-inclusive, compound Spirit.</p><p>His love is attracting, His name is charming, and His person is captivating. He has drawn and captivated millions of His lovers to pursue after Him and is still doing the same today. Therefore, all His lovers would run after Him for their satisfaction. This is why the seeker prays, &ldquo;Draw me; we will run after you&rdquo; (S.S. 1:4a).</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_002.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_004.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Crystallization-Study of Song of Songs &nbsp; pg 3</div><br></body></html>
