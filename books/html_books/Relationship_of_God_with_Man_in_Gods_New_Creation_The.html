<h2 class="head1">PREFACE</h2>
<p>This book is composed of messages given by Brother Witness Lee in San Francisco, California, from November 28 to December 1, 1963. They have not been reviewed by the speaker. </p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER ONE</h1>
<h1 class="title">WHAT IS OUR GOD?</h1>
<p>In this universe God is the center. He is the Head, the first, the preeminent One in all things. Man is the center of all God&rsquo;s creation. Furthermore, there is a special relationship between God and man. Indeed, man was created by God for a certain divine, eternal purpose. Moreover, God created the old creation, and He also created another creation, the new creation (2 Cor. 5:17; Gal. 6:15). Thus, in the foregoing brief word we have mentioned four things: God as the center of the universe, man as the center of the creatures, the special relationship between God and man, and God creating not only an old creation but also a new creation. These four things taken together form the subject of the chapters in this book, that is, the relationship of God with man in God&rsquo;s new creation. This subject is great and profound, but we will present it in a brief and simple way.</p>
<p>In considering this subject, first we need to see what God is, or, to express this in another way, what kind of God Christians serve. Throughout human history religion has always been in existence. Whether in ancient times or modern times, among civilized people or barbarians, the human race has always had some form of religion. The purpose of religion is to teach people to serve God in a certain way. Indeed, history shows us that there have been many different gods that have been served and worshipped by the human race. Nevertheless, we know that there is only one true God and that all the others are false gods (1 Cor. 8:4). As far as the true God is concerned, there are three different kinds of worshippers. First, there are the Jews, the Hebrews, who worship the only true God, the Creator of the universe. Even though many Jews today are opposed to the Lord Jesus, they still worship the God of their fathers, the true God, the Creator of the universe. Second, there are the Muslims, who also worship the true God, the Creator of the universe, the same God that the Jews worship. The third class of people is the Christians, who also serve the only true God. However, can we say that the God of the Christians is exactly the same as the God whom the Jews and Muslims worship? On the one hand, the God whom we worship is the same, but on the other hand, there is a big difference. If we see this difference, it will help us to understand in a full way the relationship of God with man in His new creation.</p>
<h2 class="head1">GOD BEING THE TRIUNE GOD</h2>
<p>John 4:24 begins, &ldquo;God is Spirit.&rdquo; The first thing we need to know is that God is not physical or material; He is a Spirit. No one among the human race can understand this brief word in a full way. The God whom we serve and whom the Scriptures reveal is a Spirit.</p>
<p>Matthew 28:19 says, &ldquo;Go therefore and disciple all the nations, baptizing them into the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit.&rdquo; The word <em>name</em> in this verse is singular, yet three persons are mentioned. It is a mystery that these three persons have only one name.</p>
<p>Second Corinthians 13:14 says, &ldquo;The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ and the love of God and the fellowship of the Holy Spirit be with you all.&rdquo; This verse mentions three persons&mdash;God, Christ, and the Holy Spirit&mdash;and three things&mdash;love, grace, and fellowship. In this verse the love is of God, the grace is of Christ, and the fellowship is of the Holy Spirit. Love is the source; within God there is love, and God is love (1 John 4:8, 16). When love is expressed, it is grace (John 1:17-18), and this grace, with the love that is its source, reaches us through the fellowship of the Holy Spirit. When the Holy Spirit communes with us, He brings grace with love to us. Therefore, love is the source, grace is the expression, and fellowship is the transmission. These are not three separate matters but three aspects of the same one thing.</p>
<p>We may illustrate this as follows: If I love a certain brother, this love is something within my heart. I might express this love to him by buying him a Bible. This would be grace, the expression of my love. However, this grace can reach him only through the post office mailman. Hence, there is love within as the source, grace without as the expression, and the fellowship, as the transportation, the transmission. Love, grace, and fellowship are one, even as God, Christ, and the Holy Spirit are one. God is the source, Christ is the expression, and the Holy Spirit is the transmission that reaches us.</p>
<p>The first part of Genesis 1:26 says, &ldquo;God said, Let Us make man in Our image, according to Our likeness.&rdquo; In this verse it is one God who speaks, yet the pronouns <em>Us</em> and <em>Our</em> used in reference to God are plural. Then verse 27 says, &ldquo;God created man in His own image; in the image of God He created him.&rdquo; Whereas in verse 26 the pronouns are plural, in verse 27 they are singular. Is God plural or singular? With God, the substance, the essence, is one, but the persons are three. This indicates that God is triune; He is the Triune God. He is one substance, one essence, but with three distinct persons.</p>
<p>Isaiah 9:6 says, &ldquo;For a child is born to us, / A Son is given to us; / And the government / Is upon His shoulder; / And His name will be called / Wonderful Counselor, / Mighty God, / Eternal Father, / Prince of Peace.&rdquo; This verse reveals that a child will be called Mighty God, and a Son will be called Eternal Father. Therefore, the child is God, and the Son is the Father. The child in this verse is the one who was born in Bethlehem in a manger; that little child, that babe, was the Mighty God. The Son in this verse is Jesus Christ, the Son of God. We should not think that the Son of God is someone apart from the Father. Seemingly, a son and his father are two separate persons, but in the case of the Lord Jesus, who is the Son of the Father, He and the Father are two, yet He and the Father are also one. When the Lord Jesus was on earth, He said, &ldquo;I and the Father are one&rdquo; (John 10:30). Although He is the Son, His name is called Eternal Father, because He is the eternal Father. This proves that the Son and the Father are one. We should never think that Christ and God are separate, because Christ is God (Rom. 9:5) and God is Christ (Titus 2:13).</p>
<p>John 14:8 says, &ldquo;Philip said to Him, Lord, show us the Father and it is sufficient for us.&rdquo; In this verse Philip seemed to be saying, &ldquo;You are the Son. For three years we have observed You. We are very familiar with You, but we have never seen the Father. Where is the Father? Show us the Father. If we see the Father, we will be satisfied because we are longing to see Him.&rdquo; Then verses 9 through 11 continue, &ldquo;Jesus said to him, Have I been so long a time with you, and you have not known Me, Philip? He who has seen Me has seen the Father; how is it that you say, Show us the Father? Do you not believe that I am in the Father and the Father is in Me? The words that I say to you I do not speak from Myself, but the Father who abides in Me does His works. Believe Me that I am in the Father and the Father is in Me.&rdquo; These verses reveal that the Son is one with the Father and that the Son is the Father. Therefore, we should not consider that the Son and the Father are two separate persons. Although They co-exist and are distinct, the Son and the Father are still one and are inseparable, for according to verses 10 and 11, the Son is in the Father and the Father is in the Son.</p>
<p>Second Corinthians 3:17 says, &ldquo;The Lord is the Spirit.&rdquo; According to this verse the Lord, that is, Christ (4:5), the Son of God, is the Spirit. On the one hand, Christ, the Son, is the Father; on the other hand, Christ, the Lord, is the Spirit. Hence, the Son is the Father, and the Son is also the Spirit. The three of the Trinity are not three Gods but one God who is the Father, the Son, and the Spirit. We should not consider the Holy Spirit as someone separate from the Lord Christ. The Holy Spirit and Christ are not two different persons. Nevertheless, many Christians hold the concept that the Holy Spirit is someone other than the Lord Christ. However, we need to realize that the Holy Spirit is the Lord Christ, because 2 Corinthians 3:17 says clearly that the Lord, that is, Christ, is the Spirit.</p>
<p>Paul&rsquo;s word in 1 Corinthians 15:45 offers further confirmation to this fact: &ldquo;So also it is written, &lsquo;The first man, Adam, became a living soul&rsquo;; the last Adam became a life-giving Spirit.&rdquo; Adam was a living soul; in contrast, Christ, the last Adam, became a life-giving Spirit in His resurrection. No doubt this life-giving Spirit is the Spirit of God, the unique Spirit who gives life (John 6:63; 2 Cor. 3:6). Because of these two verses, 2 Corinthians 3:17 and 1 Corinthians 15:45, we know definitely that Christ the Lord is the Holy Spirit.</p>
<p>In the foregoing verses we have seen that the Son is the Father and that the Son, who is the Lord Christ, is the Spirit. We need to recognize that although the Father, the Son, and the Spirit are three in person, They are one in essence. Although They are three in Their &ldquo;offices,&rdquo; They are one in Their existence, for there is only one God, not three Gods (8:6a; 1 Tim. 2:5a).</p><h2 class="head1">GOD BEING A GOD WHO IS MINGLED WITH MAN</h2>
<p>Now we must see that in addition to being the Triune God, our God is a God who is mingled with man. John 1:14 tells us that the Word became flesh; that is, God was incarnated to be a man. Then, Matthew 1:23 tells us that this man would be called Emmanuel, which means &ldquo;God with us.&rdquo; In incarnation God and man are one; they are mingled together. According to 1 Timothy 3:16, this is a great mystery, which is God manifested in the flesh.</p>
<p>Christ is God, and Christ is also man. We have seen that Christ was born to be a human child, a man-child, yet He is called Mighty God. Therefore, God is not only God; He is now also a man. The Jews, the Hebrews, do not worship a God who is mingled with man, because they consider that Jesus Christ was merely a man and was not God. The difference between the God whom Christians worship and the God whom the Jews serve is that in the case of the Jews, God is merely God Himself without being mingled with man. However, our God today is a God who is mingled with man. For this reason 1 John 4:1-2 tells us to prove whether the spirits are of God by asking them to confess that Jesus Christ has come in the flesh. We need to confess that God today, the God in whom we believe and whom we serve and worship, is a God who is mingled with man. In Him there is not only the essence of God but also the essence, the substance, of man.</p>
<p>We should not think that Christ was incarnated as a man only for a period of thirty-three and a half years, that when He died on the cross, He put off the flesh, and that He is now in heaven as God without humanity. Christ is indeed in heaven today (Mark 16:19; 1 Pet. 3:21-22), but He is not there only as God without the human nature. Rather, He is in heaven as God mingled with man. The word of Stephen in Acts 7:56 proves this: &ldquo;Behold, I see the heavens opened up and the Son of Man standing at the right hand of God.&rdquo; Today Christ in heaven is still the Son of Man; He is still God mingled with man.</p>
<p>The God whom we serve is very different from the God whom the Jews serve. They serve the only God, the Creator, without anything of the human nature mingled with Him. We, in contrast, serve the same only true God, the Creator of the universe, yet our God also has the human nature mingled with Him. Now, the true and only God is mingled with the human nature. On the one hand, He is absolutely divine; on the other hand, He is human. Perhaps you have never praised the Lord in this way: &ldquo;Lord, I praise You that I am human, and You are human too. I am a man, and You also are a man. You are the same as I am.&rdquo; We need to know our God as a God who has mingled Himself with our nature. As God&rsquo;s children who are born of Him, we can praise the Lord in another way as well. We may tell him, &ldquo;Lord, You are divine. I praise You that I also have the divine life. I am human, and You are human also. You are divine, and I also have the divine life.&rdquo; May we all be impressed with the fact that God today is a God who is mingled with the human nature.</p>
<p>Moreover, we should not think that the Holy Spirit today is only the Spirit of God with no involvement with the human nature. As an illustration, we may use a cup of plain water, which, after tea is added to it, becomes &ldquo;tea-water.&rdquo; Although it is still water, it is not merely water but water with something added. Today God is still God, but He is God with the human nature added to Him. Before His incarnation He was God only, just like plain water. Now He is still God, but He is God mingled with humanity. The Spirit of God before the Lord Jesus was incarnated as a man may be compared to plain water. He was merely the Spirit of God with the divine nature alone. But after the Lord was incarnated, and after He passed through crucifixion, resurrection, and ascension, the Holy Spirit came down as a Spirit who includes not only the nature of God but also the nature of man. In the Old Testament, when the Holy Spirit came down upon a person, He was merely the Spirit of God with the divine nature. Now, in the New Testament time the Spirit enters into us and descends upon us not only with the divine nature but also with the human nature.</p>
<p>We see this also in Acts 16:6-7, which says, &ldquo;They passed through the region of Phrygia and Galatia, having been forbidden by the Holy Spirit to speak the word in Asia. And when they had come to Mysia, they tried to go into Bithynia, yet the Spirit of Jesus did not allow them.&rdquo; The Spirit of Jesus mentioned in this passage is different from the Spirit of God in the Old Testament, because the name Jesus implies God with man. &ldquo;The Spirit of God&rdquo; was a title commonly used for the Spirit in the Old Testament, but &ldquo;the Spirit of Jesus&rdquo; is a title for the Spirit in the New Testament. Jesus is not only God; He is even more a man. In the New Testament the Holy Spirit of God is the Spirit of Jesus, who is a man. Therefore, the Spirit of God today includes not only the divine nature but also the human nature. This matter has been hidden and almost lost in Christianity. Many Christians today do not realize that the Holy Spirit whom we have received is not only a Spirit of the divine nature but also a Spirit of the human nature.</p>
<p>Through the preaching of the gospel an unbeliever may be very much moved by the Holy Spirit and decide to receive the Lord Jesus. Let us consider who this Lord Jesus is whom he will receive. He is not only God, nor merely the Triune God, but the Triune God who includes man, the Triune God-man, the Triune God mingled with man. In other words, this unbeliever will receive the Triune God and also a man. When he receives the Lord Jesus, the Holy Spirit will enter into him. This Holy Spirit includes not only the divine nature but also the human nature. Even before this unbeliever receives Him, the Savior, the Lord Jesus, has been mingled with man already. Therefore, he receives not only the Triune God but also a man, a man with the Triune God, and the Triune God in a man. Furthermore, the Spirit who enters into him is not only the Spirit of God but also the Spirit of man, a Spirit with whom there is both the divine nature and the human nature. This matter is neglected among Christians today.</p>
<p>We would emphasize the fact that the God whom we worship is the Triune God mingled with man. Today He is not only God; He is also man, the God-man. Moreover, His Spirit today is not only the Spirit of God but also the Spirit of man. Within His Spirit there is the divine nature, and there is also the human nature. He is the Holy Spirit, the Spirit of divinity and of humanity as well. This is the God whom we serve, and this is the Spirit whom we have received.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER TWO</h1>
<h1 class="title">WHAT IS MAN?</h1>
<p>In the previous chapter we saw that God is the Triune God who is mingled with man. This is further confirmed in Romans chapter eight. Verses 9-10a of this chapter say, &ldquo;You are not in the flesh, but in the spirit, if indeed the Spirit of God dwells in you. Yet if anyone does not have the Spirit of Christ, he is not of Him. But if Christ is in you...&rdquo; These verses mention the Spirit of God and the Spirit of Christ interchangeably, indicating that the Spirit of God is the Spirit of Christ. Furthermore, Christ is mentioned interchangeably with the Spirit of Christ, indicating that the Spirit of Christ is Christ Himself. These three titles&mdash;&ldquo;the Spirit of God,&rdquo; &ldquo;the Spirit of Christ,&rdquo; and &ldquo;Christ&rdquo;&mdash;refer to one person, because the Spirit of God is the Spirit of Christ, and the Spirit of Christ is Christ Himself. These three are one Spirit, for Christ is God (9:5) and Christ is the Spirit (2 Cor. 3:17). Verse 11 in Romans 8 continues, &ldquo;If the Spirit of the One who raised Jesus from the dead dwells in you, He who raised Christ from the dead will also give life to your mortal bodies through His Spirit who indwells you.&rdquo; In verses 9 through 11 there are actually four different titles: the Spirit of God, the Spirit of Christ, Christ, and the Spirit. Actually, these titles refer not to four different persons but to one person.</p>
<p>As Christians who have received the Lord Christ as our Savior, we must know two things. The first is that the One whom we have received as our Savior is not only God but also a man. He is a God-man, man as well as God and God as well as man. Because God is the Triune God, our Savior is also a Triune God-man. Moreover, we have pointed out that this Savior whom we have received is God mingled with man. He was mingled with man before we received Him. It is not that after we receive Him, He becomes God mingled with man. On the contrary, two thousand years ago He was already mingled with man. Before He was incarnated, He was only God, but through His incarnation He became God mingled with man. He died on the cross, resurrected from the dead, ascended to the heavens, and was poured out as the Spirit not only in the divine nature but also in the human nature. Therefore, now He is not merely God but God mingled with man. It is wrong to think that the time when God mingled with man was when we received Him as our Savior and that before then He was only God. A very long time before we received Him, He was mingled with man already.</p>
<p>We have seen that the Savior whom the gospel of God brought to us is not only God Himself but also God mingled with man, a God-man who has become our Savior. Yet many people are not clear concerning this. They have received Christ, who is God mingled with man, but they think that it is only God whom they have received. When we received the Lord Jesus, we might not have apprehended or understood that the Lord, the Savior, whom we had received is not only the almighty God but also a man. He is a God-man, the very God mingled with man. On the one hand, He is the mighty God; on the other hand, He was a human child who was born to us but was called Mighty God (Isa. 9:6). Today Jesus Christ, our Savior and Lord, is not merely God but God mingled with man. Within Him there is the divine nature as well as the human nature.</p>
<p>The second thing that we should know as Christians is that the Spirit whom we received from God is not only a Spirit of the divine nature but also a Spirit of the human nature. The Holy Spirit, after the Lord&rsquo;s ascension, came down as the Spirit of God as well as of man, the Spirit not only with the divine nature but also with the human nature. Within Him there is divinity and also humanity. Therefore, the God whom we Christians worship is the Triune God mingled with man, the Triune God-man.</p>
<h2 class="head1">MAN BEING CREATED ACCORDING TO CHRIST<br />
AS THE IMAGE OF GOD</h2>
<p>Having seen what God is, we must now see what man is, that is, what it is to be human. Genesis 1:26-27 says, &ldquo;God said, Let Us make man in Our image, according to Our likeness....And God created man in His own image; in the image of God He created him.&rdquo; Man was created in the image of God. Although man himself is not the image of God, he was created according to God&rsquo;s image. Every person has an image. A person&rsquo;s photograph is a picture that is according to his image. Mankind is a &ldquo;photograph,&rdquo; a picture, of God. However, since God is invisible, how could the invisible God have an image, and what is this image? The answer is found in Colossians 1:15 and 2 Corinthians 4:4, which clearly tell us that Christ is the image of God. An image is an expression. Without an expression, a person cannot be known by others. We know a person by his expression, and his expression is his image. Christ is the image of God because it is through Christ, by Christ, and in Christ that God is expressed. Without Christ, no one has ever seen God; it is Christ who has expressed God and declared Him. Therefore, John 1:18 says, &ldquo;No one has ever seen God; the only begotten Son, who is in the bosom of the Father, He has declared Him.&rdquo; Christ is the expression of God, and Christ is the image of God. Because man was created in the image of God and the image of God is Christ, man was created according to Christ. Thus, man is a &ldquo;photograph&rdquo; of Christ.</p>
<p>It is possible that we have been a Christian for years but have never realized that we are a &ldquo;photograph&rdquo; of Christ because we were created in the image of Christ and according to Christ. If we study Genesis 1:26-27 carefully, we will see that verse 26 speaks of &ldquo;Our image&rdquo; and verse 27 of &ldquo;His own image.&rdquo; <em>His own image</em> refers to Christ, who is the image of God. Human beings were created according to Christ.</p><h2 class="head1">MAN BEING A VESSEL</h2>
<p>Now we need to ask why it is that man was created according to Christ. Most Christians consider that we were created to serve and worship God. However, this thought is not correct. A glove is made according to a hand, with five fingers, for the purpose of containing a hand. Likewise, man was created according to Christ in order that man may contain Christ. The common human thought concerning man&rsquo;s relationship with God is that God is high and almighty and that we are low and small; thus, we should kneel down and prostrate ourselves before God. However, it would be ridiculous for a glove to say to a hand, &ldquo;You are so high and so great. I must prostrate myself before you.&rdquo; That is not the purpose for which the glove was made. As human beings, we were created and made according to Christ not mainly to worship or serve Christ, nor to do good things to please Christ, but to receive Christ, to contain Christ, and to be filled with Christ.</p>
<p>Man was created according to Christ because man is a container, a vessel, to contain Christ. Two passages of the Scriptures prove that man is a vessel. Romans 9:21 says, &ldquo;Does not the potter have authority over the clay to make out of the same lump one vessel unto honor and another unto dishonor?&rdquo; We are clay, and God is the Potter. God made us out of dust to be vessels of honor to contain Christ, who is God. Second Corinthians 4:7 says, &ldquo;We have this treasure in earthen vessels.&rdquo; We are earthen vessels made of clay, and as Christians we have the treasure within us. This treasure is nothing else but God in Christ. We are worthless vessels of clay, but today we have a priceless treasure within us, that is, God Himself in Christ.</p>
<p>God created man according to the image of Christ because man was intended to be a container for Christ, who is the peerless One. Although we are merely vessels made of worthless clay, today we have something worthy and precious, that is, God Himself in Christ, as a treasure within us. We must all realize, therefore, that man is a vessel made of clay according to the image of Christ.</p>
<h2 class="head1">MAN HAVING THREE PARTS&mdash;<br />
A BODY, A SOUL, AND A SPIRIT</h2>
<p>Now we must see how, or with what parts, man as a vessel was made. Man is tripartite; he is a trichotomy, having a body, a soul, and a spirit. Genesis 2:7 says, &ldquo;Jehovah God formed man from the dust of the ground and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life, and man became a living soul.&rdquo; This verse reveals the way in which God created man. First, He used the dust of the ground to form a body. Scientists tell us that the human body is composed of the same elements as the dust. Our body is a body of dust and may be considered to be just a lump of clay. After forming man&rsquo;s body, God breathed the breath of life into man&rsquo;s nostrils. This breath became the human spirit (cf. Prov. 20:27). The body is man&rsquo;s outermost part, and the spirit is man&rsquo;s innermost part. When these two came together, a third item was brought forth, that is, the soul. The soul is man&rsquo;s person, man&rsquo;s self. We must be clear that we have a body outwardly and a spirit inwardly. Outside we have a body, inside we have a spirit, and between these two we have a soul. The soul is the medium between the body and the spirit. Therefore, man is of three parts: spirit, soul, and body.</p>
<p>This is further confirmed by 1 Thessalonians 5:23, which says, &ldquo;The God of peace Himself sanctify you wholly, and may your spirit and soul and body be preserved complete, without blame, at the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ.&rdquo; This verse tells us clearly that man as a complete person is of three parts: spirit and soul and body. It is easy to know the body, because it is something physical and material, but it is more difficult to know the soul. In the Scriptures a person is called a soul (Acts 7:14; Gen. 12:5; 46:15; Exo. 1:5). Therefore, in actual fact we are a soul. The soul is our personality, our self, and our being. It includes the mind for thinking and considering (Psa. 139:14), the emotion for loving, hating, and being joyful and sorrowful (S. S. 1:7; 2 Sam. 5:8; Psa. 86:4; 1 Sam. 30:6), and the will for making decisions (Job 6:7; 7:15). This is the self, our very being. However, it is even more difficult to know the spirit, because the spirit is the innermost, the deepest, part of our being.</p>
<p>As Christians, in order to know and experience Christ as our life in a practical way, we must know the difference between the soul and the spirit. In other words, we must be able to divide the spirit from the soul. Hebrews 4:12 says, &ldquo;For the word of God is living and operative and sharper than any two-edged sword, and piercing even to the dividing of soul and spirit and of joints and marrow.&rdquo; This verse tells us that the greatest help for dividing our spirit from our soul is the word of God, which is like a sharp sword with not one edge but two. Just as the joints and marrow are joined and sometimes mingled together, requiring a sharp, two-edged sword to pierce into them and divide them from each other, today our soul is very much joined with our spirit. The word of God is needed as a sharp, two-edged sword to pierce and divide the soul from the spirit.</p><h2 class="head1">THE FUNCTIONS OF MAN&rsquo;S THREE PARTS</h2>
<p>We have seen that man is tripartite, of three parts, and that the soul and the spirit must be divided. Now let us consider the respective functions of the body, the soul, and the spirit. The body is not a person but a vessel, a container, to contain us as a person (1 Thes. 4:4). In actual fact we do not dwell in a house but in our body. Therefore, our body is both the vessel in which we are contained and the dwelling place in which we dwell (2 Cor. 5:1). This is illustrated by the fact that when a person dies, we often say that he has departed. Even though his ears, eyes, nose, and the other parts of his body remain, he himself has gone. After its contents are gone, a Coca-Cola bottle is an empty bottle; likewise, a body without the person is an empty body. Therefore, strictly speaking, the body is not the person but the vessel, the container, and the dwelling place of the person. Although I dwell in my body and am contained by my body, it is my soul, not my body, that is my person. I am a soul.</p>
<p>Man&rsquo;s spirit also is not his person. The Scriptures never call a person a spirit. It is the angels, not we, who are called spirits (Heb. 1:14). We are souls with a spirit as a receiver. Whereas the body is the vessel, the container, and the soul is the person, the spirit is a receiver, an organ for us to receive God. Therefore, without our body we have no house in which to dwell, and without our spirit we have no receiving organ for us to receive God. Let us illustrate this by a small transistor radio. On the outside there is a box as the container, and on the inside there is a small receiver to receive the radio waves. Without this receiver, although there may be a box outwardly, and although there may be radio waves in the air, the radio cannot play any music. We must realize that we are a &ldquo;radio&rdquo; and that God today is the Spirit who is filling the whole universe with spiritual &ldquo;radio waves&rdquo; for us to receive. We cannot receive God by our ears, nose, hands, or mouth; we can receive Him only by our spirit. The receiver, the receiving organ, for us to receive Christ is our spirit. This means that we need to open our entire being, including our mind, our emotion, our will, our heart, and eventually our spirit, our deepest and inmost part, and say to the Lord, &ldquo;Lord Jesus, I receive You.&rdquo; It is not sufficient merely to talk about Christ and listen to a message about Him. We must open ourselves by opening our mind, our will, our emotion, our heart, our thoughts, our imaginations, and eventually our spirit, the deepest part of our being, to Christ to allow Him to come in.</p>
<p>We would emphasize the fact that our body is not the receiver but the container to contain our soul as our person. Furthermore, we cannot receive Christ by our soul, because our soul is not the receiving organ. The receiving organ is our spirit. We must be right with our spirit, which means that we must &ldquo;tune&rdquo; the receiver rightly, so that the &ldquo;radio waves&rdquo; will come in. This means that we must be right with our inmost part, our deepest part. Those who say that there is no God say this because they do not use their receiving organ. If they would exercise their receiving organ, that is, exercise to be right with their spirit, they would be touched by God and even convicted by Him. They would sense something convicting them within all the time.</p>
<p>We have seen clearly that we are made as vessels to contain God. If we are going to contain God, we must receive God in Christ. We do this not by our body, nor by our mind, our emotions, or our will, but by our inmost part, which is our spirit. The spirit is the receiving organ. This matter is vital and needs to be stressed very much. Without knowing the difference between the spirit and the soul, we will never be able to experience Christ as life in a practical way.</p>
<p>In recent days, after traveling and visiting many places and having contact with many believers, I have discovered that although they may know the doctrine that Christ is life, many simply do not know the proper way to experience Him. Although we may talk about Christ as life, we may not know how to experience Christ in a practical and real way. The reason for this is simply that we do not know that our human spirit is the recipient, the receiving organ, the receiver for us to receive Christ. There are two verses which prove that we must receive Christ. Both use the word <em>receive.</em> John 1:12 says, &ldquo;But as many as received Him,&rdquo; and Colossians 2:6 says, &ldquo;As therefore you have received the Christ.&rdquo; The organ by which we receive Christ is our spirit. In order to be exercised in the matter of experiencing Christ as our life, we must know how to exercise our spirit, and we must also know the difference between the spirit and the soul.</p>
<h2 class="head1">CREATED MAN NEEDING TO RECEIVE GOD AS LIFE</h2>
<p>We have seen that man was created in the image of God for the purpose of containing God, and that man was made in three parts, having a body as a container to contain the soul, having a soul as the self, man&rsquo;s very being, and having a spirit as the receiving organ to receive God in Christ. We must realize, however, that at the time of creation man did not have God as life. He was just an empty vessel without the life of God. For this reason, after creating man, God put him in front of the tree of life, which signifies God Himself as life to man (Gen. 2:9). Man was put before the tree of life with the intention that he would receive the tree of life. This indicates that at the time of creation man was an empty vessel without its intended content. He needed to receive God as life, that is, to receive Christ as life.</p>
<p>This explains why without Christ a person&rsquo;s life is empty. If a person does not have Christ, if he does not have God, he does not have the content of his human life. He is just an empty vessel. Today the Triune God is mingled with man, and He is ready and waiting for you to receive Him. Such a wonderful One, God mingled with man, with the human nature as well as the divine nature, is the Savior waiting for you to receive Him. You are just a vessel with a body as the container, a soul as your self, and a spirit as the receiving organ to receive this wonderful One. Everything is ready. If you receive Him, He and you will be mingled together as one. This is the wonderful mingling of this wonderful One with our poor person. Nevertheless, regardless of how wonderful He is and how poor we are, we were made as the only right and proper vessels to receive Him and contain Him.</p>
<p>This receiving and mingling is the relationship of God with man in His new creation. The new creation is simply God who has mingled Himself with His creature, that is, with His created man. God mingled with man is the new creation. In this new creation, therefore, the relationship of God with man is simply God mingling Himself with man and man receiving God into him, with the result that God and man become one.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER THREE</h1>
<h1 class="title">WHAT IS THE NEW CREATION?</h1>
<p>In the previous chapter we saw that our human spirit within us is the recipient or receiving organ for us to receive God in Christ. John 4:24 says, &ldquo;God is Spirit, and those who worship Him must worship in spirit.&rdquo; In this verse two spirits are mentioned. The first word <em>Spirit</em> begins with an uppercase <em>S</em> and the second <em>spirit,</em> with a lowercase <em>s.</em> This indicates that the first Spirit is the Spirit of God, even God Himself, and the second spirit is not the Spirit of God but our spirit. God is a Spirit, and we also have a spirit within us. Human beings are made of three parts: spirit, soul, and body (1 Thes. 5:23). According to John 4:24, if we wish to worship God, who is Spirit, we must worship Him in our spirit.</p>
<p>In order to contact anything that is physical, or material, in substance, we need to use the right organ. For instance, in order to substantiate color, we should not exercise our ears, for the ears are the wrong organ. We should exercise our eyes, our sight. Likewise, we can substantiate the sound of voices by exercising our ears, and we can substantiate odors by exercising our nose. In contacting anything, we need to use the right organ; otherwise, we cannot substantiate the substance.</p>
<p>God is Spirit. This means that the substance of God is Spirit. Hence, we need to consider what organ we should use to substantiate God. We certainly cannot substantiate God by thinking, that is, by using our mind, for the more we think, the more it seems that God is absent. God created a spirit within us for the very purpose that we may contact Him, receive Him, and substantiate Him (Gen. 2:7; Zech. 12:1). We are vessels made for God (Rom. 9:21-23). A vessel differs from an instrument. The latter is a tool, whereas the former is a container. We are vessels, and we have seen clearly that we need to contain God. God is the content, and we are the container. Just as our stomach is the proper organ for us to receive, store, and digest food, our spirit is the right organ for us to receive God, contain God, and even store God. The spirit within us, that is, our human spirit, not the Holy Spirit, is the place in us where God the Spirit dwells. Therefore, our spirit is the dwelling place of God the Spirit (Eph. 2:22). For this reason, in John 4:24 the Lord Jesus tells us clearly that God is Spirit and that if we are going to contact Him and worship Him, we must do this in our spirit. Our spirit is the right organ for us to contact God.</p>
<p>Romans 8:16 says, &ldquo;The Spirit Himself witnesses with our spirit that we are children of God.&rdquo; This verse also mentions two spirits. The first is the Holy Spirit, and the second is our human spirit. Moreover, this verse proves that the Holy Spirit works together with our spirit and that the Holy Spirit is in our spirit. In fact, the Holy Spirit of God is one with our spirit, for 1 Corinthians 6:17 says, &ldquo;He who is joined to the Lord is one spirit.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Based on John 4:24, Romans 8:16, and 1 Corinthians 6:17 we see clearly that our spirit is the proper organ for us to receive and contain God. God is Spirit; hence, we must contact and worship Him in our spirit. The Spirit of God witnesses with our spirit; this means that He works together with our spirit. Thus, the Holy Spirit and our spirit mingle together as one spirit, and we are one with the Lord in the spirit. Apart from our spirit, we cannot be one with the Lord. The Lord is the Spirit, we have a spirit, and these two spirits mingle together, with the result that we are one with the Lord. We are one with the Lord in our spirit, not in any other part of our being. We must recognize that God has created a spirit for us and within us so that through this spirit as a receiving organ, we may receive Him into us. The Holy Spirit is dwelling in our spirit; thus, our spirit is the residence and dwelling place of the Holy Spirit. This is the revelation of the Holy Scriptures concerning the two spirits.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE NEW CREATION</h2>
<p>The subject of this book is the relationship of God with man in His new creation. In the first two chapters we saw clearly what God is and what man is. We pointed out that the God whom Christians worship is the Triune God, a God of three persons, who is mingled with man. In this God there is divinity as well as humanity. In this God there are the Father as the source, the Son as the expression, and the Holy Spirit as the transmission (2 Cor. 13:14). There is also the mingling of God with man. Moreover, according to Isaiah 9:6, the Son is the Father, because the Son is called Eternal Father, and according to 2 Corinthians 3:17, the Lord, who is the Son, is the Spirit. The Son was incarnated to be a man, who is Christ Jesus the Lord (Luke 2:11), and even today He is the Son of Man in the heavens (Matt. 26:64; Acts 7:56). How wonderful it is that the God whom we Christians serve and worship today is the Triune God mingled with man. We have also pointed out that man is a vessel created in the image of God with three parts: the body as a container to contain the soul; the soul as the being, the very person, the self; and the spirit as the organ to receive God.</p>
<p>Now that we have seen what God is and what man is, the third thing we need to see is what God&rsquo;s new creation is. It is correct to say that the church is the new creation, or even that the Body of Christ, the expression of Christ, is the new creation. However, we must realize that in its fundamental meaning the new creation is man mingled with the Triune God-man.</p>
<p>As Christians, we believe in and serve a God who is the Triune God mingled with man. He is the Son, yet He is called the Father. Moreover, He is the Spirit, and He is mingled with man. When the Triune God with the human nature mingles Himself with a group of human beings, the issue is the new creation. The new creation is composed of many created men who have received this Triune God-man into them and are being mingled with Him as one.</p>
<p>We have seen clearly that the very God whom we have received is the Son, who is called the Father, who is the Spirit, and who is incarnated as a man. Man is a soul with a body as a container and a spirit as a receiver to receive this God. The part of man that receives God is the human spirit. God, who is the Son, who is called the Father, who is the Spirit, and who is mingled with man, is now dwelling in our human spirit. Therefore, in simple terms, the new creation is the Triune God-man who has mingled Himself with us in our spirit. The old creation, in contrast, consists of many things that were created by God but do not have God in them and do not have God mingled with them. The new creation is something very different; it is God Himself as the Father, the Son, and the Spirit, with the human nature, mingled with us, the creatures; it is a mingling of human beings with the Triune God-man.</p>
<p>In order to prove this by the Scriptures, we must first consider John 3:3-5. Verse 3 says, &ldquo;Jesus answered and said to him, Truly, truly, I say to you, Unless one is born anew, he cannot see the kingdom of God.&rdquo; To be born anew means to have a new beginning, a new source, and a new origin. Verse 4 continues, &ldquo;Nicodemus said to Him, How can a man be born when he is old? He cannot enter a second time into his mother&rsquo;s womb and be born, can he?&rdquo; The elderly Nicodemus thought that to be born anew meant to go back into his mother&rsquo;s womb and to be born from there again. The Lord told him in verse 5, &ldquo;Unless one is born of water and the Spirit, he cannot enter into the kingdom of God.&rdquo; In order to understand the meaning of being born of water and the Spirit, we need to consider the background of the Lord&rsquo;s word. The Lord was speaking with Nicodemus, who was a Pharisee. Before that time the Pharisees had gone to John the Baptist, who told them that he came to baptize in water, but One would come after him who would baptize them in the Holy Spirit (Matt. 3:11). One of the Pharisees, Nicodemus, then came to see the Lord, and the Lord referred to the word spoken by John. When a person repented at the preaching of John the Baptist, he was baptized by him. This means that he was buried; he was terminated. To be born of water simply means to be put to an end and buried. To be born of water is the negative aspect. In the positive aspect, we must be born of the Spirit in order to have a new beginning. The old man is finished and buried, and we have a new beginning through the Holy Spirit.</p>
<p>In the same principle, when we repent and believe in the Lord Jesus today, the first thing the church does is baptize us, which means that it gets rid of us. In the past, whenever the church had a baptism, I would tell people, &ldquo;You must understand what we are doing today. We are having a funeral to bury people, to get rid of the old man.&rdquo; On the positive side, we are born not only of water but also of the Spirit. The Holy Spirit has come into us to impart Christ as life so that we can have a new beginning, a new source, a new origin, and a new course. This is what it means to be born anew.</p>
<p>Therefore, we must see that because the old man has been buried, he is finished, he is dead, and the old course is over. The Holy Spirit has come in to impart something new for us to have a new beginning, source, course, and origin. This new beginning, source, course, and origin are nothing other than Christ, that is, God in the Son as the Spirit&mdash;the Triune God&mdash;mingled with man. This very God comes into us as a new beginning, a new source, a new course, and a new origin. Everything old is finished, put to an end, and buried.</p>
<p>Formerly, we did not have God or Christ within us. We were simply empty persons, having nothing of Christ, God, or the Holy Spirit. But one day we repented to God, confessed our sins, and opened ourselves to Him. We realized that we had been crucified with Christ on the cross. At that very moment the Triune God&mdash;God in the Son as the Spirit&mdash;came into us to dwell within us. From that time onward we realized that we were more than mere men. We had God, Christ, and the Holy Spirit within us.</p><h2 class="head1">THE EXPERIENCE OF CHRIST MINGLING WITH US</h2>
<p>How do we know that we have Christ within us? Many times we may have argued with the Lord. At such times He tried to subdue and convince us, and we on our part tried to convince Him. Furthermore, many times we desired to do something, such as go to the movies, yet He did not agree with us. Have you had this kind of experience? If not, you are merely an empty vessel, but if so, this is wonderful and glorious, for it proves that there is a treasure, Christ, within you (2 Cor. 4:7). You have been born anew, and there is something new within you. The divine life, which is God Himself, is not merely a source but also a course. This means that we have a new beginning, a new course to follow, and a new life to live. This new source, course, and life is God Himself, that is, God the Son, who is called God the Father, who is also God the Spirit, and who is mingled with man.</p>
<p>What then is the new creation? The new creation is an old man who has been born anew. His old history, course, source, and life have been put to an end and buried, and now within him there is a new beginning, source, course, and life, which is the Triune God mingled with man. We cannot exhaust what the Triune God-man is. He is everything: light, life, love, the way, the truth, power, strength, and everything we need. Furthermore, He is omnipotent, unlimited, infinite, and all-inclusive. Do you need light? He is light (1 John 1:5). Do you need comfort? He is comfort (2 Cor. 1:3). Do you need joy? He is joy (Psa. 43:4; Neh. 8:10). Do you need strength? He is strength (Psa. 118:14; Phil. 4:13). Do you need clothing? He is the real clothing (Luke 15:22; Gal. 3:27). Do you need a house? He is the house, the dwelling place, for Psalm 90:1 says, &ldquo;O Lord, You have been our dwelling place / In all generations.&rdquo; He is everything to us (cf. Col. 2:16-17). This is wonderful, yet the most wonderful thing is that this all-inclusive Triune God-man has mingled Himself with us.</p>
<p>He is also the One who bears all our burdens (Matt. 11:28; 1 Pet. 5:7). Five years ago, when I was in Copenhagen, Denmark, a co-worker asked me why I never seemed to be anxious even though there was a large work under my care in Taiwan with many co-workers, burdens, responsibilities, and troubles. I replied that although there was indeed a large work, my secret was that I did not consider it to be my burden but His burden. I was not alone; I had Christ as my Partner. I was one with Christ, and Christ had mingled Himself with me.</p>
<p>The new creation is nothing less than the Triune God-man entering into our spirit and joining Himself with us and mingling Himself with us. Through Christ&rsquo;s redeeming death we have been put to an end. We are finished, we are nothing, and now we have Christ within us as a new life, source, course, and origin (Gal. 2:20).</p>
<p>John 3:6 says, &ldquo;That which is born of the flesh is flesh, and that which is born of the Spirit is spirit.&rdquo; Formerly, we were born of our parents to be flesh. Now we have been born anew of the Holy Spirit to be spirit, so that we may have a new start, a new course to run, and a new life to live.</p>
<p>Furthermore, 2 Corinthians 5:17 says, &ldquo;So then if anyone is in Christ, he is a new creation. The old things have passed away; behold, they have become new.&rdquo; The new creation was created by the Triune God-man and with the Triune God-man mingled with us. It is a new man, who was an old man but who is now in Christ, is one with Christ, and is mingled with Christ (Eph. 2:15).</p>
<h2 class="head1">THREE CATEGORIES OF CHRISTIANS</h2>
<p>Christians today may be classified into one of three categories. First, there are the many nominal Christians who take Christianity merely as a religion, not knowing what Christianity is or what it teaches. I was this kind of person before I was saved. At sixteen or seventeen years of age I took Christianity as my religion without knowing what it actually was. I had been taught that every person in society needs a religion. Since I considered Christianity to be the best religion, I chose Christianity as my religion. However, I neither knew nor cared who Christ was, who God was, whether I would go to hell or heaven, or that I was sinful. I went to church, sang hymns, and had a pleasant time inside some fine church buildings. I took Christianity as my religion like the many so-called Christians who are in this category.</p>
<p>The Christians in the second category are much improved over those in the first category. They study in order to know the doctrines and teachings of Christianity, including the creeds. They know that God is the Triune God who is the Father, the Son, and the Spirit and that the Lord Jesus is the Son of God incarnated to be a man. However, although they are knowledgeable concerning the teachings and doctrines of Christianity, they know neither where Christ is nor what He has to do with man. The most they are able to say is that Christ is in the heavens. They are Christians of Christian teachings and doctrines, not Christians of Christ Himself. They do not know Christ in a living way and have little to do with Christ Himself.</p>
<p>However, there is a third category of Christians, a minority, who not only take Christianity as their religion and learn the teachings and doctrines of Christianity, but even more, take Christ as the living One into them and have a living relationship with Christ. They know Christ as One who lives within them in a living way.</p>
<p>Christ is real, present, near, and available. He is more available than the air. We know that in order to breathe in air, there is no need to go to a supermarket or to go to our kitchen to cook. Air is always available and handy. However, Christ is even more handy than the air, because today He is in us. Everywhere we go, He goes with us and in us. At a certain time I had a desire and an intention to visit a certain person. At that time I hoped that Christ would not go with me. It was as if I said to Him, &ldquo;Lord, would You leave me alone for a while? Please stay here and allow me to go there just by myself.&rdquo; On such an occasion I received no answer from the Lord. Nevertheless, when I went, He went. I discovered that He is rather troublesome and bothersome. If we have this kind of experience, we are blessed. Although He is the troublesome One, He is also the One who is a blessing. The more we are troubled by Him, the more we are blessed by Him. Christ is living, real, available, ready, and near to us. Even though there may be times when we regret being a Christian because of the trouble caused by our sinful nature and our old man, we cannot get rid of Christ. He is always within us, bothering us.</p>
<p>If we do not have this kind of experience, we are not Christians in the third category. As what kind of Christian do you classify yourself: a Christian of Christianity, a Christian of Christian teachings, or a Christian of Christ? A Christian of Christ is one who can testify, &ldquo;Christ is within me. He talks with me, He walks with me, and He works with me. He is always bothering me.&rdquo; It is a blessing to be bothered by Christ. The more we are bothered by Him, the more we are blessed. This shows that we are not merely Christians of Christianity, nor Christians of Christian teachings, but Christians with Christ, of Christ, in Christ, and mingled with Christ as one. We are the new creation. We have Christ as the Triune God-man within us and mingled with us as one. We can never exhaust the telling of Christ to others. The more we speak Christ forth, the more Christ flows in, because we have the living Christ within us as the living fountain, source, and course.</p>
<p>Galatians 6:15 says, &ldquo;For neither is circumcision anything nor uncircumcision, but a new creation is what matters.&rdquo; We need to forget about rules, rituals, teachings, regulations, and forms, which are indicated by the terms <em>circumcision</em> and <em>uncircumcision;</em> none of these are anything. We must remember that we are a new creation, a person mingled with the Triune God-man. As a new creation we do not have Christian teachings, rules, or regulations. We have Christ as the Triune God-man, who is living and powerful within us.</p>
<p>Ephesians 2:15 says that in His crucifixion Christ abolished in His flesh the ordinances of the law that separated the Jews and the Gentiles &ldquo;that He might create the two in Himself into one new man, so making peace.&rdquo; <em>The two</em> refers to the Jewish and Gentile believers. Christ created these two parties in Himself into a new man, and this new man is the new creation. This new man, according to verse 16, is also the Body of Christ. The one new man, which is the new creation, is the one Body, and this one Body is the church (1:22-23; Col. 1:18). Moreover, this church is the genuine church. It does not include those Christians who are just of Christianity, nor does it include those Christians who are just of Christian teachings without Christ. Rather, this church includes only those Christians who are of Christ, the real and true Christians, the Christians who have the living Christ within them. These Christians are the Body, the new man, and the new creation. Therefore, in Ephesians 2:15-16 we see that the new man is the new creation because this new man is created by Christ, in Christ, and with Christ as the element.</p>
<p>Furthermore, these verses tell us that the new man was created of two peoples, the Jews and the Gentiles. Of these two peoples Christ created a new man in Himself, by Himself, and with Himself, and this new man is the Body. Therefore, we should not think that we as individuals are new men. There are not many new men; there is only one new man. We are the parts, the members, of the one new man, the one Body, which is a universal man including all genuine Christians.</p>
<p>In this chapter we have seen clearly what the new creation is. The new creation is a composition of all the genuine believers, those who are born anew, regenerated with Christ, and mingled with the Triune God-man. Corporately, they are all one universal man, one Body, the church of Christ. Hence, in speaking concerning the relationship of God with man in His new creation, we are referring to the new man, the Body of Christ.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER FOUR</h1>
<h1 class="title">THE PURPOSE OF THE MINGLING<br />
OF GOD WITH MAN</h1>
<h2 class="head1">THE GOD-MAN AND THE NEW CREATION</h2>
<p>Thus far we have seen what God is, what man is, and what the new creation is. In the foregoing chapter we pointed out that the new creation is simply the mingling of God with man. We need to be very clear in our vision that the God whom we worship and serve is the Triune God who was incarnated as a man. From the time of the incarnation He has been not only the Triune God but also a man, a God-man. Hence, He is man mingled with God and God mingled with man. As far as He is concerned, this mingling was accomplished two thousand years ago. Through His incarnation He brought God into man, and by His death, resurrection, and ascension He brought man into God. Moreover, He brought God into man to live on this earth in the man Jesus. The Lord Jesus was God living in a man on earth; He was God walking, working, acting, and moving in a man.</p>
<p>The record of the four Gospels shows us that the almighty, infinite God was incarnated to be a man and lived, moved, acted, and walked in a man on this earth. However, He also accomplished something further. Through His death, resurrection, and ascension He brought man into God and to the heavens (Rom. 1:3-4; Luke 24:50-51). Now there is a man existing and living in God in the heavens. By His incarnation God came into man and walked in man on this earth, and by His death, resurrection, and ascension man was brought into God and now lives in God in the heavens. When He was on earth, God walked in a man on the earth, and now that He is in the heavens, man lives in God in the heavens.</p>
<p>Regrettably, many Christians think that when the Lord Jesus was incarnated, He put man on only temporarily; then He took man off again after He had died and resurrected. In their concept, forty days after His resurrection the Lord ascended into the heavens, and He is there no longer as a man. According to this understanding, Christ came as God to put man on for only thirty-three and a half years, as if He were putting on a piece of clothing; after He went to the cross and was crucified, He put man off and returned back to the heavens exactly as He had been before, as God and no longer as man. By reading the Scriptures, however, we can see that even today Christ is still a man in the heavens. After the Lord Jesus had ascended into the heavens, when Stephen was being stoned to death in Acts 7, he saw the heavens opened and the Son of Man standing at the right hand of God (v. 56). Hence, today Jesus Christ is in heaven as the Son of Man. Moreover, in Matthew chapter twenty-six, when Christ was questioned by the high priest as to whether or not He was the Son of God, He told him, &ldquo;From now on you will see the Son of Man sitting at the right hand of Power and coming on the clouds of heaven&rdquo; (v. 64). Thus, even in His second coming the Lord will be the Son of Man. This is a wonderful matter that is far beyond our human concept.</p>
<p>We should not think that the Lord Jesus, who was God, came and put man upon Himself, that He died and resurrected in order to terminate man, and that today He is no longer a man but only the almighty God. This is a natural, human thought. On the contrary, we must realize that God&rsquo;s intention is to mingle Himself with man. He has entered into man, and He will not give man up. Although today many married couples get divorced, God, having &ldquo;married&rdquo; man, will never &ldquo;get a divorce.&rdquo; The Lord today is still joined with man, and He still has the human nature. Hence, He is God and man. When He comes to present Himself to you as the Savior, He is the God-man. When you receive Him as the Savior, you receive not only God; you receive the God-man.</p>
<p>Furthermore, we all have a human spirit (Job 32:8). However, the subtle enemy Satan is doing his best to prevent us from knowing this. This is because once we realize that we have a spirit, we will exercise our spirit to contact God. God is the Spirit who was already mingled with man before we received Him, and we are persons with a spirit for us to receive this wonderful God. When we receive Him, He becomes one with us, and we become one with Him. This is the new creation, which is nothing other than the mingling of this wonderful God with us.</p>
<p>For many years I did not know the purpose of God&rsquo;s salvation. I always thought that God&rsquo;s salvation was to pull me out of hell and one day carry me to the heavens. I considered that in the meantime, while I was still on this earth, I needed joy, peace, and certain blessings. Therefore, I thought that God on His part should day by day share with me a little joy, happiness, peace, etc., and I on my part should do something good to please Him, glorify Him, serve Him, and fulfill His purpose. Many of us have thought in this way and even thanked the Lord for His outward blessings. May the Lord open our eyes to see that the purpose of God&rsquo;s salvation is something absolutely different from our human concept. He is the Triune God incarnated as a man. He has accomplished the mingling of God with man already. Now He presents Himself to us in the way of mingling, as God who is already mingled with man, for us to receive. If we open our spirit, which He created for us, and receive Him into us, He will be one with us and we will be one with Him. This is what is spoken of in 1 Corinthians 6:17: &ldquo;He who is joined to the Lord is one spirit.&rdquo; We and He, He and we, become a mingling, and this mingling is the new creation.</p>
<p>This new creation is mentioned also in Galatians 6:15, which says, &ldquo;Neither is circumcision anything nor uncircumcision, but a new creation is what matters.&rdquo; The context in which the new creation is mentioned here indicates that we should simply take care of the mingling and experience the mingling of God with us all the time. Several times in the past, young brothers and sisters have come to argue with me concerning going to the movies. I usually answered them in this way: &ldquo;Dear brother, go to the movies and see whether the Lord Jesus goes with you. If you can enjoy the mingling of God in the movie theater, you should go there and enjoy it. If you cannot, you are wrong.&rdquo; Neither circumcision nor uncircumcision is anything, or, we may say, neither going to the movies nor refraining from movies is anything, but the new creation, the mingling of God with us, is what matters.</p>
<p>Even in the matter of whether or not to visit a certain brother or sister, we need to be assured that we are living in Christ and by Christ. We should have the sense that we are one with the Lord; otherwise, we should stop. Being a Christian is a mysterious matter, for a Christian is a mingling of God with man. We need to realize that day by day and moment by moment we are a mingling of God with man. Whatever we do and speak must be a mingling of God with man. This is the new creation.</p><h2 class="head1">THE PURPOSE OF MINGLING&mdash;<br />
TO PRODUCE MANY SONS OF GOD<br />
FOR HIS EXPRESSION</h2>
<p>The mingling of God with man has a definite purpose. This purpose is that God might be expressed through a group of people who are coordinated and built up together as a corporate Body.</p>
<p>Ephesians 1:5 says, &ldquo;Predestinating us unto sonship through Jesus Christ to Himself, according to the good pleasure of His will.&rdquo; The word <em>predestinate</em>
 means &ldquo;foreordain.&rdquo; God predestinated, or foreordained, us to be His sons. Sonship refers to the matter of expression. The title &ldquo;Son of God&rdquo; refers to the expression of God. In relation to this, John 1:18 says, &ldquo;No one has ever seen God; the only begotten Son, who is in the bosom of the Father, He has declared Him.&rdquo; Since a son is the expression of his father, God&rsquo;s predestinating us unto sonship, that is, His predestinating us to be sons of God, simply means that He foreordained us to be the expression of God.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, many Christians understand this verse in a very natural way. They consider that God has a beautiful home in the heavens with a golden street, pearl gates, and precious stones, and that we as His sons will inherit this magnificent home. However, this is not the scriptural meaning of sonship. Sonship is not a matter of inheriting some physical blessings from God but a matter of expressing God. For us to be sons of God means that we are the expression of God.</p>
<p>Furthermore, Hebrew 2:10 says, &ldquo;It was fitting for Him, for whom are all things and through whom are all things, in leading many sons into glory, to make the Author of their salvation perfect through sufferings.&rdquo; This verse does not say that God is bringing many sons to the heavens, into beautiful heavenly mansions. It says that God is bringing many sons into glory. Glory is God Himself; it is God expressed, God manifested. We may compare this to electricity. Whenever a light shines, we see the glory of electricity, which is the shining of electricity. Glory is God shining, God manifested, God expressed. One day all the regenerated believers as the many sons of God, the expression of God, will be brought into glory, the manifestation of God (Col. 3:4). Nevertheless, what Christianity teaches today, and what many fundamental Christians believe, is that God is bringing many sinners into heavenly mansions. But God has not predestinated, or foreordained, us to inherit heavenly mansions; He has predestinated us to be His sons, that is, to be His expression. One day He will bring us, the many sons, into His glory. The purpose of God&rsquo;s mingling Himself with us is that we might have the sonship, that we might become God&rsquo;s expression.</p>
<p>Romans 8:29 says, &ldquo;Those whom He foreknew, He also predestinated to be conformed to the image of His Son, that He might be the Firstborn among many brothers.&rdquo; If we read this verse carefully, we will realize that it does not say that God predestinated us to be saved from hell and brought to heaven, as is taught by fundamental Christianity today. Rather, it says that every saved one has been predestinated to be made the same as the Son of God, that is, to be conformed to the image of Christ so that He might be the Firstborn among many brothers. Nevertheless, our understanding of this verse may be that God has predestinated us sinners to go to a heavenly home so that Christ might have many companions.</p>
<p>Many Christian hymns refer to the saved ones passing through pearl gates, walking on a golden street, being with Christ forever, and going to a place where there will be no tears or darkness. Such hymns do not manifest any light but are full of the human thought and concept. They lack the divine revelation that God&rsquo;s eternal purpose is to mingle Himself with us so that we will be conformed to the image of Christ to be the full expression of God Himself. The purpose of God&rsquo;s mingling with us is to make us the real, genuine, full, perfect, and complete expression of Himself. This is the sonship. Prior to two thousand years ago, God had only one Son, one expression, but today God has many sons, and the only begotten Son has now become the firstborn Son. Therefore, God has thousands upon thousands, even millions, of sons as His expression. This is far more wonderful than a golden street and pearl gates.</p>
<p>God predestinated us to be conformed to the image of His Son, Jesus Christ. Although as human beings we were created in the image of Christ (Gen. 1:26; cf. Col. 1:15a), we do not yet have the form of Christ or look like Christ. Therefore, we need to be conformed to Him. Formerly, we were like a photo or a picture of Christ without the reality of Christ. A photo of a person has the person&rsquo;s image but not his reality. Christ intends to make us a living photo of Himself; hence, He has put Himself as the reality into us. Christ is within us for the purpose of conforming us to Himself. One day our thinking, loving, deciding, speaking, and doing will be full of Christ. We will be exactly the same as Christ is. Christ will fill us, saturate us, and permeate us.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE THREE STEPS OF BEING CONFORMED TO CHRIST</h2>
<p>There are three steps that Christ takes in order to conform us to Himself. According to John 3:3-7, the first step is that Christ regenerates us in our spirit at the time we receive Him as our Savior. According to 2 Corinthians 3:18, the second step is that from the time He regenerates us, Christ transforms us in our soul, which includes our mind, will, and emotion. Today the Lord, who is the Spirit, is constantly working to transform us, and we are being transformed into the image of Christ from glory to glory. Verse 17 says, &ldquo;The Lord is the Spirit; and where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is freedom.&rdquo; By the Spirit and with the freedom, the Lord continually works to transform us, that is, to transform our soul. This is confirmed by Romans 12:2, which says that we must be transformed by the renewing of the mind, the mind being the main part of the soul. We have been regenerated in our spirit, and we are now under the process of being transformed in our soul. Transformation is the growth of a Christian. The more we are transformed, changed, and renewed in our mind, will, and emotion, the more we grow in the divine life. The growth of a Christian is a transformation, a change in life, a change in the soul, that is, in the mind, will, and emotion. The consummation of our transformation is our being conformed to the image of Christ as God&rsquo;s firstborn Son (Rom. 8:29).</p>
<p>The third step for Christ to conform us to Himself will occur when the Lord Jesus comes back. At that time our body will be changed, or transfigured. Philippians 3:20-21 says, &ldquo;Our commonwealth exists in the heavens, from which also we eagerly await a Savior, the Lord Jesus Christ, who will transfigure the body of our humiliation to be conformed to the body of His glory, according to His operation by which He is able even to subject all things to Himself.&rdquo; The Lord Jesus will exercise His power and authority to transfigure the body of our humiliation into a glorious body. Then we will be wholly, absolutely, and thoroughly the same as He is. This is confirmed by 1 John 3:2, which says, &ldquo;We know that if He is manifested, we will be like Him because we will see Him even as He is.&rdquo; Today we may look the same as the worldly people, but at that time we will be thoroughly the same as He is.</p>
<p>Based on the aforementioned verses we can see that we have three parts&mdash;spirit, soul, and body&mdash;and that the Lord conforms us to Himself in three steps: first, He regenerates our spirit; second, He transforms our soul; and third, He transfigures our body to make us absolutely the same as the Son of God.</p>
<p>Today we do not look much like the Son of God because our transformation has not yet been completed. The process is still continuing. We may compare this to the process whereby a beautiful butterfly comes forth from an ugly worm. Within the ugly worm there is a life that continually transforms the worm. Hence, a process takes place in which the worm is transformed into a beautiful butterfly. We are the &ldquo;ugly worm.&rdquo; Often I have looked at myself and realized that I am just like an ugly worm. Although occasionally I may have a beautiful appearance and expression, a little part of the worm still remains. For example, even though we may love others in Christ, a small part of that love is ugly. The beautiful part of the love is in Christ, but there is still a &ldquo;tail&rdquo; of the &ldquo;ugly worm&rdquo; accompanying it, a little part that is of Adam. The reason for this is that we are still under the process of transformation.</p>
<p>We have pointed out that we have been regenerated in our spirit and are now under the process of transformation in our soul. Day by day we are being transformed by the renewing of our mind, emotion, and will. Furthermore, we are also waiting for the day when Christ will come to transfigure the body of our humiliation to conform it to the body of His glory by His subduing power. On that day we will be a &ldquo;beautiful butterfly&rdquo; without anything remaining of the &ldquo;ugly worm.&rdquo; We will be absolutely, thoroughly, and completely in Christ and will be full of Christ and mingled with Christ from center to circumference. This is the purpose of God&rsquo;s mingling with us.</p>
<p>In these days may the Lord open our eyes to see all these things in a divine, heavenly way so that we may be delivered from every kind of human concept concerning the Christian life and conduct. The Triune God has mingled Himself with man. He is now a God-man and is living within us to mingle Himself with us in order to make us a part of His new creation. This new creation is simply the mingling of divinity with humanity, the mingling of God with man. This mingling is for the purpose of producing many sons for the corporate expression of God Himself. In order to accomplish this purpose, God has regenerated us in our spirit, He is transforming us in our soul, and He will transfigure us in our body. At that time we will be absolutely like Him, as He is.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER FIVE</h1>
<h1 class="title">THE WAY FOR GOD<br />
TO BE MINGLED WITH MAN</h1>
<h1 class="title">(1)</h1>
<h1 class="title">THE LIGHT OF LIFE</h1>
<h2 class="head1">LIFE BEING THE WAY<br />
THAT GOD MINGLES HIMSELF WITH US</h2>
<p>God&rsquo;s intention is to mingle Himself with us so that we may be one with Him to become His expression. In this chapter we will begin to consider the way that God mingles with man, that is, how He accomplishes this matter. Although it is correct to say that He accomplishes this mingling through the Spirit and by Christ&rsquo;s death on the cross, the main thing we must stress is that God&rsquo;s way to mingle Himself with us is by life. Life is a great subject in the Scriptures. God became life to us so that He could mingle Himself with us.</p>
<p>We may illustrate this by the physical food that we eat. In order for an apple to be mingled with us, it must be life to us. We need to eat and digest it and allow it to become a life element to us. Then the apple will enter into our blood and will become one with us. This is the genuine mingling. We may say that we are mingled with many cows, chickens, fish, eggs, apples, peaches, etc. For us to be mingled with a chicken does not require both the chicken and us to be chopped up and then mixed together. This would not be a mingling but a killing. In order for us to be mingled with something, we need to take that thing as our life so that it becomes our content.</p>
<p>The matter of mingling has been lost in Christianity. Many Christians today speak in different ways about Christ and God, but they neglect the fact that God in Christ is life to us. Even though some may say that Christ is life, many times they do not understand what they are saying. Actually, the matter of life is difficult to speak about. To speak concerning our physical body is easy, but it is difficult to speak about our physical life because life is abstract and mysterious. We all know that we have a physical life, but it is difficult to define our physical life. Because it is difficult to define and explain the matter of Christ and God being life to us, this matter has been lost in Christianity.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE PRIMARY MATTER IN THE SCRIPTURES</h2>
<p>In the Scriptures the primary matter is that God is life to us. After God created man, the first picture revealed to us concerning God is that God is life to man. In the record of Genesis chapters one and two, God created man in His own image (1:26), using the dust of the ground to form man&rsquo;s body and God&rsquo;s breath of life to form man&rsquo;s spirit, with the result that man became a living soul (2:7). It is significant that after creating man, God did not tell man to worship and serve Him or to do good things to please Him. Instead, God told man to take care of his eating, implying that God wanted man to eat the tree of life, which signifies God as life to created man (vv. 8-9, 16-17). God intended that created man would take God into him as life.</p>
<p>We must be clear that God has no intention to ask us to serve Him. Even though some may argue that there are passages in the Scriptures that tell us to serve God, this is not what is in God&rsquo;s mind or heart. God intends that we come to Him to receive Him and take Him as life. The more we take Him as life, the more we please Him. Mankind always thinks that he must do something for God, that he must work, serve, and worship God (cf. Luke 15:17-24). We simply do not understand God&rsquo;s heart, mind, or desire. God&rsquo;s heart and desire are that He would be life to us, that we would receive Him and take Him as life.</p>
<p>For example, in John chapter six, when the Lord Jesus fed five thousand people with five loaves and two fish, the Jewish people considered this to be a great matter. They thought that Jesus was a great prophet, and they wanted to force Him to be King (v. 15). But the Lord indicated that, instead of coming as a great prophet or a great king, He came to be small pieces of bread to be eaten by them (vv. 32-35, 48-51, 57). The Lord does not want to be enthroned by us in an outward way; rather, He desires to be eaten by us.</p>
<p>Today many in Christianity praise Christ for His greatness. However, whatever we take in as food must be small, certainly smaller than we are. Thus, the human concept is absolutely different from the divine thought. The human concept is that God is great and that we must serve and worship Him. The divine thought is that God desires to come into us as life. In order to be life to us, God became small, as small as a piece of bread or fruit (Rev. 22:2), for us to take and eat. Although God&rsquo;s being life to us in Christ through the Spirit is unsearchably rich, the picture in John chapter six shows that this matter also involves smallness. The one who contributed the five loaves and two fish was not a great man but a little boy (v. 9), indicating something small yet rich. There were only five loaves and two small fish, but five thousand men with women and children were all filled, and still there were twelve baskets left over (vv. 10-13). This is the way in which Christ is life to us.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE BIBLE BEING A BOOK OF LIFE</h2>
<p>The Bible is a book of life. The Bible begins with the tree of life and also ends with the tree of life, proving that it is a book of life. Throughout the Scriptures there is a line of life. After man was created, he was put in front of a tree of life, which is the symbol of God in Christ as the Spirit being life to us (Gen. 2:9; John 15:1; 14:6). When Christ came, He told us that He came that we may have life and have it abundantly (10:10) and that He is the life (14:6). John 1:4 also tells us that life is in Christ. Therefore, Christ came that we may have life, the life is in Christ, and Christ is the life. This gospel tells us to believe in Him so that we may have life, the eternal life (3:15-16). If we have the Son of God, we have life, and if we do not have the Son of God, we do not have life (1 John 5:12). The apostle Paul tells us that Christ is our life (Col. 3:4) and even that it is Christ who lives in us (Gal. 2:20). Finally, at the end of the Scriptures there is the tree of life again, with the flow of the living water (Rev. 22:1-2).</p><h2 class="head1">SIX THINGS FOR KNOWING CHRIST AS LIFE</h2>
<p>Let us consider how we can experience Christ as life in a practical way. It is not adequate to say that Christ changes our life or that He gives us a new life. In China many people&rsquo;s lives are changed by the teachings of Confucius and Buddhism. Some Chinese people were gamblers, and others were drunkards or thieves, but one day their lives were changed by the teachings of Buddhism. They also claim to experience a new life. Therefore, we may have the terminology that Christ is our life without knowing the reality or the way to experience Him as life.</p>
<p>John 1:4 says, &ldquo;In Him was life, and the life was the light of men,&rdquo; and 8:12 says that anyone who follows the Lord Jesus shall have the light of life. Then in John 6:35 the Lord said, &ldquo;I am the bread of life.&rdquo; Here, once again, life is mentioned, but this time it is mentioned in connection with the bread of life. In Romans 8:2 there are the Spirit of life and also the law of the Spirit of life. That same chapter says that the mind set on the spirit is life and peace (v. 6). Finally, in 1 John 1:1-6 there is the fellowship that comes from life. Therefore, in the above verses six things are mentioned in the Scriptures concerning life: the light of life, the bread of life, the Spirit of life, the law of life, the peace with life related to the mind set on the spirit, and the fellowship of life. In order to know how to experience Christ as life, we must understand these six things.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE EXPERIENCE OF CHRIST AS THE LIGHT OF LIFE</h2>
<p>Christ is life to us, first of all, by being light to us. To experience Christ as life, we must experience Christ as light, because the life is the light of men (John 1:4). When we experience Christ as life, we will have light within us shining all the time. Christians experience Christ as life in light. This means that when we open ourselves to the Lord and give the Spirit of Christ, who is the Spirit of life, the ground to work within us, we first sense something shining as light within us. Prior to this there might have been something foggy, dark, and vague within us, but now there is light within us that shines and enlightens, even though this light may be only a small spark.</p>
<p>The experience of Christ as life is not always something extraordinary. In reality, if our experience of Christ as life is genuine, we do not experience a great Christ but a small Christ. Christ is indeed great; there is none greater than He. Nevertheless, when we experience Him in reality, we experience only a little of Christ. Our concept might be that we should encounter a Christ who is like the sun shining with glory in the heavens. Of course, some may experience Christ in this way. Saul of Tarsus on the way to Damascus did indeed meet Christ in a marvelous way. However, for most of us, our experience of Christ is normally in a small way; we experience just a little of Christ. Perhaps in the morning there is something very small within us, shining like a little star, giving us a little light, so that we see and sense something. This is very precious. Do not look down on this, but rather honor and respect it. Although there may be just a little light within us, that light is the life of Christ; it is Christ as life to us.</p>
<p>The difference between the Christians&rsquo; experience of Christ as life and the Buddhists&rsquo; experience in Buddhism is that Christians experience Christ as the inner light. With us Christians, there is not merely something teaching and instructing us outwardly; there is often something shining and enlightening us within.</p>
<p>As an illustration, let us consider the case of a young brother who is very proud before the older brothers and sisters. In accordance with the Scriptures, we might tell him, &ldquo;Brother, you need to be humble. It is wrong to be merely twenty-five years old and yet be so proud. You need to be humble. Being proud will be a damage and a loss to you, but being humble will be a profit and a blessing.&rdquo; This is teaching, outward instruction. He may even be convinced by this teaching and declare, &ldquo;Oh, yes, I am wrong. From today I must try to be humble.&rdquo; This is certainly not the proper practice of the Christian life. Those people in China who are taught by the teachings of Confucius, and those in India who live under Buddhism, do the same thing as this brother. In this example there is no difference between Christianity and Confucianism, Hinduism, or Buddhism. The proper practice of the Christian life would be for me to pray for the brother in this way: &ldquo;Lord, reveal Yourself to this young brother and bring him into the light. Shine within him so that he may see You and have the light to realize that he is proud.&rdquo; If I pray for him in this way, when I visit him, I will not say much about his pride. Instead, I will stay with him for a while and speak to him a little concerning Christ. After this, we may both pray. Although nothing may happen immediately, one morning, two or three days later, there may suddenly be something within him shining, causing him to realize that he is proud. He may have some light to see that he is proud and spontaneously may say, &ldquo;Lord, forgive me. I am proud.&rdquo; This would be sufficient to produce a change in his life.</p>
<p>One practice is by an outward teaching, and the other is by the inward enlightening. The outward teaching is the religious way, whereas the inward enlightening is the spiritual way, the divine way, the way by which we experience Christ. The little light sparkling, shining, and enlightening within the young brother is nothing other than Christ as life. By such an experience of Christ, this brother&rsquo;s life is changed; that is, his life is transformed, and he becomes transparent, not through outward teachings but by the inward enlightening. In contrast, Buddhist teachings can only help us to restrict, control, and suppress ourselves in order to make us humble and thus have an outward change in our life. Christ changes our life not by outward teaching as in Buddhism but by inward enlightening. The inward enlightening is the light of life. I can testify that even though as a young man I was very proud, from the time that I became a Christian, the Lord has been transforming my life. This has not been by outward teaching, for the more people taught me, the worse I became. Teaching was not effective in producing a change in me, but the inward shining and enlightening has gradually transformed me. This shining is the light of life. The more we have this light, the more we experience Christ, for this light is Christ.</p>
<p>Seemingly, Christians are peculiar people. For example, in the morning I may be very unhappy with a certain brother. Nevertheless, something within me is shining. By the afternoon my anger is gone, and in the evening, when I meet this brother, I am quite pleasant. Little by little the shining illuminates. This is the light of life. Just a little of this kind of shining is the proper way to experience Christ as life.</p>
<p>Often people may tell you that one day they prayed, and something came upon them like lightning or like electricity, giving them a certain kind of feeling and experience. Although this may not be wrong, it is not the proper experience of Christ. Rather, the proper experience of Christ as life is that day by day, in a continual way, there is just a little light shining within us, which is the light of life working within us. By going along with this little shining, we will experience Christ more and more. The more we take care of this shining and go along with it, the more it will grow and deepen.</p>
<p>We need to be impressed that Christ is life, and this life is the light of men. If we follow the Lord Jesus, who is life, we will have the light of life. The light of life is the Lord Jesus Himself as light within us shining all the time, not in a bold way but in a gentle way, little by little. By taking care of this inward shining, we take Christ as our life. By paying attention and going along with this little shining, we live by Christ. Learn to experience Christ as life in this way. We should not expect to have some wonderful or extraordinary experience of Christ as life. Such an experience is not normal. The normal experience is that Christ is life within us as the light of life. If we take care of Him, go along with Him, and give Him a free course, He will shine within us. This will be an indication that we are taking Christ as life and living by Christ. We need to learn to experience Christ in this normal and quiet way, by taking care of the inner shining within us.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER SIX</h1>
<h1 class="title">THE WAY FOR GOD<br />
TO BE MINGLED WITH MAN</h1>
<h1 class="title">(2)</h1>
<h1 class="title">THE LAW OF LIFE</h1>
<h1 class="title">(1)</h1>
<h2 class="head1">GOD&rsquo;S ETERNAL PLAN, CENTRAL THOUGHT,<br />
AND ULTIMATE INTENTION</h2>
<p>The way for God to be mingled with us is the way of life. It is through His being life to us that God is able to mingle Himself with us. If we wish to take something into us and be mingled with it, we must take that thing as our intrinsic constituent. We may illustrate this by considering the way food becomes our constituent. In order for our food to mingle with us, we must take it as our life supply. It must become a constituent of our physical life before it can be mingled with us. This portrays the way that God mingles Himself with us, and this mingling is the central thought of God. God&rsquo;s eternal plan, which God made in eternity past for eternity future (Eph. 3:9-11), is that He might be life to us in order that He might be mingled with us as one.</p>
<p>God&rsquo;s thought and ultimate intention are not for us to worship Him and serve Him in an objective way. Rather, He desires to enter into us to be life to us and to be mingled with us as one. A model and pattern of the mingling of God with man was accomplished in the Lord Jesus Christ. Jesus Christ is not only God, nor is He merely man; He is both God and man, a God-man. He is God mingled with man. The Lord Jesus is a wonderful model of the mingling of God with man.</p>
<p>All genuine and true believers in Christ must be exactly the same as Christ. Christ is a mingling of God with man, and every Christian also must be such a mingling. This is the reason that God must be life to us. God must live within us as our life in order that He might be mingled with us, making every one of us God-men, men who are filled with God, permeated with God, and saturated with God. You may think that you should be a good man; however, God&rsquo;s thought is not that you should be a good man but that you should be a God-man, a man who is mingled with God as one.</p>
<p>In order for God to accomplish this, we must take God as life. We should all realize that God has put Himself into us as life. Most Christians know that when we believe in the Lord Jesus, we have the eternal life (John 3:16). However, few realize that the divine life, the eternal life, that we received at the moment we believed in the Lord Jesus is God Himself in Christ as the Spirit. The Triune God&mdash;God the Father in God the Son as God the Spirit&mdash;comes into us to be life to us when we believe in Christ. We must be clear that the life that we receive through faith in Jesus Christ is the Triune God Himself. As believers in Christ, we now have the Triune God living within us as life.</p>
<p>Now that we have been regenerated and possess the life of the Triune God, we should not consider this life to be something separate from the Triune God. Rather, we need to realize that this life is the Triune God Himself. Hence, the Triune God is now within us. Although it may be difficult for you to believe that the great Triune God is in a small person such as you, you certainly have some experience of God being in you, because you have been troubled by Him. As we have seen, the life within us, which is Christ Himself and the Triune God, is the light. When we have this life, we have something within us shining all the time, because the life is the light. John 1:4 says, &ldquo;In Him was life, and the life was the light of men.&rdquo; Therefore, we know that we have Christ within us as life because there is something within us shining all the time. We are not in darkness but in the light because the life which is Christ Himself is the light. If we have Christ as life, we have the light.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE LIGHT OF LIFE AND THE LAW OF LIFE</h2>
<p>In this chapter we will consider the matter of law. Christ is life, the life is the light, and the light is the law. Light is something that rules, controls, and regulates. Under the light, everyone is regulated. For example, if the light goes out in a certain place and that place becomes full of darkness, the result will be lawlessness and confusion. Suppose an entire city such as San Francisco had no light. The whole city would be in darkness, and there would be much confusion. Where there is no light, there is no government, no rule, and no regulation. By this illustration we can realize how the light is the law. Nothing is mentioned in the Scriptures concerning going to movies, nor is there any regulation in the church forbidding this; nevertheless, when young people go to the movies, they are bothered inwardly by Christ. This is because the light within them rules, and this ruling is a matter of law.</p>
<p>Romans 8:2 says, &ldquo;The law of the Spirit of life has freed me in Christ Jesus from the law of sin and of death.&rdquo; The law of the Spirit of life is simply the law of life, and the law of life is the law of Christ (Gal. 6:2), which is nothing less than Christ Himself. The law of life is also the law of love, which is the issue and expression of the divine life (1 Cor. 13). The life is the Lord Jesus, the light is the Lord Jesus, the law is the Lord Jesus, and love is the Lord Jesus. Thus, the Lord Jesus is everything. Nevertheless, among these items there are certain differences, because Christ is one Lord with many functions. Christ as life has the function of shining within us to enlighten us; thus, He is the light. Christ as life has another function, that is, to regulate, rule, and control us; thus, He is the law. When He enlightens, He is the light, and when He rules, He is the law.</p><h2 class="head1">THE LAW OF LIFE IN THE INWARD PARTS</h2>
<p>Concerning the law of life, Jeremiah 31:33 says, &ldquo;I will put My law in their inward parts and write it upon their hearts; and I will be their God, and they will be My people.&rdquo; In this verse we see that the relationship between God and us is based on the law that He puts within our inward parts and writes upon our hearts. This law is the basic matter for the relationship we have with God. Moreover, the law here is a new law, different from the law of the old covenant, the law of Moses, which was written in letters on tablets of stone. This new law is not a law of letters but a law of life in the Spirit. It is not written on tablets of stone but it is put in our inward parts and written on our hearts (2 Cor. 3:3).</p>
<p>According to the Scriptures, man is a tripartite being composed of spirit, soul, and body (1 Thes. 5:23; Heb. 4:12). Psalm 51:6 refers to man&rsquo;s inward parts and to man&rsquo;s hidden part. The inward parts of man are the parts of the human soul&mdash;the mind, the emotion, and the will (Prov. 2:10; 1 Sam. 18:1; Job 7:15). The hidden part of man is the human spirit, referred to as &ldquo;the hidden man of the heart&rdquo; in 1 Peter 3:4. The spirit is also of three parts, or three functions. The main part of the spirit is the conscience (Rom. 9:1, cf. 8:16), by which we can distinguish right from wrong. Another part of the spirit is the fellowship, which affords us the capacity to contact God and have fellowship with Him (John 4:24; Rom. 1:9; 7:6; Eph. 6:18). In addition, in the spirit there is the intuition, giving us a direct sense of God and a direct knowledge from God (1 Cor. 2:11; Mark 2:8).</p>
<p>The heart of man referred to in the Bible is a composition of the mind, the emotion, the will, and the conscience (Acts 11:23; Heb. 4:12; John 16:22; Heb. 10:22); thus, the heart includes all the parts of the soul and one part of the spirit, the conscience. In Jeremiah 31:33 God says that He will put His law in our inward parts, that is, in our soul, in our mind, emotion, and will. This also means that He puts His law in our heart, because the parts of the soul are components of the heart. Hence, first God puts His law of life in our inward parts, and then He writes this law upon our heart.</p>
<p>Furthermore, Hebrews 8:10 says, &ldquo;For this is the covenant which I will covenant with the house of Israel after those days, says the Lord: I will impart My laws into their mind, and on their hearts I will inscribe them; and I will be God to them, and they will be a people to Me.&rdquo; Then Hebrews 10:16 says, &ldquo;This is the covenant which I will covenant with them after those days, says the Lord: I will impart My laws upon their hearts, and upon their mind I will inscribe them.&rdquo; In these verses the one law mentioned in Jeremiah has become a number of laws. Moreover, Hebrews 8:10 says that God imparts His laws into our mind. The word <em>mind</em> in this verse corresponds to the words <em>inward parts</em> in Jeremiah 31:33, proving that the mind is one of the inward parts. The law of life is put not merely into one part of our being but into all our inward parts and then inscribed upon us. Thus, the first step God takes is to put the law of life into us, and the second step is to inscribe it upon our heart.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE LAW OF LIFE BECOMING MANY LAWS</h2>
<p>As we have seen, God puts His law into us, and this law becomes a number of laws. The law of life that God puts into us is nothing less than God Himself. In the new covenant God Himself comes into us as a law. The law of Moses, the Ten Commandments, in the old covenant can be considered the description, definition, and explanation of God; by this law we can know what kind of God He is. It is a fact that any law that a person makes shows the kind of person he is. A good person makes good laws, but a legislator who is a robber will make evil laws. Even the regulations we make in our homes describe the kind of persons we are. The Ten Commandments show us that God is holy, righteous, and full of love and light. In the New Testament time God Himself, the God of holiness, righteousness, love, and light, has come into us as a living law. Because God is a law with many attributes, this law can become several laws as it spreads into our different inward parts.</p>
<p>We must be impressed that God Himself is the law within us. This is so because God in Christ as the Spirit is the life within us, and this life is the law (Rom. 8:2). We can illustrate the function of the law of a particular life by considering a group of chickens and ducks. If we were to chase all of these animals toward a pool of water, the ducks would jump into the water, but the chickens would all scatter. There would be no need to teach the ducks to jump in and swim, nor would there be a need to teach the chickens to be careful and run away, for with every life there is a law. In fact, the stronger the life is, the stronger the law of that life will be, and the richer the life is, the richer its law will be. Today we have the divine life within us, and this life is God Himself, who is strong, rich, and high. Therefore, we have the strongest, richest, and highest law within us. This law is God Himself, and He is one law that includes many items.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE REGULATING OF THE LAW OF LIFE</h2>
<p>On the negative side, the law of life with many items regulates us all the time. Every regenerated Christian has something living within him that regulates him. Before you were saved, if you went to a department store, you could buy whatever you liked. The only restriction was the amount of money you had. The more you bought, the happier you felt. However, after you were saved, whenever you went to the store to buy something, there was Someone living within you regulating you, telling you that certain items are not fitting for a Christian, a child of God. This regulating element is God&rsquo;s holiness. It is not your father, your mother, the church, or the Scriptures that regulate you; rather, it is the Lord living within you as life and functioning as the law of life.</p>
<p>Furthermore, on the positive side, with the law of life there are also many good things. For example, there is no need to teach an apple tree to bring forth apples. Just by allowing the apple tree to grow for a certain length of time, the law of the apple life will cause many apples to come forth. Many seeds look alike, but when they are sown into the soil and allowed to grow, flowers of different colors and shapes come forth. This is because with every seed there is a law of life. Hence, the law of the divine life not only restricts us from doing evil things but also regulates us to bring forth good things. This living law is Christ Himself living within us, acting and functioning all the time as a regulating element. This element restricts us negatively from doing evil, worldly, and unrighteous things, and it also regulates us positively to bring forth many wonderful and beautiful things.</p>
<p>I can testify to the regulating of the law of life from my own experience. By natural birth I am a proud person, one who always takes pleasure in boasting and glorifying himself. Before I was saved, the more I boasted, the happier I felt. Whenever I missed an opportunity to boast, I regretted it. However, after I was saved, the more I boasted, the more I experienced bitterness instead of joy. This was because I had experienced a change of inward life and thus a change of inward law. I now had another law within me that was quite different from the first law, the law of sin and death. According to our experience, this second law, the law of the divine life, restricts us all the time from doing evil things and also regulates us to bring forth pleasant, wonderful, and heavenly things. This mysterious law of life is Christ Himself as life within us. As Christians, we have something living within us that regulates, controls, and rules us continually. This regulating element is Christ Himself, the embodiment of the Triune God.</p>
<p>In order to experience Christ as life, we must go along with and take care of this inner regulating. Morning and evening, everywhere and at every time, this living regulating element is within us, and we must take care of it and go along with it. As long as we go along with the inner regulating, we live Christ and take Christ as our life.</p>
<p>We have pointed out that, on the one hand, Christ as life within us functions as the shining light, and on the other hand, Christ as life within us functions as the regulating law. Thus, we have two things within us&mdash;the shining and the regulating. We experience Christ as life simply by this shining and this regulating. If we have something within shining and illuminating us all the time, we can be sure that we have Christ as our life. Moreover, if we have Christ as life within us, we always have something regulating us. The more we are regulated by the inner law of life, the more we will be transformed in our mind, emotion, and will. We have been regenerated in our spirit (John 3:6), and the Triune God has come into our spirit to dwell there (Rom. 8:16; 2 Tim. 4:22). He is waiting for an opportunity to transform our mind, emotion, and will by shining in us and regulating us. If we love the Lord and have genuine communion with Him, we will say, &ldquo;Lord, I go along with Your inner shining, and I take care of Your inner regulating.&rdquo; The more we go along with and take care of the inner shining and the inner regulating, the more ground the Spirit will have to possess us, occupy us, saturate us, and permeate us, that is, to transform us. In this way we will grow in the Lord continually.</p>
<p>This is the only way to experience Christ as life. We must realize that Christ today is within us as life, and this life is the light shining in us and the law regulating us. Hence, we must take care of these two inner matters and go along with them. Although we may have experienced the inner shining and regulating many times already, we must learn to experience them more and more. Then we will be permeated, saturated, and transformed by the Triune God into His glorious image. This is the way for God to be mingled with us.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER SEVEN</h1>

<h1 class="title">THE LAW OF LIFE</h1>
<h1 class="title">(2)</h1>
<h2 class="head1">OUR RELATIONSHIP WITH GOD BEING BASED ON LAW</h2>
<p>Jeremiah 31:33 is a most basic verse in the Scriptures: &ldquo;But this is the covenant which I will make with the house of Israel after those days, declares Jehovah: I will put My law in their inward parts and write it upon their hearts; and I will be their God, and they will be My people.&rdquo; In order to have God as our God and to be a people to God, we must realize and understand the matter of law, because it is based on law that God is God to us and we are a people to God. If we are not clear about this matter, the relationship between us and God cannot be right as God requires. Therefore, we must understand the law that God puts in our inward parts and writes in our hearts.</p>
<p>Jeremiah 31:33 is quoted twice in the book of Hebrews. Hebrews 8:10 says, &ldquo;For this is the covenant which I will covenant with the house of Israel after those days, says the Lord: I will impart My laws into their mind, and on their hearts I will inscribe them; and I will be God to them, and they will be a people to Me.&rdquo; In Jeremiah&rsquo;s prophecy <em>law</em> is singular, but here in the quotation it becomes <em>laws.</em> In other words, when this law was prophesied in the Old Testament time, it was one law, but when this law is applied in the New Testament time, it becomes a number of laws. This is because although the law is one, when we apply it to our experience, it becomes several laws by spreading into our various inward parts. Also, in the quotation here the word <em>mind</em> is used instead of <em>inward parts</em> in Jeremiah&rsquo;s prophecy, proving that the mind is one of the inward parts. This quotation in Hebrews also says that first God will impart His laws into our mind, and then He will inscribe them upon our hearts. Hebrews 10:16, a second quotation of Jeremiah&rsquo;s prophecy, says, &ldquo;This is the covenant which I will covenant with them after those days, says the Lord: I will impart My laws upon their hearts, and upon their mind I will inscribe them.&rdquo; In this verse the heart is mentioned first and the mind second. Therefore, by comparing the one prophecy in Jeremiah 31:33 and the two quotations in Hebrews 8:10 and 10:16, we can see at least three changes. First, <em>law</em>is changed to <em>laws;</em> second, <em>inward parts</em> is changed to <em>mind;</em> and third, in 8:10 the mind is first and the heart is second, but in 10:16 the heart is first and the mind is second. Moreover, both the prophecy and the two quotations indicate that first the law must be put into us, and then it must be written on us.</p>
<p>These three verses tell us that the relationship between God and us is based on the matter of law. For us, the New Testament believers, the law is not the law of letters written outside of us on stone tablets; rather, it is a law that is put into us and written on our hearts. Since this law is something put into our inward parts and written on our hearts, this law must be something of life and in the Spirit. If not, how could this law be put into our inward parts and written on our hearts? Hence, this law must be the law of life. Today the relationship between God and us is based on this inward law of life in the Spirit.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE LAW OF THE SPIRIT OF LIFE</h2>
<p>In Romans 8:2 this law is clearly mentioned as &ldquo;the law of the Spirit of life.&rdquo; The law, the Spirit, and life, composed together, are the law of the Spirit of life. This is the law prophesied by Jeremiah and referred to by the apostle Paul in his Epistle to the Hebrews. This law is the law of the Spirit of life so that it can be put into our inward parts and written on our hearts. Furthermore, this law is also &ldquo;in Christ Jesus.&rdquo;</p>
<h2 class="head1">WHAT CHRIST JESUS IS</h2>
<p>The law of the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus is not simple, for it involves five items: the law, the Spirit, life, Christ, and Jesus. These five items are very profound. In order to understand them and then to minister them, we must spend much time to look into the relevant passages in the Scriptures. The first question we need to ask is, What is Christ Jesus? When the apostle Paul, under the inspiration of the Spirit, says, &ldquo;The law of the Spirit of life...in Christ Jesus,&rdquo; his emphasis is on what Christ Jesus is, that is, on His person, rather than on what He does. Therefore, we need to know what Christ Jesus is.</p>
<p>Christ Jesus is the God-man; He is the Triune God mingled with man. We know that Christ is the Son of God (John 20:31). However, in Isaiah 9:6 we are clearly told that the Son is called Eternal Father. Thus, the Son is the Father. Then in 2 Corinthians 3:17 we are also clearly told that the Lord (4:5), who is the Son of God, is the Spirit. From these verses we see that the Son is called the Father and that the Son, who is the Lord, is the Spirit. These are the three persons&mdash;the Father, the Son, and the Spirit&mdash;of the one God. Furthermore, God is Spirit (John 4:24). Hence, the Spirit is the substance, the essence, of God, and the Father, the Son, and the Spirit are the persons of this one God.</p>
<p>One day the Son was incarnated to be a man, and He lived and walked on this earth for thirty-three and a half years. Eventually, He was crucified on the cross, and after three days He was raised from the dead both spiritually and physically. He showed His disciples His hands and feet, indicating that after His resurrection He still bears a physical body with flesh and bones (Luke 24:39). Forty days later He was taken up; He ascended to the third heaven before the eyes of the disciples, and from that time until He comes back, He is in heaven with the human nature and the human body (Acts 1:9-11). We can be certain of this because Stephen saw Him as the Son of Man standing at the right hand of God in the heavens (7:56), indicating that He is still there as a man. Moreover, the Scriptures tell us clearly that when He comes back, He will still be the Son of Man (Matt. 26:64). This shows clearly that the Triune God was incarnated as a man and mingled with man, and He will remain a God-man forever. Therefore, today He is different from what He was before the incarnation. Before the incarnation He was merely the Triune God in His divinity, but after the incarnation He is the Triune God mingled with man. From the time of His incarnation He has never been separated from man. Now He is the Triune God-man.</p>
<p>After the incarnation, crucifixion, resurrection, and ascension of Christ, the Triune God-man came down on the day of Pentecost to present Himself to us that we may receive and accept Him as our Savior, our Lord, our God, our life, and our everything. However, although we may have received Him years ago, we may not have realized that this One who is the Savior, the Lord, and God, and who is life and everything to us, is not only the Triune God but also a man. He still has the experiences of man, the nature of man, and the body of man. The teachings of the modernists, who say that Christ never resurrected, are devilish, and we must have nothing to do with them. The Bible tells us clearly that Christ died, and three days later He resurrected from the dead, both spiritually and physically (1 Cor. 15:3-4). Today He is still a man. He is the Triune God as well as a man, and He will be such for eternity. This is the very Savior in whom we believe and whom we have received.</p><h2 class="head1">WHAT THE SPIRIT IS</h2>
<p>On the day of Pentecost the Triune God-man poured Himself out as the Holy Spirit. Today in the Holy Spirit there is not only the divine nature but also the human nature. Andrew Murray&rsquo;s book <em>The Spirit of Christ</em> refers to the Spirit of the glorified Jesus. This book says that Jesus was a man and still is a man in His glorification, that is, in His resurrection (Luke 24:26, 46). After this man ascended to the heavens, the Spirit of this man came down with the nature of this man. Andrew Murray writes, &ldquo;When poured out at Pentecost, He came as the Spirit of the glorified Jesus, the Spirit of the Incarnate, crucified, and exalted Christ, the bearer and communicator to us, not of the life of God as such, but of that life as it had been interwoven into human nature in the person of Christ Jesus.&rdquo; Therefore, the Holy Spirit who came down from the heavens on the day of Pentecost is not only the Holy Spirit with the divine nature but also the Holy Spirit with the human nature interwoven with the divine nature, that is, with the human nature mingled with the divine nature. Now the Holy Spirit is a Spirit of the divine nature mingled with the human nature. Moreover, the human nature in the Holy Spirit was redeemed, sanctified, and uplifted through the death and resurrection of Christ (Rom. 1:3-4). Thus, the Holy Spirit today, who works with us and in us, is a Spirit of the divine nature interwoven with the redeemed, sanctified, and uplifted human nature. The Holy Spirit has come down to present such a wonderful One, the Triune God-man, to us as our Savior, our Lord, our God, our life, and our everything for us to receive. Now such a One is within us.</p>
<p>We are men who are contained in a body as a vessel, with a receiving organ, a spirit, as the center of our being. By means of the receiving organ within us, we can receive God. God comes into our spirit to dwell in our spirit as the very center of our being. However, we need to know what kind of God we have received. The God whom we have received is the Triune God-man, who has become our Savior, our Lord, and our God. Furthermore, He is all these things to us not in an objective way but in a very subjective way. He has entered into us and is now in us subjectively. Christianity today emphasizes that we must worship a God who is far away in the third heaven, but we must realize that today our God is not far away from us. In fact, He is within us and He is one with us. When I was young, I was taught that the Savior Jesus Christ is now in the heavens. Although this is right, it is not the full picture. He is in the heavens, but He is here also. When I prayed, I had the thought that the Lord was in the heavens, far away from me, but the more I prayed, the more I felt that He was within me.</p>
<h2 class="head1">EXPERIENCING CHRIST AS OUR LIFE</h2>
<p>Today this wonderful Savior, who is the Lord and God, is within us. But if He is merely the Savior, the Lord, and God to us, there is no need for Him to come into us. For example, a cow may help me by pulling a cart for me or by carrying me. To render such help, there is no need for the cow to be in me. However, if I am very hungry and need the cow to be my life supply, the cow must come into me. Now we can understand why this wonderful Savior God must come into us. He must come into us not only to be our Savior, our Lord, and our God, but even more to be our life. There is no other way for Him to be life to us. Moreover, for me to take in a large cow, the cow must first be slaughtered, sent to the supermarket, brought into the kitchen, and put into an oven to be cooked. This is a picture of what the wonderful Savior did in order that we might receive Him as our life. He was slaughtered on Mount Calvary, and then He was brought to the &ldquo;supermarket,&rdquo; that is, to the church, for us to gain Him as &ldquo;groceries&rdquo; and then bring Him home and take Him in as life. Now He is within us. How wonderful this is!</p>
<p>Furthermore, when He enters into us, He does it in a quiet way. When a cow is eaten by us, it enters into us not in a noisy way but in a quiet way. Then, after we have digested it, the cow becomes even more quiet. We must be impressed that the way of life is the quiet way. Life is ordinary, normal, and apparently not at all special. After we have eaten our breakfast, the breakfast remains within us, and we live by this breakfast, not in a peculiar, strange, excited way, nor in a noisy way, but in a quiet and ordinary way. Although we are living by the breakfast within us, we do not feel it, for there is nothing special or particular about it. Many Christians today are looking for something special and peculiar, not realizing that they have the Lord as the quiet One within them. This indwelling Lord is the all-inclusive Christ, who is infinite, unlimited, and unsearchable, yet He is so quiet and normal that some people do not believe that He is within us.</p>
<p>Many Christians today do not know the normal way to enjoy Christ as their life and as their food. They have forgotten that they already have Christ within them, who is wonderful yet very quiet. They neglect the indwelling Christ and look outside for something peculiar, strange, and extraordinary. This is not the proper way. We must be clear that since we have received Christ as our Savior, He, the wonderful One, is now within us in a very quiet and normal way. Breathing, which is essential to our physical life, is very quiet and very ordinary. The normal experience of Christ as life may be likened to breathing. The most normal Christian life is one in which Christ is experienced by us as life in a quiet and ordinary way.</p>
<p>The very Christ who is life to us is also the light shining within us (John 1:4-5; 8:12). Christ shines within us not in a peculiar way but in a very ordinary way. Day by day we have something within us giving us a little light. If we declare that we have received a great light, greater than the light of the sun, this may not be the genuine experience of Christ as the divine light. When Christ shines in us, the light within us is normally small. The greater the light we think we receive, the more likely it is to be false, but the smaller the light we receive, the more genuine it is likely to be. When it seems that something within us is shining as a little light that, to our consideration, may or may not be of the Lord, this is genuine light. We need to trust in this light. It may be perceived by us as just a little feeling, sense, or registration, and we may have some doubt that it is from the Lord, but this kind of light is genuine. The best experience for a Christian is to have some light within, but not to be absolutely sure that it is of the Lord (1 Cor. 7:40).</p>
<p>As we have seen in this chapter, in order to experience Christ in a proper and normal way, we need to know what kind of Savior, Lord, and God He is, and we also need to know that He is within us. Then we need to know the right way to experience Him, that is, the normal, quiet, and ordinary way, which is the inner way of life.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER EIGHT</h1>

<h2 class="head1">THE LAW OF LIFE BEING<br />
THE ONLY TERM OF THE NEW COVENANT</h2>
<p>Hebrews 8:10-12 speaks of the covenant between God and His people in the New Testament: &ldquo;For this is the covenant which I will covenant with the house of Israel after those days, says the Lord: I will impart My laws into their mind, and on their hearts I will inscribe them; and I will be God to them, and they will be a people to Me. And they shall by no means each teach his fellow citizen and each his brother, saying, Know the Lord; for all will know Me from the little one to the great one among them. For I will be propitious to their unrighteousnesses, and their sins I shall by no means remember anymore.&rdquo; The Lord has made a covenant with us. In this covenant there is no need for others to teach us to know the Lord, because we will all know Him, even the least among us.</p>
<p>In human terms a covenant is an agreement or a contract. The Lord is so willing to be our God and to have a relationship with us that He has made a covenant, that is, a contract, an agreement, with us. Whatever is written in a contract is certain. Once a contract is made or an agreement is signed, there is no margin for any change and no possibility of any choice.</p>
<p>God, the faithful, almighty One, has signed a contract with us. The center of this contract, or covenant, is the law of life. Every contract needs to have certain terms, without which there can be no contract. In the divine contract made and signed by God, there is only one term, one condition: God has said that He will put His own law into us. He does not ask us to keep any kind of terms or conditions on our side. According to this one term, He said that He will be God to us and we will be a people to Him. This one term, this one condition, makes the new covenant a very brief and simple contract. In contrast, a business contract may contain term after term, condition after condition, each with many sub-terms and sub-conditions. However, the new covenant is a divine contract with one simple term, indicated in this statement: &ldquo;I will impart My laws into their mind, and on their hearts I will inscribe them; and I will be God to them, and they will be a people to Me.&rdquo; Actually, this one term is all-inclusive.</p>
<p>However, although it may seem that God has made a simple contract with only one term, God Himself is not simple. Hence, the contract made by God, in reality, is not simple, because in the one term everything is included. God comes into us all-inclusively as life to us, and this life is the law mentioned in the divine contract. In fact, God Himself is the law within us, but not directly. He is life to us directly, and this life works within us as a law. This life has the function of regulating; it works within us all the time to regulate us.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE ELEMENTS OF THE LAW OF LIFE</h2>
<p>We need to be impressed that God, the all-inclusive Lord, has come into us to be our life and that with this life there is a function, a law, that continually regulates us according to its nature and element. Included in this life are the divine nature, the human nature with the human living, death and the effectiveness of death, resurrection and the power of resurrection, glorification, ascension, and enthronement. Furthermore, in this life there is the headship, lordship, power, and authority. All these things are the elements of the divine life with its law.</p>
<p>Before the incarnation, in the Triune God there were only the three persons&mdash;the Father, the Son, and the Spirit. If at that stage the Spirit of God had come down to man, within the Spirit there would have been only one element, the element of divinity, because the Spirit of God was only God Himself. One day the Son of God was incarnated to be a man. This means that the Son of God came into man to put man upon Himself. In this man He lived on the earth for thirty-three and a half years, passing through the experiences of the human life. After living the human life, He entered into death, remained in death for three days, and then entered into resurrection, in which He was glorified (Luke 24:26, 46). He was just like a seed that dies when it is sown into the earth but subsequently grows up and blossoms. The blossoming of the seed is its glorification. By His resurrection Jesus was glorified. In His resurrection and glorification, Jesus ascended to the heavens and was enthroned as the Lord and Christ to receive the headship and the lordship (Acts 2:36; Eph. 1:19-22). Then on the day of Pentecost the Holy Spirit came down upon man (Acts 2:1-4, 33). At this stage the Holy Spirit of God came down upon man not with only one element but with a number of additional elements, including the human nature, the human living, the all-inclusive death with its effectiveness, and the resurrection with its power, as well as glorification, ascension, enthronement, the lordship, and the headship. This is the Holy Spirit who is within us today. This Spirit is the Spirit of the One who, as the embodiment of the Triune God, was mingled with man, passed through human living, died, resurrected, entered into ascension, and was enthroned and given the lordship and the headship.</p><h2 class="head1">THE REGULATING OF THE LAW OF LIFE</h2>
<p>The One who is now dwelling within us is God the Father in God the Son, who is also God the Spirit (John 14:10-11, 16-20; 2 Cor. 3:17). This indwelling One is the all-inclusive Christ. Because He is man as well as God, He has not only the divine nature but also the human nature. He knows the human life and has the element of human living. Now this One is life within us, and this life works in us as a regulating law not in a miraculous way but in a very ordinary way, even in a very human way.</p>
<p>The record of the Lord Jesus in the four Gospels shows that although He performed some miracles, He mainly walked, lived, acted, and worked in a very human way. Sometimes He was thirsty (John 4:6-7; 19:28), sometimes He was hungry (Luke 4:2), and sometimes He even became angry (Mark 3:5). Today Christ, who is the Lord, the almighty God, and the all-inclusive Head, is living within us as life, working and moving in us in a gentle, quiet, normal, and human way.</p>
<p>Although He is gentle, He is also very powerful. Regardless of how much we quarrel with Him, we can never overcome Him. He is steadfast and can never be subdued by us. On the contrary, He is always gently and patiently subduing us. If we will not be subdued by Him today, He will wait until tomorrow, and if we will not be subdued tomorrow, He will wait for the following day. Once He has given us an order, we cannot convince Him to change it. He gives us an order gently and quietly yet firmly, without wavering, even though we may argue with Him. His patience is unlimited, and He can wait until eternity. No one can convince Him or debate with Him.</p>
<p>Moreover, all His riches are in His regulating. If we are regulated by Him, we will enjoy His riches, which include the riches of the divine nature, the riches of the beautiful, sanctified, and uplifted human nature, the riches of His beautiful human living and walk on the earth, and the riches of the killing power of His death. As we go along with His small regulating voice, something within will be killing us, putting us on the cross, because in that regulating there are the riches of the killing power of the cross. There are also the resurrection power, the element of glorification, and the ascension, enthronement, lordship, and headship.</p>
<p>In a relationship between a husband and a wife there can be friction, even when both are Christians and love the Lord. The husband&rsquo;s will may be stubborn, and the wife may be unable to convince him to change. There may be nothing the wife can do, and no one may be able to help her. Nevertheless, Christ is living within her and is regulating her. Whenever she tries to argue with her husband, something within is regulating. While she is speaking to him, there is another One speaking to her, telling her that regardless of how her husband is, she must not argue. In this instance she needs the killing power of the cross to kill her argumentative self, her self-esteem, her pride, and her seeking to have the preeminence. When she is willing to go along with the inner regulating, her self is killed, and many times tears are shed. Nevertheless, at such times she experiences the resurrection power within, energizing and strengthening her to suffer under her husband and even to feel glorious in doing so.</p>
<p>As we cooperate with the inner regulating, we experience being not only transparent but also transcendent, far above all, and in the heavenlies. At times we sense that we are even enthroned with Christ and experience the headship and lordship of Christ. In our experience, however, two things are a problem to us. First, many teachings in Christianity distract us from the Lord&rsquo;s inner working. Second, our natural thought and human concept are that the Lord&rsquo;s working in us must be something extraordinary. This causes us not to pay attention to the Lord&rsquo;s quiet working within us. We must forget about our human, natural thought and all the different teachings and take care of the Lord&rsquo;s working, shining, and regulating within. Then all the riches of Christ will be ours. These riches will be interwoven with our entire being.</p>
<p>We should not consider this as being too deep or too high. Regardless of how long we have been saved, as long as we are Christians who are born again, the all-inclusive Christ dwells in us (Rom. 8:10; 2 Cor. 13:5). The Spirit of such a Christ is full of the riches of the Triune God-man, including the divine nature, the human nature, human living, death with its effectiveness, resurrection with its power, glorification, ascension, enthronement, headship, and lordship. All these items are the elements of the wonderful Spirit who is now within us and who is working in us in a very natural, human, gentle, and quiet way. All that is needed is for us to cooperate with Him.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE REGULATING OF THE INNER LAW<br />
ENABLING US TO KNOW GOD</h2>
<p>By the inner regulating of the law of life, we are able to know God. We do not need anyone to teach us. The inner regulating is sufficient for us to know God. Once a person is saved and begins to love God, he has the desire to please Him. He will often ask, &ldquo;How can I know if this is what God likes, if it pleases Him? How can I know if it is something of Him?&rdquo; As a young Christian, I had many questions like this. I even wondered whether or not I should wear a hat and what kind of clothes I should wear. I tried to get answers to my questions, but eventually no one could answer them. Nevertheless, the Lord within me was regulating me all the time.</p>
<p>A sister once testified that as a young girl, before she was saved, she liked to make the length of her skirts as short as possible in order to be modern. Then one day, after she was saved, she made a dress. Concerning the length of this dress, she bargained with the Lord. Although she would tell the Lord that she felt a certain length was all right, within her there was no peace. Rather, something was regulating her. Eventually, she said, &ldquo;Lord, what length will satisfy You?&rdquo; After praying in this way, she had peace.</p>
<p>This is the principle not only related to our clothing but also concerning many other things. Within us there is a measurement, a standard. No one else can give us the standard, but there is a standard within us. This standard is the living Christ. Moreover, the standard differs according to the degree of our love toward Him. The more we love Him, the more troublesome He will be to us. Conversely, the less we love Him, the less we will be troubled by Him. In other words, the more we love Him, the more He regulates us. There is no need for others to teach us, for we always know. This kind of knowledge is not outward but inward and deep; it is a sense and a consciousness, not an outward teaching, that is always with us.</p>
<p>All people, even those who are quiet, like to talk. However, while we believers are talking, there is something within us regulating us. Although no one can tell us how long we should talk, we have a standard within us. We know at what point we should stop. The problem, however, is that we are unwilling to go along with the gentle inner regulating. Instead, we hope that the Lord will speak to us like thunder and command us to stop. But the Lord never does that. He is very quiet and patient, telling us, &ldquo;You have spoken enough.&rdquo; We may ask Him to allow us to speak for another five minutes, but He still says, &ldquo;It is enough.&rdquo; It may be a considerable time before we actually stop our speaking. Because of our disobedience, He is grieved, and this makes us very sorrowful. In such a case we go to the Lord shamefully, asking Him to forgive us so that our fellowship with Him will be recovered through the blood of Christ (1 John 1:7, 9). If we go along with the inner regulating, our self, our natural life, will be killed. Such an experience of the killing work of the cross leads us into the experience of the power of resurrection. In resurrection we experience many things of Christ, including His glorification, ascension, headship, and lordship.</p>
<p>In this chapter we have seen the law of life, which is God Himself in Christ as the Spirit with the elements of the divine nature, the human nature, human living, death, resurrection, glorification, ascension, and the headship and the lordship. We have the wonderful God within us as a living law that regulates us continually. By this law we are able to know God, to know what He likes and dislikes and what pleases Him and does not please Him. There is a living standard within us, which is the living God Himself, who is mingled with us. Our only need is to learn to know this One.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER NINE</h1>
<h1 class="title">THE WAY FOR GOD<br />
TO BE MINGLED WITH MAN</h1>
<h1 class="title">(5)</h1>
<h1 class="title">THE ANOINTING</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: 1 John 2:27; Heb. 8:10-11</h1>
<h2 class="head1">THE ANOINTING BEING<br />
THE WORKING, MOVING, AND ACTION<br />
OF THE HOLY SPIRIT WITHIN</h2>
<p>According to Hebrews 8:10-11, we have the law within us, and according to 1 John 2:27, we have the anointing within us. We have seen that the law within us is the law of life, the living law, the Triune God Himself with all His fullness living within us. Now we need to consider what the anointing is. First John 2:27 does not use the noun <em>ointment</em> but the gerund <em>anointing.</em>
 In Exodus 30:22-25 the holy anointing oil, or ointment, is a type of the Holy Spirit of God after Christ&rsquo;s incarnation, human living, death, and resurrection. If the Spirit as the ointment only remained in us but was not working in us, He would be only the ointment, not the anointing. Consider the electricity in a building. We may say that in a building there is not only electricity but also the current of electricity. The electric current is not only electricity itself but the moving, working, and flowing of electricity. When the switch is turned off, although there is still electricity in the building, there is no flowing, no current, of electricity. When the switch is turned on, the electricity flows; hence, there is both electricity and also the flowing, the moving, and the working of electricity.</p>
<p>The Holy Spirit whom we have within us is a living Spirit. He is not only living but also working, acting, and moving. There is an action, a moving, and a working of the Spirit within us, and this is called the anointing. If we have only the ointment, we will have only the knowledge that there is an ointment in us; we will not have an inner consciousness, or feeling, of the ointment. But when we have the anointing, we know that we have the ointment, not because of objective knowledge but because we feel it and sense it. The Holy Spirit is indeed in us, but He is also working in us and anointing us all the time. This is not merely a matter of knowledge; it is also a matter of feeling. We not only know that the Holy Spirit is in us, but we also feel and sense that He is working in us all the time. There is a certain working, moving, and action within us. This is something we both believe and continually experience.</p>
<p>In these chapters we have seen three matters&mdash;the shining, the regulating, and the anointing. There is a shining in us because Christ is the light (John 8:12); there is a regulating in us because He is the law of life (Rom. 8:2); there is an anointing because He is the ointment (1 John 2:20, 27). The all-inclusive Christ, who is now within us, is life to us, and this life is the light shining and the law regulating. Moreover, today the all-inclusive Christ is also the ointment, because He is the Spirit (1 Cor. 15:45; 2 Cor. 3:17). The Spirit within us is shining, regulating, and anointing all the time, for He is the light, the law, and the ointment.</p>
<p>As Christians, we have something within us continually shining and regulating. At the same time, the Spirit as the ointment is always anointing us. When we experience the anointing, we feel peaceful, joyful, comfortable, and restful within. This indicates that there is not only a shining and a regulating but also an anointing. We have all experienced this to some degree. In addition to the shining and the regulating, we have a deep feeling that something is gently and pleasantly moving within us.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN<br />
THE SHINING, THE REGULATING, AND THE ANOINTING</h2>
<p>We have seen that there is a difference between the shining and the regulating. The shining brings the light to us, making us clear and bright in everything, causing us not to be in darkness. The regulating keeps us right with God. By going along with and taking care of the inner regulating, we have a peaceful conscience, that is, a conscience without offense (Acts 24:16), without any kind of accusation, because we are right with God. In the Old Testament a person was right with God if he did not break the law, the Ten Commandments, in anything. By being right with the law, he was right with God in his conscience. Likewise, today whenever we go along with the inner regulating, we have a conscience full of peace and rest because there is no accusation in it. The regulating makes us right with God.</p>
<p>There is also a difference between the shining and the regulating, on the one hand, and the anointing, on the other hand. We may illustrate this difference as follows. The Old Testament is composed of two main parts, or sections&mdash;the Law and the Prophets (Matt. 22:40). The law with all its rules is unchangeable. For example, &ldquo;Honor your father and your mother&rdquo; and &ldquo;You shall not steal&rdquo; are commandments of the law (Exo. 20:12, 15). All the commandments of the law are rules that are established and do not vary with time, place, or person. Everyone, everywhere, at any time must honor his parents. Thus, there is no need to pray for guidance as to whether we should honor our parents or not. Husbands, wives, and children all must honor their parents. This is a rule established in the law. The prophets, in contrast, give living guidance. Whether I should go to the church meeting today is not a matter of law, nor is the question of which university I should enroll in a matter of law. These are matters of guidance. We need both the law and the prophets, the established rules and the living guidance. The same is true for us today in the New Testament. The law of life within us corresponds to the established rules of the law, and the inward anointing corresponds to the living guidance provided by the prophets. The law of life replaces the law written on tablets of stone, and the inner anointing replaces the prophets.</p>
<p>When to cut our hair and which barber to use are not matters of law but matters of guidance. However, once we are in the barber shop, the style in which our hair is cut is not a matter of guidance but a matter of the inner law. The law of life will regulate us, telling us, &ldquo;You are a child of God. You should have your hair cut in a way that is fitting to your status.&rdquo; This is not guidance but the regulating of an inward law. Therefore, we may go to a particular barber shop because we feel guided by the anointing, but we must have our hair cut in a way that is regulated by the law of life. Likewise, which day the sisters go to a department store to do their shopping and which store they go to are matters of guidance through the anointing. However, when they are in the store buying clothing, which designs and colors they choose are a matter of the regulating of the law of life. What they choose is not a matter of guidance but a matter of the inner regulating.</p>
<p>Therefore, within us there is the inner law, the law of life, regulating us all the time, and there is also the anointing guiding us continually. On the one hand, the Lord Himself within us is the law regulating us, and on the other hand, the Lord Himself is the ointment within us anointing us all the time.</p><h2 class="head1">A TESTIMONY CONCERNING<br />
THE LAW OF LIFE AND THE ANOINTING</h2>
<p>The following story illustrates the functions of the inner law of life and the anointing. In 1943 northern China was under the occupation of the Japanese army. The church there was very much blessed by the Lord, and this caused the Japanese military police to arrest me and put me in prison. Approximately one week before I was arrested, I had the sense deep within that something might happen to me. A few days later, on the Lord&rsquo;s Day morning, the church had a gospel preaching meeting. Because it was customary for someone else to be responsible for that meeting, I was free that morning. During the meeting I was sitting in the deacons&rsquo; office, and inwardly I had a clear sense, an anointing, to clear my bag of all my mail. For a number of years I had been working for the Lord and had corresponded with nearly all the provinces in China, including Chungking, Nanking, and the South Sea islands. Thus, there were many different names and addresses in my correspondence. The inner sense was very clear: I had to tear those letters up and throw them away, which I proceeded to do. At noon I went home. After lunch the same inner sense prompted me to clear the drawers of my desk and cabinets of all the old correspondence, which stretched back about fifteen years, and burn them. My family wondered what I was doing, but all I said was that I felt I should do this.</p>
<p>This was indeed the Lord&rsquo;s leading. At eight o&rsquo;clock the next morning, while I was still at home, a brother came to tell me that two men from the Japanese military police were waiting for me at the meeting hall. I went to meet them, and the officer said to me, &ldquo;Mr. Lee, there are certain things we do not understand about you. Would you come with us?&rdquo; This was actually an arrest, so I told the brothers to inform my family. At that time everyone was afraid of the Japanese military police, because once a person was in their hands, his life could end very quickly.</p>
<p>They brought me to their office and told me to sit down and wait; then they left. At that time I did not know where they went, but later, after I was released, my family told me that they came back to my home and searched it thoroughly. However, they found nothing there except a notebook containing one page of notes on Song of Songs. These notes concerned Christians loving Christ, as a lover seeks her bridegroom. They brought this notebook back to the office, and that night they put me in prison.</p>
<p>The very next day the tests began. Before they arrested me, I had the anointing, and now during the tests the anointing came to me many times. Undoubtedly, I experienced the Lord&rsquo;s word which says that when we are brought before rulers and authorities, the Holy Spirit will teach us in that hour what we should say (Luke 12:11-12). Although they had found almost nothing in my home, they were still suspicious that I was working against the Japanese occupation. Whenever they began to ask me a question that would be difficult to answer, I prayed, &ldquo;Lord, help me.&rdquo; Then I noticed that their questioning would immediately turn to another point. Moreover, at that time I also experienced something regulating me, that is, the law of life. In certain instances there was no need for me to seek guidance. I only needed to stand with the law of life.</p>
<p>Over a period of thirty days there were several tests each day, each test lasting several hours. One day, approximately three and a half weeks into my imprisonment, I was asked, &ldquo;Mr. Lee, tell us which is first: your nation or your God?&rdquo; This question was very threatening. If I had said that God was first, they might have put me to death. However, I was guided by the inner anointing to remain quiet and not say a word. Although the officer demanded a response, I had the inner anointing not to speak but just to look at him. Then he asked me why I would not answer, and I had the inner anointing to say that I was afraid my answer might offend him. He responded that I would not offend him but that I had to give him an answer. According to the inner law within me, I could never say that anything other than God is first. I told him boldly, &ldquo;Of course, God is first. The nation is something given to us by God.&rdquo; Then he said, &ldquo;You are a fool! Today we will not give you any food. Let us see what your God will do for you.&rdquo; After this they sent me back to my cell.</p>
<p>What followed is a testimony to God&rsquo;s glory. Because the Japanese police were suspicious of me, they did not put me in a cell with other Chinese prisoners; they feared that news about me would leak out. A young Greek man had been arrested, and because all the cells were full, he was put in my cell. That day when the Japanese soldiers distributed the food to the prisoners, they gestured to me that they had no food for me and that they would let God give me some food. The Greek man, as a foreigner, was given better food than the other prisoners. When he saw that there was nothing for me, he asked me why, and I explained to him that I was a servant of the Lord who was being treated this way for the sake of the church and the gospel. This man was a Greek Orthodox Christian, and he insisted that I take his food, asking me to afford him the privilege of helping me in the name of the Lord. Thus, that day I ate better food than the local people. The next day when they brought me out of the cell and asked about the food I had eaten, I told them that I had indeed eaten better food than usual.</p>
<p>The anointing gives us living guidance time after time, and the inner law regulates us all the time. The latter is something established and unchangeable. Wherever we go, we cannot say that anything is first other than God. This is not only the law written in the Bible (Exo. 20:3) but also something written within us. We do not need to seek the Lord&rsquo;s mind and guidance as to whether or not God is first. On the other hand, for many matters, including what we should do or say and where we should go, we need the living, present guidance of the inner anointing.</p><h2 class="head1">THE INNER LIFE PRODUCING THE CHURCH LIFE</h2>
<p>In these chapters we have seen three main items: the light of life, the law of life, and the anointing. The Lord Jesus Christ today is the all-inclusive One. He is the Triune God incarnated as a man. He is man as well as God and God as well as man. He passed through human living on the earth, He entered into death and passed through death, and He entered into resurrection and ascended to the heavens. Although He is now in the heavens, today such a wonderful One is also within us as life. If He were merely God, the Lord, and the Savior to us, there would be no need for Him to come into us. It would be sufficient for Him to be only in heaven. But in order for Him to be life to us, He had to come into us. Now we are very clear that we have this wonderful One within us as our life (Col. 3:4). On the one hand, this life works within us as light to shine within us (John 1:4-5). On the other hand, it works as the law to regulate us and as the ointment to anoint us. Hence, we have Christ Himself, the living One, within us, continually shining in us, regulating us, and anointing us.</p>
<p>To be a normal Christian is simply to take care of this inner shining, regulating, and anointing. Day by day and moment by moment we have these three things within us. If we take care of them and go along with them, we will be normal, spiritual, and even mature Christians. We will also sense the need of a corporate life with other Christians. If one day you go along with the inner shining, regulating, and anointing, the next day you will sense that you need to fellowship with other Christians, to meet together with them, and to serve and worship the Lord with them. In other words, you will sense that you need the church life, the corporate life. The church life comes into existence by the inner shining, regulating, and anointing. The more we experience Christ in the way of the inner life, the more we will sense the need of a proper church life; moreover, the more we have a proper church life, the more we will be helped to experience Christ in full. Indeed, the more we have the full realization of Christ as the inner life, the more we will have a full expression of the Body as the corporate expression of Christ. This is the proper Christian life and church life, and this is the right way for us to follow the Lord.</p>
<p>I have the full assurance that the inner life and the church life are the two main items the Lord is going to recover in these last days. The inner life is Christ Himself experienced by us as our life, and the church life is the expression of Christ in a corporate way. Furthermore, I also have the full assurance that the Lord has begun to recover these two things in the United States. If you travel throughout the country, you will see that within just the last two or three years the Lord has raised up people everywhere who are seeking something better, something real, and something of Himself. This better and real thing is the inner life and the church life&mdash;Christ experienced by us as life and the church life as the expression of Christ in a corporate way.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE TWOFOLD PURPOSE OF TEACHING</h2>
<p>There are two passages in the New Testament which tell us that there is no need for any man to teach us. First John 2:27 says that we have received an anointing that now abides in us. Because this anointing teaches us concerning all things, we have no need that anyone teach us. Then Hebrews 8:10-11 tells us that God has covenanted to put His law into us. This wonderful law is God Himself. It is the law of life within us that regulates us all the time and is the means through which we can know God. Therefore, there is no need for others to teach us and tell us to know God, because we know Him through the spontaneous capacity of the law of life.</p>
<p>However, although these two verses tell us that we do not need any teaching, throughout the Scriptures, including the New Testament, there are many passages which indicate that we still need teaching. Apparently the Scriptures contradict one another, but actually they do not.</p>
<p>Teaching has a twofold purpose. First, the proper Christian teaching does not replace the inner teaching but rather develops it. What I have been teaching in these days is not a substitute for the teaching within you; instead, these teachings help the inner teaching to develop. The more you receive these teachings, the more the inner teaching within you, the inner anointing and the law of life, will be developed. Second, the proper outward teaching is a check to the inner teaching. We have the Holy Spirit within and the Scriptures without. The inner anointing needs to be checked by the Scriptures. If the inner anointing is contrary to the Scriptures, our understanding of the anointing is wrong. The inner anointing is quite living, but because of our weakness it may not be accurate. The Scriptures are accurate, but they may not be living. If we have only the Scriptures and not the inner anointing, we may be very accurate but very dead. Conversely, if we have the inner anointing and forget the Scriptures, we may be very living but also very misguided. Therefore, we need to be balanced, having both the anointing within to make us living and the Scriptures without to balance and check us. With everything God has created, there are two sides; for example, we have two hands, two ears, two eyes, and two feet. In our Christian life we have both the Holy Spirit and the Holy Scriptures. Today many fundamental Christians are too fundamental in caring for the black and white letters of the Bible, and many Pentecostal Christians are too Pentecostal in shouting, in speaking in tongues, in prophesying, and in healing. Consequently, the fundamentalists are dead, and the Pentecostals are mistaken in their emphasizing of Pentecostal things. However, the balanced way is to have the Holy Spirit within and the Holy Scriptures without. Day by day these two are our guidance.</p>
<p>We may illustrate this by the two pillars that were with the children of Israel in ancient times. During the day there was the pillar of cloud, and in the night, because there was no light, there was the pillar of fire (Exo. 13:21). The pillar of cloud was a type of the Holy Spirit, and the pillar of fire was a type of the Scriptures, the Word of God. These two pillars signify the Spirit within and the Word without.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the word and the Spirit are one (Eph. 6:17). When we receive God&rsquo;s word into us, it becomes the Spirit. When the word is outside of us, it is the word, and when it is within us, it is the Spirit. When we speak the word, it becomes the word again, and when this word enters into someone else, it becomes the Spirit again. We must follow the Spirit within as well as the Scriptures without. The inner anointing must be checked by the Scriptures. This is why we must read the Scriptures. In our receiving the teaching of the Scriptures, the inner teaching of the anointing is developed. We experience more of the inner anointing, and we experience it in an accurate way. Therefore, by taking care of the inner anointing and the Holy Scriptures, we will be living and accurate. This is the way to follow the Lord.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER TEN</h1>
<h1 class="title">THE HOLY SPIRIT WITH HUMANITY</h1>
<p>Prayer: Lord, we ask You to help us and strengthen us while we are speaking something concerning Yourself and the way to experience You as life. You know how much we need You in such a ministry. In the understanding of such a mysterious thing, we need Your anointing and Your help. Lord, at this very moment do cover us; cover our mind that we may not be confused by any kind of thought. We pray that You would impress us with the mysterious way to experience Yourself in our daily life. Grant us the necessary utterance to speak what is on Your heart. In Your name we pray. Amen.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE EXPERIENCE OF CHRIST AS LIFE</h2>
<p>In a previous chapter we saw that Christ, the Son of God, is called the Father (Isa. 9:6), and that He as the Lord is the Spirit (2 Cor. 3:17; cf. 4:5). Christ was also incarnated to be a man, and this man is Jesus. Therefore, Christ Jesus is the Triune God incarnated and mingled with man. Included in Christ Jesus are the three of the Triune God&mdash;the Father, the Son, and the Spirit&mdash;and man. When we receive Him, He comes into us not only as our Savior, our Lord, and our God, but even more as our life. The Gospel of John, in particular, tells us that when we believe into Him, we have eternal life (3:15-16; 5:24; 6:40, 47; 20:31). Moreover, it tells us that He is life and that life is in Him (11:25; 14:6; 1:4a). When we believe in Christ Jesus, He enters into us, that is, into our spirit (2 Tim. 4:22), to be life to us (Col. 3:4). This very life is the light (John 1:4b), the function of which is to enlighten and shine. All the time this life, which is the wonderful Christ, is shining within us. In addition, this life is the law that regulates us continually (Rom. 8:2).</p>
<p>Whether as the light shining or the law regulating, the divine life works and moves within us in a very quiet, normal, and ordinary way. Our human thought is that God is wonderful and great and that we need His help in a supernatural and miraculous way. We could never imagine that God would become a man. The first four books of the New Testament are a record of the wonderful God who became a man. His desire in becoming a man was that we would receive Him into us as life. Today the very Christ whom we have received as our life operates within us in a very quiet, ordinary way, without anything special or miraculous. If you are clear about this, it will revolutionize your concept concerning the way God deals with you. You will see that today the wonderful God works within you in a quiet, normal, and ordinary way and that you need to go along with Him. By cooperating with His inner working, day by day you will be saturated with Him and mingled with Him, and your whole being, that is, all your inward parts, will be transformed. This is very ordinary, yet it is very vital.</p>
<p>All the material things, including the food we eat, are types and figures of Christ and can help us to know Christ. Day by day we eat at least three meals. Rather than eating a great amount of food at one time, it is better to take a little in the morning, a little at noon, and a little in the evening. Life is a matter of living continually by what we take in day by day and time after time. There is no need of anything miraculous. There is no need for God to send the angels to feed us. Likewise, we should not expect an extraordinary Christ to come and help us. Rather, the Christ whom we experience is seemingly very ordinary.</p>
<p>Luke 24:13-35 gives us an account of two disciples who, after the Lord resurrected, left Jerusalem to go to Emmaus. The Lord came to them in a quiet, normal, and even hidden way, a way that was very ordinary. He was Christ, yet the two disciples did not recognize Him. It seems as if He pretended not to be Christ and asked them what they were talking about. He listened to them and did not rebuke them. Rather, He talked with them, walked with them, and stayed with them without telling them that it was He whom they were speaking about. Then at a certain time the two disciples realized that He was the Lord. At that point He disappeared from them. It is often the same in our experience of Christ. If we do not realize that it is He Himself, we sense His presence with us, but when we are clear about our experience, the sense of His presence is gone.</p>
<p>The Lord Jesus dwells within us as life today in just such a hidden, normal way, without anything extraordinary or special. We must learn to know such a Christ. We Christians always expect to experience something extraordinary, because we are not clear concerning the Lord&rsquo;s way of life. The Jesus Christ who dwells in us today is the same One who walked with the two disciples on the way to Emmaus. He is within us in a quiet, normal, and ordinary way. Hence, we should not expect something special of Him. Day by day and moment by moment we must learn to know and experience this wonderful, profound, and marvelous Savior.</p><h2 class="head1">THE SPIRIT HAVING BOTH<br />
THE DIVINE NATURE AND THE HUMAN NATURE</h2>
<p>We have pointed out that the very God whom we serve today is not only God Himself but also a man, the God-man. We have also seen that His Spirit is not only the Spirit of the divine life but also the Spirit of the human nature interwoven with the divine nature. Today in the Holy Spirit of the wonderful God-man there is not only divinity but also humanity. In other words, in the Holy Spirit there are the divine nature and the human nature as well.</p>
<p>John 7:38-39 says, &ldquo;He who believes into Me, as the Scripture said, out of his innermost being shall flow rivers of living water. But this He said concerning the Spirit, whom those who believed into Him were about to receive; for the Spirit was not yet, because Jesus had not yet been glorified.&rdquo; When the Lord spoke the word concerning the rivers of living water, He was not yet glorified. The glorification of Jesus was His resurrection (Luke 24:26, 46). After He died, He was resurrected from the dead, and this was His glorification. After His glorification the Holy Spirit came down on the day of Pentecost not merely as the Spirit of God but also as the Spirit of God mingled with man. In the Old Testament time the Spirit of God came down upon man only as God in His divinity. At a certain time God in Christ was incarnated to be a man and was mingled with man. This God-man died and resurrected and came down as the Holy Spirit. Now the Holy Spirit is a Spirit who includes not only God but also man. According to John 7:39, before Jesus was glorified, such a Holy Spirit who has both the divine nature and the human nature was not yet. Only after Jesus was glorified through His resurrection could this Holy Spirit of God, with both the divine nature and the human nature, come down to us. In the New Testament time the Holy Spirit who works upon us and dwells within us is a Spirit who has both the divine nature and the human nature.</p>
<p>First Timothy 2:5 says, &ldquo;For there is one God and one Mediator of God and men, the man Christ Jesus.&rdquo; This verse indicates that even today Christ Jesus, the one Mediator of God and men, is still a man. It is significant that, on the one hand, the enemy Satan would not allow people to believe that Christ is God. Many modernists believe that Christ is only a man and is not God. On the other hand, after we Christians believe that Christ is God, we may consider Him to be no longer a man. Many Christians truly do not realize that today our Savior, the Lord Jesus, is both God and man.</p>
<p>Philippians 1:19 says, &ldquo;For I know that for me this will turn out to salvation through your petition and the bountiful supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ.&rdquo; The word <em>this</em> refers to Paul&rsquo;s suffering in prison. In this verse Paul does not speak of &ldquo;the Spirit of the almighty God&rdquo; but of &ldquo;the Spirit of Jesus Christ.&rdquo; Jesus Christ is a man, and although the Spirit of Jesus Christ is the Spirit of God, Paul&rsquo;s emphasis is that this Spirit is the Spirit of a man, One who has suffered and been persecuted by people. It seems that Paul was saying, &ldquo;Today the Spirit of a suffering, persecuted One is within me. This Spirit, the Spirit of Jesus Christ, supplies me and supports me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Finally, Acts 16:6-7 says, &ldquo;And they passed through the region of Phrygia and Galatia, having been forbidden by the Holy Spirit to speak the word in Asia. And when they had come to Mysia, they tried to go into Bithynia, yet the Spirit of Jesus did not allow them.&rdquo; Verse 6 speaks of the Holy Spirit, the Spirit of God, and in verse 7 the same Spirit is referred to as the Spirit of Jesus. On the one hand, this Spirit is the Spirit of God, and on the other hand, He is the Spirit of Jesus, the Spirit of a man.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE LORD BEING MINGLED WITH MAN<br />
FOR US TO LIVE BY HIM</h2>
<p>We have seen clearly that after the Lord&rsquo;s resurrection and ascension, the Holy Spirit is in us as a Spirit who possesses both the divine life and nature and the human life and nature. Before He came into us, He was God mingled with man already. Do not think that He begins to be mingled with man only when He comes into us. When He comes into us as the eternal life with the divine nature, the human nature is included. When Christ comes into us as life, He is the eternal life with both the divine life and nature and the human life and nature. We may wonder why the eternal life that we have received is a life of the divine nature and the human nature as well. It is so that this life can work in us not only in a quiet, normal way but also in a human way. The wonderful Savior works, moves, lives, and acts as life within us in a quiet, normal, ordinary way and also in a very human way. This matter is something that most believers have neglected.</p>
<p>Many times I had a little feeling deep within me to visit a certain brother and to speak with him concerning a certain matter. At the same time there was always some doubt as to whether this feeling was something of the Lord, because it was quiet, normal, and ordinary and also very human. I thought it might be only my desire and not something of the Lord. Yet while I was doubting, the little feeling within, though not very strong, was constant, steady, and lasting. Eventually, I had no choice but to go. After I went, the feeling was confirmed to be of God.</p>
<p>Although this was a leading from the Lord, there was nothing extraordinary about it; instead, it was very ordinary, normal, and human. The way Christ works in us as life is very ordinary, for He as the indwelling Spirit has not only the divine nature but also the human nature. Many times before ministering to the Lord&rsquo;s children, I have no special sense concerning what I should speak, but only a little feeling or registration. Though I always doubt this, wondering if it is just something of myself, after I minister, I realize it is genuinely something of the Lord. The Holy Spirit who dwells within us is a Spirit not only of the life and nature of God but also of the life and nature of a proper man. In Him there is not only the full element of divinity but also the element of humanity. Therefore, He works within us not in a miraculous way but in a very normal and human way. This can be fully confirmed by our experience.</p>
<p>The primary reason that the Lord needed to become a man and mingle Himself with man before coming into us is that we may live by Him not in an extraordinary way but in a very ordinary and human way. The four Gospels are a record of a man who took God as His life. In that record we see that the life of this man on earth was absolutely human. It is true that sometimes He performed miracles to prove that He was the almighty God, yet His living as a man, with God as His life, was always very human and ordinary and not at all special. Once He was thirsty and asked a certain woman for water to drink (John 4:7). Another time He wept with tears (11:35). He was very human in a most ordinary way. In contrast, many Christians consider that if we take Christ as life and live by Him, we need to be like angels, not like human beings. However, the more we take Christ as our life, the more we will be properly human in a very ordinary way.</p>
<p>There was once a servant of the Lord who was invited to minister in a certain city where the people considered him to be very spiritual. At the time he was due to arrive, many went to meet him. Interestingly, before he reached the town, he turned aside into a children&rsquo;s garden. Those who were waiting for his arrival began to discuss where he might be. Eventually, they found him in the garden playing with the children. Many of his admirers were disappointed because they thought that a spiritual person should be like an angel. However, a spiritual person is not a special person but an ordinary person, one who is very human and normal. The more spiritual we are, the more normal and human we will be.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE WAY THE LORD WORKS WITHIN US</h2>
<p>We need to be impressed that the Savior we have received into us as our life has both the divine nature and the human nature; He is not only divine but also human. Today He works within us not in a miraculous way but in a very human way. Many times it is difficult for us to believe that it is His working. One morning when you rise up, read the Scriptures, and pray, you may have just a little feeling or sense within to give up certain things. You may doubt whether this is something of the Lord. Do not doubt but believe, for this is the way the Lord works within us today, not in a miraculous way but in a very human way.</p>
<p>In China there was a young girl with a strong will and a peculiar character. She was from a rich family and wanted a share in the family&rsquo;s inheritance, but in China the inheritance passes only to sons, not to daughters. Therefore, she purposely went to school to study law in order to file a lawsuit against her brothers over the inheritance. During one winter vacation her mother, who was a genuine believer and had been recently revived by the Lord, brought her to a church meeting. Although there were several hundred people there, I noticed her immediately because of her peculiar hairstyle. Two or three weeks later she came to the meeting, and I noticed something had changed. Her hairstyle had changed somewhat. After two or three more days she came again, and something more had changed. From then on, each time she came to the meeting, something had changed. Eventually, after several more weeks she came dressed in a very simple way. Many things related to her appearance had changed. When we asked her mother about this, she told us that she had not dared to touch this matter with her daughter. Later, we discovered that the daughter had believed in the Lord, and subsequently nearly every day there had been a sense within her to give up certain things. Many times she had thought that this might be herself and not the Lord, but the more she doubted, the more constant the sense was. It was present with her not in a peculiar or miraculous way but in a very ordinary and normal way.</p>
<p>As a newborn Christian, this sister grew rapidly. In time she testified that the secret of experiencing Christ as life and of taking Him as our life is to take care of the little inner feeling and sense. That feeling, though it may be small, comes from the wonderful One. He is all-inclusive and unlimited, yet He works in a way that is small, quiet, normal, ordinary, and human. If we go along with Him, He will be real, rich, and available to us. We will enjoy many items of what He is and will gradually grow. Day by day, little by little, we will be saturated and permeated by Him. Although our spiritual progress may seem very slow, it will be very steady. This is the way to experience Christ.</p>
<p>We should not expect the Lord to give us marvelous, miraculous, supernatural, or extraordinary experiences. Even though some may occasionally have such experiences, the ordinary way to experience Christ is in a normal, quiet, and human way. By being honest and faithful to this wonderful One who lives and works within us in such a small but normal and human way, we will be saturated and permeated with Him, transformed from glory unto glory, and become a living witness to Him in this age.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER ELEVEN</h1>
<h1 class="title">THE SUPPLY OF THE ALL-INCLUSIVE SPIRIT</h1>
<h2 class="head1">CHRIST BEING LIFE TO US</h2>
<p>We have seen clearly that the relationship between God and us depends on the law that God puts into us. This is based on Hebrews 8:10, which says, &ldquo;For this is the covenant which I will covenant with the house of Israel after those days, says the Lord: I will impart My laws into their mind, and on their hearts I will inscribe them; and I will be God to them, and they will be a people to Me.&rdquo; The law mentioned here is not the law in letters written on outward tablets of stone, but the law of life in spirit written in our hearts. Romans 8:2 says, &ldquo;The law of the Spirit of life has freed me in Christ Jesus from the law of sin and of death.&rdquo; The law that has freed us is the law of the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus, and this law of life is of four great items: the Spirit, life, Christ, and Jesus.</p>
<p>We have also seen that the law of life is nothing other than Christ Jesus Himself as life to us (Col. 3:4). Christ is the embodiment of God, and He enters into us as the Spirit of life (2 Cor. 3:6b, 17). If He were only God, the Savior, and the Lord to us, there would be no need for Him to enter into us. In order to be life to us, He must come into us. Furthermore, as life to us, He can never be merely an objective Savior; He must be very subjective. Nothing is more subjective to us than our life.</p>
<p>Nothing outside of us can be life to us. For anything to be life to us, it must be in us subjectively and mingled with us as one. Anything that is not within us and mingled with us as one could never be our life. In order to take some bread as the life supply to our body, we cannot simply admire it and keep it in our pocket. We need to take it in and then digest it to make it the constituent of our body. Once we have digested the bread, it will be mingled with us and become our life supply. It will be subjective to us to such an extent that it becomes our constituent, a part of our being. This is the meaning of Christ being life to us. When the Lord Jesus said, &ldquo;I am the bread of life&rdquo; (John 6:35), it indicated that His intention was to enter into us and be digested by us to become the constituent of our inner man.</p>
<p>In John 6:51 the Lord Jesus said, &ldquo;I am the living bread,&rdquo; and in verse 57 He said, &ldquo;He who eats Me, he also shall live because of Me.&rdquo; We can eat the Lord because He is bread to us. This signifies that we must take Him as our life supply, feed on Him, and feast on Him. We need to eat more of Him so that we can digest Him and He can mingle Himself with us to become the very constituent of our life. It is thus that we may live by Him. This is very subjective. Do you realize that the Lord Christ whom you have received as your Savior and life is subjective to you? Day by day He is not only living within you but also mingling Himself with you and becoming a part of your being. This is wonderful, yet it is nevertheless very real.</p>
<p>I can testify that the Christ whom I have received as my Savior and life is real and available to me. He is more &ldquo;handy&rdquo; to me than even the air. Water is more available than food, and air is more available than water. Because Christ is within us as life to us, He is even more available than the air that we breathe.</p>
<p>Life is not a simple matter. For instance, when it is sown into the ground, a small seed will grow and blossom, producing green leaves and beautiful flowers. These all come out of the small seed because there is life in that seed. Consider what kind of life Christ is. This life is nothing less than God Himself. As a seed, Jesus has within Him a wonderful life, a life that is the almighty, infinite, all-inclusive, and omnipotent God. This life is now within us.</p>
<p>Furthermore, this life is the light of men (John 1:4). It shines within us all the time. This life is also a law, a regulating element that regulates us within continually. Since the time that we received Christ as our Savior, we have experienced something within us living, shining, and regulating all the time. This is the life that is Christ Himself. He is the life, and the life is both the light and the law. This eternal, divine, uncreated life, which is God Himself in Christ as the Spirit, is the living law, the law of life, regulating us within.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE BOUNTIFUL SUPPLY<br />
OF THE SPIRIT OF JESUS CHRIST</h2>
<p>In Philippians 1:19 the apostle Paul, who was in prison suffering persecution for Christ and the gospel, said, &ldquo;For I know that for me this [referring to the situation related to Paul&rsquo;s imprisonment] will turn out to salvation through your petition and the bountiful supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ.&rdquo; We should note that Paul did not speak of the bountiful supply of the Spirit of the almighty God,<em></em>but of the bountiful supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ. The Spirit of Jesus Christ is the Spirit of God, but with something added.</p>
<p>In this verse Paul said that his imprisonment, suffering, and persecution would turn out to salvation for him. This would be through the bountiful supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ. W. J. Conybeare, in his translation of the New Testament, tells us that the word <em>supply</em> here in Greek is a special word. In ancient times among the Greeks, a group of people who danced and sang to entertain people was called a chorus. The leader of a chorus was called the choragus; he was responsible to take care of all the needs of the group. Whatever they needed, this leader was responsible to supply. Paul used the word <em>choragus</em> to denote the all-inclusive, bountiful supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ, who is indwelling Christ&rsquo;s believers to supply them with whatever they need. With this Spirit there is an all-inclusive, bountiful supply that will fully meet our need.</p>
<p>This Spirit is indeed the Spirit of the eternal God, who is the Triune God&mdash;the Father, the Son, and the Spirit. However, before Christ&rsquo;s incarnation, this Spirit had only the element of divinity. One day the Son of God, who is the embodiment of the complete Triune God, was incarnated to be a man, to enter into man and put man upon Himself. As a genuine man, He lived a human life on this earth for thirty-three and a half years. Hence, with Him there is the human life, humanity, in addition to the divine life, divinity. At the end of His human life He entered into death and passed through death. He remained in death for three days and then resurrected from death (1 Cor. 15:3-4; Acts 2:24). Thus, with Him there are also the elements of death and resurrection.</p>
<p>With resurrection there is also glorification. When Christ was resurrected, He was glorified as well (Luke 24:26, 46). His resurrection was His glorification. This can be illustrated by a seed that is dry and brown in color, without any beauty or glory. When it is sown into the earth, it dies and then begins to grow. We may say that the seed is buried and then resurrected. When the plant that grows out of the seed blossoms, the seed is glorified. According to John 12:24, Christ in His humanity was like a seed, a grain of wheat, sown into the earth. He died and was buried for three days. Then He rose from the dead and was glorified in His resurrection (v. 23).</p>
<p>After being glorified, Christ ascended into heaven (Acts 1:9-11) and was enthroned and made both Lord and Christ (2:36). Soon afterward, on the day of Pentecost, He came down to man as the outpoured Spirit. There is a difference between the Holy Spirit who descended at the time of Christ&rsquo;s incarnation and the Holy Spirit who descended on the day of Pentecost. When the Holy Spirit came down for the incarnation of God in humanity (Matt. 1:18, 20; Luke 1:35), He was merely the Spirit of God with no other elements. But when He came down upon man at Pentecost, He was the Spirit of Jesus Christ, who includes the elements of God, man, human living, the effectiveness of death, the power of resurrection, glorification, ascension, and enthronement. All these elements are included in the one Holy Spirit, who is the Spirit of God and the Spirit of Jesus Christ. Such an all-inclusive Spirit may be considered to be an all-inclusive dose. Many medicines are made by combining a number of different elements into one dose. When we take this dose, we receive all its elements. The bountiful supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ is an all-inclusive dose that contains all the elements required to meet our need in full.</p><h2 class="head1">LIFE WORKING IN A SILENT AND NORMAL WAY</h2>
<p>Although the supply of the Spirit is bountiful and all-inclusive to meet all our needs, we still need to realize that the Spirit works within us in a quiet, gentle, normal, ordinary and human way. Even so, His working in us is very rich and powerful. A certain brother among us was born in England, but he grew up in China and was educated in the United States. Consequently, he became quite a peculiar person. One day he was saved, and the Spirit as the all-inclusive dose entered into him. On the day of his salvation this peculiar person received a particular dose, the Spirit of Jesus Christ, who entered into him and from that day forward indwelt him continually. Day by day this wonderful Spirit worked within him in a very gentle and normal way, giving him a little sense, consciousness, and registration within. One day there was an inner sense telling him to forget about his Cantonese peculiarity. Another time there was another small sense that he should give up certain things. Later, there was a little sense within him that he should offer himself to the Lord. Still later, there was a little sense within him to move to Taiwan. When he went there, he was very peculiar, constantly criticizing the church and endeavoring to adjust us. But day by day, morning and evening, little by little, something within him was illuminating, shining, and regulating him. One morning he gave up something, and the next morning he dropped something more. Although he tried to adjust us, eventually he himself was adjusted. What he experienced was not merely the Holy Spirit of God but the Spirit of Jesus Christ&mdash;the Holy Spirit of God in whom are the elements of Christ&rsquo;s human nature, the effectiveness of Christ&rsquo;s death, and the power of Christ&rsquo;s resurrection. By his going along with the inner sense, this brother&rsquo;s peculiar Cantonese nature was dealt with; it was put to death by the effectiveness of Christ&rsquo;s death and was killed by the cross of Christ.</p>
<p>When the Spirit of Jesus Christ is moving in us, working in us, and anointing us, He gives us a little sense, a consciousness in our inner being. If we take care of this and go along with it, the Spirit will kill the &ldquo;germs,&rdquo; the negative things, in our being. Moreover, in this wonderful Spirit there is also the resurrection power of Christ. When we go along with the inner sense, on the one hand, we experience the killing of our peculiar self, and on the other hand, we experience the resurrection power that energizes, strengthens, and empowers us from within. We also feel glorious, and we are very much adjusted. At the same time we have the sense that we are transcendent, that we are not on the earth but in the heavens. Occasionally, we even feel that we are enthroned with the Lord.</p>
<p>On our part, all that is needed is to go along with the Lord, who continually works in us and anoints us within. We need to simply go along with the gentle, quiet feeling in our inner being that results from the Lord&rsquo;s working in us. We should not expect anything magnificent or extraordinary, for that is not the proper way to experience Christ as life. Christ is such a wonderful Savior, yet when He as the Spirit operates in us, He does so in a very ordinary, normal, and human way. We need to be faithful to Him and realize that He is working within us in such a way. He is always patient, gentle, and quiet because now He is not only the almighty God but also a man with the human nature and the human life and with the effectiveness of death and the element of resurrection. If we are obedient and submissive to Him, day by day and moment by moment, gradually and continually, we will experience Christ and His riches, and we will grow to be a proper and normal Christian.</p>
<p>When you undergo certain sufferings or trials, you may pray, &ldquo;O Lord, help me!&rdquo; expecting the Lord to come to you in a miraculous or supernatural way. At the same time there will be a small feeling within you that you must put your trust in the Lord, that there is no need to worry about your situation or bear the burden of your trials. It is easy to doubt such a small feeling, thinking that it is just something of yourself rather than the Lord&rsquo;s answer and help. However, you should realize that this little feeling is the Lord&rsquo;s working within you, giving you the sense that you must trust in Him and cast the burden of your trials upon Him.</p>
<p>There may be occasions when you have the desire either to visit a certain person or to buy certain things, but within you there is just a little sense that it is better not to do these things. You need to go along with this sense and give up your own desire. Sometimes when you are at home, a little feeling arises within you encouraging you to pray. You should go along with this feeling and pray, opening to the Lord and seeking His mind and will concerning your prayer. You may have a little feeling to pray for a certain brother, or to pray for yourself that you may see something more of the Lord. You should simply follow this feeling within.</p>
<p>At other times you may be criticized by others. Criticism is always a test, even to Christians. I myself have been tested many times by this matter. To be beaten may be somewhat easy to endure, but to be criticized is very difficult to bear. However, when you are criticized, there will be a little feeling within that you should receive this kind of criticism and thank the Lord for it. You should simply go along with this feeling and say, &ldquo;Lord, I thank You for this criticism. Bless those who are criticizing me.&rdquo; This is to pray according to the inner sense.</p>
<p>The right and proper way to experience Christ as life is not in an extraordinary way but in a very normal way. Through such a simple, normal, and ordinary way, we will have a full experience of Christ. All the riches and fullness of Christ will be ours, and we will continue to grow in life. Then we will realize what the Body of Christ is and what the function of the church is to Christ.</p>
<h2 class="head1">MAINTAINING OUR RELATIONSHIP WITH GOD<br />
BY THE LAW OF LIFE</h2>
<p>We need to realize that it is in the law of the Spirit of life that our relationship with God is maintained, that God is our God, and that we are a people to God. In the Old Testament God gave the people of Israel the Ten Commandments as the old law. All the people of Israel had to be right with God according to those commandments. If an Israelite did many good things to help others, sacrificing what he had and even his life for them, yet broke one or more of the Ten Commandments, he was still not right with God. In the same principle, we may do many good things for others, sacrificing, working, preaching, and ministering on their behalf, but we may not be right with God according to the inner law of life.</p>
<p>Today the law according to which God is God to us and we are a people to God is the law of life within us, which is regulating us all the time. We must be right with God according to the inner regulating. Otherwise, regardless of how many good things we do for God or for others, He will not approve of us (Matt. 7:21-23). We need to learn the lesson that anytime, anywhere, and in any matter, if we have a little sense concerning what the Lord wants us to do, we should immediately obey and submit. If we cooperate in this way, we will see how wonderful our Christian life will be. Day by day in all the small things we need to take care of the inner feeling, the inner consciousness. This small feeling is of the wonderful Spirit. By our simply going along with the wonderful Spirit, He will possess and occupy us more and more. He will saturate us continually, and we will be transformed.</p>
<p>What the Lord is seeking today is some who know the inner way of life, that is, the way to experience Christ and take Him as their life in a practical, normal, ordinary, human, quiet, and gentle way. Day by day and moment by moment these people will gradually be transformed into the image of Christ from glory to glory. Furthermore, automatically and spontaneously they will be built up together and coordinated as a corporate Body to express Christ in a living way. This is the church life that the Lord is seeking today. This is the proper way for us to practice both the Christian life and the church life.</p></body></html>
