   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Arrivals in K'un-ming One</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Dear Brother Philip in the Lord:</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>We have been apart for so long.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>My heart often thinks about you.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>May the Lord bless your share of the labor in the work.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>I received your letter yesterday and read it.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>I am well; please do not worry about me.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>We stayed in Ch'ang-sha for more than ten days.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>We met the brothers and sisters in the meeting hall, fellowshipping, breaking bread, praying, and testifying together.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>I stayed in Brother Liu's place in the orphanage.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>We took the southwest bus and train route at the beginning of our journey.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The mountain roads were steep, and the bus was on steep slopes.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The higher we climbed, the more dangerous it became.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>We were racing into the fog, and we felt as if we had left the earth far behind and were closer to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>We feel that Kweichow province is still very barren.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>It does not seem to have much vegetation.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Apart from Zhu-cheng, we did not see any fertile soil.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The Han people and the Miao natives live together, and development is slow.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>There is a great need for the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Please pray for them.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>K'un-ming is at a higher elevation, but it is flatter and more fertile.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>It has bountiful produce and a good climate.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>It does not rain often.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Winter is leaving, and the cauliflower is turning yellow.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The peas are already full in the pods.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Visitors coming for the first time often feel that it is very dry here.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>We have already acclimated and are doing well.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>We did not know anyone when we came, but we were thankful to have Brother Chung Huang's gracious hospitality.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>We stayed in his home for nearly ten days.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Now the Lord has prepared a house for us to rent, and we are living in it.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Prices are cheaper, so it is easier to make a living.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>We can live on what I brought for a while longer if we are thrifty.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Thank the Lord for His grace, and thank the brothers and sisters for your prayers.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>All the brothers and sisters in K'un-ming are well.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Peace in the Lord!</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Please greet the brothers and sisters in Hong Kong for me.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Please greet Brother Stephen Kaung for me.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Your little brother in the Lord,</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Chang Jing-yuan</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>January 26</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Two</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>To Sister X in the Lord:</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>I left Hankow on December 29 and arrived in Ch'ang-sha on the thirty-first.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Thank and praise the Lord!</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>On the afternoon of January 4, I was able to get my bus tickets without any problem.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The buses to Kuei-yang were booked up to April 17.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>However, one person had made a reservation and did not come to buy his ticket on the fourth, so the ticket office sold me that ticket.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>My fare was sixty-one dollars and twenty-five cents to travel by bus to K'un-ming.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>If anyone wants to go to K'un-ming, they should definitely not buy their tickets in Kuei-yang.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Some people do not know that they can buy combination bus and train tickets; therefore, when they get to Kuei-yang, they wait for two or three months and still cannot get bus tickets.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>On the morning of the fifth, I went to the West Station in Ch'ang-sha to wait for the bus.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>It was 11:30 a.m. before all the people crowded in. The bus did not go for very long before there was a problem with the tire.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>We waited several hours for help.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>I was secretly praying.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>The rescue bus arrived at 6:15 p.m. If it had not come, we would have had to spend the night in a small town nearby, which was certainly dangerous because bandits might have attacked us.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>We crossed the river into Yi-Yang around 7:50 p.m. and headed for Ch'ang-Teh.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>By the time we reached Ch'ang-Teh, it was already midnight.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>I went to the station the next morning to ask whether the bus to Yuan-Ling had come.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>I waited for one day.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>The bus to Yuan-Ling did not come until the seventh.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>We left at 9:00 a.m. and arrived at 5:30 p.m. I boarded the bus at 9:00 a.m. on the eighth and arrived in Zhi-Jiang at 3:00 p.m. We were in Huang-Shian by 5:00 p.m. I spent the ninth through the eleventh in Huang-Shian waiting for the bus to Kuei-yang.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>I left Huang-Shian at 10:00 a.m. on the twelfth and passed through Yu-Ping Station and Jen-Yuan Station, arriving at Huang-Ping Station at 6:00 p.m. Then I left Huang-Ping at 11:00 a.m. on the thirteenth and passed through Zhung-An, Lu-Shan, Ma-Chang-Ping, Sha-Ping, Kwei-Ding, and Lung-Li.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>I arrived at the Kuei-yang station at 8:30 p.m. From Hunan to Kweichow, the bus spent one whole day going through the mountains.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>I heard that the bus which left Ch'ang-sha on the sixth had an accident.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Twenty of the twenty-five passengers were injured.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>But thank the Lord for bringing me through.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>I also heard the other passengers say that in those five or six days there were no attacks by bandits.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>The buses are usually attacked and robbed by bandits, who are usually natives of the Miao tribe.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>They particularly love to rob armed passengers of their weapons.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>I also thank the Lord that it did not rain between Ch'ang-sha and Kuei-yang because it is difficult for the buses to run when it is raining.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>I passed out gospel tracts on the fourteenth, and I did not want to leave.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>I also wanted to rest.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>I could not have left in any case, because there were only one hundred seventy-five seats on the bus that left for K'un-ming on the fifteenth, and my number was one hundred seventy-seven.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>It rained on the fifteenth.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>There were no buses on the sixteenth.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>There were no passenger buses on the seventeenth either, but I worked out a deal with the station master and was able to take a Corps of Engineers' bus to continue my journey.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>When we got to An-Shun area, the bus had a flat tire, so we had to wait for several hours.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>The rescue bus arrived at 4:30 p.m., and we continued on for about twenty minutes to the An-Shun Station.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>We left An-Shun at 1:30 p.m. on the eighteenth.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>It was already 5:00 p.m. when we arrived in Kwan-Ling-Chang.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>The driver said the bus could not continue.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>It was 7:00 p.m. before help arrived.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>We drove for several minutes up a deserted mountain and then had to stop at the top because the bus did not have water.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>All the travelers who had wash basins had to get out to fetch water.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>After we found water, we continued on our way.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>We arrived in Yung-Ning Station at 8:30 p.m. We started out again at 9:00 a.m. on the nineteenth and arrived at the Pu-An Station at 4:00 p.m. The driver did not want to continue, so we had to spend the night there.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>We left Pu-An on the twentieth at 9:00 a.m. and arrived at the Pan-Shian Station at 11:35 a.m. This was the last stop in Kweichow; the bus did not continue on.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>Pan-Shian has two bus stations, one for Kweichow and one for Yunnan.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>I had to register at the Yunnan Station to find out about buses.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>When I boarded the bus on the twenty-first, there were not any seats, so I had to sit on a suitcase.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>We left Pan-Shian at 9:47 a.m. and arrived in Ping-Yi at 11:50 a.m. The inspection was very rigorous.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>The bus did not leave until 1:30 p.m. We arrived in Chu-Jing at 3:25 p.m. I left Chu-Jing on the morning of the twenty-second and arrived in K'un-ming at 3:00 p.m. I went first to Deng-Shi Street to see Brother Huang.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>Then I heard that he had moved to Wen-Miao-Dong Lane, but I did not know the number.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>I could not find his house, so I had to stay in a hotel for one night.</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>I looked for him again on the morning of the Lord's Day, the twenty-third.</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>I found the place because I heard the sound of the brothers and sisters singing hymns to remember the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>The brothers and sisters were very surprised.</S>
   <S PAR='98' RSNT='1' SNO='98'>Thank the Lord, the weather was good from Kuei-yang to K'un-ming with the exception of Chu-Jing where it snowed for a few minutes .</S>
   <S PAR='99' RSNT='1' SNO='99'>I also thank Him that I was not carsick except for one day, nor did I feel tired.</S>
   <S PAR='100' RSNT='1' SNO='100'>I saw the Lord's grace in all things.</S>
   <S PAR='101' RSNT='1' SNO='101'>Your brother in the Lord,</S>
   <S PAR='102' RSNT='1' SNO='102'>Chen Hsi-wen</S>
   <S PAR='103' RSNT='1' SNO='103'>January 24</S>
