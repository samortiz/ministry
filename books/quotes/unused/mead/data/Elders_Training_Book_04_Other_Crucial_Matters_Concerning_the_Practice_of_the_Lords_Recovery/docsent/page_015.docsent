   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>An Example from Our History</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>I would like to give an illustration of what I mean by relating a situation among us in the past.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>There was a certain local church which I loved and did my best to help and to keep it on the right way.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The Lord knows and some of the other brothers know how much I did my best to keep that church from going astray.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Some information came to me about this particular locality which said that this locality thought they had the best way to practice the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>They claimed that the church in Los Angeles was just the training center and that it did not have the proper practice of the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>This kind of fellowship went to Atlanta and that bothered the brothers there.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Therefore, the brothers passed on the information to me.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>One day the leading brother of this locality, who thought they had the best way to practice the church life, came to see me.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>I told him that if he felt that their way was the right way to practice the church life, I would not say anything.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>I also told him, though, that I did not think it was wise for him to go out and particularly to go to Atlanta and tell the saints there that Los Angeles is only good for a training center and does not have the proper church life.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>I told him that it was not wise to tell other churches and other saints that the best way to practice the church was in their locality.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>I also told him that this would damage him and cause trouble to the churches.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>To some extent this brother promised not to do this anymore.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Then, I myself went to visit there purposely to see whether what I heard was true or not.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>When I was there, they told me that they were going to have the Lord's table early in the morning because they wanted to take care of the infants.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>When I went to attend their Lord's table, I saw that they even fed the infants with the bread.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>When I saw that, I had the full realization that this was off.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>However, I did not criticize and I did not tell anybody.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>I kept this in my heart, thinking that as long as they practiced this way by themselves it would be all right.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>I did not want to adjust them, and I did not want to bother them.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>A good number of the saints from this locality came for the summer and winter trainings.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>After they had attended the trainings, they were troubled when they went back to their locality.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>On the one hand, they were in their locality for a half a year under that certain kind of practice.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>When they came to attend the training for ten days, however, they tasted the general flavor in the Lord's recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Because of this they did not feel so good about the particular situation when they went back.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Then there was an attempt in their locality to limit the number of the saints who could come to the trainings.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>This caused a lot of trouble and the trouble reached a certain degree where the leading brother in this locality could not tolerate it any longer.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>As a result, two brothers were excommunicated.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>When I heard this, I had nothing to say.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>These two brothers then came to me and told me that they did not consider what was in their locality as a church in the Lord's recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Actually, it was not, but it was a sectarian thing.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Then these brothers asked me what they should do.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>I asked them what they felt, and they said they felt that they should begin to meet as a church in the recovery and not as something sectarian.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>I told them that if they felt this way they had no choice but to be faithful to their feeling according to the Lord's leading.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>When they began to meet, to their surprise about one-half of the saints there immediately came to stand with them.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Who can be blamed for this division?</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The brother who took the lead in that locality should blame himself.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>His practices actually were sectarian because they were hard for the Body to swallow.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The Body could not take it.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>It is not just that the ministry could not stand it.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The ministry stood up with it as much as it could.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>I did not say a word, but eventually the Body could not swallow it.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The brother in that locality may have thought that this was absolutely a local matter and that the church there had a local administration.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>I admit that there was a local administration there, but what happened there affected the Body and affected the testimony.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>A number of saints would not agree with feeding the Lord's table to infants of one or two years of age.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>I hope this gives us a further realization not to think that the church in our locality has the full jurisdiction to do whatever it feels is right.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>You have the right to do it, but you must consider the result, the issue, and the effect.</S>
