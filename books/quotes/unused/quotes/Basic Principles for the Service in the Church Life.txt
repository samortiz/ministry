Paul deals with the matter of the Christian life and the matter of the Christian service in the book of Romans
If you have the Body with the Body practice, the Body expression, and the Body life, then you have the Christian service
The first aspect is a matter of the Christian life a life matter and the second aspect is a matter of the Christian service a service matter
Immediately following this parable, the Lord gave us the parable of the talents, which is something related to our service
We need to use the talent, the gift, which the Lord has given us, to do some business and to make some profit for the Lord
We need to grow in life with the oil, with the light, and with the going out of this world to meet the Lord in His coming back
He realizes the fact that the old man has been put to death and the fact that with the old man there is nothing good
In chapter twelve so many redeemed ones who are walking in the Spirit are composed together in the Spirit as one Body
The little children can do many things, but they cannot serve, because they simply do not have the adequate growth in life
Even if you have life but are short of the growth in life, still young, childish, and even like a babe, you cannot serve
The hand is good, quite useful, but if it is cut off from the body, it becomes not only dead but also ugly, terrible, and even terrifying
The members of a body are beautiful as long as they are attached where they belong in the body, but in any other place they are terrible
The Body life is in Romans 12, and the church service is in this Body life with the members of the Body, of the church, functioning, serving
If you say that you are in the reality of the Body, you need to consider seriously where the Body is, practically speaking
If we could give up the service of the Lord, there would be no need for us to talk about the Body, the church life
We know that all the believers are priests and that the function, the duty, the responsibility, of the priests is to serve the Lord
According to the spiritual reality, the priesthood is the building up of the priests, the coordination, the cooperation of all the priests
When we are built up together as a spiritual house and have the coordination of the priests, then we can preach the gospel
The first gospel preaching was on the day of Pentecost, when one hundred twenty people were built up together, coordinated
Rather, they preached the gospel in a prevailing way, in a coordination of all the saints, all coordinated as one
In the Old Testament types there are two different orders of priests, the order of Aaron and the order of Melchisedec
To be holy simply means to be sanctified, and to be sanctified simply means to be separated from the common things unto the divine things
We all need to go to the Lord and pray for a period of time, like those one hundred twenty in Acts who prayed for ten days
After those ten days, when they came out to the people to tell them that Jesus is the Lord, the Savior, they did this in a royal way
When they came out from the presence of the Lord with the heavenly authority, they were kings; they were royal
When we are built up together, separated from the world unto the Lord, and we pray before the Lord, we will be the holy priests
We come out to tell the people something about the Lord as royal priests, kingly priests, with the heavenly authority
When we as the Body go to the Lord and remain in His presence, we are the holy priests, the holy, separated ones before God
What comes out is not merely preaching of the word, of the gospel, but preaching the gospel with the kingly, heavenly authority
If we are going to serve the Lord in the way of the church service, we need to pay our full attention to these three matters
We will be qualified, empowered, to minister the Lord to others as the royal priests, the kingly priests, with the heavenly authority
The message, the word, the ministry, will be weighty because there is the heavenly authority of the royal priest
The coordination, the separation, and the authority-these three are the qualifications, the equipment we need to minister
You need to check whether you have been built up in the reality of the Body, whether you are in the coordination of the priesthood
In Acts 19:13-16, the seven sons of Sceva attempted to cast out the evil spirits by using the name of the Jesus that Paul preached
The real service, the prevailing service, does not depend upon knowledge, ability, eloquence, or so-called gifts
If you would be willing to be built up together with others, simply lose yourself, let yourself be lost, in the building of the church
You realize the separation with the saints from the world unto the Lord, and you do have the authority of the heavens
On the day of Pentecost Peter was one in the coordination and was one with the separation and the heavenly authority
When those one hundred twenty people stayed in the presence of the Lord for ten days, all of them were the holy priests
Because they were royal priests, even the highest power on this earth was afraid of them because of their authority
The first is that in the church all the serving ones must be built up together as a spiritual house, the priesthood
Among them there is a priesthood, a priestly body, a corporation, a coordination of a group of believers built up together, serving the Lord
The holy priesthood is a group of serving ones who have been separated from the satanic system of the world unto the service of God
Because they are separated from the world and entrusted with heavenly authority, they are qualified and equipped to serve the Lord
From that time, we need to learn to live, to walk, to act in the spirit, not in the mind or emotion, not in the soul
We need to learn not only to walk, to live, in the spirit but also to serve in the spirit and to serve in the newness of the spirit
To walk, to live, in our spirit means that we will be in the Holy Spirit because the Holy Spirit is now indwelling our spirit
Suppose on the Lord's Day morning we are having a morning service in the way of the letter, and we have one to take charge of the service
For the prayer meeting, you may look in the index of the hymnal and select a good hymn related to prayer just according to the letter
There is a way that is not according to your mind, your mentality, but according to the inner feeling of your spirit
We need to learn not to act or serve according to knowledge, but to act and serve according to the inmost feeling
Word by word, sentence by sentence, the message came out, not according to the mentality, but according to the anointing
One way is to offer a prayer according to knowledge, according to a routine, much like coming to an office to do routine work
We should not pray according to knowledge or routine, but according to the inner feeling, the inmost feeling of the anointing
In such a case we can sense something living, something anointing, something enlightening, not merely something of teaching
By the inner sense we know when a brother or sister is praying in the spirit or merely praying in the letter, according to knowledge
When anyone utters a prayer from the spirit, there is a spontaneous expression of agreement from the spirit of the others
Within them there is an 'amen,' but they suppress it; they would not release it simply because of their opinion
Whether they would utter it or not, when anyone prays in the spirit, there is always an echo in the spirit of others
You need to take care of this anointing and fellowship with the saints according to the inner feeling, the inner sense
During the very time you are listening to her, you need to exercise your spirit to sense her spirit and to sense the anointing within you
At that very moment you need to forget your knowledge of the Scriptures your knowledge of the Christian teachings and give up that knowledge
We all need to learn to practice, to exercise, and to conduct ourselves in the spirit in the service of the Lord
Merely to preach that we are all sinners and that the Lord Jesus is the Son of God who died on the cross for our sins does not work
He had actually stolen chalk from the school, but when he heard these words, he said to himself, 'That doesn't matter'
Your husband works hard to earn a living for you, and at the end of the year you forced him to buy a pair of high-heeled shoes for you
There are living stories of such experiences in the gospel preaching according to the inner feeling of the spirit
If you would keep your knowledge in your memory at that time, you will do much damage, and you will hinder the Spirit
While you are speaking, you need to forget about your knowledge and come back to the spirit to minister in the spirit
She was very strong in character, and she was very prominent in everything that was done for the whole evening
Another sister was serving at that same dinner, and she was the only one of the serving ones who did anything wrong
She had learned something of Christ, how to live in Christ, how to act in Christ, and even how to adjust her wrongdoings in Christ
It is possible to do many things in the Lord's service and yet have nothing of Christ ministered through you or by you
There are many lessons to learn in ministering Christ to others by cleaning, by cooking, and by doing many different practical things
We need to learn the lesson to serve others and to serve God by ministering Christ to others no matter what we are doing
If you are in the spirit when you are playing the piano, by playing the piano you will minister Christ to others
It was her habit to invite the young missionary ladies who had just come to China to have tea with her in the afternoon
A number of those young sisters could testify how much the life of the Lord was ministered to them by the serving of that tea
While they were drinking tea, several times this sister pulled her skirt down so that she was more fully covered
If others cannot sense Christ in the kitchen while you are cooking, it is doubtful that they will sense Him in the meetings in a real way
Unless we learn the lessons in these matters, the church life will be damaged, and death will be brought in through the practical matters
In that case, the more the saints come together for the practical service, the more the church life will be damaged
Whenever a brother or a sister serves in the flesh, there is a sense of something old, even six thousand years old, as old as Adam
In the Bible the Lord's maturity is portrayed in one way, and His newness is pictured in a different way, but the Lord is never old
We take care of sound teachings simply because those teachings have much to do with the matter of Christ as life
If doctrines and teachings are not related to Christ as life, we would not take care of them and would not talk about them
What we mean by the word coordination is simply to be built up together and to serve in the way of being built up together
The more you serve, the more you exercise your gift, the more you will be united, the more you will be coordinated with others
Since such a brother is so capable in himself, there are no lessons for him to learn, and there is no need for him to coordinate with others
If you would learn the lesson to be coordinated with others, you need to learn how to look down on yourself and how to be limited by others
There was a sister in China who was quite capable, educated, and experienced in doing things, and she loved the Lord very much
The first week that you come to serve the Lord you may take care of seventy percent of the things and the others take care of thirty percent
After one week, there are eight percent, then twelve, twenty, and eventually, maybe after one year, one hundred percent
The percentage of the work in your hands is always being reduced, yet the number of the people serving with you is always increasing
When you do things by yourself it seems that everything is convenient but when you do things with others it seems that nothing is convenient
The more people you have traveling with you, the more problems you have-the luggage, the things others forget, all the special needs
One of the biggest problems is to visit a church with several co-workers to be received for hospitality by the church
On the one hand, this is right, but on the other hand, they needed a few not only to help them but also to be a burden to them
If you have some helpers that are a burden to you in the service, then you will be limited, broken, and adjusted
After six months if all of the service is in your hand and nearly all of the people are goneyou are almost the only one leftthat is serious
Rather, you need to consider the percentage of the service that is in your hand and the number of the serving ones
We may talk about being broken, but the way to be broken is to serve the Lord with your brothers and sisters in the way of coordination
The more brokenness there is, the more openness there is, and the more openness, the more blending with others
We can come together week after week, month after month, and year after year, but we can never have a church life
We can never be blended as one in the spirit because our natural life, our soulish life, our human nature, has never been broken
There is only one way for you to experience the real brokenness of the natural life, and that is to be coordinated with others
You cannot merely close yourself in your room to read the Scriptures and pray and praise the Lord that you are broken
Suppose that, under the Lord's sovereignty, this sister is placed in some kind of coordination and put among seven sisters
After passing through such a testing, how could this sister close herself in her room in her old way and praise the Lord that she is broken?
The sovereignty of the Lord brought her into such a situation to show her that she has to be broken in this very matter
All of these eight will then be built up together, and they will bring more and more people to be coordinated with them
We need to learn to serve in a way that we could be coordinated with others and others could be coordinated with us
The more lessons you have, the more you need to learn, and the more you learn, the more the lessons will continue to come
If you are such a brother the Lord will send you more sisters and probably under His sovereignty He will send you the most troublesome ones
We need to practice to know the way of the church service, which is a service of coordination, never a service of an individual person
If the brothers would give you just a little hint that they would not have you minister, you should be willing to take it
Before that day there was no church in Jerusalem but something else was there something closely related to the church but different from it
It was not in the hand of the church, in the government of the church, or under the direction or control of the church
Paul and Barnabas were not under the direction of the church in Antioch; rather, they were separate from the church in Antioch
They were related to it, and what they went to do was completely for the local churches established around Antioch
They were a group of workers of God very much related to the churches and they worked to produce establish edify and build up the churches
As co-workers of the Lord, however, they were not apostles of the church in Antioch, of the church in Ephesus, or of any other local church
The ministry, the work, has much to do with the churches and is one hundred percent for the churches, yet it is not of the church
It is not under the control or direction of the church but is directly under the control of the Head, the Lord Jesus
According to the first three chapters of Revelation, the Lord is the One who walks among the golden lampstands
If we are going to serve the Lord, we must realize whether we are serving the Lord in the church or in the ministry
To serve the Lord in the service of the church is one thing, while to serve the Lord in the service of the ministry is another
Many brothers and sisters seem to have the attitude that it is good enough simply to come and serve in any way
The biggest distinction we must learn in the Lord's service is the relationship between the ministry and the church
The leading ones may examine a worker to see if he properly knows the divisions and meanings of the books of the Scriptures
Such a training is carried out when the church realizes what is of the Lord, for the Lord, and for the churches in the various localities
We need to be very clear about these two ways in order to maintain the church and the work under the direct control of the Lord's hand
Some have considered that our training meetings are simply church meetings, like the prayer meeting of the church
If we are going to serve in the service of the church we must be under the coordination of the church that is under the order of the church
It is all right now, but later on they may encounter problems with themselves or with others, if they are not clear about these matters
We must be coordinated, but in order to be coordinated rightly, we must realize in what part of the service we are serving
In the future, many churches will be built up, and we believe that many co-workers will be raised up by the Lord
According to church history, Christians in past generations have taken many ways to preach the gospel for the Lord
At the end of the Gospel of Matthew, the Lord told us to go and preach the gospel to the nations, making them the Lord's disciples
In the Scriptures, especially in the first three Gospels, there is the principle that Christians must be persons who go
On the one hand, we need to learn how to come to the Lord all the time, day by day; then on the other hand, we need to learn how to go
After the Lord accomplished His redemption by His death and resurrection, and after He ascended, the gospel was completed
The first time the gospel was preached after the completion of the gospel was by the Body of Christ on the day of Pentecost
If we are not built together as one, the enemy, Satan and the evil spirits, will laugh at us because we will not have the impact
Even though the brothers among us are few, if we would be one in the spirit and built together as one, we eventually will have the impact
If there are divisions among us, if we have opinions and quarrel with one another, the impact of the gospel preaching will be gone
We need to help all the brothers and sisters learn how to pray, on the one hand, and learn how to preach, on the other hand
In order to help the brothers and sisters to preach the gospel, we must help them to consecrate themselves again
We may ask the brothers to come together to have a meeting for some prayer to offer themselves to the Lord for this purpose
We should consider how many of them are already Christians and truly saved, and if possible, we should pray for them
We should consider whom to visit and whom to write, sending them gospel tracts, booklets, and helpful messages
If we have friends or relatives in other cities, we can mail them something and tell them where the meeting place is in their city
The first commission from the Lord to the church is to preach the gospel, to bring new believers to the church
We need to check ourselves by many ways to see if we are right or wrong one way to check ourselves is by whether or not we bring forth fruit
A necessary item for training young believers is to help them to promise to bring one person to the Lord each year
Some need to promise to bring two or four persons a year to the Lord, and one saint may even promise to bring ten persons
If every brother or sister brings one new convert to the church each year, the entire world will be evangelized in about thirty years
The first year we will start with one hundred, then the next year we will have two hundred, and each year we will double again
We should encourage the young brothers and sisters to carry tracts in their pockets and distribute them in order to contact people
We also put posters on the electric poles in the streets which said God so loved the world Jesus saves and other phrases in bold characters
While we paraded on the street, sometimes we would shout, 'Friends, we must tell you that you are sinners, and you need to believe in Jesus'
Some of us gave a message, some sang a hymn, some maintained the order, and others distributed tracts and booklets
The church must be helped to learn how to pray, how to preach the gospel, and to prepare gospel tracts and good booklets
Of these, about half are Catholics and half are Protestants, and in addition, many of the nominal Christians are false believers
Every member there is a preaching member; they preach all the time, nearly day by day, and so many of the saints simply live for the gospel
Being a testimony to people helps us to be humble, sincere, careful, faithful, and to try our best to love others
We especially need to train the brothers and sisters to do the work after the gospel meeting of visiting people
To have the same brothers coming together week after week on the Lord's Day becomes old, with no freshness or newness
If we take care of all these dealings, we will attain to a point where we realize the divine life in the church life
Although this may be a familiar subject or term for many of us, we look to the Lord that we may see something in a very practical way
The book of Romans shows us that the final stage, or experience, of the Christian life is the stage, the experience, of the Body of Christ
He shows us that if we are going to realize the experience of the Body of Christ, we must offer ourselves to the Lord
To offer ourselves in a way that is without our body is an offering or a consecration to the Lord 'in the air'
We must be separated, sanctified, and different from this age as a particular people, and we must be transformed
These are the two intentions in God's creation of man, one on the positive side and the other on the negative side
To express God in Christ through the Holy Spirit, strictly speaking, is not a matter of individuals but a matter of a corporate Body
It is true that we have ears a nose lips eyes and fingers we have many members but they cannot express us in a separate individual way
Why do we sense weakness, confusion, many negative things, and things other than Christ Himself in every kind of Christian group?
To have separated and scattered members is an awful condition which causes many troubles and things which need to be cleared up
There is no need for us to do anything more serious; to bring in only a small amount of self is enough for the enemy to damage the Body
If one says, 'Hallelujah,' the other says, 'Amen,' and if the other says, 'Hallelujah,' the first one says, 'Praise the Lord'!
If we still have our independence, we may be very nice to one another, but we can never realize the Body life among us
When someone comes to their home, he can sense the beauty and see how beautifully the couple argues in harmony
If we can keep the harmony, we can continue to argue, but if we cannot keep the harmony, we must stop the argument
We may have oneness without harmony, but to be sure, if we have harmony, we have oneness because harmony is something more than oneness
If we truly have a sincere heart to keep the harmony among the Lord's children, we will be very regulated and ruled by the heavenly reality
We will be governed, controlled, and directed by the inner life, the inner anointing, and the inner presence of the Lord
On the other hand, if someone receives these truths and agrees with them, he must not argue with others or try to convince them
Our intention, commission, and burden is not to preach doctrines but to preach Christ and minister Him to others
The self, the independence, the disharmony, and the overemphasis of matters other than Christ and His church damage and kill the church life
Learn the lessons to give up our self, to forget our independence, and to keep the sweet, fine, and tender harmony among the saints
Always remember that we are here for nothing but our dear Lord and His Body; this is our commission, our business
