The story of Moses shows us that he had an aspiration to save the Israelites on God's behalf. Although he was not used by God until he was eighty years old, his aspiration did not begin at the age of eighty; it was there when he was forty years old. God did not forget his aspiration during the next forty years. He came back to Moses.</p><p>Not only do we see this in Moses, we see this in the story of Samuel as well. Hannah prayed to the Lord and vowed, "If thou wilt...give unto thine handmaid a man child, then I will give him unto the Lord all the days of his life" (1 Sam. 1:10-11). God gained Samuel and accomplished His purpose through him in that age because Samuel's mother had an aspiration toward God concerning her son. God cares for man's aspiration toward Him; He treasures such an aspiration.</p><p>If we read God's Word carefully, we will find that God only gives spiritual life and light to one kind of people. Who are these people? They are the ones who have an aspiration to be used by God. The same is true in the case of spiritual power. No spiritual power is outward. All spiritual power comes as a result of man's aspiration for God and his consecration to God. Genuine power is based on man's heart toward God and his love for God. In the Old Testament Samson was very powerful. His enemy, the Philistines, did not know the source of his power; through Delilah they found out that his strength was with his hair. Once his hair was cut, he lost his power (Judg. 16:15-17). What was his hair? It was the hair of a Nazarite. A Nazarite is one who is fully consecrated to God. All genuine spiritual power comes from one's consecration to God. If a person is not thorough with his consecration, he is still crippled and powerless. But if a person has a thorough consecration before the Lord, he will become powerful. No matter how seeking we have been, we must always remember that power comes from consecration.</p><p>Suppose God puts His hand on a sister, and she struggles with the Lord for a long time without yielding to Him. Although she is willing to pray with others, her condition is not healthy because she has not satisfied God's demand. No matter how much she tries to help others, she cannot have a breakthrough. One day when God's love constrains her, she decides tearfully to yield to God. Once she answers God's demand, the help she renders to others will begin to touch others. This is why we say that power comes from consecration. The more consecration we have, the more power God will give to us.</p><p>Some may ask: "Why is it that others can have the light, but I do not have the light?" According to the story of Samson, whenever his hair was shaved, his power was gone, and he lost his eyes (Judg. 16:20-21). We do not have the light and we are blind because we do not have a thorough consecration. The Lord said, "For where your treasure is, there will your heart be also. The lamp of the body is the eye....But if your eye is evil, your whole body will be dark. If then the light that is in you is darkness, how great is the darkness!" (Matt. 6:21-23). The degree to which our heart is turned to the Lord determines the degree to which our spiritual eyes are opened within. God's children do not have light because they do not have a heart for God. They do not have power because their consecration is too little. When our heart is not turned to God sufficiently, when our consecration is inadequate, and when we do not answer God's demand completely, God cannot get through in us. If our consecration is thorough, it will bring in spiritual riches and heavenly blessings. I believe that when all the brothers and sisters are for the Lord and are thoroughly consecrated, the gospel will be preached everywhere and heavenly blessings will pour down everywhere.</p><p>Brothers and sisters, there is no other way to genuine power, light, and heavenly riches except through answering God's demand. The amount of consecration we have to God determines the amount of power we have from God. May we not hinder Him. In order for God to have a way, our heart must be turned toward Him; we must answer His demand and allow Him to flow through us. Otherwise, we will only hinder our God. God desires that we turn our heart to Him and answer His demand. In His work God needs man. If we do not answer His demand, He will have to find someone else to answer Him and carry out His will. May God strengthen our aspiration toward Him, and may His will be carried out through us.</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_054.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_056.html">Next</a> </body></html>
