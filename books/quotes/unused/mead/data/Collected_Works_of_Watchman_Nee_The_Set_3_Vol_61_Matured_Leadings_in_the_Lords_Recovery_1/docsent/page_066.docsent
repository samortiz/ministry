   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>A FEW THINGS TO NOTE IN HANDING ONESELF OVER</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In making judgments concerning the saints' handing themselves over, we have to be accurate.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Otherwise, there will be undesirable consequences.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Some brothers handed themselves over in another place already.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>We should not dictate their pathway for them.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>From now on, all the arrangements we make should be centered around the church.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>In other words, they should be centered around the Lord and the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The schooling of the young people also should be done in coordination.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>We do not expect all of you to quit work, but some should change jobs and work with the brothers and sisters.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Others can be scattered among unbelievers and strive to gain more of them.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>If we all practice this, the Lord will bless us.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>If the things that you handed over should be sold, you should dispose of them as quickly as possible.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>If not, you will get into trouble.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>One brother started out as an officer in the navy.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Later he was promoted to be a commander and then an admiral.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>He owned much land and had a nice house.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>It was built at the cost of sixty thousand gold dollars.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>He loved antiques, and he kept a great deal of precious metals and antiques in the house.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>I exhorted him to sell his things.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Even if he had to discount his house by ten percent, he could still get back fifty thousand gold dollars for it.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>He was reluctant to give up these things.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>As a result of this delay, his house has been turned into the headquarters of the Communist government.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>He could not take one article from his house, and he did not get a single dollar back of what he had put into it.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>During these few days, I hope you will gather together and make suitable arrangements for the things that the brothers and sisters have offered up.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>In this way the church will not suffer any loss.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>HANDING OURSELVES OVER OPENING THE WAY</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>FOR US TO LOVE THE LORD</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Finally, I would like to say that during the past few days I have had a deep feeling that our handing over of ourselves opens the way for us to love the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>If a man does not hand over himself, he can never succeed in loving the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Mr. F. B. Meyer was a person very experienced in the matter of consecration.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>One young sister consecrated herself over ten times at the age of twelve.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>She kept saying that she consecrated her heart to the Lord, but there was no breakthrough.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>She said to Mr. Meyer, "I do not know why I fail all the time.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Whenever I pray and give my heart to the Lord, I still feel as if it is with me."</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Mr. Meyer answered, "Tell the Lord that you cannot give your heart to Him, and ask Him to take it away instead."</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Let me say this: Our heart cannot go to Him, because it is stuck in the world and in its treasures, the mammon.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>This is the reason our mouth can say as much as we want about loving the Lord but our heart will not follow.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>If we send our treasures and our mammon to the Lord, our heart will follow.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>We cannot control our heart, and we cannot consecrate ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The Lord said that where our treasure is, there is our heart also Matt 6:21 .</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>How do we consecrate?</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>There is no need to deal with the heart, just deal with the treasure.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>When we give the Lord our treasure, our heart will go to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The happiest experience on earth is when our heart goes to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>We can jump up and sing, "Hallelujah!"</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>A Christian suffers when his heart cannot love the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>In order for our heart to love the Lord, we must not pay attention only to our heart, but to our treasure.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Once we hand over our treasure, our heart will surely follow.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>We can only love the Lord when we hand over ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>HANDING OURSELVES OVER</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>OPENING THE WAY FOR US TO LOVE</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>THE BROTHERS AND SISTERS</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>From the day we hand ourselves over, not only do we love the Lord, but we begin to truly love the brothers and sisters.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>If we have not handed ourselves over, we can only give what we have in excess to others; we cannot love the brothers and sisters.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>When we hand over everything, the Lord breaks our shell of self-love.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>We are delivered from our own little domain and begin to practice brotherly love.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>We become one who is good at giving.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Once we see something we have that others do not, we feel uneasy and want to give it up as well.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>I can testify to you honestly that Brother Philip Luan was a brother who handed himself over long ago.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>He sold everything he had.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>He was a strong person.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>He offered up many of his possessions the day after he was saved.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>He terminated many relationships.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>He even closed his tobacco factory.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Originally, he was known as the king of tobacco in Manchuria.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Every factory under him was very large.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>He had twenty-seven companies and over a hundred retail branches.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>However, he closed all these businesses a day or two after he believed in the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>He paid all the debts he owed, but he forgave all the debts that others owed him.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Later, when Brother Luan came to Hong Kong, he went through severe trials financially.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>He had been a rich man in his own place, but he volunteered to take the way of poverty.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>He did more than just love the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Many people can testify that he loved the brothers and sisters.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>Perhaps his speaking could not match that of Brother Witness, but he was a person who was absolutely free from self.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>God saved many people and perfected many others through him.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>Here we see a brother who was free from mammon.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>He loved the Lord and the brothers and sisters.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>No one who is constantly calculating can love the brothers.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>HANDING OURSELVES OVER OPENING THE WAY</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>FOR US TO LOVE SINNERS</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>Finally, handing ourselves over enables us to love not only the Lord and the saints but sinners as well.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>Before we hand ourselves over, we always count our money and consider it more precious than the human soul; we do not believe that a sinner is worth more than the whole world.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>But after we hand ourselves over, we feel that every soul is precious.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>It is worthwhile to spend the riches of the whole world in exchange for a single soul.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>The Lord asked, "What shall a man be profited if he gains the whole world, but forfeits his soul-life?</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>Or what shall a man give in exchange for his soul-life?"</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>Matt 16:26 .</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>When we fearfully hold on to our money, all the souls in the world mean little to us.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>We argue over three or five dollars while allowing a soul to go to hell.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>When we let go of our money, our heart will love all the sinners in this world.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>During the past two or three years, I have had the deep feeling that we can never treasure what is true unless we cast away what is false.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>Only those who are truly delivered from the power of mammon can love the Lord, the brothers, and sinners.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>If mammon continues to have a hold on us, our love for the Lord is false, our love for the brothers is false, and our love for sinners does not exist.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>It is nothing but doctrine, good only for deceiving and mollifying ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>We will have love and joy only after we have handed ourselves over.</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>Christ will be precious to us only after we have done this.</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>Only then will the church and all the brothers and sisters be precious to us.</S>
   <S PAR='98' RSNT='1' SNO='98'>When we walk on the street, we will feel that every soul is precious and every sinner lovable.</S>
   <S PAR='99' RSNT='1' SNO='99'>While we are waiting for the bus to come, we will have a different feeling when we see the crowds passing by.</S>
   <S PAR='100' RSNT='1' SNO='100'>Even if some argue and fight in front of us, we will still love them and treasure their souls.</S>
   <S PAR='101' RSNT='1' SNO='101'>When we see someone engaged in a brawl, we will pray earnestly for him.</S>
   <S PAR='102' RSNT='1' SNO='102'>Others may consider him a demon, but we will find his soul very precious.</S>
   <S PAR='103' RSNT='1' SNO='103'>There is only one thing in the world that takes away our love for the Lord, for the saints, and for sinners mammon.</S>
   <S PAR='104' RSNT='1' SNO='104'>Once mammon goes away, our senses will be clear, our eyes will be opened, our minds will see, and our judgments will be right.</S>
   <S PAR='105' RSNT='1' SNO='105'>May God grant us this kind of seeing.</S>
