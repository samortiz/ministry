   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>God's Expression of Love</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Does the whole matter stop with God loving the world?</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>"God is love" speaks of God's nature; it speaks of God Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>"God so loved the world" speaks of God's action.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>But God's love toward us has an expression.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>What is this expression of His love?</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Romans 5:8 says, "But God commends His own love to us in that while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us."</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>God's love has an expression.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>If I love a person and merely tell him that I love him, that love has not yet been consummated.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Unless love is expressed, it is not consummated.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>There is no love in the world that is without an expression.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>If there is love, it must be expressed.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>If a love is not expressed, such a love cannot be considered love.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Love is most practical.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>It is not vain and is not merely a verbal matter.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Love is expressed through actions.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>If you put a ball on a surface that is not level, you can be sure that something will happen; it will end up rolling down.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The same is true with love.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>You can be sure that it will have an expression.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Since God loves the world, He has to be concerned about man's need.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Hence, He must do something for man.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>We are sinners.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>We have no other choice but to go to hell, and no other place to be except in the place of perdition.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>But God loves us, and He will not be satisfied until He has saved us.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>When God says, "I love you," His love will step up to bear all our burdens and remove all our problems.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Since God loves us, He must provide a solution to the problem of sins; He must provide the salvation that we sinners need.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>For this reason, the Bible has shown us this one great fact: the love of God is manifested in the death of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Since we are sinners and are unable to save ourselves, Christ came to die in order to solve the problem of sin for us.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>His love has accomplished something substantial, and this has been put before us.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Now we can see His love in a substantial way.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>His love is no longer merely a feeling.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>It has become a thoroughly manifested act.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>In this great matter of God's love, we must take note of three things: the nature of God's love, the action of God's love, and the expression of God's love.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Thank and praise God!</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>His love is not only a feeling within Him.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>It is also an action, and even an expression and manifestation.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>His love made Him do what we cannot do by ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Since He is love and since He has loved the world, salvation has been produced.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Since man has sin and since God is love, a lot of things follow.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>If you are not poor, you will have no need of me.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>But if I do not love you, even if you are extremely poor, I will not be concerned at all.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The situation today is that man has sinned and God has loved; therefore, things begin to happen.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Hallelujah, a lot is happening because man has sinned and God has loved.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>When you put the two things together, the gospel comes into being.</S>
