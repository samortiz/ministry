   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>God has not given us Christ so that He could just die for us on the cross; He has given Christ to us to be our life.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Originally, we react to all the demands that are outside of us by exercising our own life; we act according to our own life.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>If our own life is strong enough, we make it.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>If our own life is not strong enough, we do not make it, or worse, we collapse.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>We react with our own life and deal with outward matters with our own life.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>But God has given Christ to us to be our life.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Before we received the Lord Jesus, we lived by ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>After we receive the Lord Jesus, God wants Him to live inside of us and live for us.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>When the Lord Jesus becomes our life within, we do not have to live by our original life.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>It is not a matter of the Lord Jesus giving us commands, suggestions, or teachings and then us carrying them out.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Rather, He becomes our life within and carries things out for us.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>From now on, we should live by His life.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Formerly, we responded to outward demands with our own life.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Now we should allow Christ's life to respond to them.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>After understanding the meaning of Christ being our life, we now come to the question of Christ becoming our wisdom from God.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Brothers and sisters, you have been a Christian for many years.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Do you have anything other than your own wisdom?</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Have you received the Lord Jesus as your wisdom?</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Has the Lord Jesus been your wisdom once?</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>How much have you known the Lord Jesus?</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>This is the basic question, and we must be clear about it.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>This verse does not say that the Lord Jesus gives us wisdom; it does not say that God has given us the Lord Jesus' wisdom.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>It does not say that we understand and know how to speak or act, even though we were once foolish, because God has given us wisdom.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>No, the Bible does not say this.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The Bible says that Christ became wisdom to us from God.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The word "became" is very important, and there is no better word than this word.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>We can take the story of Moses and Aaron as an example.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Moses was afraid of speaking to the Israelites; he was afraid because he was not eloquent.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>He said that he was slow of speech and of a slow tongue; therefore, he dared not go.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>What did God say?</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>He said, "Is not Aaron the Levite thy brother?....He shall be thy spokesman unto the people: and he shall be, even he shall be to thee instead of a mouth" Exo 4:14, 16 .</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Does this mean that when Aaron became Moses' mouth, Moses became eloquent?</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>No, Aaron only became Moses' mouth, but Moses was still Moses.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Of course, Moses spoke later.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>But that is a different story.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>When Moses' eloquence failed, he could ask Aaron to speak for him.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>This is the meaning of Aaron becoming Moses' mouth.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Aaron became Moses' mouth.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The eloquence was still with Aaron; it was not with Moses.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Moses needed Aaron to be the mouth, because his own mouth did not work as well.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>It does not mean that after Moses took Aaron as his mouth, his own mouth became eloquent.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>After we see the meaning of Aaron becoming the mouth of Moses, we see the meaning of Christ becoming wisdom to us from God.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>It does not mean that Christ has made us wise.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Rather, it means that we are foolish, but we allow the Lord to become our wisdom while we do not move.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Originally, when there were demands from the outside, we reacted with our own life.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Today when there are demands from the outside, we know that we cannot make it and should not react anymore.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>What then should we do?</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>We should allow the Lord's life to react.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>It is not a matter of becoming better in ourselves; it is a matter of the Lord living on our behalf.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Moses' mouth did not improve.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Rather, Aaron became his mouth for him and spoke instead of him.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Christ being our wisdom is like Aaron speaking on Moses' behalf.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Suppose you are going to speak to someone.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>What are you going to do when you cannot say what you want to say?</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>You may ask another one who has come with you to speak for you.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>You cannot speak yourself, and you ask him to speak; he meets the demand.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>While he is speaking, your mouth remains dumb; it has not improved, and you are still the same as before.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>We must never think that when Christ becomes our wisdom, we become wise.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>We must remember that even when Christ has become our wisdom, we can still do nothing in ourselves.</S>
