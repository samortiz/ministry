OF THE MIRACULOUS NORMALITY</h2>
<p>It is difficult to determine when Peter and the other disciples who followed the Lord in His earthly ministry were regenerated. Bible teachers hold different opinions on this matter. Some say that Peter received the Lord Jesus when he first came to Him. Others say that Peter was regenerated when he saw the Lord Jesus transfigured on Mount Hermon. Still others say that Peter was not regenerated until the day of the Lord&rsquo;s resurrection when the Lord breathed the Spirit into him. Another school maintains that Peter was regenerated on the day of Pentecost when the Spirit came upon him, and he stood up to speak. In considering this matter, we need to realize that Peter was in a transitional period. When Peter called on the Lord in this transitory period, he was on the way to being saved. There was a period of transition for the Lord to accomplish and to complete Peter&rsquo;s regeneration. Peter&rsquo;s regeneration began at the time of his calling on the name of the Lord and was completed on the day of the Lord&rsquo;s resurrection. On the day of resurrection, Peter was actually and practically regenerated, not only positionally regenerated.</p>
<p>Today we are not in a transitory period like Peter was. We did not need to call on the name of the Lord and wait three and a half years for our regeneration to be completed. We did not even have to wait three and a half seconds. When we called, &ldquo;O Lord Jesus,&rdquo; we immediately received the Spirit within. Our calling on the name of the Lord and our regeneration transpired at the same time.</p>
<p>Soon after Peter&rsquo;s regeneration was completed on the day of the Lord&rsquo;s resurrection, he was tested concerning the need of his living. Peter and his colleagues were full-timers who had been called by the Lord to give up their occupations and follow Him (Matt. 4:19-20; Luke 5:3-11). Due to the trial of the need of their living, Peter returned to his old occupation and some others followed him, backsliding from the Lord&rsquo;s call (John 21:2-3). Peter was called by the Lord when he was fishing on the sea of Galilee, but after the day of resurrection, he told the others that he was going fishing, and they followed him. They might have lacked a sufficient supply of food and were very concerned about it. Do you believe that while Peter and the others were fishing the entire night that they were filled inwardly with the Spirit? Do you believe that before going fishing, they knelt down and prayed for twenty minutes to make a thorough confession of their sins and failures to the Lord? If they had prayed in such a way, they surely would have been filled inwardly with the Spirit and would not have gone fishing. Despite fishing for the entire night, they caught nothing. They did not get any fish, but they did get Jesus. Jesus appeared to them (John 21:4-14).</p>
<p>However, there was a great difference with these same disciples when they were in the upper room in Jerusalem as part of the one hundred and twenty. They prayed for ten days in one accord, and Peter stood up to expound some verses in the Psalms (Acts 1:14-20). Surely by that time all of them were filled inwardly with the Spirit. Without the inward filling of the Spirit, how could they have prayed together for ten days in one accord and how could they have withstood the opposition and persecution of the Jews in Jerusalem? Although the Jewish leaders were persecuting the followers of Jesus, they stayed together to pray for ten days in one accord. Surely all of the one hundred and twenty were completely filled with the Spirit inwardly during those ten days.</p>
<p>They were filled inwardly with the Spirit, but they still had not received the outpouring of the Spirit. The Spirit had not yet fallen or descended upon them economically. After the ten days were completed, the Spirit in the economical sense came down from the throne of the ascended Christ to descend upon them. This was not the inward filling of the Spirit of life but the outward outpouring of the Spirit of power (Acts 2:16-18). The outpouring of the Spirit in Acts 2 was the disciples being clothed with power from on high (Luke 24:49). It was then that the Spirit became their uniform, their authority for their work.</p>
<p>If a policeman attempted to direct traffic or do any of his work without his uniform, he would not command the respect of the people. But when a driver sees a policeman in his uniform, the driver is full of a fearful respect. The uniform of the policeman signifies the authority, power, position, duty, and responsibility of the policeman. We realize that we have to respect and regard a man in a police uniform because he is a man in authority, in his position, and in his responsibility. He is a man who, doing his duty, has the power to enforce the law.</p>
<p>When Peter and the eleven stood up on the day of Pentecost (Acts 2:14a), they were clothed with the economical Spirit of power, the power from on high, as their uniform. They stood there with authority. The heavens, the earth, and all the demons respected them because these were the men in the universe who had the power and the authority of the ascended Christ. This was not the inward filling of the Spirit essentially but the outward clothing of the Spirit economically.</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_044.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_046.html">Next</a> </body></html>
