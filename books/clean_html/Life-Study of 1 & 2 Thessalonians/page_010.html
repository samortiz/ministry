<h1 class=series>LIFE-STUDY OF FIRST THESSALONIANS</h1><h1 class=msg>MESSAGE THREE</h1><h1 class=title>THE LIVING GOD AND THE WORK OF FAITH</h1><h1 class=scripture>Scripture Reading: 1 Thes. 1:1-10</h1><p>For the most part, Christians understand and interpret the Bible in a natural way. This may be the case in reading 1 and 2 Thessalonians. We have pointed out that these Epistles were written by Paul in an elementary way to new believers, to those who had been in the Lord probably for less than a year. When I was very young, I was told that the books to the Thessalonians are very precious, and I began to pay close attention to them. However, my understanding of these Epistles was natural. As I look back on the past, I realize that I interpreted these books in a very natural way. We all need to see the difference between understanding the Word in a natural way and understanding it in a spiritual way.<h2 class=head1>THE CHURCH IN THE TRIUNE GOD</h2><p>Although 1 and 2 Thessalonians were written to new believers, in these books a number of profound terms are used. Both 1 and 2 Thessalonians begin in almost exactly the same way: “Paul and Sylvanus and Timothy to the church of the Thessalonians in God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.” Of the many Epistles written by Paul, only these two have this expression, the church in God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ. Instead of taking this expression for granted, we should seek to find out what it means. If we check in this way, we shall learn that it is a very profound matter to say that the church is in God. This thought cannot be found in the Old Testament. God never told His people, the children of Israel, that they were in God. But in the New Testament there are two Epistles that tell us that the church is in God. We need to learn the real significance of the church being in God. What a great matter that the church is in God!<p>In 1 Corinthians Paul says that the church is in Corinth. He also speaks of the churches in Macedonia. Both in 1 and 2 Thessalonians the location of the church is not a city—it is God. Furthermore, the church is in the Triune God. This is indicated by the fact that Paul says “in God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.” The object of the preposition “in” is both God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ. The Father and the Son are two and yet are one. For the church to be in God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ means that the church is in the Triune God.<p>The God revealed in the New Testament is not merely God the Creator; He is God the Father and our Lord Jesus Christ. He has passed through the process of incarnation, human living, crucifixion, and resurrection. The name Jesus indicates incarnation, and the title Christ, resurrection. If God had not become incarnate, how could He be Jesus? If He did not enter into resurrection, how could He be Christ? The God who has passed through incarnation and resurrection is now in our spirit to be our life. The church is an entity in such a God, even the Triune God.<p>Although the church in Thessalonica was a new church, the Thessalonians nevertheless had to realize that the church is in God. Those in this young church needed to see that the church is in the Triune God, in the very God who is our Father and our Lord. The books of 1 and 2 Thessalonians were written not to individuals, but to the church in the Triune God. This is the reason we speak of a holy life for the church life. These two Epistles are addressed to the church, and the church is in the processed Triune God.
