<h2 class="head3">Two</h2><p>I received a letter from the brothers and sisters in Ch'ang-sha recently. They have asked Brother Liu Ai-wu to write a letter of invitation to me, hoping that I can go to them and do some work among the sisters. How do you feel? If you feel the same way and I am clear that this is God's will, I hope that I can go.</p><p>Sister Tso Fu-ru, June 14</p><p>(On July 27 I received Sister Tso's letter, dated the nineteenth, saying that she has decided to go from Shanghai to Ch'ang-sha via Hong Kong on the twenty-sixth. She will probably arrive in Ch'ang-sha by August 3 or 4&mdash;Editor.)</p><h2 class="head2">Pioneering Work around Hwang-Ni Mountain, Chekiang Province</h2><p>The men of Hwang-Ni Mountain, who had never heard the gospel before, heard of salvation for the first time on April 21. We worked there for seven evenings. The Spirit of God had gone before us, and every evening about three hundred people came to listen to the word. Even on rainy nights, at least half that number showed up. Such quietness and attentiveness have rarely been seen elsewhere. On the third night some began to yield to the Lord. Thereafter, some began to believe in the Lord, both in the day as well as at night. On the last evening more believed. Over thirty people knelt down to call on the Lord. Miracles and works of wonders testified to our word. At the end of May we did some watering work and some became clear about their salvation. They have asked to start meeting and have already rented places for their meeting. On the Lord's Day of June 12, they began to meet. Every Wednesday evening they meet for prayer and to learn to sing hymns. The offering box was placed in the meeting place, and everyone brought chairs and other furniture from their own homes. God has also selected some among them who are like elders. We praise the Lord unceasingly at seeing His great grace and power! At the beginning of June, we conducted five days of pioneering work in the foothills of Bai-Luh Mountain, which is three miles west of Hwang-Ni Mountain. One person believed in the Lord. On June 30 we advanced to Jien-Tan Mountain, which is five miles northwest of Hwang-Ni Mountain, and worked there for seven evenings. The attendance was no less than that in Hwang-Ni Mountain, except that the crowd was noisy. God prepared a village chief who accepted the Lord. This has been to the disadvantage of the opposers. Thank the Lord that seven or eight have repented and believed in the Lord. Since God has done a great work, the enemy will not let go. In Hwang-Ni and Jien-Tan recently, he has been using many ways to attack God's children, and he has enticed some to draw back. May the victorious Christ continue to display His victory in His children and shame His enemy. I hope that the co-workers will remember this and pray.</p><p>Brothers in the Lord,</p><p> Hu Bu-dao, Chen Meng-tsao, July 10</p><h2 class="head2">A Letter from Rachel Lee, K'un-ming</h2><p>The Lord willing, I will leave soon for Yunnan. At any rate I have to repay my present debt. I am clear concerning the Lord's will and will be in Yi-Liang and Luh-Liang by the end of the month. Then I will travel to areas around Shi-Ping, Ku-Jiu, and Mong-Tze. During the past three weeks, the pastor from the Episcopal Church and his wife have asked Sister Yu to preach at their place. The situation during that week was very good, and some of the newly saved ones were revived. Recently, much progress has been made with the sisters; they now desire to seek after the Lord very much.</p><p>Sister Rachel Lee, July 8</p>
