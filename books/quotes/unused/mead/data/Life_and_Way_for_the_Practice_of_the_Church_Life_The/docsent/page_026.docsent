   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>LIVING ACCORDING TO THE INNER LAW OF LIFE</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>I am concerned that many of you may be very good, yet you are wrong with the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>You may work for God today, preach the gospel, do a lot of things to build up the churches, and even give what you have to help others.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>But I would ask you, "Are you right with the Spirit in you?"</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>One day when the Lord comes back, He will not ask you about so many things.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>He is concerned about only one thing, that is, whether or not you are right with Him according to the inner law of life.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Today it is not a matter of work or doing.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>It is a matter of how you deal with the living One who dwells in you.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Are you right with Him?</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>I say again, you may be very good, very religious, and seemingly very spiritual, but I am afraid you are not in the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>According to your actions, your expressions, your doings, and your speaking, you are altogether outside of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>You are not right with the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>You are not right with the inner law.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>You do not take care of the inner regulating, but neglect it all the time.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>In Revelation 2, the Lord told the church in Ephesus, "I know your works and your labor and your endurance and that you cannot bear evil men; and you have tried those who call themselves apostles and are not, and have found them to be false; and you have endurance and have borne all things because of My name and have not grown weary.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>But I have one thing against you, that you have left your first love" vv.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>2-4 .</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>As a wife, you may do a lot of good things for your husband, but are you right with your husband?</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Do you have a genuine love for him?</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>This is the problem.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>We are talking about the Christian life and the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>What is the Christian life?</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>What is the church life?</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The Christian life is not a religious life; it is a life which is Christ Himself lived out through us.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>We must take Christ as life and live by Him day by day.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>We need to love Him and be willing to be regulated, governed, and ruled by Him.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Then we will be walking in this living One, and we will be in the reality of the Christian life.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The church life is not something organized or something regulated by teaching.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The church life is Christ lived out through us in a corporate way.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>You live Christ and I live Christ, and this very Christ unites us together in oneness.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Then together we have the corporate life of Christ expressed.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The church life is not produced by a lot of discussion.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>This is the way of the United Nations in New York or of the United States Congress.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>This is not the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Strictly speaking, in the church, there is no need of discussion.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>If we need a lot of discussion, that means we are fallen; we are wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>If you take Christ as everything, all the problems will be solved, settled, through the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Brothers and sisters, I am very much concerned about this matter.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>We may know how to be religious, but we do not know adequately how to take Christ as our life that Christ Himself may be lived out through us.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>We may know the forms and the teachings, but do we know the real church life which is Christ Himself lived out through us in a corporate way?</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>We need to be definite and subjective.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>This wonderful Christ is living, acting, and moving within us.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>He is shining on us and regulating us all the time.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The only need is for us to take care of this inner regulating.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Sometimes brothers or sisters would come to me and ask me about certain things, but I had something within holding me back from speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>According to the inner regulating, I could not say anything.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>If we learn to forget about all the outward things and simply take care of the inner regulating, we will have a wonderful church life.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The church life is Christ Himself.</S>
