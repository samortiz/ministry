   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>The only one way for our sins to be forgiven is for us to be cleansed righteously in the Lord's blood.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>However, when sinners want to be saved, they will try any method, whether righteous or not.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Before we were awakened and before we repented, we refused salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>But when we realized the result of sin, the danger of our present position, and the pain and terror of eternal punishment in hell, we tried many methods to be saved.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>However, with God, there cannot be many methods.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>God's way of salvation must not conflict with His righteousness, holiness, nature, and will.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>At the time we were saved, we were filthy and sinful persons; we did not know God's holy, righteous, and glorious salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>God's salvation must not come into conflict with His righteousness, holiness, and glory, and, at the same time, still save sinners.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>We did not know and we did not care about these things because we were short of the glory of God anyway.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Romans 3 through 5 say that the Lord was delivered and crucified for our sins and resurrected for our righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Since we were so sinful, filthy, and hopeless, we were very short of God's glory.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>But when the Lord died and resurrected, He recovered God's glory.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>God did not forgive our sins in a careless and foolish way.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>He did not forgive our unrighteousness in a loose way.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>He cannot deal with sin carelessly and loosely.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>God has judged and punished the sinners in the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>We have passed through God's judgment and punishment in the Lord, and we are saved through the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Our sins have not been forgiven in a careless and loose way.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Rather, we passed through God's judgment and punishment in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>When I was in Shanghai, I met a friend who was a lawyer and also a Christian, and I asked how he was saved.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>He told me that after he heard a message, he realized that the doctrine of salvation through faith in the Lord Jesus was very lawful.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>According to the law, when man transgresses the law, he must be judged by the court and punished by the government.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>After he has been judged and punished, he is no longer a sinner.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>If a criminal commits a crime and deserves to be punished ten years in prison and then is imprisoned for ten years, when he comes out of prison, he is no longer guilty of any crime.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>No one can put him into prison for another ten years.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Even if his adversary meets him on the street, the adversary cannot do anything to him because he is no longer a criminal.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Originally, we were all great sinners, but we were judged and punished by God.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>We do not have our sins anymore, and no one can say anything against us.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>God's way of salvation must be able to save us according to His righteous demands and must allow the conscience to approve it.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>In the past we did not know that the way God saves sinners is in accordance with His righteousness and holiness.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>We did not know that sin had to pass through severe judgment and punishment.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>God is absolutely holy and righteous.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>His eyes cannot behold sin.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Because the Lord died for us and resurrected, the blood He shed satisfies God's heart.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>When the holy and righteous God saw this death, He considered it our death and passed over us.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>He had nothing more to say about us.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The holy and righteous God said, "This is enough.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>It is all right."</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Even more, we can say, "It is enough.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>It is all right."</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>God cares for His holy nature and righteous way more than we do.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>He cannot do anything contrary to His virtuous nature.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>He has to act according to His nature in righteousness, holiness, and glory.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Otherwise, He is not qualified to save the sinners.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The Lord's blood is precious because it satisfies the righteous and holy God.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>This is why the sinners can be saved and become sinless, righteous ones.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>When God enacted the new covenant, our sins were removed once and for all.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>When the Lord saves us, He eternally saves us to the uttermost.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>When God accepted the sacrifice of the Lord, our filth, rubbish, and everything that blocked God's way was removed, and we were accepted by God.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>The blood of the new covenant not only removed the hindrances, it also bought back something.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>It bought back an inheritance for us.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>The Bible speaks of the Lord's work of salvation; it also speaks of His bringing us back to the Father's house and His kingdom, and of His giving us an eternal inheritance kept in the heavens.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>He has not just saved us as poor individuals.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>When we consider the blood, we should see that it has not only removed something, it has also bought us something.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>The blood enables us to draw nigh to God.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>God has not brought us just to the outer court.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>He has not just told us to go in peace and that our sins have been forgiven.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>He has brought us through the veil into His habitation and removed the separating veil.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Not only have our iniquities and unrighteousness been removed and cleansed, but God has given Himself to us to be our all.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Therefore, whatever He can do, we can do also.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>The blood is a big plus; it has added everything to us.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Paul said that if God "did not spare His own Son, but delivered Him up for us all, how shall He not also with Him freely give us all things?"</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Rom 8:32 .</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>The blood of the Son of God not only redeemed us, but purchased an inheritance for us who believe in the name of His Son.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>I hope that whoever is sitting here today would lift up their hearts to God and say to Him, "Thank You, the blood has removed everything that is against me."</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>If you can say this to God, I will thank the Lord for you.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>The blood has not only removed your sin and hindrances before God, it has also put you in a covenant.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Through the blood, God has now given you everything in the covenant.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Brothers and sisters, do you know that a covenant is most effective?</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>If you do not know God's covenant and only pray according to your own will, you will not obtain what you want.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>You will not even have the power to ask for what you want.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>When you see the effectiveness of the blood, when you see all the spiritual blessings in the heavenlies that it has bought for you, when you see all the things pertaining to life and godliness, and when you see that all these things are yours, you will realize that it is foolish to painfully beg for God's work to be accomplished.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>If I go to the Shanghai Bank today and say, "I am very poor.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>Please give me fifty dollars," I could beg from eight in the morning until eight at night, but I do not think that I will receive fifty dollars.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>It is difficult to receive by begging in this way.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>But if I deposit some money there, do I still have to beg?</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>All I have to do is claim it.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>There is no need for me to pitifully beg.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>If the banker pays me too slowly, I can even ask him to hurry up.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>In one instance, I do not have money in the bank, and I can only beg.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>In the other instance, I have money, and I can claim it.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>In the former case, the bank's money has nothing to do with me.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>In the latter case, it is my own money.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>Brothers and sisters, have you seen what a covenant is?</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>Have you seen what a vain request that has no basis is and what a request that is based on a covenant is?</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>The covenant is a document that shows that the Lord has bought all things pertaining to life and godliness for us with His blood.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>When we ask according to the covenant, we are not asking for something that is not ours; we are claiming what is ours and has been kept in custody.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>A request based on the covenant is not an empty request, but a claim for what has been promised in the covenant.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>Before the Lord died, there was a need to ask and pray.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>But since the Lord has died on the cross, do we still need to ask and pray, or should we claim what is ours?</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>We should realize that now all of the spiritual blessings are ours, and all we have to do is to claim and apply them.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>God is now standing on our side because of the blood.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>We can obtain all the blessings through the blood.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>Many times, through the blood, we can come to God and claim rather than ask.</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>This does not mean that we do not need to pray, but our prayers should be more of a claim than a request.</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>Mr. Gordon said that since Golgotha, all the references to asking in the Bible should be changed to taking.</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>Everyone who knows God, who knows Golgotha, and who knows the meaning of the blood will say "amen" to this word.</S>
   <S PAR='98' RSNT='1' SNO='98'>The blood shed on the cross on Golgotha has purchased all the spiritual blessings concerning life and godliness for us.</S>
   <S PAR='99' RSNT='1' SNO='99'>Now everything is being kept for us, and all that we have to do is claim them back.</S>
   <S PAR='100' RSNT='1' SNO='100'>Through the blood, we do not have to ask God to give us what He has, but what we have.</S>
   <S PAR='101' RSNT='1' SNO='101'>This is why we say that God is now dealing with us according to the principle of righteousness and not grace.</S>
   <S PAR='102' RSNT='1' SNO='102'>Everything that the new covenant gives to us is according to righteousness and is rightfully ours.</S>
   <S PAR='103' RSNT='1' SNO='103'>We can claim all these things through the new covenant.</S>
