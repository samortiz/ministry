   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>What Galatians 2:20 speaks of is something accomplished once for all.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>After we realize that our self needs to be put to death, we should then by faith acknowledge in a definite way that "I have been crucified with Christ."</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The word in the original text is ego, the "I," the self.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Besides the cross, there is indeed no other way to put the self to death.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>We should also pay attention to the words "with Christ."</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The crucifixion of the self is not an independent act of the believers.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Believers are not to crucify the self on the cross by themselves in their own strength.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The crucifixion of the self is to be joined to Christ and in conjunction with Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>This is not to say that we help Christ to put the self on the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Rather, it means that Christ has already accomplished this fact, and I now merely acknowledge and believe its reality.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Here the main focus is Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>This is why it says: "I have been crucified with Christ," and not "Christ has been crucified with me."</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>It is not that we want to put the self to death, and that Christ comes merely to accompany us.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Rather, it was Christ who in His death brought all our "ego," our self, to the cross and nailed it there.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Therefore, I am not crucifying the self again but am merely acknowledging the fact.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The two words "have been" show us that it is a fact and not a wish.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>A life that dies to the self is possible, real, and attainable.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The apostles in the ancient time obtained that kind of life already; their self passed the test.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Therefore, it is possible for us to obtain this life also.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>However, we should remember that this is "crucified with" and not "crucified alone."</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Apart from the Lord we can do nothing.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>To crucify the self with the strength of the self is an impossible task and can never be done.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>If we are not united with the Lord in His death, our self will never die.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Christ alone brought all the old creation together with every part of it to the cross in His death.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>If we try to find another way besides the Lord's way, and to try to accomplish anything besides the Lord's accomplishment, we are not only foolish but are also wasting our time.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Therefore, we are to do nothing but come to the Lord with full assurance of faith and acknowledge the Lord's accomplishment as ours; following this we should pray for the Holy Spirit to apply in us the work of the Lord's cross and to express this very work from us.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>We should come before God to rebuke our self and should offer up everything to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>By the Spirit of the Lord, we should put to death everything that is included in our self life.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>We should tell God, "Hereafter it is no longer I, no longer my own likeness, opinions, tastes, or preconceptions.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>I will put all these on the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Starting from today, I will live only according to Your will.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>O Lord!</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>It is You...not I."</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>We should submit to the Lord in such a way as to put all we have to death.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>But this does not mean that from now on we have the self exterminated.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The self cannot and will not be exterminated; it always exists.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Why then do we say to nail the self on the cross?</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Here we must know one important thing: the question before us is one that has to do with the spiritual life.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>For this kind of question, we must emphasize spiritual experience more than mere literary accuracy.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>There are many things which seem to contradict one another in semantics and which seem utterly incompatible.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Yet they fit very harmoniously together and have no awkwardness of any kind in the realm of the spiritual life.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>This is what happens here.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>According to the literal meaning, if the self is dead already, how can it not be exterminated?</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>We have to know that the word "dead" here refers to a kind of process in the spiritual experience.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The self being dead does not mean that the self is from now on non-existent.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>It means that the self will hereafter submit to God, that it will not allow its likes and dislikes to take over, but that it will allow the cross to crucify and terminate all its selfish thoughts and activities.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>To stop the self life from driving the self means that the living which is derived from the self life is dead, and that there is no more self life and self living, and that only the shell of the self remains.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The self includes the will, the emotions, and the intelligence, etc. This does not mean that when we believe in our self being crucified with Christ, our will, emotions, intellect, etc., will be annulled! No one can annihilate the few faculties which make up his being just by believing in his having been crucified with the Lord! To die with the Lord simply means to no longer allow the self to be the master, to no longer act according to one's own will, emotions, and thoughts, and to no longer allow the self life to have its way; it means to allow the Lord's Spirit to rule over everything that the self encompasses, so that a person will obey God's life within.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>As long as the self is not dead, it will not yield to the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Once the self walks away from the cross, it will right away resume its old posture.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Believers have neither the power nor the way to subdue themselves.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Galatians 2:20 sheds a lot of light on this point.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>"I the self have been crucified with Christ,...and the life which I now live in the flesh...."</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Does not the Scripture speak very clearly here?</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>In his first sentence Paul made it very clear that his self had been crucified on the cross, yet in the second sentence did he not say that his self still existed?</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Therefore, the crucifixion of the self does not mean the extermination of the self; rather, it means to cease from the activities of the self and to allow the Lord to be the Master.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>This should be very clear.</S>
