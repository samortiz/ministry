   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>FEASTING IN THE NEW TESTAMENT</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The New Testament often records that the Lord Jesus reclined at table with His followers.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>A table is a place to eat.</S>

   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>EATING PRIVATELY AND CORPORATELY</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>We should come to the church meetings to eat the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>However, if we eat the Lord only in the meetings and not privately in our daily life as well, there will not be much to eat in the meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>If we eat the Lord privately in our daily lives, we will have more to eat in the meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>If we do not eat the Lord throughout the day, we will come to the meetings empty-handed.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>We may hope that others will bring something for us to eat, but if everyone thinks this way, no one will bring anything of Christ to the meeting for others to enjoy.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>However, if all the saints eat the Lord throughout the day, there will be much to share in the meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>The eating in the meetings depends on the eating in our private life.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>If we eat daily in our private lives, we will have a rich store and come to the meeting full of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Then we can share our Christ, and all will eat and be richly fed.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Therefore, every day we need to contact the Lord individually.</S>

   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>We can sing to the Lord not only in the meetings but also by ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>We need to have both individual eating and corporate eating.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>We can eat corporately in the church meetings or with only one other person, such as our spouse or roommate.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>The Christian life is an eating life.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>The more we eat, the more we are filled and saturated with Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>When we come to the meetings full of Christ, the meetings will be rich feasts.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>EATING AND DRINKING IN REVELATION</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>At the end of the Bible, there is a promise and a call.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>The promise is in Revelation 22:14, which says, Blessed are those who wash their robes that they may have right to the tree of life and may enter by the gates into the city.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>The call is in verse 17, which says, Let him who is thirsty come; let him who wills take the water of life freely.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>Thus, the Bible invites us to come to eat and drink.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>If we learn to eat and drink, we will be kept in God s central line, fulfill His purpose, and reach His goal by being filled with Christ.</S>
