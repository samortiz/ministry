   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CONSTITUTED GIFTS</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>It is by His descending and ascending that Christ constitutes us gifts to the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The more He descends and ascends within us, the more we become gifts.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Many brothers and sisters have very little function in the church because they have not yet been constituted as gifts.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>They may be good brothers and sisters, but they are not gifts to the church.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>But as Christ descends and ascends within them, He captures them, vanquishes them, and constitutes them into gifts to His Body.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>As a result of Christ s traveling, they become useful gifts.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>I am concerned, however, that within some of the saints Christ s traveling may have ceased.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>He no longer goes up and down within them.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>I can testify that I have been constituted as a gift to the church through Christ s descending and ascending within me.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Christ has had many ups and downs within me.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>If we try to hold Christ as the Head without allowing Him to descend and ascend within us, we damage the process by which we are constituted gifts.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The Lord will constitute us as gifts only through His descending and ascending within us.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>After such experiences of Christ s inward traveling over a period of time, we become useful in the church.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Allow me to give a word of testimony on behalf of a certain brother whom I met more than twenty years ago.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>At that time, he had not experienced very much of Christ s descending and ascending.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>But this brother s situation is much different today.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Through Christ s descending and ascending within him, he has been constituted into a useful gift to the Lord s recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>He could tell you that especially on the days he is used by the Lord, Christ goes down and up within him.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Christ comes down to where he is and ascends with him into the heavenlies.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Christ truly is a descending and ascending Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>OUR CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>If you consider the verses we have covered in this message, you will see that the Christ we experience in the Lord s recovery is different from the Christ we heard about in religion.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>What a Christ we have!</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>He is the embodiment of God and the content of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Our Christ is the all-inclusive, universal Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>He is far above all, He is unsearchable and immeasurable, and yet He is intimately making His home in our hearts.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Furthermore, our Christ is continually descending and ascending within us.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Because all the fullness of God is in Him, He is the very embodiment of God.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Therefore, as He makes home in our heart, we are filled unto all the fullness of God.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>This Christ who is the embodiment of God is also the very content of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Furthermore, through His descending and ascending He fills all things, universally, vertically, and horizontally.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>We should not focus our attention on ourselves, but on the all-inclusive Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Do not consider how weak or how poor you are.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Rather, think of Christ, speak of Christ, and look away to Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Praise the Lord for the revelation of Christ in God s economy found in the book of Ephesians!</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>This book says little of Christ as the Redeemer or Savior.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>But it does reveal that Christ is far above all and that He is now filling all in all.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Nevertheless, this Christ is available to us.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>He is making His home in our heart, and He is imparting into us His unsearchable riches so that we may be filled unto all the fullness of God.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Eventually, we as the church shall have Christ fully wrought into us as our unique content.</S>
