   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>ANOTHER COMFORTER</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Now we come to another problem.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>How does God dispense His life to us?</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>We have to read John 14:16-20: "And I will ask the Father, and He will give you another Comforter, that He may be with you forever, even the Spirit of reality, whom the world cannot receive, because it does not behold Him or know Him; but you know Him, because He abides with you and shall be in you.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>I will not leave you as orphans; I am coming to you.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Yet a little while and the world beholds Me no longer, but you behold Me; because I live, you also shall live.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>In that day you will know that I am in My Father, and you in Me, and I in you."</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The word "another" means that there was one already, and that this one is now another.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The first Comforter was Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The second Comforter is the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The word "comforter" is paracletos in the original language; it means a helper.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The prefix para means to be alongside, just as the words parallel lines mean two lines that are alongside one another.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>This can be seen from two railway tracks which run alongside one another.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Being parallel means maintaining the same distance all the time and being alongside all the time.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>God has given us a second Comforter, who will be alongside of us forever and help us all the time.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The word "another" also means another in kind, and not just another in number.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Another Comforter does not mean the same kind of comforter.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The kind that the disciples knew could die and leave them; He could not be with them forever.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>But the other kind would not be the same as this kind; the other Comforter would be with them forever.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Verse 17 tells us who the other Comforter is.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The other Comforter is the Holy Spirit, the Spirit of reality, whom the world cannot receive, because it does not behold Him or know Him.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Hence, it was impossible for the world to receive Him.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The other Comforter was different from the Lord, because the other One could be with us forever.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>John 14:17 reveals the difference between the Old Testament and the New Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>In the Old Testament, the Lord could be present with men, but His presence was outward; it was not the kind of presence depicted in the New Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>In the New Testament, the Lord is present within man; He brings His presence into man.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Indeed, this is the real gospel!</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>You and the Lord were two persons.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>But now you and He have become one, because He is present within you.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>THE LORD BEING THE HOLY SPIRIT</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The most mysterious part of this portion of the Word lies in the pronoun He in verse 17, which is changed to the pronoun I in verse 18.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Why is this?</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Please remember that the He is the I and the I is the He.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The Lord Jesus is the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>I am not denying the doctrine of the Trinity.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>I am merely saying that the Lord Himself says that He is the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Today the Lord Jesus is the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>This is like me saying, "A certain man is traveling to Pu-Chien-Ding to preach."</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Then I may go on to say, "I am preaching in Pu-Chien-Ding."</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>What does this mean?</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>This clearly means that the "He" in the first sentence is the "I" in the second sentence.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Hallelujah!</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The Lord Jesus is now the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Paul said that from now on he would no longer know Christ according to the flesh 2 Cor 5:16 .</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>When the Lord Jesus was incarnated and put on flesh, He was immediately limited by time and space.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Suppose the Lord was still in the flesh today, He would not be able to be in Tien-An Chapel if He was in the Savior's Church.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>If He was in the meeting in Ho-si Street, He could not be in the meeting behind the football field.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>If He was in London, He could not be in New York.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>If He was with the three disciples, He could not be with the other nine.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>If He was with the twelve disciples, He could not be with the other fifty-eight disciples.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>If He was with the seventy disciples, He could not be with the one hundred and twenty disciples.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>If He was with the one hundred and twenty, He could not be with the five hundred.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>If the Lord was in Jerusalem, Christians would have to save money to make a pilgrimage once every three or five years to Jerusalem to see Him, just as Muslims make pilgrimages to Mecca.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>But today the Lord is no longer in the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Before His death, He was in the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>He put on a human body in the same way that a man puts on a garment.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>But after His death, He put off the body of flesh and put on the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>The Lord has put off the flesh and put on the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Today He is in the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>This is why He can be in us.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>I have often pondered the completeness of God's salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>It is so complete that He Himself has become available to us.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Today the Lord is in the Spirit, and the Spirit is omnipresent.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Therefore, we can all receive Him.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>In Acts 2 the apostle Peter quoted the last verse of Joel 2, saying, "And it shall be that everyone who calls on the name of the Lord shall be saved" v. 21 . Paul even said that the Lord is near us, in our mouth and in our heart Rom 10:8 . Please remember that the Lord can be such because He is in the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>This is why He can be omnipresent today.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>John 14:18 says, "I am coming to you."</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>This does not refer to His future coming, which will be visible; rather, it refers to His coming in the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Today the Lord has come to us in the Spirit, and He is even dwelling within us.</S>
