   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE BODY LIFE AFTER TRANSFORMATION</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Many Christians cannot differentiate Romans 12 from 1 Corinthians 12.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>To them, Romans 12 and 1 Corinthians 12 are the same, for both speak of the Body life.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Romans 12, however, is much more advanced than 1 Corinthians 12 because the Body life there in Romans 12 comes after transformation.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>After 1 Corinthians 12, we have 2 Corinthians 3, where we find the matter of transformation.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>This indicates that in the two Epistles to the Corinthians transformation is mentioned after the Body life.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>In other words, in the Corinthian Epistles the Body life is practiced before transformation.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>However, Romans 12 is different, because there transformation comes first and then the practice of the Body life follows.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Seemingly, 1 Corinthians 12 and Romans 12 are talking about the same thing.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>But both the condition and the stage are different.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>First Corinthians 12 is before transformation, and Romans 12 is after transformation.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Before transformation, in 1 Corinthians 12, Paul mentioned the miraculous things and gifts such as speaking in tongues and interpretation.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>But after transformation, in Romans 12, he said not a word regarding miracles, healings, tongues, or the interpretation of tongues.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>This indicates that to drop these things is a great advance.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>In 1 Corinthians 12 there are many toys, but in Romans 12 there are no toys.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The more we grow, the fewer toys we have.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The dear ones in 1 Corinthians were very young, still at the age of playing with toys.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>But those described in Romans 12 are more mature, more advanced, and have no toys.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The crucial matter here is transformation.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>To repeat, the church life in 1 Corinthians is before transformation, but the church life in Romans 12 is with transformation.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>This reveals the fact that we need to advance by being transformed so that we may have a solid church life with fewer toys.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>In the childish Body life there are many toys, things such as healings, miracles, and tongues.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>But in the solid church life, in which there has been a good deal of transformation, there will not be many toys.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>We expect that the churches in the Lord's recovery will grow through transformation.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>We all should grow by having Christ written upon us by the life-giving Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Then we shall be epistles full of Christ for others to read.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Furthermore, because Christ has been impressed upon us, we shall reflect Him, and people will see Christ by looking at us.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Thus, we shall be Christ's epistles for people to read and His mirror reflecting Him that others may see Him.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>This is a church life that has advanced in the expression of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>This is a more solid church life, with many who have been transformed for the Body life.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>If we cannot see this today, I expect to see it in the future.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Nevertheless, I hope that even today in all the churches there will be more epistles and mirrors, not only children playing with toys.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Many are in 1 Corinthians playing with toys, but others are in 2 Corinthians.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>They are epistles in which others can read Christ and mirrors reflecting Christ to others.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>This is the Body life.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>We all need to be ambitious to be made long epistles for Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>We need to pray, "Lord, make me a long epistle, even more than two hundred pages long.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Lord, let others read You in me.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Lord, I am ambitious that whenever I come to the meeting, people will see Your reflection in me."</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>If you are such a reflection of Christ, you will not need to stand up or say a word.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Even if you just sit there in the meeting, you will reflect Christ and radiate something of Christ into the whole meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>I have known brothers and sisters whose simple coming and sitting in the meeting uplifts that meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>How the meetings are enriched by their presence!</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>But when they are not present, the meetings are empty.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>We need some saints who enrich the meetings in this way.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>If all the rich ones were taken away from the church, nothing would remain.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>But when the rich ones are in the church life, the church is solid, weighty, and full of life.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>We need the epistles and the mirrors.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>We need a great deal of transformation so that we can be transferred from 1 Corinthians 12 to Romans 12.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>The Body life must advance from 1 Corinthians 12 to Romans 12 through the process of transformation.</S>
