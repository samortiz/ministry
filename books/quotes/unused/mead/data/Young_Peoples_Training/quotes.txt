[1]  In these messages of the young people s training we all must see a heavenly vision.
[2]  He came to God s people, a people who had the holy Scriptures, who worshipped in God s temple, and who offered the sacrifices according to God s divine regulations.
[3]  Acts 26 is also set against the background of the Jewish religion.
[4]  In verse 17 the Lord said that He would deliver Saul from the people unto whom He would send him.
[5]  The word people in this verse does not refer to mankind but to the Jewish people, the religious people.
[6]  Saul was zealous for God according to the traditional religion, but he was persecuting the church of Christ and opposing God s economy.
[7]  The complete, perfect, whole gospel is found here: to open people s eyes and to turn them from darkness to light and from the authority of Satan to God, that they may receive forgiveness of sins, be sanctified by faith, and enjoy the common portion of the saints to have the church life.
[8]  In Galatians 1:11-16 we also see the religious background of the revelation of Christ in Paul s experience.
[9]  In Galatians 1:13 and 14 Paul says that he persecuted the church of God and profited in Judaism, being exceedingly zealous of the traditions of his fathers.
[10]  In this message I am burdened to share with you the two main aspects of the Lord s recovery today.
[11]  As you are preparing to do a work among the young people, you must know what the Lord s recovery is.
[12]  And just so the Spirit of God as poured out at Pentecost was indeed something new....When poured out at Pentecost, He came as the Spirit of the glorified Jesus, the Spirit of the Incarnate, crucified, and exalted Christ, the bearer and communicator to us, not of the life of God as such, but of the life as it had been interwoven into human nature in the person of Christ Jesus....Christ came not only to deliver man from the law and its curse, but to bring human nature again into the fellowship of the Divine life, to make us partakers of the Divine nature....In His own person, having become flesh, He had to sanctify the flesh, and make it a meet and willing receptacle for the indwelling of the Spirit of God....From His nature, as it was glorified in the resurrection and ascension, His Spirit came forth as the Spirit of His human life, glorified into the union with the Divine, to make us partakers of all that He had personally wrought out and acquired, of Himself and His glorified life....And in virtue of His having perfected in Himself a new holy human nature on our behalf, He could now communicate what previously had no existence a life at once human and Divine.
[13]  The Christ whom we experience is not as low as the Christ preached in today s Christianity.
[14]  In the Lord s recovery we do experience a different Christ.
[15]  Years ago, someone in Hong Kong condemned me, saying that I preach another Christ.
[16]  Christ is virtually the Spirit, inasmuch as He communicates Himself in conversion, and at other times by means of the Spirit; the Holy Spirit is His spirit; the animating principle of the Lord s indwelling and influence in the hearts of believers is this Holy Spirit...But such a virtual identification of Christ and the Spirit can have reference only to Christ in His state of exaltation comp.
[17]  Through the Spirit of Christ, through whom the glorified Lord comes to His Church and sees as with eyes of flame and works and speaks, is neither the human spirit of Christ, nor the pre-existent Logos who was made flesh, yet it is so absolutely one in will and thought with the Divine-Human Christ that Christ is still in the Spirit present and at work on earth, dwelling in men and revealing Himself to them after a manner more expedient for them than if He were still visibly in their midst.
[18]  The central and crucial line in the Bible is that Christ is everything to us.
[19]  The Lord Jesus today is the all-inclusive Spirit in our spirit.
[20]  Our only need is to give ourselves to Him, to love Him, to live by Him, and to take Him as our life, our person, and our everything.
[21]  If you are a husband and are about to speak to your wife, you must be sure that in your speaking you take Christ as life.
[22]  We have Christ s life with His nature in us as the regulating law, and we also have His person, the life-giving Spirit, indwelling us as the anointing.
[23]  Now we come to the second aspect of the Lord s recovery today the practice of the proper church life.
[24]  The genuine experience of Christ always issues in and demands the church life.
[25]  The more you experience Christ, the more something within requires that you live in the proper church life.
[26]  But once we experience Christ in a genuine and living way, He will require us to get into the church life because the dispensation of Christ into us is for the producing of the church.
[27]  The Bible clearly reveals that God s purpose is to work Christ into His chosen people so that they might be the members of His Body, which, in this age, is expressed in many localities.
[28]  If we have a heart to mean business with the Lord, then we must have a clear vision concerning Christ and the church.
[29]  When we speak of a vision concerning Christ, we do not mean Christ in a doctrinal or theological way; we mean Christ in our experience.
[30]  We all must see a clear vision of the church.
[31]  The church is simply the expression of the Body of Christ on the proper ground with the experience of Christ.
[32]  The proper ground of the church includes two aspects.
[33]  Every local church must be genuinely one in its locality, and every local church must be in fellowship with all the churches throughout the world, because all the churches are the one Body of Christ.
[34]  If we say that we are a local church but do not care for the other churches, we immediately lose the ground of the proper church life and become a local sect, a division in the Body.
[35]  Both Romans 8:4 and Galatians 5:16 speak of walking according to the spirit.
[36]  We must walk according to the regenerated spirit that is indwelt by Christ.
[37]  According to the Greek, the word walk means to live, to do things, to behave ourselves, and to have our being.
[38]  Thus, we must live, behave, and have our being, not according to culture, custom, or even according to the Bible in dead letters, but according to our spirit indwelt by Christ.
[39]  In 1 Corinthians 4:21 Paul says, What will ye? shall I come unto you with a rod, or in love, and in the spirit of meekness?
[40]  By reading this verse we realize that Paul was a person who truly walked in the spirit.
[41]  According to 1 Corinthians 5:3-5, Paul could even attend a church meeting in his spirit when he was not physically present.
[42]  In 1 Corinthians 5:4 he said, In the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, when ye are gathered together, and my spirit.
[43]  His desire is that a group of His chosen people would practice the real church life with His Christ.
[44]  As you go to do a work among the young people, go praying.
[45]  Although you may not have much time to pray privately in your room, you can still pray at every moment.
[46]  Pray to the Lord about the chosen ones, saying, Lord, give me Your chosen people.
[47]  As you pray in this way, you must believe that the Lord will give them to you, granting you the proper people whom He has chosen for His purpose in eternity past.
[48]  In the first three Gospels the Lord Jesus charged His disciples to preach the gospel, to teach the nations, and to baptize them into the name of the Father, the Son, and the Spirit Matt 28:19-20; Mark 16:15; Luke 24:47 .
[49]  In the Gospel of John, however, the Lord Jesus did not charge His disciples in this way.
[50]  In John 15:1 the Lord said, I am the true vine, and My Father is the husbandman, and in John 15:5 He said, I am the vine, you are the branches.
[51]  Not many Christians have seen that in the Gospel of John the Father is expressed in the Son, the Son is realized as the Spirit, and the Spirit is expressed through all the branches.
[52]  The Spirit, who is the reality of the Son, now expresses Himself through all the branches in fruit-bearing.
[53]  With this as a basic concept, let us consider some other matters.
[54]  If we are not concerned about the preaching of the gospel, we simply do not care for it at all.
[55]  When we contact people, we must be able to enter into their situation and condition.
[56]  Colossians 1:24-29 is a profound portion of the Word.
[57]  In this message we need to look into the depths of this portion of the Word.
[58]  In Colossians 1:24 Paul said, Who now rejoice in my sufferings for you, and fill up that which is lacking of the sufferings of Christ in my flesh for his body s sake, which is the church Gk.
[59]  Colossians 1:25 says, Whereof I am made a minister, according to the economy of God which is given to me for you, to complete the word of God Gk.
[60]  . There is a difference between a preacher and a minister.
[61]  A preacher preaches doctrine, and a minister ministers Christ.
[62]  Some of my friends have advised me, saying, Brother Lee, don t say that Christ is the life-giving Spirit.
[63]  If you say this, many Christians will be offended.
[64]  Twelve years ago, before I gave a series of messages that were later printed as the book, The Economy of God, a friend of mine advised me in this manner, saying, The Bible says that Christ is the life-giving Spirit.
[65]  But if you say that Christ is the life-giving Spirit, you will offend people.
[66]  In Colossians 1:28 and 29 Paul, speaking of Christ, says, Whom we preach, admonishing every man, and teaching every man in all wisdom; that we may present every man mature in Christ; whereunto I also labor, struggling according to his operation, which operates in me in power Gk.
[67]  . Paul s desire was to present every man mature in Christ.
[68]  When a man is mature in Christ, he is qualified to be presented to God.
[69]  Thus, you must help them, through the study of typology, to see the holy ointment which is a compound of various spices Exo 30:22-33 .
[70]  CHAPTER SIX THE PURE REVELATION OF THE TRIUNE GOD 1
[71]  In the last five messages, we have pointed out that in the Lord s recovery we preach the gospel for the purpose that God might gain what He desires.
[72]  God desires that a group of His chosen people would experience Christ subjectively in a full way.
[73]  This experience of Christ is not for religion, but for the proper church life, for the expression of Christ as the centrality and universality of God s economy.
[74]  The recovery today is of two main items: the experience of Christ and the proper church life.
[75]  The recovery is not concerned with the objective knowledge of Christ for the doctrine of religion, but with the subjective experience of Christ for the practical church life.
[76]  Any healthy mind would understand that the mighty God must refer to the child and that the everlasting Father must refer to the Son.
[77]  As no one would twist the words child or son, no one twists the name mighty God.
[78]  I do not care how some twist this verse or how they interpret the word Father as the everlasting Father, the Father of eternity, the eternal Father, the Father that begot eternity, the Father of creation, the Father of Israel, the Father of some invention, or the Father of the age to come, as indicated by the footnote in a version of the Septuagint He is the Father, and no one can deny that He is the Father.
[79]  Do you believe that besides the divine Father of the Godhead there is another divine Father?
[80]  This message is the continuation of the previous one.
[81]  Some may wonder how, if the Son and the Father are one, the Son can pray to the Father.
[82]  Verse 11 of this chapter says, And the angel of God spake unto me in a dream, saying, Jacob: And I said, Here am I. In verse 13, the angel of God says, I am the God of Bethel.
[83]  Throughout the centuries, many great teachers have attempted to reconcile the two aspects of the Triune God.
[84]  Or else, on account of their ineffable union these three are together one God, why not also one Person; so that we could not say three Persons, although we call each a Person singly, just as we can not say three Gods, although we call each singly God, whether the Father, or the Son, or the Holy Spirit?
[85]  First John 3:24 says, He that keepeth his commandments abideth in him, and he in him ASV .
[86]  Abideth in him means to abide in God, and He in him means that God abides in us.
[87]  The remainder of this verse says, And hereby we know that he abideth in us, by the Spirit whom he hath given us.
[88]  In Exodus 30:22-25, Moses was told to take four of the finest spices myrrh, cinnamon, calamus, and cassia and add them to a hin of olive oil to make a holy anointing oil.
[89]  Verses 25 and 26 say, It shall be an holy anointing oil.
[90]  We need to quote these verses: Now on the last day, the great day of the feast, Jesus stood and cried out, saying, If anyone thirsts, let him come to Me and drink.
[91]  But this He said concerning the Spirit, whom those who believed into Him were about to receive; for the Spirit was not yet, because Jesus had not yet been glorified.
[92]  In the past, I never used such terms as processed God or raw God.
[93]  In these messages we have seen that the Lord s recovery today is concerned with two main items: the full experience of Christ in our spirit and the practical church life.
[94]  In the more than half century since 1922, the enemy has not ceased to attack the Lord s recovery.
[95]  During the past years in the United States, the attacks have always been on two points the Spirit and the ground of the church.
[96]  The enemy has tried his best to defeat us regarding the Spirit for our experience and the church ground for our practice.
[97]  However, when the Lord Jesus said in Matthew 18:17, Tell it unto the church, He was referring, not to the universal church, but to a local church to which we can go.
[98]  Although many Christians are talking about the church, we must ask them where their church is.
[99]  Most Christians do not dare say that the church is in the Roman Catholic Church or in any of the denominations.
[100]  Fifty years ago, they might have had the boldness to say this, but not today, because the light of the truth is shining in the darkness, and eyes are being opened to see that Catholicism and the denominations certainly are not the church.
[101]  Neither would anyone have the boldness to claim that a free group is the church.
[102]  In Christianity there is a great deal of vain talk, especially regarding the church, but little of this talk is practical.
[103]  According to the revelation of the New Testament, the church, the Body of Christ, is expressed in the local churches.
[104]  If you do not have the local church, you do not have the church.
[105]  God is expressed in Christ, Christ is expressed in the church, and the church is expressed in the local churches.
[106]  Suppose you meet someone who accuses us of being a cult and of being heretical.
[107]  Do not be offended by him or lose your patience.
[108]  Rather, remain open and ask him to give you all the points and definitions.
[109]  In this message and in the messages following we turn to the matter of the reality and practicality of the church.
[110]  We are not concerned with the church in doctrine or merely with the church in revelation, but with the church in reality and practicality.
[111]  However, in order to see the reality and practicality of the church, we must have a clear revelation concerning the church.
[112]  I am especially burdened to help those who have recently come into the church life to see what the church is and to know the church s reality and practicality in the Lord s recovery today.
[113]  In the past we received the help to be saved, and afterwards we were taught to improve our behavior.
[114]  All this is good, and I do not find fault with it.
[115]  Let us now consider the various aspects of the church unfolded in the book of Ephesians.
[116]  Ephesians 1:5 says, Having predestinated us unto sonship through Jesus Christ to himself, according to the good pleasure of his will Gk.
[117]  The sonship to which we, the chosen ones of God, have been predestinated is a blessing in the divine life that we might enjoy the church.
[118]  In His resurrection, the Lord Jesus, the only begotten Son of God, was born to be the firstborn Son of God.
[119]  The book of Ephesians also reveals that the church is the family of God Eph 2:19 .
[120]  If you are not in the sonship, you do not belong to the family because the family is based upon the sonship.
[121]  The church is also Christ s counterpart, His wife Eph 5:25-27, 32 .
[122]  The church as the counterpart of Christ implies satisfaction and rest in love.
[123]  If we say that we are the church, then we must ask if Christ has His rest among us.
[124]  CHAPTER TEN GOD S WAY TO BUILD UP THE CHURCH
[125]  Matthew 28:19 says, Go ye therefore, and disciple all nations, baptizing them into the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit Gk.
[126]  . Although you might have read this verse many times, perhaps you have never realized that it is related to the building up of the church.
[127]  In Matthew 16:18 the Lord Jesus said, Upon this rock I will build my church.
[128]  But how does the Lord build up His church?
[129]  If we are careful, thoughtful, and logical readers, when we read in Matthew 16:18 that the Lord Jesus will build His church, we should immediately ask about the way the Lord builds His church.
[130]  It implies that we are prepared and positioned to let God come into us.
[131]  The extent of the reality of the church life we possess depends upon the degree to which we have been perfected into one.
[132]  It all depends on how much we have been transformed by the Triune God and even with the Triune God.
[133]  THE UNITY OF THE SPIRIT IN THE ONE BODY
[134]  According to Ephesians 4:3, this oneness is the unity of the Spirit.
[135]  The Spirit is the reality of the person of the Triune God.
[136]  The name denotes the person, and the reality of the person of the divine Being is the Spirit.
[137]  Ephesians 4:5 says, One Lord, one faith, one baptism.
[138]  OF THE CHURCH A GENERAL SKETCH OF THE REVELATION
[139]  Those in the local churches have come from all directions to be in the flow.
[140]  Praise the Lord that we all have been gathered in!
[141]  We may apply this principle to today s Christianity.
[142]  There is nearly no church flow on earth today because most Christians have been carried away by different teachings.
[143]  Up until this point, we have been dealing with the reality of the church.
[144]  Now we must go on to consider the practicality of the church.
[145]  I have known some dear ones who have truly seen the reality of the church, but who were not clear about the practicality of the church.
[146]  As we have pointed out elsewhere, the local churches are the destination of God s revelation and manifestation.
[147]  Hence, if you reject the local church, you lose both the practicality of the church and the destination of God s revelation and manifestation.
[148]  In teaching children, we often firstly show them a picture and then give them a clear word.
[149]  God also commanded that the top portion of the produce of the good land be eaten in the place He had chosen.
[150]  Regarding the enjoyment of the produce of the good land, God seemed to say, When you enter into the land, you must keep aside the top portion of your crops and your herds.
[151]  After the death of Solomon, the kingdom of David was divided.
[152]  As you contact other Christians, you must be calm and sober and ask them two important questions.
[153]  Firstly, ask them why they have different names that cannot be found in the Bible.
[154]  CHAPTER THIRTEEN THE UNIQUE PLACE FOR GOD S NAME
[155]  As we pointed out in the last message, the Bible gives us a wonderful picture in the Old Testament.
[156]  After the children of Israel had passed through the Red Sea, they found themselves in the wilderness.
[157]  Like the children of Israel, many of us still remembered the taste of garlic, onions, and leeks when we were in the wilderness after we had made our exodus out of Egypt Num 11:5 .
[158]  Now we must consider the meaning of this requirement.
[159]  In the previous message we pointed out that the Passover lamb was a type of Christ and that manna was a type of Christ as our food.
[160]  In Egypt the children of Israel enjoyed Christ as signified by the Passover lamb.
[161]  Although there are thousands of places on earth, there is just one place the church where God s name and God s habitation are.
[162]  Some of you were formerly in the Catholic Church.
[163]  Did you enjoy the top portion of Christ while you were there?
[164]  Remember that what is found in the Old Testament is a type and that what is found in the New Testament is the reality.
[165]  The reality of the name is the Spirit, and the reality of the habitation is our human spirit.
[166]  When she asked Him about the worship of God, saying, Our fathers worshipped in this mountain, and you say that in Jerusalem is the place where men must worship John 4:20 , He said, Woman, believe Me, an hour is coming when neither in this mountain nor in Jerusalem shall you worship the Father...But an hour is coming, and now is, when the true worshippers shall worship the Father in spirit and reality John 4:21, 23 .
[167]  When the Samaritan woman asked about the place of worship, the Lord clearly indicated that the hour has come to worship the Father in spirit.
[168]  That the hour has come means that the age has changed.
[169]  In the age of reality it is no longer a matter of a material place, but of the human spirit in which all true worshippers of God may contact Him.
[170]  Since today s Jerusalem is not a material site, but our human spirit mingled with the Holy Spirit, some may wonder why there is still a difference between our enjoyment of Christ in our private life and our enjoyment of Him in the church life.
[171]  The difference is that in our private life we enjoy Christ by our own spirit, but in the church life we enjoy Him by our spirit mingled with the Holy Spirit in a corporate way.
[172]  CHAPTER FOURTEEN SIX TESTS OF A GENUINE LOCAL CHURCH
[173]  In the past several messages we have covered the reality and practicality of the church.
[174]  We have seen that the church is one in substance, one in existence, and one in manifestation.
[175]  Apart from God, nothing in the universe is more one than the church.
[176]  A division is called a denomination because it has been denominated by a particular name.
[177]  Hence, the first factor of a denomination is a special name.
[178]  Some groups do not have a name, but they have a particular teaching that produces a particular fellowship.
[179]  For example, some groups believe that all the saints will be raptured before the great tribulation.
[180]  Anyone who does not hold this concept must repent of his doctrine before he can fellowship with this group.
[181]  We receive those who speak in tongues and those who do not speak in tongues; those who have been immersed and those who have been sprinkled; those who wear a head covering and those who do not wear a head covering; those who practice foot-washing and those who do not practice foot-washing.
[182]  In fact, we would receive even Catholic nuns and priests who are true believers in the Lord Jesus.
[183]  We would encourage them all to go on by loving the Lord, by growing in His life, and by realizing the proper church life to satisfy the desire of God s heart.
[184]  One other factor is a test of a genuine local church.
[185]  There may be a Christian group that has no particular name, no particular fellowship, and no particular teaching.
[186]  Although they pass all these tests, do not be quick to say that they are a true local church.
[187]  Suppose the total number of Christians in Corinth was a thousand, with two hundred fifty in the church of Paul, three hundred fifty in the church of Apollos, one hundred twenty-five in the church of Cephas, one hundred in the church of Christ, and the remainder, seventy-five, in the church in Corinth.
[188]  Due to the division and scattering among today s Christians, not all Christians are the church.
[189]  In these messages we have covered various crucial matters pertaining to the church.
[190]  If you are simply religious, ethical, and moral, you may say, As long as we love Jesus, behave ourselves, and love others, it does not matter if we are in the Catholic Church, in the denominations, in the free groups, or in the charismatic movement.
[191]  As long as we all believe in the Lord Jesus and know that we are going to heaven, everything is all right.
[192]  Although you may say that everything is all right, God would not agree with you.
[193]  Let me now share a word concerning the book, The Normal Christian Church Life.
[194]  We have seen that the church is a genuine oneness.
[195]  The church is absolutely one in substance, both universally and locally.
[196]  Because the church is one, nothing that is of a divisive nature can be the church.
[197]  Let us now consider the picture of the recovery of the proper ground in Jerusalem after the dispersion.
[198]  As we have pointed out already, many Christian teachers neglect the significance in typology of the history of Israel after their captivity in Babylon.
[199]  Now we need to consider further the question of motive.
[200]  When it comes to the church, we must have a pure motive, seeking nothing for ourselves.
[201]  Our motive must be singly for the Lord s recovery.
