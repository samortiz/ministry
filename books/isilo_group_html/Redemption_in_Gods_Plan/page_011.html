<p>Before we were born, we were condemned (John 3:18). Our condemnation is not based on a particular sin that we committed. We were condemned in Adam even before we were born. Such a condemnation is the result of Adam&rsquo;s one offense (Rom. 5:17-18).</p>
<h2 class="head2">Having a Sinful Nature</h2>
<p>We were born sinners with a sinful nature because we were born, came out, of Adam, who had a sinful nature. Let us return to the example of ink and plain water. If I pour the black water into many small cups, the water in each cup will still be black. We do not need to pour black ink into every small cup. The large cup that contains black water can be likened to Adam, and the small cups with water can be likened to the descendants of Adam. Adam had a sinful nature, and the billions of people that came out of him have the same sinful nature. We are just like Adam. We are exactly the same as he, because we came out of him. Hence, no person in the world is without sin. Every person has the sinful nature. No one is without sin; no one is pure. We were born sinners with a sinful nature; hence, we are capable of sinning.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Being Dead</h2>
<p>We were born dead, because our spirit was deadened. Although we were born with a human spirit, it was deadened. It lost its function, so we could not understand the things of God or fellowship with Him. For example, the ears of a deaf person have lost their function and cannot hear sounds, and the eyes of a blind person have lost their function and cannot see colors. We could not understand the things of God or know God, because our spirit was deadened. When our spirit was deadened, our body also lost its sustaining power, and as a result, our body gradually becomes weak, old, and sick and eventually dies. If a person who is not saved dies, his soul will be tormented in Hades. Eventually, his entire being will suffer the second death. Strictly speaking, after we were born, we have been dying every day, not living. Through Adam&rsquo;s fall we are in the place of death. Hence, the Bible says, &ldquo;By the offense of the one the many died,&rdquo; &ldquo;by the offense of the one, death reigned,&rdquo; and &ldquo;in Adam all die&rdquo; (vv. 15, 17; 1 Cor. 15:22).</p>
<h2 class="head2">Having Knowledge of Good and Evil</h2>
<p>We were born with the knowledge of good and evil. Regardless of whether a person is civilized or a barbarian, he is born with the knowledge of good and evil and the ability to discern right from wrong. This knowledge proves that all mankind has participated in Adam&rsquo;s fall and in the consequences of Adam&rsquo;s fall. The knowledge of good and evil entered into mankind through Adam&rsquo;s fall. Adam passed down to his descendants not only sin and death but also the knowledge of good and evil. The knowledge of good and evil causes man&rsquo;s spirit to be independent from God. People are controlled by the knowledge of good and evil instead of by God. They are accountable to the knowledge of good and evil instead of to God. They seem to know good and evil but not God. People pay attention to good and evil and to right and wrong, but they do not have the power to refuse evil or to do good, nor do they pay attention to God. As a result, they commit sins and do evil. People live by the knowledge of good and evil because they are fallen.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Being Cast Out from God&rsquo;s Presence</h2>
<p>We were born far from God (Eph. 2:12-13). We were born after Adam was cast out of the garden of Eden, and we were born outside of the garden of Eden. When Adam was cast out of the garden of Eden, his descendants, who were included in him, were also cast out of the garden of Eden. None of Adam&rsquo;s descendants were born in the garden of Eden. Before we were born, we were already cast out of Eden, out of God&rsquo;s presence. We were born outside of God&rsquo;s presence and far from God.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE WAY TO THE TREE OF LIFE BEING CLOSED</h2>
<p>After Adam ate the fruit of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, God closed the way to the tree of life. Genesis 3:22 says, &ldquo;Lest he put forth his hand and take also from the tree of life and eat and live forever.&rdquo; This indicates that Adam had not yet eaten the fruit of the tree of life and that God did not want fallen man with his evil nature to eat the fruit of the tree of life. God&rsquo;s original intention was for man to eat the fruit of the tree of life in order to gain the eternal life of God, but man received Satan&rsquo;s evil life and nature by eating the fruit of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil. Hence, God did not want man to eat the fruit of the tree of life without dealing with his evil nature. If man ate of the tree of life, he would live forever with this evil nature. Closing the way to the tree of life was not an ill intent on God&rsquo;s part; it was a good intention toward man until He could deal with man&rsquo;s evil nature through the cross of Christ.</p>
<p>God placed &ldquo;the cherubim and a flaming sword which turned in every direction to guard the way to the tree of life&rdquo; (v. 24). The cherubim signify God&rsquo;s glory (Ezek. 9:3; 10:4; Heb. 9:5), and the flame signifies God&rsquo;s holiness. God must burn anything that does not match His holy nature (Deut. 4:24; 9:3; Heb. 12:29). The sword indicates God&rsquo;s righteousness. God cannot pardon anything that does not match His righteousness (Lam. 3:42-43; Rom. 2:5; 2 Thes. 1:5-6; Rev. 19:2, 11). After man sinned, the way to the tree of life was closed due to God&rsquo;s righteousness, holiness, and glory. God&rsquo;s intention was for man to contact the tree of life and receive the life of God, but because of his sin, man violated God&rsquo;s righteousness, contradicted God&rsquo;s holiness, and fell short of God&rsquo;s glory (Rom. 3:23). Therefore, God used His righteousness, holiness, and glory to close the way to the tree of life, thus preventing man from receiving His righteous, holy, and glorious life. In order for the way to the tree of life to be opened, God&rsquo;s righteousness must be satisfied, His holiness must be matched, and His glory must be manifested. The way to the tree of life remained closed until the Lord Jesus accomplished redemption. When the Lord Jesus accomplished redemption, He satisfied God&rsquo;s righteousness, matched God&rsquo;s holiness, and manifested God&rsquo;s glory. This opened the way to the tree of life.</p>
<p>The tree of life signifies God. Therefore, when the way to the tree of life was closed, the way to God was closed. Although God desired to contact man, His righteousness, holiness, and glory prevented sinful man from contacting Him. This was clearly portrayed when the children of Israel received God&rsquo;s law at Mount Sinai. The children of Israel were in fear of contacting God at Mount Sinai because of His righteousness, holiness, and glory (Exo. 19:20-24). The way that leads to the righteous, holy, and glorious God was closed until the Lord Jesus came and shed His blood to accomplish redemption. Only then was a way opened for man to approach God (Heb. 10:19-20; Matt. 27:50-51).</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_010.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_012.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Redemption in God's Plan &nbsp; pg 11</div><br></body></html>
