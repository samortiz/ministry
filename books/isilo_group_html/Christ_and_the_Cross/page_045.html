<h1 class="title">THE CROSS AND THE CHURCH</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Matt. 16:16-18, 21-25; Eph. 2:14-15; Col. 3:9-11</h1>
<h2 class="head1">THE CHURCH BEING OUT OF CHRIST</h2>
<p>In a previous chapter we saw that the church is out of Christ. The church comes out of Christ and is a part of Christ, just as Eve came out of Adam and was a part of Adam. Anything that was not of Adam was not Eve. In the same way, anything that is not of Christ is not the church. Eve was built out of Adam&rsquo;s rib, a part of Adam (Gen. 2:21-23), and the church is built out of Christ&rsquo;s resurrection life, a part of Christ (John 19:34-36). When Peter received a revelation from God that the Lord Jesus was &ldquo;the Christ, the Son of the living God,&rdquo; the Lord told Peter that He would build the church upon Himself as the rock (Matt. 16:16-18). The Lord builds the church through His resurrection life, and the church that is built upon Him is one with Him because of His resurrection life. The resurrection life of Christ is just Christ Himself.</p>
<p>On the cross Christ released His resurrection life in order to produce the church. As a result, the church shares one life with Christ and is a part of Christ. This is the way that the church is built upon Christ and is one with Him. Eve was one with Adam because she was built from Adam&rsquo;s rib, which was just Adam. Eve was part of Adam, out of Adam, and shared one life with Adam. Only that which was out of Adam could be joined to him, and only that which was of Adam could become one flesh with him. Likewise, only that which is out of Christ can be joined to Christ and built upon Christ, and only that which is of Christ can be one with Christ. Without Adam there would be no Eve, and without Christ there would be no church. A rib had to be taken out of Adam in order for Eve to be built. Similarly, Christ&rsquo;s life had to be released in order for the church to be produced.</p>
<p>May God give us the spiritual vision to see that the church is absolutely out of Christ. The church is the fullness of Christ, the overflow of Christ, and, thus, a part of Christ. The church can be built upon Christ and joined as one to Christ because the church is built with the resurrection life of Christ. In order to know the church, the nature of the church, and the relationship between the cross and the church, we must see that the church is produced by Christ&rsquo;s resurrection life and constituted with Christ. Then we will comprehend the necessity of the cross in relation to the existence of the church.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE CHURCH BEING PRODUCED<br />
THROUGH THE CROSS</h2>
<p>The life that produced the church was released through the cross. The church is out of Christ, and it is produced through the cross. The church was brought forth in Christ&rsquo;s resurrection life, but the church was produced through Christ&rsquo;s death on the cross. Christ produced the church with His life through His death on the cross. If we only had the life of Christ, the church could not come into being. In order for the church to come into existence, there was the need for Christ&rsquo;s death on the cross. The life of Christ had to pass through death on the cross before it could be released to produce the church.</p>
<p>In Matthew 16, after the disciples heard that He was the Christ, the Lord told them that He had to pass through the death on the cross in order for the church to come out of Him and be built upon Him (vv. 15-18, 21). After Peter confessed that the Lord was the Christ, the Lord said that He would build the church upon Himself. This means that the church would come out of Him, be joined to Him, and be one with Him. After this revelation the Lord spoke to the disciples about the cross on many occasions (20:18-19; 26:2). The church was born of Christ and built upon Him, but He had to pass through death on the cross in order for His life to be released for the producing of the church. In order for His life to be released, Christ had to die on the cross. This is the reason that He spoke of the cross after speaking of the producing and the building of the church. The church cannot be produced or built without the cross. In a sense, it is not sufficient to have Christ; we need the cross as well. For its existence the church needs Christ and the cross. Christ could produce the church because He released His life through His death on the cross.</p>
<p>Eve came out of Adam after he fell asleep and his side was opened. Eve was built from Adam&rsquo;s rib, but Adam had to fall asleep, and his side had to be opened in order for a rib to be taken from him. Adam&rsquo;s sleep typifies Christ&rsquo;s death, but not in its redemptive aspect. Christ had to die, and His side had to be opened so that the church could be produced. Adam&rsquo;s rib had to be taken out of him in order to build Eve, and Christ&rsquo;s life had to be released from within Him in order to produce the church. Adam slept in order for Eve to be brought forth, and Christ died for the church to be produced. A rib was taken out of Adam so that it could be built into Eve, and life flowed out from Christ so that it could produce the church.</p>
<p>The church was produced by Christ through the cross. Without Christ there would be no church, but without the cross there still would be no church. The church cannot be separated from Christ, and the producing of the church cannot be separated from the cross. The church is out of Christ and dependent on Christ, but the church was produced through the cross. The church came out of the life of Christ, but this life had to pass through death on the cross. The church was produced by Christ&rsquo;s life passing through death on the cross. In order to know the church, we need to know Christ and we need to know the cross. In order to see the church and live in its reality, we need to know Christ and the cross.</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_044.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_046.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Christ and the Cross &nbsp; pg 45</div><br></body></html>
