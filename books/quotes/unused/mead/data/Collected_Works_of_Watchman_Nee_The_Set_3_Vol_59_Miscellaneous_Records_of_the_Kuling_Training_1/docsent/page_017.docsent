   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER SIX QUESTION-AND-ANSWER SESSION 1 Date:Morning, May 29, 1948</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Place:Customs Lane, Foochow</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Brother Hsie: Is the outer man broken and dealt with by God through one great blow, or is this accomplished through a gradual process?</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Watchman Nee: Our outer man is broken because it is a hindrance to God's work, not because it has done something wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>We cannot hasten God's work, but we can certainly delay His work.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>A man may or may not know if his outer man is broken, but others surely know, just as anyone touching a saved person knows whether or not he is saved.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Of course, the one doing the touching must be saved before he can discern whether or not others are saved.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>God breaks us gradually step by step.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>He works on us until our outer man is no longer whole and hard.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>God has to bring us through one, ten, or even twenty breakings.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>One day the breaking will be complete; our outer, hard shell will be completely gone.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>We can delay God's work, but we can never hasten His work.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>All we have to do is condemn our peculiarities, commit ourselves to the faithful God, and look to Him for mercy.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>THE DISTINCTION</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>BETWEEN THE HEART AND THE SPIRIT</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Question: What is the difference between the heart and the spirit?</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>What is the difference between an evil heart and a wrong spirit?</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Answer: The main thing about the heart is our motives.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>There are many evil things in the heart, such as pride, jealousy, and hatred.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>If our heart is proud, our spirit will be defiled when it passes through such a heart.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Our heart contains all kinds of terrible things like pride, jealousy, and greed.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The spirit does not contain evil things like the heart does.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>But when the spirit moves through the heart, it is contaminated and colored by the tainted elements of the heart.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The spirit itself certainly does not have such elements, but in its release, the pride that is in the heart attaches itself to the spirit, and the spirit becomes a proud spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Sometimes the jealousy in one's heart is attached to the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>When the spirit is released, it becomes a spirit of jealousy.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>If a man is humble and meek in his heart, he will appear to others as having a humble spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>If the heart is not right, the spirit is not necessarily touched.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>However, the mouth speaks out of the abundance of the heart.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>When we say that a man has an improper spirit, we are actually saying that he has improper things in his heart, and that these things flow out with his spirit when he speaks or moves.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>When the spirit moves, it conveys various characteristic colors.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>These colors come from the heart.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>If a man is evil in some way, his spirit will convey this evil to others.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Therefore, we know a person's heart by his spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Question: How can we tell the difference between an unbeliever's spirit and a believer's spirit?</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Answer: The spirit of an unbeliever is dead toward God; it does not function in that regard.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>As for the nature of their spirit, we can distinguish it by the outward attitude unbelievers display.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>We know their spirit by their attitude.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The same cannot be said of believers.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>A brother may have a right attitude, but the spirit that flows out may be wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>We should know a saved brother by his spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>As for unbelievers, we can discern their spirit from the attitude they display.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>It is hard to discern their spirit by any other means.</S>
