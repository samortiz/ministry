   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Before the Lord we need a stricken spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>What is a stricken spirit?</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Since the spirit is expressed through the feelings, a stricken spirit has the feeling of being stricken.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The Lord desires that we live in a stricken spirit; He desires that our feelings be fine and tender.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Such tender feelings are not in us; we acquire them through being stricken.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The Lord wants us to live in a stricken spirit, which means that He wants us to have the feeling of being stricken.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>We should be so broken by the Lord that the feeling of His chastisement is fresh with us, and His discipline should still be fresh in our memory.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The Lord has to work on us so much that we fear and tremble in our feeling, that we no longer dare to be cavalier or lazy.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Every time God works on us, chastises us, and deals with us, our feelings become finer and more sensitive.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>This is the deepest lesson in the breaking of the outward man.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The breaking of the feelings may not be as drastic as the breaking of the will and the mind, but it is much deeper.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>If we live in a stricken spirit and if there is a wound in us, we feel the pain.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>This pain spontaneously makes us fearful; our feelings are refined by the pain.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>As we are dealt with repeatedly, we become genuinely happy when our hearts are happy and genuinely sad when our hearts are sad.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>When God's word comes to us again, we will sense the feelings of the word, and our feelings will match the word.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>This is a glorious thing.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The purpose of chastisement is to make us compatible with God's word.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>When He speaks or expresses a desire again, our feelings will match His feelings.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The Lord is disciplining us.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>He repeatedly tries us until we have a wound and a scar in our body.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>We were once coarse and insensitive, but after discipline, we begin to have feelings.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>As soon as God's word comes, we feel something.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>As soon as He moves, we are sensitive to it.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>At least during the period immediately after our discipline we can match God's word.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>As the Lord increases His discipline in us, we are broken, and all our feelings come up to His standard.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>A minister of the word must come up to the standard of the Lord's word in all his feelings.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>After we have gone through such discipline in our feelings, we discover one interesting thing: We not only speak God's word, but we feel His word as well.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>What we feel inwardly is expressed outwardly.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Peter "lifted up his voice" when he spoke at Pentecost Acts 2:14 .</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>He lifted his voice because his feelings were strong.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>I am afraid some of us have never lifted up our voice in our speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The only explanation is that our feelings are not strong enough.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Peter was full of feelings as he spoke, and because his feelings were so strong, he was able to lift up his voice when he spoke.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>God's word has feelings, and it does not come out like words from a dictating machine.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>It is pressed out by strong feelings.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Paul exhorted the church in Corinth "through many tears" 2 Cor 2:4 .</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>I am afraid many people have never shed tears in their messages because their feelings are too short.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Lifting up one's voice or shedding one's tears are not big things in themselves.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>But if a person has never lifted up his voice or shed his tears, something is wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>There is no special merit to lifting up the voice or shedding tears.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>But there is definitely something wrong with those who have never lifted up their voice or shed tears; the feelings of such ones have never been broken by the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>If a man's feelings have been finely ground, he will rejoice when God's word calls for rejoicing and weep when God's word calls for weeping.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>This is not a performance.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Do not try to perform.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>If it is a performance, an experienced person immediately will see through the farce and artificiality.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>We must never be artificial.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Artificiality only corrupts God's word.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>What we are saying here is that we must have proper feelings.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>We have to have the same feeling as God's word.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Joy and sadness are opposite examples.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>When the Bible speaks of joy, the proper reaction is to rejoice, and when it speaks of sadness, the proper reaction is to grieve.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Some people are so bound up in themselves all their lives that they are always cold.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>They do not rejoice when others play the flute, and they do not mourn when others weep.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Their feelings cannot meet the need, and God's word is frustrated through them.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Why do so many people have feelings that cannot be used at all?</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Why does the Lord bring them through so many experiences?</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>It is because the root of man's feelings lies in the person himself.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>The problem with feelings is different from the problems with the will and the mind.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>The problems with the will and the mind are more complicated.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>The problem with feelings is simply that they are centered around the person himself.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Many people expend all of their feelings on themselves.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>They have little difficulty feeling for themselves.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>If a man expends all of his feelings on himself, he does not have any feelings for others.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Some brothers are dull and insensitive to everything; they seem to be indifferent to everything.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Yet they are not insensitive or indifferent to themselves.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>A brother can be rude to every other brother, but if someone is rude to him, he is offended.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>This brother has expended all of his feelings on himself.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>He loves himself and cares for himself.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>When he suffers, he feels it.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>When he has problems, he weeps, but he has no feelings whatsoever for others' affairs.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Brothers, if the Lord does not conquer our feelings completely, we will be useless in the ministry of the word.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>The Lord often lays His hand on us through the discipline of the Holy Spirit with the purpose of turning our feelings toward others.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>We need to direct all of our feelings into the service of the ministry of the word.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>We have no time to spend our feelings on ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>Our feelings have to be tender all the time.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>Once they are exhausted, they become useless.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>Many people are obsessed with themselves; they think that they are the center of the universe.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>All their feelings revolve around themselves.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>God has to deliver them out of their shells.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>We do not have an unlimited supply of feelings.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>If we exhaust our feelings, we will not be able to be a minister of God's word.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>God must discipline us and deal with us until we do not have feelings for ourselves and until our feelings become tender.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>The foundation of tender feelings is a freedom from self-centeredness.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>The Lord has to break down our feelings so that we will no longer be self-centered.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>The more we are ground and the finer we become, the more our feelings will become useful.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>A minister of the word has to have feelings that are fine and rich before God can make use of them.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>We must remember that our words are only as rich as our feelings.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>The amount of riches in our word is determined by our feelings.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>Our inward feelings dictate the number of words we speak.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>Sometimes we have many words, yet our feelings are not strong enough to match them.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>At such times, our words are bound by our feelings.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>All ministers of the word have to remember that their words can only go as far as the breaking they have received from God.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>The words cannot go beyond the person's condition.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>Some people have trouble with their mind.</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>Others are short in their feelings.</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>They are still short in God's breaking work.</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>A spiritual man is rich in all kinds of feelings.</S>
   <S PAR='98' RSNT='1' SNO='98'>The more spiritual a person is, the more feelings he has.</S>
   <S PAR='99' RSNT='1' SNO='99'>Never think that the more spiritual a man becomes, the more insensitive he becomes.</S>
   <S PAR='100' RSNT='1' SNO='100'>The more lessons a man learns from God, the richer his feelings will be.</S>
   <S PAR='101' RSNT='1' SNO='101'>If the feelings of a sinner were compared to the feelings of Paul, it would be easy to see that Paul was superior both in his spirituality as well as in his feelings.</S>
   <S PAR='102' RSNT='1' SNO='102'>The more dealings a person receives, the more feelings he has.</S>
   <S PAR='103' RSNT='1' SNO='103'>When our feelings are enriched, we find the right sentiment to match the words we speak.</S>
   <S PAR='104' RSNT='1' SNO='104'>When the feelings match the words, God's word finds the free outlet He desires.</S>
   <S PAR='105' RSNT='1' SNO='105'>If words are spoken yet feelings lag behind, the two are out of step, and the utterance will not be satisfactory.</S>
   <S PAR='106' RSNT='1' SNO='106'>We feel that something is wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='107' RSNT='1' SNO='107'>We may try to say more, and we may try to raise our voice, but something still is wrong because our feelings do not match our speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='108' RSNT='1' SNO='108'>If a man desires to be a minister of the word, he must subject himself to strong dealings.</S>
   <S PAR='109' RSNT='1' SNO='109'>Once he turns away from a dealing, he will fall behind.</S>
   <S PAR='110' RSNT='1' SNO='110'>We must be dismantled before the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='111' RSNT='1' SNO='111'>Unless we are broken, we cannot accomplish any work.</S>
   <S PAR='112' RSNT='1' SNO='112'>Without discipline, there is no work.</S>
   <S PAR='113' RSNT='1' SNO='113'>Even if we were the wisest men in the whole world, we still would be useless.</S>
   <S PAR='114' RSNT='1' SNO='114'>It does not matter how clever or knowledgeable we are.</S>
   <S PAR='115' RSNT='1' SNO='115'>Only those who have been broken are useful.</S>
   <S PAR='116' RSNT='1' SNO='116'>This is a very serious matter.</S>
   <S PAR='117' RSNT='1' SNO='117'>Our emotions and feelings must go through repeated dealings before they can become useful to our speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='118' RSNT='1' SNO='118'>If the Lord has dealt with our self-love once or twice, when we speak about self-love, our feelings spontaneously will match our speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='119' RSNT='1' SNO='119'>There will be no hindrance whatsoever.</S>
   <S PAR='120' RSNT='1' SNO='120'>If our pride has been dealt with, when we speak about pride and about the Lord resisting the proud, our feelings will match our words.</S>

   <S PAR='123' RSNT='1' SNO='123'>This is the only way for us to prepare ourselves for the ministry of the word.</S>
