The explanation here shows us three things: (1) that the slain lamb of the Passover is Christ; (2) that the leaven is malice and evil; and (3) that since our Lamb, who is Christ, has been slain, we should also keep this feast before Christ. Now, according to the record of Exodus, let us consider the story of the Passover portion by portion.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>I. THE VERDICT OF DEATH<br>(EXODUS 11:4-5)</H2><P>"And Moses said, Thus saith the Lord, About midnight will I go out into the midst of Egypt: and all the firstborn in the land of Egypt shall die, from the firstborn of Pharaoh that sitteth upon his throne, even unto the firstborn of the maidservant that is behind the mill; and all the firstborn of beasts."</P><P>The verdict is that all the firstborn ones, the eldest ones, have to die. What is the meaning of the firstborn and the eldest one? We can read 1 Corinthians 15:46, "But the spiritual is not first but the soulish, then the spiritual." Everything that is of Adam, that is begotten of Adam, is the eldest and firstborn, and God's verdict for it is "death"!</P><P>Romans 5:12 says, "Death passed on to all men." Hebrews 9:27 says, "And inasmuch as it is reserved for men to die once." No one can escape this death! First Corinthians 15:22 says, "For just as in Adam all die." Hence, my friends, we are all destined to die. No one can escape death. Everyone has to die. This is God's verdict. All the firstborn ones, the eldest ones, have to die.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>II. A DIFFERENCE BEING MADE<br>WITH RESPECT TO DEATH<br>(EXODUS 11:7)</H2><P>"But against any of the children of Israel shall not a dog move his tongue, against man or beast: that ye may know how that the Lord doth put a difference between the Egyptians and Israel."</P><P>God chose a special group of people, the Israelites. He chose a group of people who would not have to pass through death to be His people. He is likewise choosing a group of people from the world who will not have to pass through death. God has put a difference between the Egyptians and the Israelites, so that the latter do not have to die. Ephesians 1:4 says, "Even as He chose us in Him before the foundation of the world." What good news! Among all the dead ones, God is choosing a group of people whom He will deliver from death.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>III. GOD'S WAY OF DELIVERANCE<br>(EXODUS 12:1-4)</H2><P>"And the Lord spake unto Moses and Aaron in the land of Egypt, saying, This month shall be unto you the beginning of months: it shall be the first month of the year to you. Speak ye unto all the congregation of Israel, saying, In the tenth day of this month they shall take to them every man a lamb, according to the house of their fathers, a lamb for a house: and if the household be too little for the lamb, let him and his neighbor next unto his house take it according to the number of the souls; every man according to his eating shall make your count for the lamb."</P><P>What was the way God used to deliver men from death? In the former days, it was with a lamb. Now God has given us Christ. In the whole world, the word lamb is applied to only one person, Christ. The title the Son of Man was used by both Daniel and Ezekiel. But from Genesis to Revelation, only Christ is ever called the Lamb. John 1:29 says that He is "the Lamb of God." First Peter 1:19 says that His precious blood is the blood "of a Lamb without blemish and without spot." Revelation 13:8 says that He is "the Lamb who was slain." Everywhere in the Bible, Christ is considered as the Lamb. In the old days, the Israelites were saved by the lamb. Now, men are saved by Christ.</P><P>Why did God want them to consider this month as the first month and the beginning of the year? There is a profound significance here. He would not consider the eighth month, the ninth month, the second month, or the fourth month. He would not consider all the other months of the year, but He would consider only this month as the first month and the beginning of the year. This tells us that for an unsaved person all the years he spends when he is unsaved are not counted. No matter if he is forty or fifty years old, as long as he is not saved, his days are not counted before God. All these years are wasted in vanity! God considers this month as the beginning of the year. As soon as a person is saved, he has his first month. The day that we receive the life of God is the first day of our year. In the parable of the vineyard in Matthew 20, everyone who has not entered the vineyard for the work is to the master of the vineyard an "idle" person. This does not mean that all these people are doing nothing. But to the master of the vineyard, they are "idle." The same is true with all unsaved persons in the eyes of God.</P><P>"In the tenth day of this month they shall take to them every man a lamb." This is the beginning of the Passover. The Lord Jesus entered Jerusalem on this day. He went to Bethany six days before the Passover, which was the ninth day of the first month (John 12:1). The next day, which was the tenth day of the first month, He entered Jerusalem (John 12:12). From that day on, the betrayer Judas sought for opportunity to deliver Him up to men (Matt. 26:16).</P><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_002.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_004.html">Next</a> </body></html>
