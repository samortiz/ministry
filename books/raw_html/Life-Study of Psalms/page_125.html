<H2 CLASS=HEAD2>C. Praising God in His Relationship<br>with the Sons of Men on Earth</H2><P>In verses 10-15 the psalmist praised God in His relationship with the sons of men on earth.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>D. Praising God in His Deliverance<br>and Preservation</H2><P>The psalmist praised God in His deliverance and preservation, which are stronger than those by a great army, by a mighty man of great strength, and by a horse with its great power (vv. 16-19). He compared God's saving power and God's preserving strength to a great army, a mighty man, and a horse. When I was a young Christian, I felt that this was wonderful, but today I do not feel the same. The New Testament does not compare our God with a horse. This shows again that we should not trust in our natural understanding when we read the Psalms. We need to have a change from our natural concept to the divine concept.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>E. Waiting on God as His Help and His Shield,<br>Trusting in His Holy Name, and<br>Having Hoped in Him</H2><P>At the conclusion of Psalm 33, the psalmist said that he was waiting on God as his help and his shield and trusting in His holy name, having hoped in Him (vv. 20-22).</P>
