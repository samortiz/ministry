<H2 CLASS=HEAD1>LETTERS FROM PEKING</H2><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>One</H2><P>Dear brother:</P><P>I have not written for a long time. I think of you often! During this time, I have been living a life of warfare in Peking. Although I have failed many times, I believe that God is causing me to learn some lessons. Truly, I now see that to begin to overcome, we must first overcome the flesh. At the same time, He has allowed me to see that Satan is real and active here. Thank God, He wants to lead us to overcome!</P><P>I am not confused inwardly now. I have had the experience of Habbakuk 3:16-19. Because of this, I am not in such a sad and distressed condition as I was before. Truly, thinking of myself all the time is the most miserable thing. May God cause me to forever escape from this cursed self. Brother, please instruct me and pray for me!</P><P>Miss Miao came from Tsinan to Peking a few days ago. There will probably be a few days of women's meetings, but we do not know how the Lord will lead them.</P><P>Mr. Chi, who once wrote an article about correcting the name of pastor and teacher, recently got smallpox in Jehol and died. This event really awakened me to take advantage of today to labor more for the Lord, to watchfully prepare, and to wait to see the Lord's face! (Parts omitted.)</P><P>Now I will speak of the meeting in Peking. I can tell you a little of its condition. Thank God, there has been some revival recently. The brothers bear more of the burden. Those outside the meeting here think that this meeting does not allow outsiders to come to the meetings. I do not know why they have this thought. On top of this, our furnishings are not adequate. We do not have many chairs, so some do not want to come. Thank God, He adds the number of saved ones to us. Some brothers and sisters will be baptized soon. There are many difficulties here, and I cannot relate to you all of them. May God cause us to live more according to His will and to please Him! Please pray for us unceasingly!</P><P>How is your physical health? I often think of you! Greet Brother Witness. I do not want to say too much. I greet you with this. Peace in the Lord.</P><P>Your little brother,<br>Chung Chieh<br>June 8, 1934</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>Two</H2><P>Dear brothers in the Lord, Watchman and Witness:</P><P>I received your letter and read it. After receiving your exhortation, I will do my best to live up to your high expectations. But my knowledge is shallow, and my language ability is not so good. I do not know if I can attain to your hopes.</P><P>Thank the Lord, there was a baptism meeting recently. Three or four people were put into the name of the Lord. Sister Miao might do some work next week. She still has not been able to decide. I hope you will pray for the meeting in Peking!</P><P>If the Lord allows, perhaps there will be a few days of conference meetings at the beginning (or end) of July. May the Lord especially bless this conference so that it will be able to touch people's hearts, causing them to obey the truth and be gained by the Lord. This is the first struggle. I hope you brothers pray much for us so that the Lord will use me, this weak and ignorant little one, to revive His own work.</P><P>Have you been busy with the work recently? Have people been sending articles to Shanghai? I think of you often! Greet the brothers and sisters for me! I respectfully bless you. Peace in the Lord!</P><P>Your little brother,<br>Chung Chieh<br>June 18, 1934</P>
