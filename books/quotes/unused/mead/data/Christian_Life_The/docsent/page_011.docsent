   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>This work was His releasing of the divine life within Him as the grain of wheat John 12:24 .</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The divine life was concealed in His human shell.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The cross broke His human shell, and the divine life within Him was released.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>His death was a life-releasing death.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The death of Adam is dark, but the death of Christ is bright.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>According to the divine autobiography, His all-inclusive death has also become an element of His being.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>After this death, He entered into His marvelous resurrection with His ascension.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Today He is an all-inclusive person as the processed and consummated Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>He has divinity, humanity, human living, an all-inclusive death, and an all-inclusive resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>We have to add these five things together divinity, humanity, human living, the all-inclusive death, and the all-inclusive resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>When these five things are added together, we have today's processed and consummated Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>This One is our God, our Redeemer, our Savior, our Lord, our Master, our Head, our reality, our life, our living, and our everything.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>If some ask us who our God is, we should tell them all of this.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>My God is a composition.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>He is composed of divinity, humanity, human living, an all-inclusive death, and an all-inclusive resurrection to be my God, my Redeemer, my Savior, my Lord, my Master, my Head, my reality, my life, my living, and my everything.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>This is my God!</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Then I would ask, "Where is your God?"</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>This God of such a wonderful composition is right now within us.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>He is also mingling Himself with us to make us exactly the same as He is in life, nature, element, and essence, but not in the Godhead.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>We have to see all of this; then we will have an all-inclusive view concerning the contents of the Christian life.</S>

   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The content of the Christian life is the processed and consummated Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>To be consummated is to be completed.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>It is to be wrought with something until there is a completion, an accomplishment of having been wrought.</S>
