   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>UNIVERSAL BUILDING</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>ACCOMPLISHED ONLY THROUGH LOCAL BUILDING</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>It is important to see that the universal building can be accomplished only through the local building.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>If we are not built up with others in our own locality, we should not expect to be able to be built up in any other locality.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>All those who are burdened to migrate for the spread of the church life must firstly be built up in their own locality.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>If you have not yet been built up in your local church, I encourage you not to migrate.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Before we can be built up universally, we must be built up in a practical way locally.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>If you have been in a locality for a period of time without being built up with others, there must be a reason for this lack of building.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The reason may be your natural cleverness or your reservations concerning the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Yes, you have stopped wandering from group to group, and you have come into the church life to stay.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>However, in order for you to be built up locally, your disposition, your being, must be dealt with.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Nothing tests your spiritual maturity as much as this matter of building.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Furthermore, the local building is a great help in your spiritual growth.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>If you are willing to be built into the church in your locality, you will have the abundance of the growth in life.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The building must begin with the local aspect and then spread to the universal aspect.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Some saints have not grown very much because they have not been built into the church locally.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The reason for the lack of building is that they have too many reservations.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Although they are in the local church, they have the tendency to withdraw or to hold back when certain situations arise in the church.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>It is this holding back that keeps them from being built up.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Instead of withdrawing or holding back, we should be willing to be broken and even wrecked in order to be built up with others.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>What a difference this makes to our growth in life!</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>If we grow in this way, the church life will spread both through us and with us, and we shall be useful in any coming migration.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>However, if we are not built up locally, we shall not be a help to any future migration.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Only those who have been built up locally can support the spread of the church life through migration.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Any who have reservations about the church, yet who desire to participate in a migration, will be a cause of frustration.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>THE SPREAD OF THE LORD S RECOVERY</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The spread of the Lord s recovery is the move of the living Christ in our spirit in a corporate way.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The Lord s move is with the saints not individualistically, but corporately.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>As those who seek the Lord, we should not hold anything back from Him.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>On the contrary, we should always give in to Him and be willing to be broken so that we may be built into the church in our locality.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Then wherever we may be, the recovery of the Lord will spread through us.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>This is altogether different from a movement of man or an organization.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>For the genuine move of Christ as the life-giving Spirit in His Body, we need the local building.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>We thank the Lord for the many churches raised up through migration.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>We also thank Him for the many who have been useful in migration because they had experienced some amount of local building before they migrated.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>At the same time, we must admit that there has been some frustration in certain places.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The reason for this frustration is that certain ones still have reservations.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>They still have the tendency to hold back from the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>This underscores the fact that the success of migration depends on the degree of building.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>If we are built up in an absolute way, migration will proceed also in an absolute way.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>But if we compromise with the local building, we shall also compromise in any future migration.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>In conclusion, I wish to emphasize again that how much building we have universally as well as locally depends on how much we give up the ordinances and realize in a practical way that Christ is everything in God s economy.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Since He is the all-inclusive One, we should not hold on to anything in place of Him.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>If we hold to Christ as everything to us, we shall experience the genuine building, first locally and then universally.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>This will make us useful in migration for the expansion of the church life.</S>
