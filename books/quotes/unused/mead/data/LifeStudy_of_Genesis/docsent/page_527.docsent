   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>k Jacob Losing the Treasure of His Heart</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Through God's sovereignty, which was exercised in all these seemingly coincidental matters, Jacob lost the treasure of his heart vv.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>31-35 .</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>After the death of Rachel, Jacob's heart was wholly set upon Joseph.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Suddenly and much to his surprise, Joseph was snatched away.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Jacob's sons deceived him into believing that Joseph had been devoured by an evil beast vv.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>32-33 .</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>When Jacob heard this news, he "rent his clothes, and put sackcloth upon his loins, and mourned for his son many days" v. 34 . To Jacob, there was nothing more on earth.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>He was not only broken; he had been robbed to the point where he had nothing left.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Although his children tried to comfort him, he refused to be comforted and said, "I will go down into Sheol unto my son mourning" v. 35, Heb . Jacob was utterly despondent, and nothing could comfort him.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>He had lost his heart treasure.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>How deep and personal was this dealing!</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>In principle, sooner or later we all shall pass through such a dealing.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Do not be frightened at the prospect of this.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Praise the Lord that we not only have chapter thirty-seven, but also chapter forty-seven, where we see a glorious result.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Chapter thirty-seven is simply a narrow underpass.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Jacob had to walk this narrow underpass and experience a suffering that touched his heart profoundly that he might mature.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Nothing in his entire life touched him as personally and as deeply as the loss of Joseph.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>l The Midianites Bringing Joseph to Egypt</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>and Selling Him to Potiphar</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Joseph, however, was not lost.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>God was preserving him in Egypt.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Joseph's being brought to Egypt was actually his transfer from "high school" to the "university."</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>In Egypt he would receive his higher education, the education which would prepare him for kingship.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Jacob, of course, did not know this.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>In Jacob's eyes, Joseph had been devoured by a beast.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>But in God's eyes Joseph was being prepared for kingship.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Therefore, God could say, "Jacob, there is no need to mourn.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Instead, you must rejoice because your son is in Egypt being prepared to be a king."</S>
