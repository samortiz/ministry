   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>God Making a Covenant with Abraham</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>After thirteen years, Abraham was ninety-nine years of age and was becoming old.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>He considered his own body as being already dead.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Even if he wanted to have a son, he could no longer do it.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Then God appeared to him and said, "I am the Almighty God" 17:1 .</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>This was the first time that God revealed His name as "the Almighty God."</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The name Almighty God in the original language can be translated as "all-sufficient God."</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>After God revealed this name to him, He put a demand on him.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>"Walk before me, and be thou perfect."</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Although Abraham had believed that God is powerful, he might not have believed that God is all-sufficient.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>This was why he tried to do things by himself.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>God showed him that if he believed in God as the all-sufficient One, he had to walk before Him as a perfect man.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Being perfect is being pure.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>God required Abraham to be pure and without any mixture.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>After God showed this to Abraham, He said, "I will make my covenant between me and thee, and will multiply thee exceedingly...My covenant is with thee, and thou shalt be a father of many nations.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Neither shall thy name any more be called Abram, but thy name shall be Abraham; for a father of many nations have I made thee...And I will establish my covenant between me and thee and thy seed after thee in their generations, for an everlasting covenant, to be a God unto thee and to thy seed after thee.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>And I will give unto thee, and to thy seed after thee, the land wherein thou art a stranger, all the land of Canaan, for an everlasting possession; and I will be their God" vv.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>2-8 .</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>God wanted to gain a people through Abraham, and God wanted to be their God.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>What kind of a standing should Abraham and God's people take before they can become His people?</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>God said, "This is my covenant, which ye shall keep, between me and you and thy seed after thee; Every man child among you shall be circumcised" v. 10 . In other words, God wants a people, yet they must not have any fleshly activity, power, or strength.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Who then are the people of God?</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>They are those who have been circumcised.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Circumcision is the mark of God's people.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Those who were eight days old, whether they were born in the house or bought with money of any stranger had to be circumcised v. 12 . It was not enough to be born, and it was not enough to be bought.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>One had to be circumcised as well.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>We are all born of God and bought by God.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>As far as redemption is concerned, we were bought by God.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>As far as life is concerned, we were born of God.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>But if we are not circumcised, we will have no part in the testimony of the people of God.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>God told Abraham, "The uncircumcised man child whose flesh of his foreskin is not circumcised, that soul shall be cut off from his people" v. 14 . Those who were not circumcised were to be cut off from among God's people.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>This has to do with the testimony.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>It means that those who are not circumcised cannot be vessels for God's testimony.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>A man may be redeemed and have life, but if he is not circumcised, and if he does not know the flesh-dealing cross, he cannot be of God's people; he still has to be cut off from the people.</S>
