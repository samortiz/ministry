Many Christians may not be familiar with the term &ldquo;the blood of the covenant&rdquo; found in this verse. This expression is also used by the Lord Jesus in Matthew 26:28. Even readers of the Bible who are familiar with the term &ldquo;the blood of the covenant&rdquo; may not know the true significance of it. This matter comes from the heart of God. However, it has no place in the heart of the natural man. Certain things found in the Bible may correspond to what is in our heart. For this reason, when we come across these things in the Word, we automatically pay attention to them. Other matters, however, are far beyond our concept. When we read of them in the Word, we may not be impressed. This is the case with the blood of the covenant.</p><p>Why did Moses in 24:8 speak of the blood of the covenant? Why did the Lord Jesus say on the night He was betrayed, &ldquo;This is My blood of the covenant, which is poured out for many for forgiveness of sins&rdquo; (Matt. 26:28)? The Lord&rsquo;s word here seems to be at least a reference to Exodus 24:8. Luke 22:20 speaks of the new covenant. This indicates that in 24:8 we have the blood of the old covenant and that in Matthew 26:28 and Luke 22:20 we have the blood of the new covenant. Both for the Old Testament and the New Testament the blood was necessary.</p><p>I do not believe that many of us have been impressed with the fact that the blood is the blood of the covenant. We may realize that the blood is the redeeming blood, the cleansing blood, the sanctifying blood, and the blood which overcomes the enemy. But have you ever paid attention to the fact that the blood is also called the blood of the covenant? This is a matter of great significance.</p><h2 class="head1">THE ENACTMENT OF THE LAW</h2><p>Before we consider the significance of the blood of the covenant, I would like to point out once again that in Exodus 24 we have the enactment of the law. Prior to this, the law was decreed by God and, through Moses as their representative, it was received by the children of Israel. As we have pointed out, Moses enacted the law in a way that was quite different from what we would expect according to the natural concept. Instead of charging the people to observe the law of God, Moses built an altar. An altar, no doubt, is for sacrifices. But what have sacrifices to do with the law? If we consider this matter, we shall realize that the law does not necessarily involve sacrifices. Why, then, in the enactment of the law did Moses build an altar? The altar points to the need for redemption, termination, and replacement. Because we are fallen, sinful, and corrupt, we need redemption and termination. We also need to be replaced by Christ.</p><p>Moses also built twelve pillars representing the twelve tribes of Israel. These pillars indicate, or signify, that after God&rsquo;s people have been redeemed, terminated, and replaced at the altar, they can become the testimony of God reflecting what He is.</p><p>Exodus 24:6 says, &ldquo;And Moses took half of the blood, and put it in basins; and half of the blood he sprinkled on the altar.&rdquo; We have seen that, according to verse 8, Moses also sprinkled the blood on the people and said, &ldquo;Behold the blood of the covenant.&rdquo; To be sure, the blood came from the sacrifices offered on the altar. It was the blood and neither the altar nor the pillars which made effective the enactment of the law. The covenant was established by the blood which came from the sacrifices offered on the altar. Thus, the altar with the sacrifices produced the blood for the enactment of the law. In the enactment of the law, the blood is the focus.</p><p>Apparently the altar, the pillars, the sacrifices, and the blood are not related in any way to the law. Why did Moses use all these things when he enacted the law? What Moses did in Exodus 24 is related to God&rsquo;s economy.</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_259.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_261.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Life-Study of Exodus &nbsp; pg 260</div><br></body></html>
