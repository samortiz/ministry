THE ALL-INCLUSIVE CHRIST BEING<br>THE CENTRALITY AND UNIVERSALITY OF THE MOVE<br>OF THE DIVINE TRINITY FOR THE ACCOMPLISHMENT<br>OF HIS DIVINE ECONOMY BY THE DISPENSING<br>OF HIMSELF INTO HIS CHOSEN PEOPLE</H2><P>In Isaiah we can see that our God is an active and aggressive God. He is moving. He has a personal desire, His heart's pleasure. Before the foundation of the world He made a plan in Himself. That plan is His eternal economy to create the universe and man so that He may have a people to express Him in a marvelous way. Isaiah's central point is to show us how God made Christ the centrality and universality of His great move for the accomplishment of His economy. This is why Isaiah reveals so many items of Christ. Christ has to be many items; otherwise, He could not fulfill God's economy.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>II. THE SHOOT OF JEHOVAH<br>AND THE FRUIT OF THE EARTH</H2><P>Isaiah can be considered as a book of poetry, and Hebrew poetry is composed in pairs. In Isaiah 4:2 there is a pair of aspects of Christ&#151;the Shoot of Jehovah and the Fruit of the earth. In this pair there is a comparison. "The Shoot" is in comparison to "the Fruit," and "Jehovah" is in comparison to "the earth." The title Immanuel includes "Jehovah" and "the earth" because it means God with us, that is, God with man. God is eternal, and man came from the earth. The Fruit of the earth refers to a man made from the dust (Gen. 2:7). Hebrews 2:14 says that the Lord Jesus shared in man's blood and flesh. Furthermore, Christ is the eternal God. John 1:1 says that in the beginning was the Word and the Word was God. Then verse 14 says that the Word became flesh. Christ as God came from eternity, but as man He came from the earth, so He is the Shoot of Jehovah and also the Fruit of the earth.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>A. The Shoot of Jehovah</H2><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>1. A New Development of Jehovah God for His Increase and Spreading through His Incarnation</H2><P>The Shoot of Jehovah is a new development of Jehovah God for His increase and spreading through His incarnation (Isa. 7:14; Matt. 1:22-23). "The Shoot of Jehovah" indicates that Jehovah is a big tree, a big plant. The shoot of this plant is a new development for Jehovah to be increased and to spread through His incarnation.</P><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_158.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_160.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Life-Study of Isaiah &nbsp; pg 159</div><br></body></html>
