   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>BREATHING AND DRINKING</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>BY CALLING ON THE NAME OF THE LORD</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Along with drinking the Lord, we also need to breathe Him in. According to the spiritual reality, breathing is drinking.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>M.E. Barber said in one of her hymns, "Just to breathe the Name of Jesus / Is to drink of Life indeed" Hymns, #73, verse 2 . To breathe the name of Jesus is to drink the water of life.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>By calling "O Lord Jesus" we breathe, and by breathing we drink.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Isaiah 12 speaks of drawing water v. 3 . No doubt, this is for drinking.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Now we need to consider where breathing is revealed in this chapter.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Verse 4 says, "And you will say in that day, / Praise Jehovah; call upon His name!"</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Praising Jehovah and calling upon His name are put together as one.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Whenever we call on the name of the Lord, that implies praising.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>When we say "O Lord Jesus," that is not only calling but also praising.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>When we say, "O Lord Jesus, I love You," this is praising and breathing.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Many Christians are deadened because they do not practice this spiritual breathing.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>If we do not breathe physically, we will die within a short period of time.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>This shows how crucial calling on the Lord is.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Acts 2:21 says, "And it shall be that everyone, whoever calls on the name of the Lord, shall be saved."</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The note on this verse in the Recovery Version points out that calling on the name of the Lord began with Enosh, the third generation of mankind, in Genesis 4:26.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The name Enosh means frail, mortal man.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>We human beings are altogether weak, frail, fragile, and mortal.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>We cannot do anything apart from the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Because we need Him in everything, we need to call on Him.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>When we call on Him, we breathe Him in, and our breathing is our drinking.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The air we breathe includes water.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>When water becomes vapor, it gets into the air.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The air sends water to the earth in the form of rain, and the water on the earth vaporizes and goes back to the air.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>There are devices called vaporizers which convert the water into vapor for inhalation.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The water in the vaporizer goes into the air.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>When we breathe in this air, we get the water because the water is in the air.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>This illustrates that our breathing is also our drinking.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Spiritually, our calling is our breathing, and our breathing is our drinking.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>When we say, "O Lord Jesus," we breathe Him in, and we are watered and refreshed.</S>
