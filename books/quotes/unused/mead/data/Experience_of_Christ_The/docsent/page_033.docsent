   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER SEVEN THE EXCELLENCY OF THE KNOWLEDGE</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>OF CHRIST AND THE DETAILED WAY</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>TO EXPERIENCE CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>As we have pointed out, the book of Philippians is on the experience of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>It is the only Epistle in the New Testament concerned with the experience of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Although we are familiar with the term the experience of Christ, it is difficult to explain how to experience Him.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>We have seen that the experience of Christ is mysterious because Christ is mysterious, invisible.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Nevertheless, we can experience Him.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>He is real and can be experienced, yet He is invisible.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>For this reason, it is difficult to find a verse in the New Testament telling us how to experience Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Although the book of Philippians deals with the experience of Christ and although the way to experience Christ is found in this book, the way is a mystery.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>It is not found on the surface of the book of Philippians.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>In order to find the way to experience Christ, we need to get into the depths of this book.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>In the last message we saw that the way to experience Christ is to repudiate all that we are naturally.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>All that we have, all that we can do, and all that we are must be rejected and given up.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>As long as a certain aspect of us is natural, it must be repudiated, no matter how good it may be.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Whether our natural constitution is very good or very poor, it must be denied.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>It takes little effort to deny the worst kind of self, but it requires a great deal of energy to deny the best self.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Perhaps you have been treasuring your best self for years.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Your friends and relatives all admire it, and you also appreciate it and esteem it highly.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Now you hear that you are called upon to repudiate this self in order to experience Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>After we repudiate ourselves, we find that something still remains.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>This remainder is Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>As the remainder, Christ is very mysterious.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>When we cooperate with the mysterious Christ, we not only experience Him, but also enjoy Him.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>This enjoyment causes us to be happy and excited.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>FIVE CRUCIAL MATTERS</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>In Philippians 3:8 Paul speaks of the excellency of the knowledge of Christ Jesus his Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>This excellency surpasses the realm of physics, science, and mathematics.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>In fact, it surpasses everything.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>I doubt that very many Christians know what the excellency of the knowledge of Christ is.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>In Philippians 3 we find the contrast between two kinds of righteousness: the righteousness of the law and the righteousness of God.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The righteousness of the law comes from our keeping of the law.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>For example, the law commands us to honor our parents.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>If we honor our parents, then this becomes our righteousness according to the law.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The law also charges us not to steal.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>If we refrain from stealing, then we are righteous according to the law in the matter of stealing.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The second kind of righteousness seen in Philippians 3 is the righteousness which is of God by faith.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Thus, one kind of righteousness is the righteousness of the law, and the other kind of righteousness is the righteousness of God.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The law is of dead letters, but God is living.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Thus, there is one kind of righteousness which is of dead letters and another kind of righteousness which is of the living God.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>In verse 10 Paul speaks of the power of Christ's resurrection and the fellowship of His sufferings.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>In chapter one there is the fellowship in the gospel and in chapter two, the fellowship of spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Here we have the fellowship of Christ's sufferings.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>In verse 10 Paul also speaks of being conformed to Christ's death.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Christ's death is like a mold, and we are like clay pressed into the mold.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Eventually, the clay is conformed to the mold.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>This is a picture of our being conformed to Christ's death.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>In this message we need to consider these five crucial matters: the excellency of the knowledge of Christ, the righteousness of God by faith, the power of Christ's resurrection, the fellowship of Christ's sufferings, and the conformity to Christ's death.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>In verse 11 we find another unusual expression: "the out-resurrection from among the dead" Gk.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>. This is not an ordinary resurrection, but an extraordinary resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>It refers to something outstanding.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>This we shall consider in another message.</S>
