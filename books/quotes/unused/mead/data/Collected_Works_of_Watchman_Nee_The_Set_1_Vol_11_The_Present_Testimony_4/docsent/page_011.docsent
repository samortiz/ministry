   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>LIVING BY FAITH Issue No. 33 Scripture Reading: Heb 10:38</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The word "live" in this verse can be translated two ways according to Greek.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>It can be translated "have life," or "live."</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In Romans 1 it should be translated "have life," while in Hebrews it should be translated "live."</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Because Romans talks about sinners, "live" should be translated "shall have life by faith."</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Hebrews is written to the believers, those who are saved and have eternal life; therefore, the more accurate translation is "live by faith."</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>I have met many believers who have mentioned various spiritual problems.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Of all of the spiritual problems, there is one that many people have difficultly overcoming.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Many believers frequently wonder why at times they feel spiritually dry and tasteless, while at other times they are happy and excited.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>When they are happy and excited, even though they are not having the experience in the third heaven, it seems as if they are having a unique mountaintop experience.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>They wonder how they can overcome the dry life to remain all the time in a happy and excited condition.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>They wish that their whole life would be one of constant flowing and bubbling.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>If they could do this, they would be able to sing hallelujahs all their life.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Many believers are seeking a solution to this problem.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Believers ordinarily refer to this type of living as "wave-like."</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>They live a fluctuating life.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>In their feelings, many Christians live a life that is sometimes on the mountaintop and sometimes in the valley.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Sometimes they are on the top of the wave, and sometimes they are under the waterline.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Sometimes they are high, and sometimes they are low.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Almost every Christian feels that he is living a fluctuating life.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Sometimes he feels very happy and will not be satisfied with only two hours of prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The more he testifies, the more he has to say, and the words come out like a river.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>When he listens to a message, he feels very interested and does not become tired at all.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>When he studies the Bible, he feels that God's Word is as sweet as honey.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>But then sometimes, things seem to be completely different.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>He feels that praying is the same as not praying.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Whether or not he prays does not seem to make much difference.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The Bible seems to be letters of black and white only, and it is dry and tasteless.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>When he meets someone, he feels guilty if he does not testify, and so he reluctantly says a few words like, "If you believe in Jesus, you will have eternal life."</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>However, in his heart he feels uninspired and has nothing to say.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Other things of the same nature are done halfheartedly.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Sometimes he feels that it is only profitable to draw near to God and pray to Him and that no work is necessary.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Yet at other times he feels that even this is too dry, and there is not much joy in drawing near to God.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Since he feels obligated to draw near to God, however, he does it reluctantly.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>We can compare this kind of Christian life to nature.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Where there is a mountain, there must be a valley.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Where there is a high wave, there is also a low wave.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Because many Christians frequently have this kind of experience, they conclude that a fluctuating life is inevitable and that it is impossible to live a steady life.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>They think that this will be their experience until they die.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>There is another group of Christians who say that mountain and valley, high and low wave experiences are unnecessary and that the Christian experience of life can be steady and on a straight line.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>What I want to tell you is that it is not altogether right to say that a Christian must have fluctuating and wavy experiences, nor is it altogether right to say that a Christian's experience must always be level and flat.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>If we want to find out the principle of something, we have to combine the experiences of all kinds of people.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Only by combining the spiritual experiences of all kinds of people can we come up with a common principle.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>For example, a person may study patients who have suffered from a certain illness.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>He will study the causes, symptoms, and results of many cases before he can draw a conclusion.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>If the hundreds or thousands of patients that are studied are found to have the same cause and same result, he can then draw a conclusion from what is common in all the cases.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>For this reason, we have to study how the highs and lows of a Christian life occur and how they develop before we can find out the proper principle.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>A Christian begins his life from the time he is saved.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Is a person sad when he is saved?</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>No, he is very happy.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>When someone finds a treasure, he is happy.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>When someone tells you that believing in Jesus Christ will give you eternal life and that you will pass from death to life and never come under condemnation anymore, that is the happiest day of your life.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>But let me ask, can this happiness remain forever?</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>No, after a while this happy feeling will go away.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>How long will the happiness last?</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>It is not certain, and it differs from person to person.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>According to my knowledge, the happy feeling and great joy that one had at the time of salvation seldom lasts more than a few months.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Generally speaking, after a month or two, the feeling goes away.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>With some, the feeling of joy from salvation is gone in only a matter of one or two weeks.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Let us use a horizontal line to illustrate the experiences of a Christian.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Anything above this line is joy, and anything below this line is dryness.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>When some are saved, for the first few months they live in joy.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>But one morning, though they study the Bible, pray, and fellowship just as before, they feel that their joy is not as full as the day before.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>It has diminished.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Some people are persecuted and ill-treated after they are saved.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Others want to deal with their sins to the extent that they are willing to cut off their right arm after they are saved.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Still others want to confess their sins to others and give up their sins after they are saved.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>At this time they are happy and consider it worthwhile to be saved because their happiness more than compensates for their loss.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Of course, they should be happy when they are saved.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Even God is happy that they are saved.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>But a few months later, they begin to lose their joy, or the joy is no longer as full as it was before.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>At the time of salvation, they loved to read the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Even though they may not understand the meaning of the Bible, they are interested in reading it.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>Although there are many things that new believers do not understand about the Bible, they like to eat and do not think that it is too much to read more than a dozen chapters a day.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>At that time they feel very happy about praying.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>Although they cannot tell how many times God has answered their prayer, they still like to pray.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>They lock themselves up in a room for a few hours and jump up and down for joy.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>But when the joy is gone, they begin to feel sad.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>Temptation will come from two sides.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>On the one side, the enemy will come; Satan will tell them that they are backslidden and no longer saved.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>On the other side, they will think that they have committed some sins and have become fallen.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>Yet in spite of their searching, they cannot find out what sins they have committed.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>Now, they feel that everything has dried up.</S>
