   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>GOD S PURPOSE</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>FOR THE CHURCH Scripture Reading: Eph 1:3-10, 22-23; 3:9-11; Rom 8:17-23; Rev 21-22</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Nearly all of the things revealed about God s eternal plan for the church are found in the two books of Ephesians and Colossians.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The book to the Ephesians is the revelation of the Body, and the book to the Colossians is the revelation of the Head.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>When put together, these two books reveal a universal man, composed of Christ the Head, and the church the Body!</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In Ephesians 1:10 and 3:9, the words dispensation and fellowship should be translated economy.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>They are both the same word in the Greek.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The church is something of God s economy, and this word economy is very important.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>It means dispensation, arrangement, stewardship, and administration.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>God has something to dispense, so He needs an arrangement and an administration in order to carry out this dispensing.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The very substance that God is going to dispense is Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>God is going to dispense Himself into man, so He arranged and administered the church.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The church is the central matter in God s economy.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Putting it into human terms, the church is God s business.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>We all know that business is the key to any economy.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Such a large corporation as General Electric has an economy in order to do business.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>In other words, business reveals the economy of this large corporation.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>In a similar way, God Himself is a corporation with an economy, and in this economy God s divine business is the church.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Many Christians do not have such an awareness of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Their thought is that the church is a group of fallen people who are saved and who come together to worship God.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>This is right, but it is a concept far below God s economy.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The heavenly and eternal view of the church is much higher than this.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>It is the very central matter of God s economy.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>In God s dispensation, in God s administration, in God s arrangement, in God s governmental stewardship, He has eternally planned the church.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>In Ephesians 3:11, there is the phrase, according to the eternal purpose, which shows that the church is not an accident but that it was planned by God in eternity past.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The church is eternal because it is of God s eternal plan and of God s economy.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>To have an economy or a business, there must be three things: the capital, the power, and the wisdom.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Without the finance or the capital, nothing can be done.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>This is why there are the shareholders, who raise the funds in a corporation.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Then there is the need of the power or the strength to run the corporation.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The largest corporation may have the largest capital; however, without the power, it can do nothing.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Furthermore, even with the power and the capital it will become bankrupt without the wisdom or the proper way to run the corporation.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>So a successful corporation needs the capital, the power, and the wisdom.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>In the two books of Ephesians and Colossians, these three things for God s economy are presented.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The capital, the finance, is God Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Ephesians 3:19 tells us that the church will be filled with the fullness of God.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>God Himself is the finance and the capital to run the business.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Then Colossians says that the fullness of the Godhead dwells in Christ bodily 2:9 , and this will be in the church.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The church will be filled with the fullness of God because it is the Body of Christ in whom the very fullness of the Godhead dwells.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The power is also mentioned in these two books.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>In chapter one of Ephesians there is the power that raised Christ from the dead, lifted Him up to the heavens, and put Him on the throne vv.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>19-20 .</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>This is the divine power.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Then in Colossians 1:29, the apostle Paul tells us that the power for him to minister is the inner energizing power.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>There is something within energizing him all the time, and he ministers by this power.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>What then is the wisdom?</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Of course, Christ is God s wisdom.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>In chapter one of 1 Corinthians we are told that Christ is the power of God and the wisdom of God v. 24 . Then in Colossians chapter two, we see that in Christ, God has hidden all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge v. 3 .</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>God s economy is to be carried out by these three things: by God Himself as the finance, by God s divine energy as the power, and by God s divine wisdom as the way.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>And the church is the very center of this economy.</S>
