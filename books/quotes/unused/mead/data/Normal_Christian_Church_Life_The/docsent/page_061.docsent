   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>That was a great and noble statement that our brother Paul made to the Philippians.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>He dared to say to those who were almost his sole supporters, "I have received in full all things and abound."</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Paul gave no hint of need, but took the position of a wealthy child of a wealthy Father, and he had no fears that by doing so further supplies would not be forthcoming.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>It was all very well for apostles to say to an unbeliever who himself was in distress, "Silver and gold I do not possess," but it would never have done for a needy apostle to say that to believers who would be ready to respond to an appeal for help.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>It is a dishonor to the Lord if any representative of His discloses needs that would provoke pity on the part of others.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>If we have a living faith in God, we shall always make our boast in Him, and we shall dare to proclaim under every circumstance, "I have received in full all things and abound."</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>There is nothing petty or mean about God's true servants; they are all great souls.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The following lines were penned by Miss M. E. Barber on Psalm 23:5 when she had used her last dollar:</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>There is always something over,</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>When we trust our gracious Lord;</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Every cup He fills o'erfloweth,</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>His great rivers all are broad.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Nothing narrow, nothing stinted,</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Ever issued from His store;</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>To His own He gives full measure,</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Running over, evermore.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>There is always something over,</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>When we, from the Father's Hand,</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Take our portion with thanksgiving,</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Praising for the path He planned.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Satisfaction, full and deepening,</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Fills the soul, and lights the eye,</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>When the heart has trusted Jesus</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>All its need to satisfy.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>There is always something over,</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>When we tell of all His love;</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Unplumbed depths still lie beneath us,</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Unscaled heights rise far above.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Human lips can never utter</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>All His wondrous tenderness.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>We can only praise and wonder</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>And His Name for ever bless.</S>
