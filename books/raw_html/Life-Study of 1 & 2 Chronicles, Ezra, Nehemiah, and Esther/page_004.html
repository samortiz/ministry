<h1 class="msg">MESSAGE TWO</h1>
<h1 class="title">THE REPRODUCTION OF GOD</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Gen. 1:26; 3:15; 22:18; 2 Sam. 7:12-14; John 12:24</h1>
<p>In this message I have the burden to speak a word on a very striking matter&mdash;the reproduction of God.</p>
<h2 class="head1">MAN CREATED<br />
ACCORDING TO GOD&rsquo;S KIND</h2>
<p>After God created the heavens and the earth, one of the angels rebelled and became God&rsquo;s enemy, Satan. This ruined God&rsquo;s original creation. Eventually, God came in to repair, remodel, and restore the universe. In this restoration God created billions of living creatures, including all kinds of birds and animals. Although God created so many living creatures, not one of these creatures was like Him. So God made man in His image and according to His likeness (Gen. 1:26). Therefore, man was not created according to his own kind but according to God&rsquo;s kind. God did not create mankind; He created man according to God&rsquo;s kind.</p>
<p>After God finished the creation of Adam and his wife, He looked upon everything that He had made. As He looked upon the earth and everything in it, only Adam and Eve were His delight, His &ldquo;hobby.&rdquo; Only they could make God happy because only they were His kind. When God looked at Adam, He might have said, &ldquo;I am pleased to see man. This is My hobby; this is My kind.&rdquo; However, God&rsquo;s hobby was far from complete because at that time man had only God&rsquo;s image and God&rsquo;s likeness but not God&rsquo;s life and God&rsquo;s nature. Man had God&rsquo;s image, but he did not have God Himself.</p>
<h2 class="head1">GOD BECOMING A MAN</h2>
<p>According to His eternal plan God Himself had to become a man. God is almighty and omnipotent, but He never does things in a fast way. We may have an idea and then act upon it immediately. God is not like this. He is very slow and full of patience. He made an economy in eternity past. Then He created the heavens and the earth. Later He repaired and restored the ruined creation, and as the last work in His restoration and further creation, God created man, His hobby. Yet that was not God&rsquo;s real hobby. God&rsquo;s real hobby is that God Himself would become a man.</p>
<p>After Adam&rsquo;s fall and after promising Eve that He would come as the seed of the woman (Gen. 3:15), God waited thousands of years before becoming a man. If I had been His companion, I would have said, &ldquo;God, since the desire of Your heart is that You become a man, why would You not do this right now? You told the fallen man that You would come as the seed of the woman. Why would You not come as this seed today?&rdquo; If God had been asked such questions, He might have said, &ldquo;I am not small like you are. I am great, and with Me a thousand years are as one day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Approximately two thousand years after making the promise in Genesis 3:15, God promised Abraham a seed that would be a blessing to all the nations (22:18). God seemed to be saying, &ldquo;Abraham, you will have a seed. This seed will be I Myself becoming a man to be the blessing to all the earth.&rdquo; Unable to be patient, Abraham followed Sarah&rsquo;s suggestion that he have a child by her handmaid, Hagar. Instead of producing the promised seed, Abraham produced a wrong one, Ishmael. God, however, continued to wait before becoming a man.</p>
<p>After another thousand years, up to David&rsquo;s time, God still had not come as a man. But God told David that he would have a seed who would be God&rsquo;s Son (2 Sam. 7:12-14). This Son is just God Himself. God prophesied to David concerning this seed, but He still did not come as a man.</p>
<p>Eventually, after another one thousand years, four thousand years after the creation of Adam, God came to be a man, conceived of the Holy Spirit and born of a human virgin (Matt. 1:20, 23). He grew up for thirty more years, but no one knew that He was God become a man, a God-man.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE ONE GRAIN PRODUCING MANY GRAINS</h2>
<p>One day the Lord Jesus, the God-man, said that He was a grain of wheat falling into the ground to die in order to become many grains (John 12:24). These many grains are actually many gods as the reproduction of God. The first grain&mdash;the first God-man&mdash;was a prototype, and the many grains&mdash;the many God-men&mdash;produced by this one grain through death and resurrection are the mass reproduction. This is the reproduction of God. When some hear that God has been reproduced, they may be shocked and say that such a word is nonsensical. Nevertheless, this is what is revealed in John 12:24.</p>
<p>God&rsquo;s real hobby is to have His reproduction in many nations around the globe. Such a reproduction makes God happy because His reproduction looks like Him, speaks like Him, and lives like Him. God is in this reproduction, and His reproduction has His life, His nature, and His constitution. What a great matter this is!</p>
