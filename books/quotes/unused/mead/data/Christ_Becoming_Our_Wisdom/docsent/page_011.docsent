   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>When Christ becomes our life within, He responds to all the demands outside of us.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>There is only one life, but because the demands outside of us are different, there are different kinds of responses.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>When pride comes, Christ is manifested as our humility.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>When anxiety comes, Christ is manifested as our patience.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>When jealousy comes, Christ is manifested as our love.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>From this one life issue all the virtues.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Because the need in the environment varies, the manifestations of this life also vary.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Daily we encounter many things.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>When the Lord manifests Himself in these things, we find Him in many virtues.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Hence, the many virtues of Christians are not their own behavior, but the reflections of Christ and the manifestations of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>This is the meaning of Christ becoming our sanctification.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Hence, the Christian life is a matter of how much we know about Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>It is not a matter of our humility, our patience, or our meekness.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Everything depends on Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The more we know Christ, the more His virtues are manifested through us.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Others may think that these are our virtues.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>But we know that they are nothing but Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>A Christian has no virtue other than Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>All Christian virtues are just Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Brothers and sisters, if we know Christ more, we will see that our virtues are just the outflow of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Sister Wang's patience is Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Brother Chan's patience is also Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Brother Chow's love, Sister Hu's meekness, and Sister Liu's humility are not different virtues; they are Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The virtues manifested through different persons are different.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>But they are all Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Hallelujah!</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>All of our virtues are just Christ!</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Everything that flows out of us is just Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The love that flows out of Brother Chow is Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The meekness that flows out of Sister Hu is Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The humility that flows out of Sister Liu is also Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The demands in the environment may be different, but the supply within is the same.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The outward manifestations are different, but the intrinsic nature is the same.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>No Christian virtue is a product of one's own work; every virtue is the outflow of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>It is Christ reflecting Himself out of us.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Brothers and sisters, once we realize this, we will lift up our head to the Lord and say, "I have tried in the past to be a Christian by myself.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>I was wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Lord, I thank You.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Now I know that You are my sanctification.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>I want You to live Yourself out of me."</S>
