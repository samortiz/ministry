   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>LIFE-STUDY OF FIRST CORINTHIANS MESSAGE SEVEN CHRIST CRUCIFIED,</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>GOD S POWER AND GOD S WISDOM 1 Scripture Reading: 1 Cor 1:18-25 PAUL S SPIRIT IN FIRST CORINTHIANS</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Brother Watchman Nee once told us that what is most important and precious in reading the Bible is to touch the spirit of the writer.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>When Paul wrote the book of 1 Corinthians, no doubt there was a specific burden in his spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>As we read this Epistle, we need to get into the writer s spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In order to touch Paul s spirit in 1 Corinthians, we need to know something of the background both of Paul himself and of the believers in Corinth.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Paul was a typical religious Jew, absolutely committed to the religion of his forefathers.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Because of his absoluteness for Judaism, he was opposed to the gospel, to the name of Jesus, and to the church.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>As we know, when he was opposing the church, the Lord Jesus came to him, called him, separated him, commissioned him, and charged him to preach Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>In obedience to the Lord s commission, Paul did preach Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>On a particular journey of ministry he visited the city of Corinth, a cultured city in Greece, where many philosophical people lived.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>To these people Paul preached Christ Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Some of the philosophical Greeks in Corinth received the word of Paul s preaching, accepted Christ, and were saved.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>When they were regenerated, they received the initial gifts: eternal life and the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>These initial gifts were sown into them as spiritual seeds.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>However, after receiving the divine life and the Holy Spirit, they did not live by these gifts.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Instead of living by the divine life and by the Holy Spirit, they still lived a life according to Greek culture.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>This means that they lived a life of wisdom and philosophy, not a life of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>They lived according to their philosophy and worldly wisdom, not according to the divine life and the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Due to the worldly wisdom of their philosophy, the believers at Corinth had different minds and opinions.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>They spoke different things and had different preferences and choices.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Some said, I like Paul ; others said, I prefer Cephas ; and still others said, My choice is Apollos.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Certain of the Corinthian believers even said, I like Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>These different opinions and ways of speaking opened the door for many evil things to come into the church life, things including strifes, quarrels, fornication, and lawsuits.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Regarding married life, there was also confusion and differing opinions.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Some said that a brother should leave his wife if she was not willing to go along with him to believe in the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Others advised against this.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Thus, among the believers in Corinth there were differing opinions.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Even though they were genuine Christians who had received the divine gifts, they were not living a Christian life, but living a Greek life.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>They were not living a life of divinity, but living a life of philosophy according to their worldly wisdom.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>As a result, there was confusion among them.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>This was the background of this Epistle.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>As Paul was writing this Epistle, he was burdened to guide the distracted, philosophical Christians in Corinth back to Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>These believers had been distracted by their wisdom, philosophy, and culture.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Thus, Paul s spirit was burdened to bring them back to the very Christ whom he had testified to them.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>This burden in Paul s spirit is especially evident in the first two chapters of this book.</S>
