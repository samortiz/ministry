   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CONSECRATING OUR BODIES AND OUR TIME</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Among the churches in Nansha, a few brothers have recently had the desire to do some work for the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>They had a fellowship meeting in April in Cheluwan.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The topic of the meeting was "How to Serve God."</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>As a result, they decided to begin with preaching the gospel and visiting people.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In every local church they began to have two or three days of meetings, and the work developed nicely.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The most recent message was "Presenting Our Bodies as Living Sacrifices."</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>In every church many brothers and sisters have consecrated their bodies and their time.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>About seventy have consecrated themselves in Jiazaowan, and many others in Shi-Er-Dai and Dangshanwan.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Around forty have consecrated themselves in Wananchiao, and there are thirty in Fengjialou.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>After consecration, their works are assigned by the church.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Those who are able to preach the gospel and visit people are assigned to preaching and visitation.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The brothers who cannot preach the gospel or visit are sent to help in the farms and businesses of those brothers who are preaching and visiting.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>All the churches are joining together in this we are not separated by locality or region .</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>For example, a brother from Jiazaowan may be sent to help on the farm of a brother in Dangshanwan.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Is this way of doing things according to the truth?</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>We are sending this letter particularly to ask for direction in the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>We hope you will give us an answer.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The brothers in Meilinwan: Wang Yu-gen</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Sinwan: Fei Chang-hua, Sung Da-fu</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>July 12, 1948</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Mailing Address: c/o Christian Assembly Hall, Sinwandi, Xiaoshan, Chekiang province</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Editor: The churches in the region of Nansha are unique in their location.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Although there are more than twenty localities, they are all villages in Xiaoshan and Shaoshing counties.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Some of the churches mentioned in this letter are only eight or ten li apart.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Thus, they spontaneously combine forces and work together.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>This is not an organization of united churches.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>THE CHURCHES PRACTICING</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>TO PREACH THE GOSPEL</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Thank God that now He is leading a few of us brothers and sisters to pursue life and to learn to serve.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>We learned something new through a brother's letter and saw something of the work the Lord wants to do in this age.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>This has enlightened our hearts and given us a way to go on.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>When the lease was up on the old meeting hall in the spring, God led us to build a new meeting hall with eleven rooms.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>It is large enough for the present use.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>We still have enough land to build approximately ten more rooms.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>We have learned deeper lessons through this.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>God touched the hearts of all the brothers and sisters concerning the matters of service and offerings.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>They did not merely give according to the measure of their strength, but even beyond their strength.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Some brought out their beloved possessions, while others offered up their livelihood.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>We really saw God working here.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>It is unfortunate, however, that we do not have enough life and are unable to bring more brothers and sisters to rise up and serve God.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Some have gotten cold and backslidden, some have gone to love the world, and some have gone into heresy.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The biggest problem since the testimony was raised up in Lan-chou involves those who walk according to their own will.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Recently, another person quit his job, saying that he was called by God to work for Him.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>This person works in many places and brings God's children into all kinds of lawlessness and rebellion.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>We were most troubled about this, but the Lord showed us that God sent Jesus Christ, the Lord sent the twelve apostles, and the Holy Spirit sent out Paul and Barnabas through the church.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Therefore, Lan-chou dared not receive these people anymore.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>We feel that we bear a great responsibility for the church.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>We are not strong enough.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>A doctor the so-called workers can write the wrong prescription, but the pharmacist the responsible brothers cannot give someone the wrong medicine.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>This responsibility is so great!</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>We really feel that we cannot bear it.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>We have already stopped the Lord's Day message.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>May the Lord grace all His children so that the church would learn to preach the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>We are temporarily doing some work to prepare the way while we are waiting for God to send His servants to Lan-chou to begin working.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>There are now more than fifty brothers and sisters in Lan-chou who come to the meetings regularly.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Your brothers,</S>
