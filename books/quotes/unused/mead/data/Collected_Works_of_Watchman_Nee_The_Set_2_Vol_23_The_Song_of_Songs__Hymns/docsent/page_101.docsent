   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>I have a Friend, whose faithful love</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Is more than all the world to me:</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>'Tis higher than the heights above,</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>And deeper than the soundless sea;</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>So old, so new,</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>So strong, so true;</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Before the earth received its frame,</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>He loved me Blessed be His name!</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>He held the highest place above,</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Adored by all the sons of flame,</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Yet such His self-denying love,</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>He laid aside His crown and came</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>To seek the lost,</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>And at the cost</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Of heavenly rank and earthly fame</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>He sought me Blessed be His name!</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>It was a lonely path He trod,</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>From every human soul apart;</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Known only to Himself and God</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Was all the grief that filled His heart,</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Yet from the track</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>He turned not back,</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Till where I lay in want and shame,</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>He found me Blessed be His name!</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Then dawned at last that day of dread,</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>When desolate, yet undismayed,</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>With wearied frame and thorn-crowned head,</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>He, God-forsaken, man-betrayed,</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Was then made sin</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>On Calvary,</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>And, dying there in grief and shame,</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>He saved me Blessed be His name!</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Long as I live my song shall tell</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The wonders of His dying love;</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>And when at last I go to dwell</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>With Him His sovereign grace to prove,</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>My joy shall be</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>His face to see,</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>And bowing there with loud acclaim</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>I'll praise Him Blessed be His name!</S>
