   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Sixth, we must deal with the very way we listen.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>A man may be somewhat gifted and talented.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>But as long as he is inaccurate with his words, there is a gaping hole in his character.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>This one flaw alone will cost him all of his power.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>How unfortunate that many of God's workers have become information centers!</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Brothers and sisters, as the Lord's workers we come into constant contact with people and have therefore many opportunities to hear others speak as well as to speak to others ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>If we are not disciplined and restricted in our words, it is very possible that while we are speaking God's word, we are spreading rumors and gossip at the same time.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>If our words are not disciplined, we may be building up God's work with one hand and destroying it with the other.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Hence, we have to look to God to apply strict discipline to our ears.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Brothers and sisters often want to tell us their personal stories.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>We should do our best to listen to them.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>We should be a good listener, and we should realize their problem and render them the proper help.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>When others speak to us, we should listen to them to take care of their need and solve their problem.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>But we must discourage them from going into any further detail once we are inwardly clear about their need.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>We should tell them to stop.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>We can say, "That is enough.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>You can stop here."</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>It is wrong to listen with curiosity to what others have to say and to treat their words as stories or tall tales.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>All we need to do is to realize their problem.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>As soon as we know and have some assurance about it, we should say, "Brother, that is enough."</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>We should not have a lust for information.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Human beings have a lust for knowing other people's business; they have a lust for listening.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>There is a lust for knowledge, a lust for listening.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>But we must listen with guarded caution.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>As soon as we reach the limit, we should stop.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Our listening is for the purpose of taking care of our prayer and for solving problems.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>We should listen only to take care of our brothers' and sisters' problems.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>At a certain point, we should stop listening.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Seventh, we have to gain and maintain people's trust.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>If anyone shares his spiritual problems with us, that is a trust he has placed with us.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>We must not speak about these confidences carelessly.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Unless the interests of the work make it necessary, we should not repeat these things loosely.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>If we have never been disciplined in our words, we cannot participate in God's work.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>God's servants are entrusted with many things.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>They need to treat such confidences as a sacred trust and guard them faithfully.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>These words are entrusted to us; they are not our possessions but are objects entrusted to us in our ministry and our divine service.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>We cannot release them at will.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>We must learn to safeguard and protect every spiritual confidence placed in us by the brothers and sisters.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>We cannot spread these things irresponsibly.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>If our responsibility or God's work or human needs calls for their divulgence, that is another story altogether.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>At any rate, a multitude of words always brings in a loss, a great loss.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Those who are wordy and who pass on words easily cannot be entrusted with the Lord's work.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>We should receive warning from the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>May He restrict our words, and may we not open our mouth rashly or speak lightly.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Whether or not a person is disciplined is most easily seen from the way he controls his tongue.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>If a man is disciplined, his tongue will always be restricted.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>We should pay particular attention to this matter.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Eighth, we have to pay special attention to the matter of lies.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>The double-tongued person to whom we have referred is a close kinsman of the liar.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>All utterances that are made with an intent to give a false hope or a wrong impression fall into the category of lying.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Sometimes a lie may not contain any false statement, but it is skillfully spoken to give others a false impression.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>This is in reality a lie.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>We have to remember that honesty in our speech is a matter of motive; it is not simply a matter of correctness in words.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>If a brother asks a question we do not wish to answer or are unable to answer, we should politely refuse to reply, but we should not deceive the brother.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>A false statement is a lie, and anything that gives others a wrong impression is also a lie.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>We want people to believe the truth; therefore, we dare not use words that are true in order to convey a false impression.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>For God's children, it should always be "Yes, yes; No, no."</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Anything more than this is of the evil one.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>The Lord once spoke very strongly to the Jews: "You are of your father the devil, and you want to do the desires of your father....When he speaks the lie, he speaks it out of his own possessions; for he is a liar and the father of it" John 8:44 .</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>The devil is the author of lies.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>He was a liar from the beginning.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Even today he is filled with lies.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>He is a liar and the father of it.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>It would be unthinkable for a child of God and, even more, for a worker of the Lord to lie.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Yet some are indeed lying.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>This is too poor.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>There is no sickness more fundamental than this one.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>This is a very serious problem, very serious and very sobering!</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>We must pay attention to the matter of lies.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>We should not think that everything we say is always accurate.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>The more careful we are, the more we will realize the difficulty of being accurate in everything that we say.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Sometimes our intention is to speak the truth, but with a little carelessness we find ourselves off the mark.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>If we can so easily veer off when we are trying to be accurate, how much more we will be off the mark if we are not consciously trying.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>It is hard enough for us to speak the truth by carefully watching over ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>It is harder still for us to speak the truth when we do not control ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>Hence, we must guard ourselves, pay attention to our words, and never be loose.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>Otherwise, we will not be able to serve our God.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>God cannot use a person who is His mouthpiece one minute and a mouthpiece of Satan the next minute.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>No, He can never use such a person.</S>
