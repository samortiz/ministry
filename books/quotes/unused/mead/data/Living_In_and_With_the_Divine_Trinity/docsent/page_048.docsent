   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>LIVING BY CHRIST AS THE LIFE SUPPLY</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>We need to be those living by Christ as the life supply John 6:57b-58 .</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The most important thing in living in a home is eating.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In the home nothing is as crucial as food.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>If we are going to live in the Divine Trinity, to abide in the Divine Trinity as our home, we must enjoy Christ as our food.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>We need to live by Christ as our life supply.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>He is our food.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>He is eatable because He is now in resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Because of His crucifixion, our redemption has been completed.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Now Christ is good for us to eat.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>After accomplishing death and resurrection, He became perfected for us to eat Him.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Because He is living in resurrection, He is good for us to eat organically.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>After His resurrection the Lord trained His disciples to live by Him as their life supply.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>In John 21 we see the resurrected Christ moving and living with the believers.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>In this chapter Peter took the lead to go fishing, and the other disciples followed him because they did not have anything to eat.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The resurrected Christ as the disciples' life supply had been breathed into them, but Peter took the lead to go away from this life supply.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>This life supply was inside of the disciples, not in the sea.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>They should not have gone to the sea.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Instead they should have remained in their spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>They became distracted from the life supply in them.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Even though they fished through the entire night, they caught nothing.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Then what was caught by their fishing?</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>In a sense we can say that they "caught Jesus."</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>They were disappointed to the uttermost that they did not catch one fish.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>All of a sudden, Jesus came.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>His coming indicated to them that He was their life supply.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The Lord Jesus was training them to realize where the life supply is.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The life supply is not in the world, in the sea, but within us.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The very Spirit breathed into our being is the life supply.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>We do not need to "go fishing."</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>We do not need to go to any other source to get our life supply.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The only source of our life supply is in our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>This supply is the very pneumatic Christ, who is today the life-giving Spirit indwelling our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>John 20 and 21 reveal that the pneumatic Christ came into His disciples to dwell there as the life supply.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>We should not be distracted from this source to anyone or anything else.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Day by day we need to live by the resurrected Christ as the life supply.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>This is what it means to live, to abide, to have our living, to have our being, in the Divine Trinity.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>After this fellowship, we may still wonder what it means to live in resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>This is very hard to explain.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The only thing I can say to explain this is from the negative side.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Whenever we are in ourselves, we realize that we are not in resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Whenever we do or say something in a natural way, we know that what we do or say is not in resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>As long as we are natural, that is altogether not in resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>To be in resurrection is to reject ourselves, our natural man, our natural way, and our old man.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>In 1932 a small church was raised up by the Lord in my hometown of Chefoo.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Brother Nee heard the good news that a church was raised up in northern China.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>That was the start of the recovery in northern China, so he was happy.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>In the spring of 1932, he came to stay with us and he was my guest.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>During that time he related an illustration to me which I will never forget.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>He spoke of the difference between putting a little rock or a living seed into the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>If we plant the rock in the earth and wait for many years, nothing will come out.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>If we plant a seed, such as a grain of wheat, something will eventually come out.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>He asked me why nothing will happen with the buried rock, whereas something will happen with the buried seed.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Of course, I responded by saying that this is because there is no life in the rock, whereas there is life in the seed.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Then he came to his point.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>He said, "Brother, we are not a piece of rock.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>We are a seed.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>The more we reject ourselves, our flesh, our old man, and the more we become nothing, the more the life within us will rise up."</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>We are not unbelieving Gentiles, who are like pieces of dead rock.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>We are regenerated believers.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>We were regenerated in Christ's resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Now we are living seeds.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Within us there is something of resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Within us is the resurrected Christ, the pneumatic Christ as the life-giving Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Therefore, when we reject ourselves, our natural man, our old man, this gives the indwelling, pneumatic Christ the opportunity to grow within us.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>I received so much help when Brother Nee gave me that simple illustration fifty-five years ago.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>For fifty-five years I have been enjoying and experiencing the help from that illustration.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>I am always reminded of what it is to live in the resurrection life.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>To live in the resurrection life is to deny ourselves, to reject our old man, and to despise the natural way.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>When we do this, we are immediately in resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>This resurrection is a living person.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>On another occasion, Brother Nee gave a message telling us that the reality and essence of resurrection is the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Resurrection is the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>This Spirit is not merely the Spirit of God as He was in Genesis 1, brooding on the face of the waters.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>Resurrection is the person of the Spirit of Jesus Christ after Jesus' resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>This living person is the reality and the essence of resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>To live in resurrection is to live and to walk, not by ourselves but by this Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>Where is this Spirit?</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>He is right now in our spirit Rom 8:16; 1 Cor 6:17 .</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>Thus, whenever we turn to our spirit, we meet the reality of the resurrection, which is a living person, the life-giving Spirit as the pneumatic Christ.</S>
