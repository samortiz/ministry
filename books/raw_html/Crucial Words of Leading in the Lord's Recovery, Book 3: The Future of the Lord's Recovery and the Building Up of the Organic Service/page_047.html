	 <h1 class="msg">CHAPTER THIRTEEN</h1>
<h1 class="title">THE WAY FOR THE CHURCHES<br />
IN TAIWAN TO GO ON</h1>
<h1 class="title">(1)</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Hab. 3:2; Ezek. 1:4</h1>
<h2 class="head1">A TRUE REVIVAL</h2>
<p>Hymn #212 in the Chinese hymnal was written after we had a thorough study of Ezekiel 1 more than twenty-three years ago. The messages given during those meetings were published in Chinese.</p>
<p>Ezekiel 1 speaks of a vision seen by Ezekiel in which a storm wind, coming from the north, brings a great cloud in which there is fire flashing. From the midst of the fire there is something like electrum in brightness (v. 4). This shows that in Ezekiel 1 there are four main items: the wind, the cloud, the fire, and the electrum. John Nelson Darby says that the electrum is &ldquo;an unknown substance&rdquo; that &ldquo;some think a mixture of gold and silver.&rdquo; According to the divine revelation, gold represents the manifestation of God&rsquo;s divine nature. The storm wind comes from God, the cloud that comes with the wind contains a flashing sanctifying fire, and from the midst of the fire there is something like the glowing electrum, composed of the elements of gold and silver. This picture, which is full of spiritual significance, implies that every one of us must become a man of wind and cloud, filled inwardly with the divine fire, and full of the shining forth of the divine essence.</p>
<p>Five hundred years of Christian history have passed since Luther began the Reformation. The item most emphasized in Christianity during these years has been revival. According to church history, for the past five hundred years the Protestant churches have been maintained mainly by revival meetings. We cannot say that this is against the Bible; however, even with revival meetings the condition of Christian meetings has progressively declined, and the result is a loss of spiritual weight. When the gospel was preached in China, the Christians changed the word <em>revival</em> into <em>excitement.</em> This means that the meetings merely excited people. After a short time believers grew cold again, and they continued to live as they had in the past. For this reason, after the Lord raised up His recovery among us, we did not pay much attention to revival meetings; neither were we willing to use the term <em>excitement meeting.</em> There have been very few revival meetings among us.</p>
<p>I have been speaking God&rsquo;s Word for many years, and I rarely quote the Minor Prophets in the Old Testament. However, for this meeting, there is one sentence that we can use: &ldquo;O Jehovah, revive Your work / In the midst of the years&rdquo; (Hab. 3:2). <em>Hymns,</em> #797 is also very appropriate, because the beginning of every stanza and the beginning of the chorus say, &ldquo;Revive Thy work, O Lord!&rdquo; However, in considering this matter, we will use hymn #212 in the Chinese hymnal.</p>
<p>If we read this hymn thoughtfully, we can see that the revival we are speaking of is not the shallow revival of which most of today&rsquo;s Christianity speaks, much less is it a revival of excitement referred to by the Christians in China. The second half of the third stanza of hymn #212 says, &ldquo;Burn out filthiness, / Burn up common things, / Making man correspond to God, / Holy without blemish.&rdquo; The revival we are speaking of causes man to correspond to God by making man holy and without blemish. The second half of the fourth stanza says, &ldquo;Divinity mingled with humanity, / Man&rsquo;s spirit joined with God&rsquo;s Spirit, / Causing God&rsquo;s life / To be manifested in man.&rdquo; This is the revival that we are referring to, and I believe this is also the revival that God desires. It is not an outward, so-called revival work, much less a revival of excitement; rather, it is &ldquo;divinity mingled with humanity, / Man&rsquo;s spirit joined with God&rsquo;s Spirit, / Causing God&rsquo;s life / To be manifested in man.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In 1961 I conducted a Life-study of the book of Ezekiel, and I wrote this hymn. This proves that the revival that God showed us over two decades ago was a revival of &ldquo;divinity mingled with humanity, man&rsquo;s spirit joined with God&rsquo;s Spirit, causing God&rsquo;s life to be manifested in man.&rdquo; This is also the revival that causes man to correspond to God. We need to sing these words until they enter into us and come out from us as a cry unto God: &ldquo;Lord, bring in such a revival among us that makes man correspond to You so that Your life can be manifested in us.&rdquo;</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE MODEL FOR THE ADMINISTRATION, MOVE,<br />
AND BUILDING UP OF THE CHURCH</h2>
<p>In the past few conference meetings more than six hundred saints have consecrated all their time for the Lord&rsquo;s work and service, and another group of more than six hundred saints have consecrated themselves to be part-time for the Lord&rsquo;s work and service. This will greatly expand and strengthen our service. We must, therefore, make new arrangements for the Lord&rsquo;s work in Taiwan and for the building up of the church.</p>
<p>We will thoroughly fellowship with all the saints concerning the leading we have received from the Lord, the vision we have seen, and the way we must take in order to go on. We want every church and every saint in Taiwan to know how the work of the Lord&rsquo;s testimony should go forward. We also want the churches to know how to build up the priesthood through service. We will fellowship as a family concerning the way we should move forward to promote the Lord&rsquo;s testimony.</p>
