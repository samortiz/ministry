   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>For example, gravity is a fact.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The law of gravity existed long before Newton, yet for thousands of years no one discovered it.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>One day, an apple fell on Newton while he was asleep under a tree.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Through this he discovered the law of gravity.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>There is no question about the existence of facts.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The question is whether or not these facts have been discovered.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>For example, the Bible mentions something in some places and does not mention it in other places.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>One place mentions one thing while another place skips it.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>One place says it one way while another place says it a different way.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The same word can be in the plural form in one place and in the singular form in another.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Sometimes the Bible emphasizes the Lord's name while at other times it emphasizes a man's name.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Chronology is clearly mentioned in some places, but totally skipped and seemingly neglected in other places.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>These are all facts.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>A person who is good at reading the Bible is surely a careful person before God.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>He cannot be sloppy or muddled.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Every iota or serif of the Bible is unalterable.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>God's Word says it, and it is so.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The moment God's Word is opened up, you should know what its emphasis is.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Many people are very careless.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>They listen to men's words carelessly and read God's Word carelessly.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>They do not see what God's Word emphasizes and are ignorant of the depths in His Word.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The first thing a person has to do is discover the facts.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Afterwards, he has to memorize these facts and analyze, categorize, and compare them.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Only then will he receive light from the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>In this way he will get the supply and also supply others.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>He will receive nourishment and also nourish others.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Here I will give a simple illustration.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>If we read the Bible carefully, we will find the New Testament expressions in the Lord, in Christ, in Christ Jesus, etc. It never says in Jesus or in Jesus Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>It only says in Christ Jesus, not in Jesus Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>These are facts.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>We must memorize and jot down these facts one by one.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Find where it says in the Lord and what the context is.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Find where it says in Christ and what the context is.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Find yet another place where it says in Christ Jesus and what the context is.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>If we know all these portions by heart, we can compare them.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Why does it say in Christ in one instance instead of in Jesus?</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Why does one place say in Christ Jesus and not in Jesus Christ?</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Why does the Bible never say in Jesus or in Jesus Christ?</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>What is the reason for this?</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>When we analyze and compare the Scriptures in this way, looking to God for enlightenment, we will see something.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Once the light comes, everything will become very clear.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Jesus is the name given to the Lord while He was on earth.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Christ is the name given to Him after His resurrection when God anointed Him.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>"God has made Him both Lord and Christ."</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Do you remember these words in Acts 2?</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Christ is the name given to Him in His resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>In reading Romans we find the words Christ Jesus, which mean that the Christ today is the very Jesus who was on earth in the past.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Christ Jesus is His name today.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>This means that the Christ today is the very Jesus who was on earth before.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>His name before resurrection was Jesus Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>This name implies that Jesus would one day be the Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Jesus was His name when He lived on earth as a man.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>These two expressions Christ being once Jesus, and Jesus eventually becoming Christ mean two different things.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Moreover, we can only be in Christ, not in Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>We can only be in the Lord and in Christ Jesus, not in Jesus Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>When the Lord was on earth, we could not be in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>If we had been in Him when He was on earth, we would have taken part in His cross and His redemption.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>This is contrary to the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>We have no part in His incarnation at Bethlehem.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>He was the only begotten Son of God, and we have no part in that.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>How then can we be in Christ?</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>First Corinthians 1:30 says, "But of Him God you are in Christ Jesus."</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>It does not say in Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>After the Lord Jesus died and resurrected, we became joined to Him in His resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Through His death and resurrection, God has made Him the Christ, and God has joined us to Him through the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>We received His life at the time of His resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Regeneration does not come through incarnation but through resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Now we should be clear.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>This is the way to read the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>This is how we study the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>First, discover the facts.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Then memorize, analyze, categorize, and compare these facts.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>After this pray to the Lord and wait on Him; He will enlighten you and give you sight.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>These are the four principles of reading the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>We cannot skip any one of them.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>Let us give another illustration.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>Consider the word about the coming of the Holy Spirit in John 14 and 15.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>In reading these passages, we must pay attention to the promise of the Lord Jesus and discover whether there are any special facts related to it.</S>
