 <h2 class="head2">The Fellowship of the Spirit<br />
in the Regenerated Spirit of All the Members<br />
of the Organic Body of Christ</h2>
<p>The intrinsic fellowship of the churches is the fellowship of the Spirit in the regenerated spirit of all the members of the organic Body of Christ (2 Cor. 13:14; Phil. 2:1). Second Corinthians 13:14 refers to the &ldquo;fellowship of the Holy Spirit,&rdquo; and Philippians 2:1 mentions &ldquo;fellowship of spirit,&rdquo; indicating the human spirit. Therefore, the intrinsic fellowship is of the divine Spirit residing in our human spirit.</p>
<p>We believers come from many different backgrounds and cultures. Regardless of our differences outwardly, however, we all have the same intrinsic fellowship. Japanese, Korean, black, and white all become one in this fellowship. If we do not follow the outward things, but follow only our spirit with the Spirit, we are in the flow. In the Lord&rsquo;s recovery, we practice this universal oneness in the flow of the divine life. Many have testified that our meetings are a wonder because all the races are meeting together as one. We can meet as one because we care only for the intrinsic fellowship.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Fellowship Based on<br />
the Unique Belief (the Faith)<br />
of All the Members of the Organic Body of Christ<br />
according to the Teaching of the Apostles&mdash;<br />
the Unique Teaching of the New Testament</h2>
<p>The fellowship is based on the unique belief (the faith) of all the members of the organic Body of Christ according to the teaching of the apostles&mdash;the unique teaching of the New Testament (Jude 3; 1 Tim. 3:9; 2 Tim. 4:7; Acts 2:42). We all have to know our faith, the objective faith. This faith is our Christian belief, the things in which we believe, not our believing act. All the members of the organic Body of Christ have a fellowship which is based on the faith, the unique belief. Whatever we believe is according to the teaching of the apostles, the unique teaching of the New Testament.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Any Special Fellowship<br />
Based on Any Wind of Teaching<br />
Being One of the Three Factors<br />
(a Special Fellowship, a Special Name,<br />
and a Special Ground) of a Sect</h2>
<p>The fellowship among believers must not be based on any wind of teaching (Eph. 4:14). If our fellowship is based upon different teachings that are winds, these teachings will be one of the three factors of a sect: a special fellowship, a special name, or a special ground. Any of the three will cause us to become a sect or division (Gal. 5:20). Therefore, we must avoid any special fellowship which is based on any wind of teaching.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE ORGANIC RELATIONSHIP OF THE CHURCHES</h2>
<h2 class="head2">The Unique Relationship of the Unique Church<br />
(the Universal Church Composed of<br />
All the Local Churches)</h2>
<p>The organic relationship of the churches is the unique relationship of the unique church&mdash;the universal church composed of all the local churches (1 Cor. 12:28). Today in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery, there are about eleven hundred fifty churches throughout the earth. There are many local churches, but there is only one unique, universal, and intrinsic fellowship which is for the organic relationship of the churches.</p>
