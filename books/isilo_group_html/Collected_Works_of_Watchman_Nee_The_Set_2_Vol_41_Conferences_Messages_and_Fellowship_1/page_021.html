In order for God to bless a man, he must satisfy one condition: he must be hungry. "The hungry He has filled with good things, and the rich He has sent away empty" (Luke 1:53). If we are not hungry, we cannot expect to receive anything from God. God's riches and grace are reserved for only one kind of people: those who are hungry. Many people are often dissatisfied and unhappy. However, dissatisfaction and unhappiness are not necessarily the same as hunger. A man may be unhappy and dissatisfied, yet at the same time, refuse to seek for more because he is not hungry even though he is dissatisfied. What does it mean to be hungry? It is being empty before God and feeling unfulfilled within. An empty and unfulfilled feeling is an impetus for a person to seek after God. However, if a person is not hungry, he can sit in the same place for days without doing anything. God has promised to fill only those who are hungry. He has not promised to fill those who are dissatisfied. Those who are full, that is, who think that they are rich, will be sent away empty-handed.</p><h2 class="head1">MISS BARBER'S EXAMPLE</h2><p>Miss Barber used to tell others that from her youth through her old age she had an eternal hunger for God. She told others that whenever her eyes were not set on the Lord, she would not feel hungry. But whenever her eyes were set on the Lord, she would be continually hungry before the Lord. She was hungry continually, and the Lord filled her continually. Today we find many believers who are dissatisfied, but we find very few who are hungry. The prodigal son in Luke 15 returned home because he was hungry. He could have filled himself with carob pods. This would not have satisfied him, but neither would he have gone hungry, and he would not have thought about returning home. This is the condition with many people. They live daily in dissatisfaction, yet their stomachs are filled with carob pods. Hence, we see that dissatisfaction is one thing, while hunger is another. Many believers know the doctrine of overcoming; they may even be able to give a message on overcoming. They can lay out the doctrine on the overcoming life from the first point to the last and do a clear analysis of the subject. Yet they still have not overcome. It is one thing to have the doctrine of the overcoming life, it is another thing to overcome. The doctrine of the overcoming life is easy. Those who are smart and have a good memory can understand and remember it readily. But when they are faced with various circumstances, they find that they cannot overcome at all. Hearing a message on overcoming is not an end in itself; one does not overcome simply by listening to a message on overcoming. Only one kind of people will overcome: those who are hungry to experience it. God grants the overcoming experience to those who are hungry. If a man is not hungry, he cannot live an overcoming life. Today we need a hunger for God, because all those whom God uses and blesses are desperate ones.</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_020.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_022.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Collected Works of Watchman Nee, The (Set 2) Vol. 41: Conferences, Messages, and Fellowship (1) &nbsp; pg 21</div><br></body></html>
