   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In this chapter we need to see some of the principles in interpreting the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>If we want to study the Bible, we have to understand the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In order to understand the Bible, we need to interpret it.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>If there is no interpretation and no explanation, naturally we will have no way to understand the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>We know everything has its own principles.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The more esteemed and important a matter is, the stricter are its governing principles and laws.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>If a matter is of no significance or importance, and can be carried out in any way, there will not be any laws, principles, and regulations to speak of.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>But if a matter is proper, and occupies a definite place and significance, and if it is great and noble, surely there are principles and laws governing it; one cannot carry it out haphazardly.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The Bible is an extremely great item in the universe.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Besides our Lord and God of glory, I believe the greatest item in the universe is the Bible we have before our eyes and in our hands.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Since the Bible is so important, we need the proper interpretation before we can study or understand it.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>This interpretation must be governed by definite rules, laws, and principles.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>We cannot interpret it in this or that or any way we like.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Now that we have seen how the Bible was written, how it was translated into different languages and placed in our hands as an available book, we need to find out the governing principles and laws for its interpretation and study.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Not only will this help us to understand the Bible, it will also help us to avoid many errors.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>All rules are a kind of protection.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>If a train has no railroad tracks to run on, not only will it be unable to run smoothly, but it will also be without protection.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>When there are railroad tracks, the train will move smoothly and will have the proper protection.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>This is the same way with the study of the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>If one studies the Bible and expounds it blindly and carelessly, the result will be inconceivable and even dangerous.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Our thoughts are often without restraints.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>It is very dangerous for a person to judge according to what he thinks and to interpret according to what he perceives.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>If we want to study the Bible properly and understand it accurately, there must be the restrictive interpretation.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>If we want a restrictive exposition of the Bible, we need to find out the principles and laws of Bible interpretation.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Here we will point out ten such principles.</S>
