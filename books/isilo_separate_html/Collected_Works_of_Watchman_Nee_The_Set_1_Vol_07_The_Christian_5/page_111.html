Booksellers often use advertisements to attract people to buy their books. Buyers are often cheated through oversight. Many booksellers have only one goal in mind, which is to make money. They sell all kinds of books, from those which are orthodox in their faith to those which are not. It is not uncommon for pastors and preachers to spend some of their savings to buy useless books. This is why we want to review books and magazines in this column honestly, fairly, and scripturally, so that the readers will know what to choose. [Editor's note: Following this is a list of magazines whose faith is unscriptural, a list of magazines whose faith is mixed, and a list of magazines whose faith is pure.]</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD4>Issue No. 7</H2><P>In the last issue, we intended to publish a letter from Pastor Tsui Ai-kwang. Unfortunately, the letter was lost. What that letter said was mainly concerning the need for stern critical works on reviewing books and magazines in this age of apostasy. As for the reviews made in the issues prior to the last one, they were all done by the editor.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE PERSONAL WAY TO BE SAVED</H2><P>A few years ago, when I was a one-year-old believer, I obtained this book in English and received much help from it. Two years ago, I heard that it was translated into Chinese, but did not know who the publisher was and could not secure a copy for myself. Although this book is small, it contains many practical points. It also contains many moving stories. Chapter seven on prayer is the most valuable article. The author of the book is the founder of a certain group in England. The group is not a church, but an organization established solely for the salvation of souls. The method the group uses is to write down in notebooks names of friends and relatives according to the leading of the Spirit and to pray for them. At the same time, the gospel would be shared with them until one by one they are saved. When I first became a Christian, other than The Pilgrim's Progress, this book rendered me the most help.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>RIGHTLY DIVIDING THE WORD OF GOD</H2><P>Writer: Scofield. Publisher: Morning Star Publisher, Chefoo. Price: Five cents. This book is a popular booklet among Western spiritual believers. The greatest problem with modern Bible expositions is that men do not rightly divide the teachings in the Bible. Instead, they mix up the teachings of various biblical dispensations, such as those for the Jews and those for the church, and those concerning grace and those concerning the law. In this book Dr. Scofield made clear distinctions between the different teachings. Those believers who want to study the Bible without confusion should study this book.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>CHRIST AND SOCIAL REFORM</H2><P>Writer:______. Translator:______. Price: Sixty cents. The first point about this book is that it is too expensive. A book with so-called social reform in its title is enough to make a person who firmly believes in the Bible sick at heart. Those in the Young Men's Association group talk daily about social reforms. But what I want to know is how many societies they have reformed. As long as the Christian church is here, it proves that the world cannot be reformed. If society can be reformed, then the Lord would have reformed it already. Why is there still the need for the church to be established? (The word church in the original language means "the called-out ones." If society can be reformed, one can live inside it; what need is there to be called out?) The writer wrote on page 10 about "the ideal society according to Jesus." I do not know if the Lord Jesus showed one time what an ideal society should be. The writer is a person who does not believe in the vicarious death of the Lord Jesus for sinners. He considers that the Lord Jesus only "sacrificed for His teaching," "was martyred for His teaching," and gave Himself to a "risky endeavor" (p. 20). More absurd than this is his assertion that the gospel that the Lord Jesus proclaimed was merely a "philosophy" (p. 22). He thought that when the ideal society of the Lord Jesus would appear, all the good things would happen. Later, he said that "such a world would be paradise indeed" (p. 22). Can the world become a paradise through certain kinds of philosophies? We know that the Bible never intends to reform the world. God's intention in this age is to select men out of this world for His name (Acts 15:14). He is not selecting the whole of humanity. In expounding the story of the rich man and Lazarus, the writer said, "The uneven distribution of wealth between the rich and the poor..filled Jesus with righteous indignation! Probably He thought He could change this" (p. 26). Fortunately, he used the word probably! The Lord Jesus never considered the uneven distribution of wealth between the rich and the poor as something that could be changed. The rich man was still rich at the time he died! And Lazarus was still poor at the time he died! If there was any change at all, it was after they had died! Yet even after they had died, there was still the distinction --Lazarus was still not with the rich man in the same place! In talking about social struggles, the writer quoted 1 Corinthians 12:4-6, 17-22. But I do not know how these verses can have anything to do with the social struggles that the writer talked about. On page 39 the writer talked about the "kingdom of heaven"; then on page 112 he explained the meaning of the "kingdom of heaven." The kingdom of heaven to him is just the ideal society of the Lord Jesus. He does not recognize the existence of a real kingdom and is the same as all the other modernists. On page 115 he said, "The new citizens are those who can build up Jesus' promised kingdom of heaven." That means they do not necessarily have to be saved Christians! Page 34 talks about how these new citizens come about; they come about through regeneration. "Jesus called regeneration the rejuvenating experience of confessing oneself to be a child and responding to the love of God." Is this the regeneration that the Bible talks about? Can one be regenerated just by "confessing oneself to be a child"? The reason there is regeneration is that the "self" is unreliable. Can one be regenerated without the bearing of sins on the cross? The writer did not recognize the total depravity of humanity either. "According to Jesus' teaching, everyone has a good nature within him and has the ability to do good" (p. 170). He just said this capriciously and could not quote one verse to back him up. We do not know how the writer would explain John 3:6. Can those born of the flesh evolve into a spirit? The Lord Jesus thinks that it is impossible, that there is no goodness in man. On page 183 the writer mentioned the death of the Lord Jesus as "a martyrdom," and not an act of redemption. The translation of this book is very fluent. If a reader has the intention to study sociology, he will be impressed by the beauty of the style and will recognize the Lord Jesus as the best social reformer. But this book is completely useless, even harmful, to the salvation of the soul and to leading others to believe in the Lord as their Savior. After reading this book, I was amazed by one thing: the writer only called Christ as "Jesus"; he did not call Him "Lord Jesus." The Judas of old and this writer today are of the same category. "No one can say, Jesus is Lord! except in the Holy Spirit" (1 Cor. 12:3).</P><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_110.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_112.html">Next</a> </body></html>
