   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Example Two Dying with Christ</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Romans 6:6 says, "Knowing this, that our old man has been crucified with Him in order that the body of sin might be annulled, that we should no longer serve sin as slaves."</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>This shows us that God not only caused the Lord Jesus to shed His blood on the cross so that we could be forgiven, but He also put us in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>When the Lord Jesus was crucified on the cross, God also crucified our old man with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>We have been crucified with Christ on the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>This is God's fact.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>But our human minds cannot understand this.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The Lord Jesus' crucifixion was obviously something in the past.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>How can we be joined to Him?</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>How can we as ones living today be related to Christ who was crucified more than nineteen hundred years ago?</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Thank God that one day He opened our eyes, and we saw the light.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The Bible says, "Our old man has been crucified with Him," and we also confessed that we have died.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>When we say this, we do not consider the death of Christ to be something in the past.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>We are not talking about a fact of death more than nineteen hundred years ago.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>We are saying that this fact of death is here today, living and fresh.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>It is true that Jesus died, but this truth is something we can touch and see today.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>We need to remember that everything God has done in Christ is done in the present.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Second Timothy 2:18 says, "Who concerning the truth have misaimed, saying that the resurrection has already taken place, and overthrow the faith of some."</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The people who misaimed concerning the truth did not say that there was no resurrection, but that the resurrection had already taken place.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Saying that the resurrection has already taken place is to misaim concerning the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>We need to know that resurrection has not passed away.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>It is still here today.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Did the cross pass away?</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>No, it is still here today.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Did the fact that we died with Christ pass away?</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>No, it is still here today.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>God is forever the God who now is; therefore, everything that God has done in Christ is now and forever now.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>If we consider any aspect of the work of Christ as being past, that aspect will be dead to us.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>We thank God that all that He has done in Christ is present; nothing is past.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>God put what His Son has done in the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>In the Holy Spirit there is no past, there is only now.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The work of the Lord Jesus in us is something living when we look at it through the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>But if we consider it apart from the Holy Spirit, it is just letters.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>If we read it as mere letters, it is dead.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>If we speak of it as a doctrine, it is dead, and if we consider it merely as a story, it is also dead.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Some people say, "I believe in all the facts of the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Why is it that they do not produce any effect on me?"</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Some people say, "I have heard that doctrine, but why does it not have an effect on me?"</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Others say, "I have found God's words in the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>But why do they not have an effect on me?"</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The reason is that these ones are not touching God's facts in the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Everything in Christ belongs to the past when it is viewed according to letters or when it is viewed doctrinally.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>But when it is viewed according to the Holy Spirit, nothing belongs to the past; everything is now.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Hallelujah!</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Nothing in Christ is past.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Christ is still the great "I AM" today!</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>He does not have a past; He cannot pass away.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Hallelujah!</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Our Lord cannot pass away!</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Everything in Him is full of life and fully in the Holy Spirit; nothing can pass away.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Brothers and sisters, if a person is truly under the Lord's leading and is going on all the way, he will see that everything in Christ is a matter of now; there is no past.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Christ is the Lord of today; there is no past in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Everything in Christ is always today.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>This is true with Christ's experience, and it is also true with our experience of Christ it is forever a matter of now.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>We do not have enough words to describe this kind of thing, but when the Lord's Spirit works in us and brings us into a union with Christ, we will see that all the facts in Christ are now; nothing is past, because we are joined to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>The cross of Christ, the resurrection of Christ, the ascension of Christ, and the descension of the Holy Spirit are all matters of the present.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>All that God gave us in Christ is now.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>We cannot take what God gave us in Christ as history.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>All that God has given us in Christ is now.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Thank God, Christ is still the "I AM" even today.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>He is always there and does not pass away.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>God is a God of now; there is no past in Him.</S>
