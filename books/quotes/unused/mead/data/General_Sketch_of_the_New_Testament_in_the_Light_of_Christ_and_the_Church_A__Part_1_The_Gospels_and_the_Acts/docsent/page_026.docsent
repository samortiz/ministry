   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>The Real Meaning of John 14 and 20</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>John 14 and 20 should now be very clear.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>At that time the Lord Jesus was able only to be among the disciples; He was not able to enter into them.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Therefore, the Lord needed to die and resurrect, and in so doing, He was transfigured from the flesh into the Spirit, who is a wonderful person 1 Cor 15:45b .</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>After His resurrection, the Lord still had a physical body, yet it was wonderful and mysterious.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>On the day of resurrection, He came to the disciples in this extraordinary way, not only to be with the disciples but also to enter into them as breath.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>He breathed into them and said, "Receive the Holy Spirit" John 20:22 .</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Just as the Father sent the Son, the Lord was also in the disciples and one with them to send them.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>After His death and resurrection, the Lord Himself is not only in the Father but also in the disciples.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Since the disciples are in the Lord, and the Lord is in the disciples, they are automatically in the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Therefore, where the Lord is, there the disciples are also.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>In this way the Lord brought them into God.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Now everything has been accomplished.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>God is in man, and man is in God, so God and man become a mutual abode.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>God becomes our abode, and we become God's abode mutually.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>For this reason, John 15 continues with the Lord's word to abide in Him and He in us.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>This is the proper meaning of this portion of John.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Being in the Father but Going to the Father</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>On the one hand, John 14:10 tells us that the Lord is in the Father, while on the other hand, the Lord needed to go to the Father vv.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>12, 28 .</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>When the Lord Jesus was on this earth, according to His divinity, His inward essence, He was already in the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>However, He also had another part, another nature, which is His humanity, which had not yet been transfigured to be in the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Therefore, He had to pass through death and resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>By passing through death and resurrection, His humanity was transfigured and brought into His divinity.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>KNOWING THE BASIC THOUGHT OF THIS GOSPEL AND OF THE ENTIRE NEW TESTAMENT</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>In order to understand the Gospel of John we must be very careful.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>We should not understand this portion of the Word by our human concept.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>This is a mistake made by so many Christian teachers.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>We have pointed out, for example, that many Christians teach that John 14 speaks about going to heaven, but this is inconsistent with the context of the entire Gospel of John.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The context of this entire book tells us that first God was incarnated to be a m an, and then He brought man into Himself by the death, resurrection, and ascension of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Our intention in stressing this matter is not merely to adjust and correct the wrong teachings in Christianity.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>It is to see something subjective in life.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>We must realize that it is not the Lord's intention to prepare a place for us in the heavens and then one day to bring us there.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>This is not the thought of God.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The thought of God today is to work Himself into us.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>We must realize how much we need to be wrought into God and have Christ wrought into us.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>May we all be clear that this is the basic thought of this Gospel and the basic thought of the entire New Testament.</S>
