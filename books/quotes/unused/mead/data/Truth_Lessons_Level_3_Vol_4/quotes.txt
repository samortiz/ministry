[3]  TRUTH LESSONS LEVEL THREE LESSON FIFTY-THREE THE CORPORATE EXPERIENCE
[4]  OF THE DIVINE TRINITY 1 OUTLINE By entering into the kingdom of God: Being regenerated into the kingdom of God.
[5]  Entering richly into the eternal kingdom of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ: Receiving from God s divine power all things which relate to life and godliness.
[6]  In John 3 the Lord Jesus also said to Nicodemus, Unless one is born of water and the Spirit, he cannot enter into the kingdom of God v. 5 . When we believe into the Lord, we are regenerated, and through regeneration we enter into the kingdom of God.
[7]  The believers have been regenerated into the kingdom of God John 3:3, 5 .
[8]  Likewise, without the divine life, the life of God, we could never enter into the kingdom of God.
[9]  Thus, to enter into the eternal kingdom of the Lord is related to entering into God s eternal glory, to which God has called us in Christ Jesus 1 Pet 5:10; 1 Thes 2:12 .
[10]  Beside, along with, the precious and exceedingly great promises given to us by God, we should bring in all diligence to cooperate with the enabling of the dynamic divine nature for the carrying out of God s promises to have a rich entrance into the kingdom of the Lord.
[11]  Our corporate experience of the dispensing of the Divine Trinity begins by our entering into the kingdom of God.
[12]  The New Testament shows that repentance and regeneration through believing in the Lord are not primarily for salvation but for the kingdom; moreover, God s salvation and the kingdom are mutually related.
[13]  The kingdom of God is the reign of God.
[14]  Furthermore, after we have entered into God s kingdom through regeneration, we need to continue to enter richly into the eternal kingdom of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ.
[15]  The initial entrance into the kingdom of God is through regeneration, but the rich entrance is by the full development of our experience in the divine life as revealed in 2 Peter 1:5-11.
[16]  In this lesson we will see that because we have entered into the kingdom of God, we need to live in the reality of the kingdom of the heavens Matt 5 7 .
[17]  If we desire to develop in the divine life to have a rich entrance into the eternal kingdom of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ, we need to live in the reality of the kingdom of the heavens.
[18]  Those who live in the reality of the kingdom of the heavens are poor in spirit, mourning for the present situation, meek in suffering opposition, hungry and thirsty for righteousness, merciful toward others, pure in heart, peaceful toward all men, suffering persecution for righteousness, and bearing reproach and evil speaking on behalf of the Lord.
[19]  The word spirit refers not to the Spirit of God but to our human spirit, the deepest part of our being, the organ by which we contact God and realize spiritual things.
[20]  If we are poor in spirit, the kingdom of the heavens is ours; we are in its reality now in the church age, and we will share in its manifestation in the kingdom age.
[21]  The believers who live in the reality of the kingdom of the heavens practice the higher law of the kingdom of the heavens and have the surpassing righteousness.
[22]  Righteousness does not refer only to objective righteousness, which is the Christ whom we receive when we believe in Him and thus are justified before God 1 Cor 1:30, Rom 3:26 ; it refers even more to subjective righteousness, which is the indwelling Christ lived out of us as our righteousness that we may live in the reality of the kingdom today and enter into its manifestation in the future.
[23]  Finally, if we live in the reality of the kingdom of the heavens, we need to walk on the way that leads to life and receive Christ s words as the foundation of our living and work so that we may do the Father s will.
[24]  The old man, the self, the flesh, the human concept, and the world with its glory are all excluded; only that which corresponds with God s will can enter in. If we would live in the reality of the kingdom, we first need to enter in through such a narrow gate and then to walk on such a constricted way.
[25]  The believers who live in the reality of the kingdom of the heavens, corporately experiencing the dispensing of the Divine Trinity, walk on the way that leads to life and receive the words of Christ as the foundation of their living and work so that they can do the Father s will, which is to build up the church as the corporate expression of the Triune God.
[26]  Romans 14:17 is strong proof that the church is the kingdom of God: The kingdom of God is not eating and drinking, but righteousness and peace and joy in the Holy Spirit.
[27]  Lastly, to live the kingdom life in the church we need to live a joyful life toward God in the Holy Spirit.
[28]  If we truly live the kingdom life, we will be joyful toward God and praise Him.
[29]  Throughout the centuries religion, in particular, has been utilized by God s enemy to keep God s people from entering into the full enjoyment of the all-inclusive Christ as the kingdom of God.
[30]  The kingdom of God is the church life, and the church life is the realm of the enjoyment of the resurrected and ascended Christ.
[31]  H. Saved into the Heavenly Kingdom of the Lord
[32]  Shortly before his martyrdom, Paul indicated that he firmly believed that the Lord would bring him into the heavenly kingdom.
[33]  Therefore, he said to his spiritual son Timothy, The Lord will deliver me from every evil work and will save me into His heavenly kingdom 2 Tim 4:18 .
[34]  The heavenly kingdom is the kingdom of their Father Matt 13:43 , the kingdom of My Father 26:29 , the kingdom of Christ and of God Eph 5:5 , and the eternal kingdom of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ 2 Pet 1:11 , which will be a reward to the overcoming saints.
[35]  We not only live such a kingdom life but also work for the kingdom of God, practically building up the church and thereby partaking of the kingdom.
[36]  Christ as life is the essence, the element, for us to live a proper life so that in this life we can be built together with other believers to bring in the genuine church life, the glorious expression of Christ as the embodiment of the Triune God.
[37]  Moreover, through this life, which is Christ Himself, we are able to live a life according to the constitution of the kingdom of the heavens, a life that corresponds with the reality of the nature of the kingdom, which reality is the content of the church life.
[38]  OF THE DIVINE TRINITY 5 OUTLINE As the believers family and house: The house of the living God.
[39]  In 1 Timothy 3:15 Paul tells us that the church of the living God is the pillar and base of the truth.
[40]  Truth refers to the real things revealed in the New Testament concerning Christ and the church according to God s New Testament economy.
[41]  God s New Testament economy is composed of two mysteries: Christ as the mystery of God Col 2:2 and the church as the mystery of Christ Eph 3:4 .
[42]  The church as the supporting pillar and holding base of the truth testifies the truth, the reality, of Christ as the mystery of God and the church as the mystery of Christ.
[43]  When the church grows in Christ with the growth of God Col 2:19 , the church functions as the house and household of the living God for His move on the earth and as the supporting pillar and holding base of the truth, bearing the divine reality of Christ and His Body as a testimony to the world.
[44]  According to the context, godliness in verse 16 refers not only to piety but also to the living of God in the church, that is, God as life lived out and expressed in the church.
[45]  If, through the reality of the kingdom, we have the proper church life, God s manifestation that began in Christ will be continued in the church.
[46]  The believers are in the church in the locality where they live.
[47]  Matthew 18:17 reveals that the believers should obey the church.
[48]  If a brother sins and offends us, we need to deal with him first by ourselves in love v. 15 , then by two or three witnesses v. 16 , and finally through the church with authority v. 17 . Verse 17 says, If he refuses to hear them, tell it to the church; and if he refuses to hear the church also, let him be to you just like the Gentile and the tax collector.
[49]  If any believer refuses to hear the church, he will lose the fellowship of the church and will be like the Gentile the heathen and the tax collector the sinner , who are outside the fellowship of the church.
[50]  A Gentile or a tax collector is someone who does not have fellowship in the kingdom life or in the church life.
[51]  The church revealed in Matthew 16:18 is the universal church, which is the unique Body of Christ, whereas the church revealed in Matthew 18:17 is the local church, the expression of the unique Body of Christ in a certain locality.
[52]  If we do not submit to the church, we are finished with the kingdom, for the kingdom life is a life of submission to the church.
[53]  To corporately experience the dispensing of the Divine Trinity in the church, we need to function in the church meetings.
[54]  Any emphasis on things other than Christ and the church will confuse the church and distract the church from the central lane of God s New Testament economy.
[55]  Just as children grow in a family, so believers grow in the church life.
[56]  To grow in the church is to experience the real growth in life, which is the increase of the element of God, the increase of the measure of the stature of Christ, and the gaining of ground within us by the Holy Spirit.
[57]  For the element of God to increase within us means that more of God Himself is mingled with us, is gained by us, and becomes our element.
[58]  The more we love Christ, seek after Christ, and let Christ live in us, the more the measure of the stature of Christ increases within us.
[59]  The believers are God s plants, planted in the church; the church is God s cultivated land v. 9 . God causes the believers to grow in the church as His cultivated land.
[60]  The more we experience and enjoy Christ in the church, the more we as God s plants grow in the divine life.
[61]  In the church life the believers need to forgive one another.
[62]  We have a goal in the church life, which is to build up the church.
[63]  He who overcomes, him I will make a pillar in the temple of My God, and he shall by no means go out anymore, and I will write upon him the name of My God and the name of the city of My God, the New Jerusalem, which descends out of heaven from My God, and My new name.
[64]  We can overcome the degradation of the church by the sevenfold intensified Spirit of God.
[65]  Revelation 1:4 speaks of the seven Spirits who are before His throne, and 3:1 speaks of the seven Spirits of God.
[66]  The seven Spirits are undoubtedly the Spirit of God because they are ranked among the Triune God in Revelation 1:4 and 5.
[67]  In essence and existence, God s Spirit is one; in the intensified function and work of God s operation, God s Spirit is sevenfold.
[68]  The words of the Lord in Revelation 2:7, 17, and 3:20 indicate that He desires to recover God s people to the eating of proper food, that is, to what God has ordained, as typified by the tree of life, the manna, and the produce of the good land, all of which are types of Christ as our food in various aspects.
[69]  This not only indicates that the Spirit is the Lord and the Lord is the Spirit, but it also emphasizes the vital importance of the Spirit in the darkness of the church s degradation, as indicated by the sevenfold intensified Spirit in 1:4.
[70]  Finally, the overcomers in the church will be the bride of Christ in His marriage feast Rev 19:7-8 .
[71]  The ultimate consummation of our living in the church will be our becoming the bride, the counterpart of Christ, at His coming back.
[72]  At the marriage feast of Christ, we will be His bride, receiving the reward to enter into the manifestation of the kingdom of the heavens, that is, to enter into the joy of the Lord Matt 25:21, 23 and to reign with Him for a thousand years.
[73]  God s economy in the New Testament is to obtain a bride, the church, for Christ through His redemption and divine life.
[74]  OF THE DIVINE TRINITY 8 OUTLINE By living in the Body of Christ: Being baptized in one Spirit into one Body.
[75]  In the progressing stage of God s full salvation, the stage of transformation, we corporately experience the dispensing of the Divine Trinity by entering into the kingdom of God, living in the church life, and living in the Body of Christ.
[76]  Both the framework and organic life essence of God s New Testament economy are closely related to the kingdom, the church, and the Body of Christ.
[77]  Following this, the Lord mentioned the kingdom again, saying to Peter, I will give to you the keys of the kingdom of the heavens, and whatever you bind on the earth shall have been bound in the heavens, and whatever you loose on the earth shall have been loosed in the heavens v. 19 . Here the Lord indicated that He would give the keys of the kingdom of the heavens to Peter; thus, Peter would be able to open the door for people to enter into the kingdom so that the Lord might build them into the church.
[78]  A. Being Baptized in One Spirit into One Body
[79]  The first step of our living in the Body of Christ is that we are baptized in one Spirit into one Body.
[80]  First Corinthians 12:13 says, In one Spirit we were all baptized into one Body, whether Jews or Greeks, whether slaves or free, and were all given to drink one Spirit.
[81]  The Spirit is the sphere and element of our spiritual baptism, and in such a Spirit we were all baptized into one organic entity, the Body of Christ, so we should all, regardless of our race, nationality, or social rank, be this one Body.
[82]  Christ is the life and constituent of this Body, and the Spirit is the reality of Christ.
[83]  Therefore, the believers in Christ are baptized through water and in the Spirit into Christ, the death of Christ, the name the person of the Triune God, and the Body of Christ.
[84]  We have been baptized into the Triune God, into Christ, into the death of Christ, and into the Body of Christ, but the destination of this baptism is not the Triune God, Christ, or the death of Christ; our destination is the Body of Christ.
[85]  The believers in Christ are being constituted with Christ into His one Body.
[86]  Not only were we baptized into one Body; we are being constituted with Christ to become His Body.
[87]  In Greek Christ in this verse is the Christ, referring to the corporate Christ, composed of Christ Himself as the Head and the church as His Body, of which all the believers are members.
[88]  In Revelation the church, the Body of Christ, as the embodiment of the Triune God is depicted by the golden lampstand; the golden lampstand typifies the embodied Triune God.
[89]  For the believers to corporately experience the dispensing of the Divine Trinity, three steps are needed: to enter into the kingdom and live the kingdom life, to live in the church through living the kingdom life, and to live in the Body of Christ through living in the church life.
[90]  Therefore, the believers need to live in the kingdom, in the church, and in the Body of Christ in order to corporately experience the dispensing of the Divine Trinity so that the Lord may have a way to accomplish His eternal purpose and so that they may receive a reward.
[91]  This requires that the believers as members of Christ be constituted with Christ and have His life and nature so that the church can become the Body of Christ.
[92]  If we read 1 Corinthians 12 carefully, we will see that to blend the Body is to uplift the inferior ones, to belittle the superior ones, to encourage the weaker ones, and to adorn the uncomely members with more abundant comeliness.
[93]  Romans 12 shows that after our bodies are presented to the Lord for His Body, we still need to be transformed in our soul through the renewing of our mind so that we may prove what the will of God is by producing the Body of Christ through our organic union with Him.
[94]  K. Through Living a Life of the Highest Virtues
[95]  Finally, the believers live the Body life through living a life of the highest virtues of the divine life and love vv.
[96]  Ephesians reveals that the church is the Body of Christ 1:22-23 , the kingdom of God, the household of God 2:19 , a holy temple in the Lord, and a dwelling place of God in spirit vv.
[97]  Thus, the church is not just an assembly of believers, a kingdom of heavenly citizens, a household of God s children, or even the Body of Christ.
[98]  Ephesians 1:1 through 6:9 speaks of the positive revelation of the church in its accomplishing of God s eternal purpose, whereas, on the negative side, 6:10-20 speaks of the church being a warrior to defeat God s enemy, the devil, and his spiritual forces in the heavenlies.
[99]  To deal with God s enemy, to fight against the evil forces of darkness, we need to be empowered with the great power that raised Christ from the dead and seated Him in the heavens, far above all the evil spirits in the air v. 20 . When we are empowered with the power that raised Christ from the dead and that made Him to be the Head over all things, we realize the might and strength of God.
[100]  Verse 11 says, Put on the whole armor of God that you may be able to stand against the stratagems of the devil.
[101]  To fight the spiritual warfare, we need not only the power of the Lord but also the armor of God.
[102]  The whole armor of God is for the entire Body of Christ, not for any individual member of the Body.
[103]  To sit with Christ 2:6 is to participate in all His accomplishments, to walk in His Body 4:1, 17; 5:2, 8, 15 is to fulfill God s eternal purpose, and to stand in His power is to fight against God s enemy.
[104]  The believers wrestle with the devil and his evil spiritual forces in the heavenlies, not only by being empowered in the Lord and in the might of His strength and by putting on the whole armor of God but also by praying in spirit and watching unto this in all perseverance and petition concerning all the saints and the apostle.
