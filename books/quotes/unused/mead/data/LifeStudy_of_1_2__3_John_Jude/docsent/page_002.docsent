   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>LIFE-STUDY OF FIRST JOHN MESSAGE ONE A WORD CONCERNING THE WRITINGS OF JOHN 1 Scripture Reading: 1 John 1:2-3; 2:27; 3:9; 5:4, 18</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>With this message we begin the Life-study of the Epistles of John.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>We trust in the Lord to open up the Scriptures to us again and speak a fresh word to us all.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>A REVELATION OF DIVINE THINGS</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>This message is an introductory word concerning the writings of John.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>John s writings include his Gospel, his three Epistles, and his Revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>These writings occupy a particular and striking place in the full revelation of God in the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>In his Gospel, Epistles, and Revelation John writes of things that are mysterious.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>These things are mysterious because they are divine.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Therefore, we need to see that John s writings are altogether a revelation of divine things.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Here I would emphasize two words: revelation and divine.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The entire Bible, of course, is the holy revelation of God.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The Bible was not written according to man s mind or according to human thought.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Rather, the whole Bible is the divine revelation written in human language.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Nevertheless, it is important for us to realize that this is especially true of John s writings, writings that are concerned with divine things.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Our Need for Revelation</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Because John writes about divine things, it is necessary that these things be revealed to us.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>It is not possible for the natural human mentality to guess or infer what John s writings unveil to us.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Whatever is revealed in the writings of John is far beyond our human comprehension.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Hence, there is no room here for guessing or inference.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Our mentality cannot grasp, lay hold of, the divine things revealed in John s writings.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The Gospel of John, the three Epistles of John, and the book of Revelation reveal matters that are beyond our ability to imagine.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>We cannot even conceive of these things, much less make inferences regarding them.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Because John s writings are of what is divine, we cannot with our natural mentality imagine what they contain.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Only through divine revelation can the divine things in John s writings be revealed to us.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>As we read the writings of John, it is not adequate merely to exercise our mentality.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>We need much prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>We also need to believe that today the divine Spirit is within us, in our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>We should trust in this indwelling Spirit to give us the revelation of the things contained in John s writings, and also the wisdom to grasp, lay hold of, the things we see in our spirit as a result of this revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Like the apostle Paul, we need to pray for a spirit of wisdom and revelation: That the God of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of glory, may give to you a spirit of wisdom and revelation in the full knowledge of Him Eph 1:17 .</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>It is not sufficient simply to read John s writings or meditate on them.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Neither is it sufficient only to exercise our natural understanding.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>When we come to the writings of John, we should not trust in our reading, meditating, or understanding.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>On the contrary, we should pray, Lord, I depend on You to grant me a revelation of what is contained in these writings.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Lord, I do not trust my natural ability to understand Your word.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The entire book of Revelation is a revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>This is why it opens with the words, The revelation of Jesus Christ which God gave to Him Rev 1:1 .</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The word revelation denotes the opening of a veil.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Revelation is a matter of opening a veil to show us something mysterious hidden behind the veil.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>We all need such an unveiling.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Many marvelous divine things have been concealed, but we may experience an unveiling and have these things revealed to us.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Our Need for Understanding</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Along with revelation, we also need understanding.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>We may see certain things, but we may not understand what we see.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>For example, suppose you visit a large factory and look at various kinds of machines.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>You see the machines, but you may not understand anything about them.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Although the machines have been revealed to you, you still need understanding.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The principle is the same with divine things.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>In addition to revelation, we also need wisdom for understanding.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>For this reason, Paul prayed for a spirit of wisdom and revelation.</S>
