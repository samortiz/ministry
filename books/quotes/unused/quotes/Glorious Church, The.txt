The content of The Glorious Church in this edition differs in several respects from the first American edition published in 1968
Scripture references have been updated to reflect the contents of the Recovery Version, published by Living Stream Ministry
The stress was primarily on the triumphant church, the glorious Body of Christ, the full expression of Him who fills all in all
Their record gives us a full scope of the glorious church in God's eternal plan, the church that satisfies His desire
Verse 27 reveals Gods creation of man So God created man in his own image in the image of God created he him male and female created he them
The man that God's heart was set upon was completely different from all other created beings; he was a man in His own image
; but verse 27 says, 'So God created man in his own image, in the image of God created he him; male and female created he them'
It is because there are three in the Godhead the Father, the Son, and the Spirit, yet only one has the image in the Godhead the Son
We are not minimizing the importance of redemption, but only saying that redemption was not foreordained by God
Verses 27 and 28 say, 'So God created man in his own image, in the image of God created he him; male and female created he them
The direct translation of verse two is: 'And the earth became waste and void; and darkness was upon the face of the deep'
The word 'was' in Genesis 1:2 and the word 'became' in Genesis 19:26, where Lot's wife became a pillar of salt, are the same
The Lord Jesus taught us to pray, 'Your name be sanctified; Your kingdom come; Your will be done, as in heaven, so also on earth'
After the fall of man, God spoke to the serpent, 'Upon thy belly shalt thou go, and dust shalt thou eat all the days of thy life'
We see that the creeping things occupy a very great position, for God spoke of it after He finished mentioning 'all the earth'
Not only is there the serpent, representing Satan, but also scorpions, representing the sinful and unclean evil spirits
If man has not restored the earth from the hand of Satan, he has not yet achieved God's purpose in creating him
If we are to be men whom God will use to overthrow all of Satan's work and authority, we must obey the Lord completely and absolutely!
In Genesis 3 the fall took place and sin entered; man came under the power of Satan, and everything seemed to come to an end
In addition to the passage in Genesis 1, there are two more passages in the Scriptures which are related to this problem
Even though Psalm 8 was written after man's fall, the psalmist was able to praise; his eyes were still set upon Genesis 1
The Holy Spirit did not forget Genesis 1, the Son did not forget Genesis 1, nor did God Himself forget Genesis 1
God's desire is to obtain men who are able to praise; those who can praise are those who can deal with the enemy
Starting from the third verse, the psalmist again narrates the same old story, completely ignoring the third chapter of Genesis
In this world there are some who receive many hard blows, but no one has been attacked daily and received continual blasts like God
Genesis 1 speaks of the will of God at creation Psalm 8 speaks of Gods will after mans fall and Hebrews 2 speaks of Gods will in redemption
In verses 5 through 8a the writer says, 'For it was not to angels that He subjected the coming inhabited earth, concerning which we speak
Psalm 8 said that God made man a little lower than the angels, but the apostle changed the word 'man' into 'Jesus'
God originally purposed that man should be a little lower than the angels and that man should be crowned and rule over all His creation
He intended for man to exercise authority on His behalf to cast out His enemy from the earth and from the heaven related to the earth
In His other aspect, He is a man related to us; He is our Savior, the One who has dealt with the problem of sin in our place
Verse 10 continues, 'For it was fitting for Him, for whom are all things and through whom are all things, in leading many sons into glory'
Since the Lord Jesus is the representative man, the rest will be like whatever He is, and they will enter with Him into glory
The Lord Jesus and we are all begotten of the same Father; we have all originated from the same source and have the same life
Redemption did not change God's purpose; on the contrary, it fulfilled the purpose that was not accomplished in creation
Did this mean that God could never achieve His eternal purpose, that He could no longer obtain what He was after?
In the whole world there is at least one man who chooses God a person who can say The ruler of the world is coming and in Me he has nothing
When the Lord Jesus became a man, He suffered temptation as a man and passed through all the experiences of man
We do not mean that He did not have the glory of God, but Hebrews 2 does not refer to the glory which He possessed as God
It refers to Jesus, who was made a little lower than the angels because of the suffering of death; Jesus was crowned with glory and honor
When the many sons have obtained authority and restored the earth, then they will be brought triumphantly into glory
We should never presume that God's purpose is merely to save us from hell that we may enjoy the blessings of heaven
God desires to obtain a group of men who will do His work here on this earth, that God may rule on earth through man
Our relationship with redemption is for the benefit of man, while our relationship with creation is for the economy of God
Once we have become Christians, we should not only receive the benefit of redemption but also achieve God's purpose in creation
God requires the other half, that man may rule for Him upon the earth and not allow Satan to remain here any longer
As one descends from one peak and proceeds to ascend the other, he encounters redemption at the lowest part of the valley
On the one hand, God's will is eternal and straightforward, without any dip, so that the purpose of creation may be achieved
God's will from eternity to eternity is a straight line, but ever since his fall, man has not been able to attain to it
Apart from it we would plunge lower and lower; we would be suppressed by Satan more and more until there would be no way to rise
Both redemption and creation are for the obtaining of glory and the overthrowing of all the power of the devil
The commission of the church is twofold: to testify the salvation of Christ and to testify the triumph of Christ
On the one hand, the church is to bring benefit to man, and on the other hand, it is to cause Satan to suffer loss
To cause such a God, who plans so much and who is full of life, to enter into rest requires the greatest strength
The end of Genesis 1 records that it was because 'God saw every thing that he had made, and, behold, it was very good'
If we desire to know God's will, His plan, His good pleasure, and His purpose, we have only to look at that which caused Him to rest
Man too cannot rest in that which does not satisfy him; he must gain what he is after and then he will have rest
When we have purchased a certain object with which we are particularly satisfied, we turn it around with pleasure and look it over well
Let us read Genesis 1:27-28 again: 'So God created man in his own image, in the image of God created he him; male and female created he them
Now read Genesis 1:31 with Genesis 2:3: 'And God saw every thing that he had made, and, behold, it was very good
God blessed the seventh day, and sanctified it: because that in it he had rested from all his work which God created and made'
Corinthians 15 says that Adam was a type of the Lord Jesus, and Romans 5 says that Adam was a figure of the man who was to come
We are not focusing our thoughts upon the work of Christ, but upon the position the church occupies in relation to that work
Although one appeared before the fall and the other after, there is no difference in God's sight: the church is the Eve of Genesis 2
On the sixth day God created Adam but afterward it seems that He considered a little and said No it is not good that the man should be alone
From this we realize that having Adam alone, or we may say, having Christ alone, is not enough to satisfy God's heart
the Lord God caused a deep sleep to fall upon Adam, and he slept; and he took one of his ribs, and closed up the flesh instead thereof
Adam said, This is now bone of my bones, and flesh of my flesh: she shall be called Woman, because she was taken out of Man'
The Bible says very clearly that all of the things made of earth and not taken out of the body of Adam could not be his help meet
In the Hebrew language the word 'man' is singular, but immediately following, the plural pronoun 'them' is used
Notice further that verse 27 says, 'God created man in his own image, in the image of God created he him; male and female created he them'
Oh, there are many people who think that the church is the coming together of the 'people' who believe in the Lord and who are saved
The apostle Paul clearly stated that the one loaf represents the Body of Christ, that is, the church as a whole
For many centuries throughout the world, all Christians have taken a little portion of this loaf and eaten it!
Only that which came out from Adam, not from clay, can be called 'Eve,' and only that which comes from Christ can be called the church
Eve was constituted only of that which came out of Adam, and the church, likewise, is constituted only of that which is out of Christ
If their eloquence is that which they originally had and has never been dealt with by the cross, then it is entirely from their own nature
If this is so, it is simply something out of the earthly Adam, out of the man himself, the human nature; it is something of the flesh
When they use this mind to study the Bible, instead of helping the church, they will cause the church to suffer loss
The basis of our being a part of the church is our new birth, since it is then that Christ imparts Himself to us
In the future we will see that there is only one man in Hades and only one man in the heavens; there is no third man
All of God's children, all who share the life of Christ, are not many individual men and women; they are all one man
If such a person would say to another brother or sister, 'I just cannot get through this matter by myself, would you help me'?
We must allow the Christ in us and the Christ in all the other brothers and sisters to become knit together in one Body
Many Christians know the life we have in Christ, but we must regretfully say, they do not know the life in the Body of Christ
If the church is to become a real church, two steps are necessary: the spreading or increase of Christ and the consuming of our self
The first lesson is to reject anything that comes from ourselves, and the last lesson is still to reject anything that comes from ourselves
We are not saying that we should not seek after power, but that we should seek the power which is from the Lord
He must bring us to the place where we realize that we truly can do nothing from ourselves everything must be by Him and out of Him
In the matter of serving the Lord, God must bring us to a place that we do not want anything that is not from the Lord
Let us remember that whatever comes out from man's self is just dust and not worthy of being the material for the help meet
And the Lord God caused a deep sleep to fall upon Adam, and he slept; and he took one of his ribs, and closed up the flesh instead thereof
Adam said, This is now bone of my bones, and flesh of my flesh: she shall be called Woman, because she was taken out of Man'
If death had been mentioned, then sin would be involved, because verse 17 in the preceding passage says that death and sin are related
Since man fell, Christ came to redeem us in order to bring us back to the original purpose of God's creation of man
Because of these two distinct aspects in the death of Christ, the Bible uses two different substances to typify them
John 19:34 says that the water flowed out from Him, and in chapter twenty, the Lord pointed out His side to His disciples
Let us read Genesis 2:22 and 23 again: 'And the rib, which the Lord God had taken from man, made he a woman, and brought her unto the man
According to 1 Corinthians 15, Christ died for our sins, but Ephesians 5 says that Christ loved the church and gave Himself for it
It is true that God knew that man fell and needed to be redeemed, but marvelously, along another line, He did not see sin at all
Asenath's marriage to Joseph and her bearing sons in Egypt typifies the church being chosen out of the world unto God
There is no other type similar to it because Eve portrays the church as it really is in God's mind and the place it has in His eternal plan
Eve came out of Adam and was wholly for Adam; even so, the church comes out of Christ and is wholly for Christ
That which is completely without sin is called Eve, and that which is wholly out of Christ is called the church
We must see that the church is the vessel chosen by God to manifest His Son, Christ, and to achieve His eternal purpose
He wants us to have an entirely new view of the church; He wants us to see that she is not related to sin at all
When we give our praises to Him in eternity, it will not be necessary for us to mention what kind of sinners we have been
When He purposes something, even though Hades and all of creation's forces would rise to oppose Him, He cannot be resisted
In the same way the husbands also ought to love their own wives as their own bodies; he who loves his own wife loves himself
For no one ever hated his own flesh, but nourishes and cherishes it, even as Christ also the church, because we are members of His Body'
The first section says that Christ 'loved' the church and 'gave' Himself up for her these verbs are in the past tense
The first section refers to the church as the bride of Christ; the second section speaks of the church as the Body of Christ
Concerning the present, the church is the Body of Christ, and the Lord is presently nourishing and cherishing His church
Whenever God's Word speaks of the oneness between Christ and the church, we see Christ as the Head and the church as His Body
Whenever the Word shows the distinction between Christ and the church, we see the church as the bride to Christ
Adam and Eve were spoken of as two becoming 'one flesh,' but they were still two persons; God still counted them as two
One day, when the church is mature in life, God will bring the church to Christ; in that day she will become the bride of Christ
God will not bring the church to Christ as His bride until the work of the church as the Body of Christ has been accomplished
When all the birds of the air were brought to him, Adam did not take any of them as his help meet, for they were not out of him
There are many people who feel that they should offer all that they are and all that they have for the Lord's use
They think that everything will be fine as long as they offer themselves, their abilities, their talents, and all they have to the Lord
We must remember that Christ will accept only that which comes out of Himself; He will not accept anything which comes out of man
The matter we need to attend to is this: only that which is out of Christ can be of any value and spiritual use in the church
In spite of this, man's natural ability and intelligence that which has not been dealt with by the cross are of no spiritual use
In the same way the husbands also ought to love their own wives as their own bodies; he who loves his own wife loves himself
If a normal person hurts his hand, he carefully cherishes his hand; if his foot is injured, he tenderly cares for it
The outstanding feature of this book is that it does not start with sinners being saved but with our having been chosen in eternity
The book of Ephesians reveals two lines: one is from eternity to eternity, and the other is from man's fall to his redemption
On the other hand we need to see that we are just a group of sinners saved by grace therefore we need the washing of the water in the word
In Matthew 4:4 Jesus said, 'It is written, 'Man shall not live on bread alone, but on every word that proceeds out through the mouth of God'
One day a messenger came to tell a mother that her son had been run over by a car and was at the point of death
They were very familiar with it and could recite the Old Testament commandments very well, but it was of no use to them
Peter remembered the word, how Jesus had said to him, Before a rooster crows twice, you will deny Me three times
Before the Lord Jesus came, God spoke His word to Simeon that he would not see death until he had seen the Lord's Christ
On the day he saw the Lord Jesus, Simeon said, 'Now You release Your slave, Master, according to Your word, in peace'
The rhema reveals something to us personally and directly; it shows us what we need to deal with and what we need to be cleansed from
Luke 3:2 says, 'During the high priesthood of Annas and Caiaphas, the word of God came to John the son of Zachariah in the wilderness'
It is true that the word spoken by God in the past and the word He speaks today carry the same authority; they have never changed
While Peter was preaching to the household of Cornelius, the Spirit of the Lord fell upon them, and the word of the Lord came to Peter
It is not that there was something wrong with the message, but it was all the general word of the Lord; there was no rhema in it
The problem with the church today is that it lacks the living word of the Lord; instead there are only dead doctrines
Her defect is not that the Christ whom she has received is too little, but that she has too many things other than Christ
The church in God's will comes entirely out of Christ, without any sin, without any flesh, and containing no natural life
At the beginning we do not feel anything while we are engaged in a certain matter; in fact, we feel that everything is fine
If the Lord first gives us rhema, speaking to us first, then we still need to ask Him to supply us with life to deal with the matter
The reason the Body of Christ cannot be built is because we merely have something outward, not something inward
In His magnificent work, the Lord is using the words He speaks as the instrument to bring the church back to God's original purpose
All doctrine, teaching, theology, and knowledge are of little use if they just flow from one person to another
If we do something just because others tell us to do it, we are keeping the law; we are not in the New Testament
A person with a clear mind can divide the book of Romans into sections, such as 'Salvation,' 'Justification,' etc
When God speaks to us through His word, we are enlightened; through His word we are sanctified; and through His word we are made to grow
Ephesians 4 says that the church will arrive at the oneness of the faith and the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ
The Lord will cleanse us to such a degree that it will seem as if the church has never had any spot or defilement
The Lord wants to bring the church to the stage where there is nothing old, where there is nothing of the past
When the church stands before the Lord, it will seem as if she has never sinned, as if she has never had any history of sin
She will not only be without spot and wrinkle, but she will not have any defect whatsoever; all the defects will have been excluded
The day is coming when God's work upon the church will be brought to such a stage that she will be completely glorious
As His Body, Christ is purging and preparing us so that we may become the church which God intended from eternity
When the time arrives, Christ will come, and we will be brought into His presence to be presented to Him as a glorious church, His bride
Rather, may we be those who hearken to Him and go forward so that the church may be brought to the stage of being the Bride of Christ
Chapter five tells how the church will be a glorious church, without spot or wrinkle or any such things, holy and without blemish
When we read Ephesians 6:10-12, we realize that the work and responsibility of the church is spiritual warfare
Therefore take up the whole armor of God that you may be able to withstand in the evil day, and having done all, to stand
The spiritual warfare is defensive, not offensive, because the Lord Jesus has already fought the battle and won the victory
The starting point of spiritual warfare is standing upon the victory of Christ; it is seeing that Christ has already overcome
Wherever the devil has been cast out, wherever the work of the enemy has been displaced by God's power, His kingdom is there
Not only does the Lord Jesus Himself represent the kingdom of God, the church also represents the kingdom of God
The important point here is not a matter of future reward or position in the kingdom, whether large or small, high or low
We must stand on the position of the kingdom of God whenever we work, and we must apply the kingdom of God to deal with the power of Satan
The fiery darts of Satan can penetrate our flesh, but, praise God, we can put on Christ who has won the victory
Redemption solves the problem of man's moral responsibility and man's loss, but the loss which God suffered has not been solved
Man's moral responsibility has been dealt with by the cross, but the problem of Satan's authority must be dealt with by the kingdom
Man was originally given the responsibility to overthrow the authority of Satan, but instead man fell, leaving the authority to Satan
Revelation 11:15 says, 'The kingdom of the world has become the kingdom of our Lord and of His Christ, and He will reign forever and ever'
When God sees that the church has sufficiently fulfilled this task, the kingdom will come, and the new heaven and the new earth will follow
On the one hand, we must lead the people of the world to be saved, and on the other hand, we must stand fast for the kingdom
While we allow God to exercise His authority in the heavens, we must also allow Him to exercise His authority over us
Not only must we seek to live before God according to Ephesians 5, but we must also pursue the responsibility revealed to us in Ephesians 6
We have already seen the woman in Genesis 2 and how she speaks of the man whom God in His eternal will desires to obtain to glorify His name
There are a total of twenty-two chapters in this book, but by the end of chapter eleven we can say that everything is finished
Revelation 10:7 says, 'But in the days of the voice of the seventh angel when he is about to trumpet, then the mystery of God is finished'
All the visions from chapter four to chapter eleven, when the seventh angel sounds the trumpet, are based upon the throne
What is the basis upon which God will cause the kingdom of this world to become the kingdom of our Lord and of His Christ?
Although the nation of Israel was scattered, her going into the wilderness was not the result of Christ's ascension
Chapter seventeen tells us that these seven heads are seven kings: five have fallen, one is still existing, and the other has not yet come
Ephesians 6 tells us that the church on earth must still battle with the rulers, authorities, and spiritual forces of evil in the heavenlies
Since this portion of Scripture has not yet occurred, it is impossible for it to be a reference to the time of Jesus
After Mary gave birth to the Lord Jesus she did flee to Egypt; however, she did not do this at the Lord's ascension
The serpent cast water as a river out of his mouth after the woman that he might cause her to be carried away by its current
The earth helped the woman, and the earth opened its mouth and swallowed the river which the dragon cast out of his mouth'
After the man-child, who was born of the woman, was caught up to the throne, a remnant of her seed still remained upon the earth
In this way, we see that the woman is not only related to the age of grace, but also to the age of the law and the age of the patriarchs
She includes all the saints in the age of grace, as well as all the saints from the ages of the law and the patriarchs
Revelation 12:2 says, 'And she was with child, and she cried out, travailing in birth and being in pain to bring forth'
Immediately after he is delivered, he is caught up to the throne of God, while his mother flees into the wilderness
Revelation 12:4 begins, 'And his tail drags away the third part of the stars of heaven, and he cast them to the earth'
One third of the angels in heaven were deceived by the dragon, and they fell and were cast down with the dragon
Verse 4 continues And the dragon stood before the woman who was about to bring forth so that when she brings forth he might devour her child
The last part of Galatians 4:27 says, 'Because many are the children of her who is desolate rather than of her who has her husband'
The Jerusalem that is above is the New Jerusalem, and the New Jerusalem is the woman, the goal which God desires to obtain in eternity
When the Word says that the Jerusalem which is above has many children, it does not mean that the mother and the children are separate
When we look at the totality of the people in God's purpose, we see the woman; if we look at them separately, we see many sons
There it says that some will be caught up in the clouds, while here it says that the man-child was caught up to the throne of God
The fleeing of the woman into the wilderness and the warfare in heaven are both due to the man-child being caught up
When this warfare takes place in heaven, Michael and his angels fight against the dragon, who is the old serpent
Once the man-child is caught up, not only is the dragon unable to be enlarged any further, but he is cast down from heaven
According to Luke 10:18, which is based upon verse 17, Satan is cast down from heaven because the church casts out demons
All of his power can be brought to an end by God's children on earth repeatedly dealing with him, instance after instance
Since the church, however, has not attained to God's purpose, nor does she even know God's purpose, what can God do?
The worshiping of idols is the greatest sin, so God required these men to slay their own brothers with the sword
We must remember that the Levites did not serve God for themselves, nor were they overcomers by their own selection
During the time of the Judges, the people of Israel were oppressed by the Midianites and were in great desperation
God originally promised that after the seventy years of captivity, the people of Israel would return and be restored to the land
Not all returned; only a minority led by Ezra, Nehemiah, Zerubbabel, and Joshua came back to build the temple and the city of Jerusalem
The principle of the overcomers is not that an individual who is especially spiritual will have a crown and glory waiting for him
There is only a group of people left to do that work for the church and to take up the church's responsibility
The reason we are considering this matter of the man-child is because in God's eternal purpose He needs a group of overcomers
Revelation 12:10 says, 'The accuser of our brothers has been cast down, who accuses them before our God day and night'
He likes to accuse people to such an extent that they consider themselves useless and thus lose all their ground for fighting with him
When he kneels down to pray, he will feel that he is wrong and does not even believe that God will answer his prayer
The main concern of Christians like this is not how glorious and victorious the Lord Jesus is, but how evil and worthless they are
There are many of God's children whose consciences are so weak that they have no real awareness of the work of the Lord Jesus
He accuses us in our conscience as well as before God until our conscience becomes so weak that it cannot be strengthened
We must not only reject the accusations which are without cause, but we must also reject all the accusations which have cause
When God's children have done something wrong, we need only the blood of Jesus, His Son, not the accusations of Satan
The blood of Jesus, God's Son, does not wash us of one or two sins, or even many sins, but it cleanses us from every sin
When we commit sin, we do not glorify God, but when we do not trust the precious blood, we dishonor Him even more
Every time we come before God, our only qualification is that we have been redeemed, not that we have advanced in our Christian life
Sometimes when we have sinned, Satan comes to accuse us, and sometimes when we have not sinned, Satan still comes to accuse us
Since we have been cleansed by the blood and justified by the blood we are under no obligation whatsoever to accept the accusations of Satan
Hebrews 10:2 says, 'Because those worshipping, having once been purified, would have no longer had the consciousness of sins
It takes only a moment of time for man to receive Him as Savior, but it is a lifelong matter to face the accusations of Satan
It would be ridiculous if we believed the words of the accuser while our Mediator is in the very act of defending us
If we realized the value of the blood, there would be a great increase of peaceful and joyful Christians on the earth today
We should deal with the power of Satan according to God's valuation of the blood, not according to our valuation of the blood
When you have the blood before God, you will have boldness before God, and you will have a testimony before man
Testimony' means to tell others what there is in Christ, and the word of testimony is something which must be spoken forth
Satan does not fear when we talk theology or when we expound the Scriptures, but he does fear when we declare the spiritual facts
Many people speak about Jesus as the Lord and explain how Jesus is the Lord, but Satan is not afraid in the least
We can say, 'The Lord Jesus is stronger than the strong man,' or, 'The Son of God has already bound Satan,' etc
Christians must rely upon prayer in everything, but sometimes the word of our testimony is more effective than prayer
The Lord Jesus did not say that what a person prays will come to pass, but that what a person says will come to pass
In Acts 16 when Paul cast out the demon he also used the word of proclamation I charge you in the name of Jesus Christ to come out of her
A woman who was possessed of a demon was there, and a member of her family invited the two sisters to go to her home to cast out the demon
We further proclaim that the Lord has given us authority to tread upon serpents and scorpions and to overcome all the power of the enemy
The work of the Lord has not only given us the blood to protect us, but also the word of testimony by which we can defeat Satan
They face trials and encounter many difficulties, yet Revelation 12:11 says, 'They loved not their soul-life even unto death'
Oh, we all must be brought by God to the place where we are trembling and fearful lest we do anything without the Lord
We will consider ourselves to be quite satisfactory, yet our inward condition will be even more difficult to deal with
We all must be brought by God to the place where we see that we can do nothing in the church with our natural strength
That which passes through the cross and rises up again is of God; anything which is not able to rise is of man
Our attitude is that we will not live by ourselves in any way; we will not value our own ability or have any self-confidence
Although there is a long distance between them, the last two chapters of Revelation correspond with the first three chapters of Genesis
God created the heaven and the earth in Genesis, and the new heaven and the new earth are in the last two chapters of Revelation
In Genesis there is gold, pearl , and a kind of precious stone , and in Revelation there is gold, pearl, and all kinds of precious stones
If we read the Scriptures carefully, we will see that Genesis 1 through 3 does indeed correspond with Revelation 21 and 22
Even though these four women appear to be different when we speak of them separately, they are the same when we put them together
Since the Lord Jesus is the Lamb, it is impossible for the woman in Ephesians 5 to be anyone other than the wife of the Lamb
The woman in Ephesians 5 is also likened to Eve, and Eve is also likened to the wife of the Lamb in Revelation 21
As a result, God in eternity future will indeed obtain a woman, a ruling woman who has dealt thoroughly with Satan
Of the two women spoken of in Revelation 17:1-3 and 21:9-10, one is called the great harlot, and the other is called the bride
Why does God deal with Babylon and why is it necessary to wait until Babylon is judged before the wife of the Lamb appears?
The principle of the tower of Babel involves the attempt to build up something from earth to reach unto heaven
They do not stand in a position where they are truly able to say, 'Lord, if You do not give us grace, we cannot do anything'
Another man who is very clever receives some help and possesses some knowledge and then becomes a Christian worker
Man's difficulty is that he does not see that he is under judgment, nor does he see that he is just dust and clay
God destroyed man's plan to build the tower of Babel in order to show man that he is useless in spiritual matters
When one puts on a beautiful garment, it means that he adorns himself to improve his appearance and to add a little luster to himself
Achan's coveting of the Babylonian garment meant that he was seeking to improve himself, to make himself look better
We are not saying that we should not use certain things at all, but we are saying that anything in excess is luxury
Regardless of whether it is clothing, food, or housing, if it is excessive or beyond our need, it is luxury and in the principle of Babylon
God's children must learn from the depths of their spirit to separate themselves from Babylon and to judge all her actions
The twenty-four elders and the four living creatures fell down and worshipped God, who sits upon the throne, saying, Amen, Hallelujah'!
The actual judgment will be performed by God in the future, but the spiritual judgment must be made by us today
Those who destroy the earth' in Revelation 11:18 are of this woman, of whom it is written in chapter nineteen that she 'corrupted the earth'
We need God to enlighten us so that in His light we may judge everything in us which is not absolute toward Him
The Lord requires that we delight and seek to be one who is absolute, not one who is living in the principle of Babylon
Revelation 195 says And a voice came out from the throne saying Praise our God all His slaves and those who fear Him the small and the great
These are declarations from heaven, signifying the time when God speaks, the place where God speaks, and what His emphasis is on
The voice from heaven proclaims that all of God's servants, all who belong to God, both small and great, must praise Him
When the voice from the throne declared that praise be given to God, there was a host of echoes resounding throughout the universe
When you listen to the noise of a great waterfall or the waves of the ocean, you will realize how loud a voice of many waters can be
Regardless of how much weakness there has been, both yesterday and today, God will obtain His determined will in that day
Please note that chapter nineteen does not speak of the marriage of the Lamb, it simply says that the marriage of the Lamb has come
At that time, if we look back, we will see that the harlot has fallen, and if we look forward, we will see the new heaven and the new earth
In chapter nineteen, the declaration that the wife has made herself ready is spoken while looking upon the overcomers
We must bear in mind that what the overcomers accomplish is not for themselves alone, but for the whole church
We must remember this one thing all of our seeking and all of our growth is not for us as individuals, but for the Body
When your mouth says something wrong, you cannot deny that you have spoken wrongly, because your mouth and body are united
When we were saved, we began to obtain a fine linen garment for our adornment the righteousnesses of the saints
Verse 13 says, 'The King's daughter is all glorious within the royal abode;/Her garment is a woven work inwrought with gold'
The righteousness which the Lord Jesus gave us, the clothing which He put upon us when we were saved was something of gold
Later, something is sewed into it with thread, and by this sewing work, the original material and the thread become one
The Gospels record many righteous acts, such as Mary's act of expressing her love to the Lord by anointing Him with ointment
The Bible tells us that whoever will give only a cup of cold water unto a little one will by no means lose his reward
We must not be afraid of hardship, neither must we long for a smooth pathway, because days of difficulty can make us shine
He is continually expending much effort upon us so that we may be white, and He is continually laboring upon us to make us shining
The fear of hardship, the fear of trouble, and the longing for an easy way and a smooth path will cause us to lose our brightness
The fine linen garment tells us that God not only requires man to have God's righteousness, but also his own righteous deeds
God not only intends to obtain His righteousness in us, but He also intends to obtain many righteousnesses in us
Oh, there can be no other privilege, no other position higher than this to be called to the marriage dinner of the Lamb
Those who are called will be together with the Lord enjoying a unique and special fellowship, which no one has ever tasted before
In chapter nineteen there is a declaration that the marriage of the Lamb has come and His wife has made herself ready
How can the words, 'The kingdom of the world has become the kingdom of our Lord and of His Christ,' be spoken at this time?
It is possible because this declaration was made at the beginning of things, not at the point of their accomplishment
In chapter nineteen God makes another declaration, saying that the marriage of the Lamb has come and that His wife has made herself ready
Today we may say that God's standard for the church is high and ask how the church will ever attain to such a condition
We may not know how God will do it, but we do know that the church will attain to that position at the time of the new heaven and new earth
All that the Scriptures have ever said about the blessing in eternity is summed up in these words, 'God Himself will be with them'
The heaven and the heaven of heavens cannot contain Him, but we may say that the New Jerusalem can contain Him
Now in the new heaven and new earth, the woman and the holy city are one; they are no longer two separate entities
Since the New Jerusalem is the woman, the New Jerusalem is the wife of the Lamb; therefore, the woman and the holy city are one
Not only so, but God's throne is established in the New Jerusalem, or we may say that God Himself dwells within this woman
Sorrow or mourning is the aching of our heart, the feeling of inward suffering; crying is the weeping without, the outward expression
The difficulty that we face today is that even though we are the new creation, we still live in the old creation
Regardless of the church's condition in her present experience, she will have no spot, wrinkle, or any such things in God's goal
No matter how weak, how indifferent, or how hardened we are, there will be a day when God will smash us to pieces
The man-child in the age of the kingdom is constituted of a minority, but in the New Jerusalem, the entire Body overcomes
In God's eyes and in the eyes of those who are inspired by the Holy Spirit, the harlot is one who dwells in the wilderness
He commanded him to go up to the top of Mount Pisgah and lift up his eyes to behold the land which He had promised
We must realize that whenever we take this position, God's eternal plan is nothing more to us than doctrine and knowledge
There must be overcomers to bring in the kingdom, and then there must be overcomers to bring in the new heaven and new earth
After John saw the New Jerusalem, he did a very foolish thing he fell down to worship before the feet of the angel
The angel said that he would show him the wife of the Lamb, but John saw 'the holy city, Jerusalem, coming down out of heaven from God'
The city is a figure, describing the characteristics and spiritual condition of the corporate Body whom God chose before creation
God not only is concerned about the destination of this corporate man, but also about the place from which this corporate man comes
How we thank God that on one hand we were purchased with the precious blood of the Lord, and on the other hand, we were truly born of God
Among Christians there are some who are taken up with greatness, but there are some who pay attention to holiness
Only that which issues from God is of value; that which comes out from God, and only that, is the New Jerusalem
It is because they have so many things which are not of Christ, and anything that is not of Christ cannot be brought to heaven
What we realize today is quite obscure in many areas, but in that city the glory of God has the brightness of jasper
They will come from the east and the west, and from the north and the south, and will recline at table in the kingdom of God'
These two groups of people are participants in the kingdom of God; therefore, they will all enter into the New Jerusalem together
From Abel at the beginning and for all the saints in the Old Testament, God has appointed a city, the New Jerusalem
From this we see that both the saints of the Old Testament and the saints of the New Testament will be in the New Jerusalem
Ephesians 2:11-14 says, 'Therefore remember that once you, the Gentiles in the flesh, those who are called uncircumcision,
To reconcile 'both in one Body' to God means that the Old Testament saints as well as the New Testament saints are reconciled to God
Then you are no longer strangers and sojourners, but you are fellow citizens with the saints and members of the household of God'
The saints in Ephesus were no longer strangers but fellow citizens with the saints and members of the household of God
In conclusion, at the time of the new heaven and new earth, all those who have the life of God will be included in the New Jerusalem
Verse 17 says, 'And he measured its wall, a hundred and forty-four cubits, according to the measure of a man, that is, of an angel'
It includes and keeps everything that is within the city, and it excludes and rejects everything that is outside the city
When Nehemiah returned to Jerusalem to build the wall, Sanballat and Tobiah came and made every effort to stop the building
The city has twelve gates and twelve foundations, and on the foundations are the names of the twelve apostles of the Lamb
The city has three gates on the east, three gates on the north, three gates on the south, and three gates on the west
Formerly cherubim guarded the way of the tree of life, but now the tree of life in the city is guarded by angels at the gates
The city being measured with gold means that the city can be measured by God's standard and corresponds with God's standard
We need to seek God's glory, hoping that we will be able to meet God's standard when we are measured in that day
He measured the city with the reed to a length of twelve thousand stadia; the length and the breadth and the height of it are equal'
There is another place in the Bible where the measurements of length breadth and height are equal that is the Holy of Holies in the temple
And the oracle in the forepart was twenty cubits in length, and twenty cubits in breadth, and twenty cubits in the height thereof'
In the Bible, only the Holy of Holies in the temple and the city of the New Jerusalem have equal measurements of length, breadth, and height
Revelation 21:17 says, 'And he measured its wall, a hundred and forty-four cubits, according to the measure of a man, that is, of an angel'
Everything that is dead and everything that is of man is outside the city, but inside everything is resurrected and of God
Everything that is of man once it dies can never be raised up but everything that is of God though it passes through death will rise again
When that which originates from us passes through the cross, it is brought to an end, but nothing of God can be touched by death
In the first part of Revelation, there are many sevens seven churches, seven seals, seven trumpets, seven bowls, seven angels, etc
Anything which is added can also be subtracted and thereby lost again; so this completion is not a lasting one
The function of the city wall, as we have seen, is to separate that which is within the city from that which is without
The fact that this wall is made of jasper means that the separation is based upon what is seen in God's true light
Before we were saved, everything in us was of the flesh, everything was natural; there was nothing whatever of a spiritual nature
It is regrettable, however, that although we have this gold in us, it is mixed with many other things; it is an alloy
We have God's nature, but at the same time, we also have many things in us which are completely different from God
From the day we were saved, God has been doing this work, and the instrument for this work of subtraction is the cross
What God has put into us is pure gold but because there is so much dross in us so many things which are not of God we have become an alloy
God must expend much effort to make us see those things in us which are of self and those things which cannot bring glory to Him
We believe that if God speaks to us, we will discover that what needs to be removed is much more than what needs to be added
Day after day and year after year, God wrought something into Jacob which caused him to become a precious stone
That life which God has imparted to us is the gold, while the life which God is constituting in us is the precious stone
God does not stop by just giving us a portion of Christ's life; He wants to have the life of Christ wrought into us
On one hand, we must realize that except for the Lord's life in us we are not any different than we were prior to our salvation
It seems that the things which other people encounter are all good, but the things which you are up against are not prosperous or easy
They were not formed by God in a moment of time but obtained after being wrought upon through long years of God's working
When the fire burns in a certain way a certain kind of mineral is melted into that substance and it becomes a certain kind of precious stone
Even so, precious stone is something formed in us through the Holy Spirit by means of many different circumstances
Not only has God shared His nature with us, but day by day He is making us a certain kind of people who can bring glory to His name
In the ensuing days, God may have put you into certain circumstances in order to give you certain kinds of experience
We all have gold in common before God, but after we become precious stones before Him, we will each be a certain form
In many of God's children who have walked with Him for ten or twenty years, there is something which God has wrought through the Holy Spirit
It is not just that God has imparted something to them, but they themselves have become that something; it is their very constituent
We should never refuse the discipline of the Holy Spirit, nor complain when God's hand encircles and encloses us in every way
God has not only given us His life, but He is also working in us to the extent that we may possess a special quality
Sometimes when we sit in the presence of an elderly person, we feel that he is one who is really walking with the Lord
In the presence of such a one we can only bow and say, 'How we wish that we also may have something that is so inspiring, so touching'
Verse 21 continues, 'And the twelve gates were twelve pearls; each one of the gates was, respectively, of one pearl'
Pearls are not formed by burning; they are the result of a gradual formation within a sea creature after it has been wounded
Corinthians 3:12 says that spiritual building should have materials of gold, silver, and precious stones, not wood, grass, or stubble
In Revelation 21, in the New Jerusalem, there are once again gold, precious stones, and pearl; there is no silver
Gold, precious stones, and pearl these three items are found both in the garden of Eden and in the New Jerusalem
A street is a place for communication, and since the street of this city is of pure gold, the people who walk upon it will never be dirty
Today those who have bathed still need to have their feet washed in order to maintain their fellowship with God
When we walk on the street of this world, we cannot avoid gathering some dust, and our fellowship with God is thus frustrated
Every Christian should be transparent today, for in that day, in the presence of God, we will all be transparent
The temple was the place set aside for God, and it was to that place that man had to go for fellowship with God
No one could pass through this veil and enter into God's presence except the High Priest, and then only once a year
Those who are on the new earth will still have a body of flesh and blood; they are the people and the nations of the earth
The wall of this city has three gates in each direction: on the east, west, south, and north a total of twelve gates
Since all those who dwell in the city will have resurrected bodies, they will never feel tired; they can serve God constantly day and night
The kings of the earth will not only bring their glory to the city, but they will bring the glory and the honor of the nations into it
There are those who will be transferred from the millennium they will continue to live and become the inhabitants of the new earth
Recalling the book of Genesis, God created man as a type of Christ and the woman as a type of the church he desired to obtain in Genesis 2
The woman in Genesis could be driven away, while the woman at the end of Revelation can no longer be driven out
We can answer that it is impossible for this to happen again, because in eternity God Himself will dwell in the holy city
Psalm 46:4 says: 'There is a river whose streams gladden the city of God,/The holy place of the tabernacles of the Most High'
Verse 2 says, 'And on this side and on that side of the river was the tree of life, producing twelve fruits, yielding its fruit each month'
In the new heaven and new earth, the people of the nations will have no sin, no death, no pain, no curse, nor any demons
As we learn to follow the Lord, all our conduct should include the river of water of life and the tree of life
In order to move about we need to have all of our activities based upon the tree of life not upon the tree of the knowledge of good and evil
When the life within us generates the activity, the result will be the outflow of the river of the water of life in the Spirit
If there is not the life of the Lord and if there is not the outflow of the river of water of life in the Spirit, we cannot move
If we act according to the moving of the life within, the result will be that the water of life will flow out to others
On the one hand, God wanted man to be like Himself, and on the other hand, God's appointed work for man was that he should rule
May He show us the kind of people He desires to obtain and how precious is that which He has set His heart upon
The seed of the woman in Genesis 3 primarily refers to the Lord Jesus, but the overcomers also have a part in this seed
God's binding in heaven is based on our binding on earth; God's loosing in heaven is based on our loosing on earth
Because of this the twelve apostles have a special position not even Paul is reckoned with them; they were a dispensational instrument
Of all the dispensational moves the manchild is the greatest because it removes mans power and the devils power and it brings in the kingdom
