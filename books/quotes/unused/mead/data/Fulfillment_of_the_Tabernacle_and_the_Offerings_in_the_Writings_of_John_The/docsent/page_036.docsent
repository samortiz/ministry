   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE NEED OF REGENERATION</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The serpent is mentioned in John 3 in such a way as to indicate that we, fallen human beings, are all serpentine.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>We are not only sinners; we are serpentine because we were bitten by the old serpent.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>To be sure, when Nicodemus came to the Lord Jesus that night, he certainly did not have any realization that he was serpentine.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>He probably regarded himself as a God-seeking and God-fearing man, as a man who tried to please God by keeping the law of God and who taught the Scriptures to the children of Israel.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Nicodemus, however, was not satisfied with the law or with the teachings in the Old Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>He had heard about Jesus the Nazarene and what signs He had done.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Nicodemus may have seen some of these signs, and he may also have heard the Lord speak.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>But he did not dare to come to Him directly, because that would have been a shame for a man of his position.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>This was the reason Nicodemus came to the Lord at night.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>We know that Nicodemus respected the Lord Jesus by the way he spoke to Him in verse 2.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Nicodemus said, "Rabbi, we know that you are a teacher come from God; for no one can do these signs that you do unless God is with him."</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Among the Jews, rabbi was the highest title that could be given to anyone.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Not only did Nicodemus call the Lord a rabbi; he also recognized that He came from God.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>He knew that as God had sent Moses to the fathers, so He had sent the Lord Jesus to them.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Nicodemus seemed to be saying, "The other Pharisees may not respect you, but I do.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>I respect you as a rabbi sent to us by God.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Surely you can give me some better teachings.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>As a teacher of the Scriptures, I want to receive more teachings, better teachings, higher teachings."</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>However, the Lord Jesus answered Nicodemus not with teachings, but with a clear word about being born again: "Truly, truly, I say to you, unless a man is born anew, he cannot see the kingdom of God" v. 3 . Here the Lord Jesus seemed to be telling Nicodemus, "You come to Me for teachings.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>But you do not need more teaching you need to be born again.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Nicodemus, you need another birth."</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>In speaking with Nicodemus, the Lord Jesus was wise.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>He did not tell him frankly and directly that he was serpentine.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The Lord did not say, "Nicodemus, because you are serpentine, you need to be born again."</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>First the Lord told Nicodemus that he needed to be born again.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Only later did He bring in the matter of the brass serpent.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>In the conversation between Nicodemus and the Lord Jesus there were two sides, the side of Nicodemus and the side of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>As an elderly man, Nicodemus was religious, ethical, and moral.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>What he said to the Lord here is natural, religious, moral, ethical, and human.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The Lord's way of speaking to Nicodemus was not religious, ethical, moral, or human.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The Lord told him that it was necessary for him to be born anew.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Moses did not teach this.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Neither was it taught by Confucius or the Greek philosophers.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>This word is something beyond religion, ethics, morality, and philosophy.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>No doubt, the Lord's word about being born anew was puzzling to such a religious and ethical person as the elderly Nicodemus.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Nicodemus said to the Lord, "How can a man be born when he is old?</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>He cannot enter the second time into his mother's womb and be born, can he?" v. 4 . Although the Lord's word about being born anew was something beyond human thought, the question Nicodemus asked in verse 4 indicates that he brought the Lord's word down to the human level.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>He thought that to be born anew required a return to the mother's womb to be born a second time.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>But even if such a thing were possible, we would still have our serpentine nature.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Being reborn physically would do nothing to change this.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>As the Lord says in verse 6, "That which is born of the flesh is flesh."</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Here the Lord seems to be saying, "Even if you could go back again and again to your mother's womb to be born, you would still be flesh."</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>In the sight of God, this flesh contains the poison of the old serpent.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Our flesh is altogether serpentine.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The Lord was patient with Nicodemus and went on to say in verse 5, "Truly, truly, I say to you, unless a man is born of water and the Spirit, he cannot enter into the kingdom of God."</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>We have seen that water is the central concept of the ministry of John the Baptist, that is, to terminate those of the old creation.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Spirit is the central concept of the ministry of the Lord Jesus, that is, to germinate people in the new creation.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>These two main concepts put together are the whole concept of the matter of regeneration.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Regeneration is the termination of those of the old creation with all their deeds and their germination in the new creation with the divine life.</S>
