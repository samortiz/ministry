IN THE LORD&rsquo;S MOVE</h2>
<p>It is clear in the New Testament that Paul was taking the lead in the Lord&rsquo;s New Testament ministry on the earth at that time. When I was working with Brother Nee in mainland China, I never considered myself as anything. I only considered myself as a co-worker to carry out Brother Nee&rsquo;s burden. I did my best not to preach any gospel not preached by him and not to give any message never given by him. I did my best not to use any terminology or eloquence for the preaching, the speaking, the teaching, which he never used. I must declare and praise the Lord that I have received the blessing. I never regret what I did. No one ever heard one thing out of my mouth concerning Brother Nee in a negative way. I am still so grateful to him. Without him, without his ministry, I could never be here like I am. I only labored, I only worked, and I never caused any problem to the Lord&rsquo;s recovery.</p>
<p>Just before the government in mainland China was about to be changed to Communism, Brother Nee proposed an urgent conference of the leading co-workers in Shanghai. He fellowshipped with us concerning how we were going to face the coming situation. He proposed to send me out of mainland China to go abroad, and he said that he and the others would sacrifice themselves in mainland China for the Lord&rsquo;s purpose. I did not feel good about this. It seemed to me that I was a dropout and that everyone would stay but me. After the meeting, Brother Nee and I took a walk, and I asked him why it was that all the brothers would stay to sacrifice themselves for the Lord&rsquo;s work, yet I would be asked to go out. I could never forget the look on Brother Nee&rsquo;s face when he turned to look at me. He told me that we should be desperate and even willing to sacrifice ourselves for the Lord&rsquo;s move and that he realized there was much possibility that one day the enemy would wipe us out. He told me that in case we were wiped out, I had to go out so that we would still have something left. Then I said that I would take his word and go. Out of the many co-workers, I was the only one designated by him to go out in case we would be wiped out, so that we would still have something left. Whatever Brother Nee said was all fulfilled and has become history. Praise Him&mdash;we still have something left.</p>
<p>We brothers must realize that we are not doing any work of ourselves. You are not doing your work and neither am I doing my work. We are all doing a unique work for the Lord&rsquo;s unique recovery. There are over six hundred churches on this globe and not one is &ldquo;in my pocket.&rdquo; The leading ones in Anaheim can testify that I do not even know their meeting schedule. If I want to attend the Lord&rsquo;s table I need to make a phone call to find out where I should go. Whatever churches I have built up have all gone &ldquo;into others&rsquo; pockets.&rdquo; We should realize that we are not doing a work for ourselves. We are doing a work for His recovery. Regardless of how much people have criticized Brother Nee, he was more than faithful to what he had seen. He surely worked for the Lord&rsquo;s recovery, and he has made a good, proper, and adequate foundation for this recovery. I am continuing to build up the Lord&rsquo;s recovery and I am doing the same work. I hope that all of you would be clear about this. Do not think about being somebody. We all are nobody! Only Christ has a Body.</p>
<p>I do feel that my frank word should make the entire situation clear to all of you and make the need clear to all of you. We need a fighting army and in the fighting army we do not merely need a leader. We need a commander to fight the battle! We do not have any time to waste. Many of you who have given up high degrees and high positions for the Lord&rsquo;s recovery have to be faithful to your sacrifice. You also have to be faithful to so many who were influenced by you; otherwise, you are cheating them. We must be faithful to our Lord. We are serving Him and we mean business. We are not just doing a job to feed ourselves, to make a living. That is shameful. If you want to make a living, do not stay in the Lord&rsquo;s work. Go to another and better field for you to make a better living. We must mean business with the Lord, with the saints, and with ourselves. This is the only way for us to go on in the Lord&rsquo;s ministry. Now you know where I am and where you should be. Also, you know what all of us should do&mdash;go to fight as an army and in the army.</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_021.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_023.html">Next</a> </body></html>
