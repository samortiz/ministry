   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE NEW JERUSALEM BEING</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>THE CONCLUSION OF THE BIBLE</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>This long storybook, the Bible, does have a conclusion.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>This conclusion is the New Jerusalem Rev 21:9 22:3 .</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>If we were to ask some careful pastors, "What is the New Jerusalem?" they might advise us not to touch this matter.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>They might also advise us not to touch the entire book of Revelation, in which the New Jerusalem is mentioned, because Revelation is a mystery.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>On the other hand, some careless pastors might say that the New Jerusalem is a heavenly mansion that Christ is building for us in heaven.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>They would say that the Lord Jesus told us in John 14 that He would build such a mansion for us, in which there is a room for every believer in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>If we do believe in Christ, when we die, we will go there to enjoy the eternal life, which equals the eternal blessings.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>When I was a young Christian I believed such teaching, but later I discarded it.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Its Construction</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The New Jerusalem has three sections.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The city proper, or the city itself, is pure gold 21:18b .</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>This means that the base of the city is gold.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The second part of the city is its twelve gates, each of which is a pearl vv.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>12-13, 21 .</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The third part of the city is the wall with its foundations, all of which are precious stones vv.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>14, 18a, 19-20 .</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The entire wall is jasper, and the foundation of the wall has twelve layers.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The first layer of the foundation also is jasper.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Revelation 4:2-3a tells us that God's appearance is like jasper.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Thus, in appearance the city is exactly the same as God.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>God appears like jasper, and the city also appears like jasper.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The three sections of the New Jerusalem are constructed with three kinds of materials, or three kinds of elements.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The number three is a particular number in the universe, signifying the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The Triune God is the number three.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Every number in the Bible has its meaning, and three signifies the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Therefore, the three kinds of materials in the New Jerusalem no doubt signify the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The first material is gold, which constitutes the city proper and forms the base of the city.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>In the Bible gold refers to God the Father as the base, the fountain, the source.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The second material is pearl.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Pearls are produced by oysters, and oysters live in the sea, signifying the death water.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>One day a small rock enters into an oyster and wounds it.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>This rock then remains in the wound, and the oyster secretes its life juice from the wound around the rock, layer after layer.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Eventually, a pearl is produced.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>This indicates that Christ is the living "oyster."</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>He lived in the death water, the world.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>One day we sinners as small "rocks" wounded Him.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>He was wounded by us and for us, and He retained us in His wound.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Through His death we were redeemed, and His death also released His divine life John 12:24 , the life juice of the "oyster."</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>His resurrection secretes the divine life around the redeemed sinners to make them all pearls.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>These pearls become the entrance to the holy city.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Christ's redemption with His secretion in the resurrection life first redeemed us and then secreted the divine life around us, making us pearls.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Through Christ's resurrection we were regenerated 1 Pet 1:3 , and regeneration is the very entrance into the kingdom of God John 3:5 .</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>In the New Jerusalem God the Father is signified by the gold, and God the Son, by the pearls.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>By making us pearls, God the Son has now become us.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Both Christ and we are pearls.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Here we can see the organic union.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>The organic union indicates that Christ is united with us organically through His death and resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>His death becomes the redeeming death, and His resurrection becomes the secreting resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>He redeemed us, and He secretes His life juice over us to make us pearls, which are both He and we.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>In this way the second person of the Trinity became us.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>This is the organic union.</S>
