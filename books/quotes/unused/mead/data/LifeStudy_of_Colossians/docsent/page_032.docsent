   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>LIFE-STUDY OF COLOSSIANS MESSAGE ELEVEN THE STEWARDSHIP OF GOD Scripture Reading: Col 1:24-26</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In 1:25 Paul says that he became a minister according to the stewardship of God.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>For the sake of the full expression of God, there is the need for the stewardship of God.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>It is important to understand accurately the meaning of stewardship.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The Greek word rendered stewardship here, oikonomia , is the same word rendered dispensation in Ephesians 1:10 and 3:9.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The word also appears in Ephesians 3:2, where Paul speaks of the stewardship of grace which had been given to him.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>According to ancient usage, oikonomia denoted a stewardship, a dispensation, or an administration.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>At the time of Paul, many rich families had stewards whose responsibility was to distribute food and other supplies to members of the household.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Our Father has a great family, a divine household.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Because our Father has such vast riches, there is the need in His household for many stewards to dispense these riches to His children.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>This dispensing is the stewardship.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Hence, a stewardship is a dispensation.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The word dispensation here does not denote an age or means by which God deals with people; it refers to God s dispensing of His riches into His chosen ones.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>This dispensation is the stewardship with the dispensing ministry of the ministers of God.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>This ministry of dispensing is also God s administration.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Today God administrates by dispensing Himself into us.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>This stewardship, this dispensation, this administration, is God s economy.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>In the New Testament economy of God there is the desperate need of the stewardship of God.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>We have pointed out that stewardship refers to the dispensation of wealth in a royal or upper-class family.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>God s royal family is rich in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>According to the Epistle to the Colossians, God s family is especially rich in Christ as the all-inclusive and preeminent One, as the One who is the image of the invisible God, the firstborn of all creation, and the firstborn from among the dead.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The riches of such a Christ, who is the full expression of the Triune God, need to be dispensed into the members of God s family.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>This service of dispensing, which in 1:25 is called the stewardship of God, was the work of the Apostle Paul.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>It also should be our work today.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Not many ministers or workers in today s Christianity carry out the stewardship of God.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>This means that not many are actually dispensing the riches of Christ into the members of God s royal family.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The stewardship of God is needed for this rich, all-inclusive, preeminent Christ to be dispensed into the members of His Body.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>This stewardship is the ministry in the New Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The New Testament ministry is the dispensing of the unsearchable riches of the all-inclusive Christ into the members of God s family.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The Apostle Paul dispensed the riches of Christ into the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>This is what we are doing in the ministry today.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The stewardship of God is according to the economy of God.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>With God it is a matter of economy; with us it is a matter of stewardship.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>All the saints, no matter how insignificant they may seem to be, have a ministry according to God s economy.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>This means that every saint can dispense the riches of Christ into others.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The desire of God s heart is to dispense Himself into man.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>This is the central point of the whole Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>God s economy is to carry out the dispensing of Himself into man.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>We share in this economy through our stewardship, our ministry of dispensing the riches of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>After the riches of Christ have been dispensed into us, we need to take up the burden to dispense them into others.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>With God these riches are His economy; with us they are the stewardship; and when they are dispensed by us into others, they become God s dispensation.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>When God s economy reaches us, it becomes our stewardship.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>When we carry out our stewardship by dispensing Christ into others, it becomes the dispensation of God into them.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Hence, we have the economy, the stewardship, and the dispensation.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Those who bear responsibility in the local churches need to share in the stewardship of God.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>This means that the elders should be those who take the lead to dispense the riches of Christ into others.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Although Christ is all-inclusive and preeminent, there is still the need for Him to be dispensed into the members of God s family.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>This dispensation takes place through the stewardship.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Hence, between the unsearchably rich Christ and the members of His Body, there is the need of the stewardship.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>All those who take the lead in the Lord s recovery and have responsibility for the care of the churches need to realize that they have a part in such a divine stewardship.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>We are not here to carry on an ordinary Christian work.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>For instance, we are not concerned merely with teaching the Bible in an outward way.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Rather, we desire to serve the riches of Christ to all the members of God s family.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>In our conversation with one another, we need to minister the riches of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Even when we are invited to the homes of the saints for dinner, we need to dispense the riches of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>This is the stewardship of God.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Every member of the Body of Christ has a part in this stewardship.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>In Ephesians 3:8 Paul refers to himself as less than the least of all saints.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>This indicates that Paul was even smaller than we are.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>If Paul could be a steward, then we also can be stewards and dispense the riches of Christ into others.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>In preaching the gospel, for example, we should not be concerned merely with winning souls.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Rather, we should preach the gospel to carry out the stewardship of dispensing the riches of Christ into others.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Day by day we need to fulfill our stewardship by dispensing the Triune God into man.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Praise the Lord that we all have a share in this stewardship!</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>We all have the privilege of dispensing the unsearchable riches of Christ into others.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Therefore, we should not merely preach the gospel or teach the Bible; we should also impart the riches of Christ to others.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>We have many opportunities to minister the riches of Christ to the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Suppose we are helping a family to move.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>We should not simply move the furniture, but we should supply the riches of Christ to the members of the family, especially to the sister.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>If we help in the moving without dispensing the riches of Christ, we may actually make things difficult for others.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Our intention in helping a family move their belongings should be to dispense the riches of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>All our activity with respect to such a service should be with Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Another opportunity to minister the riches of Christ to others is in giving or receiving hospitality.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>Both the hosts and the guests should minister the riches of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>May the Lord open our eyes to see that we all have part in the stewardship of God.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>In every aspect of the practical church life, even in such things as ushering and cleaning the meeting hall, we need to dispense Christ into others.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>Firstly, we need to be filled with Christ and then minister the riches of Christ to others.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>This is our stewardship.</S>
