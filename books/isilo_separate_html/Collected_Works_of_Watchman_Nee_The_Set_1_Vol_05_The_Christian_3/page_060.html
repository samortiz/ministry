He is God's last word. There is nothing more advanced or progressive than Christ. All the fullness dwells in Him. We can find everything there is to find in Christ. He is the basis of everything to the believers. The failure of Laodicea arises when it tries to look for something apart from Christ. This becomes the manifestation of their self-will. Our riches and work can only be found in Him. God puts us into a life-union with Christ. He has placed us in a position of absolute dependence so that we have to walk by Christ in everything. He is the end to God's word. Only by abiding in Him and doing what He commands will we see the word of God manifested in us. We have to remember that the book of Colossians was also written to the Laodiceans. All the sins and sources of heresies arose when they did things "not according to Christ" (Col. 2:8). The believers must reach the point where everything they do is according to Christ. Whether or not a thing is good, there must not be any independent action apart from Christ. This will keep one from the mistake of Laodicea. "Christ is all" (Col. 3:11). Hence, all apostasies and all failures come about when one departs from Christ. If believers do gain something apart from Christ, they are doing good apart from the power of Christ and are leaving ground for the work of the enemy. All those who want to add anything apart from or after the Amen will lose the Amen.</P><P>The meaning of Amen is "true and absolutely sure." Isaiah 7:9 in the original language puts it well: "If ye will not amen, surely ye shall not have the amen." This means that if they do not agree with His promises, they will not receive His praise. The duty of the church on earth is to affirm God's promises. Through the faith of the church the promises will be fulfilled. Through the oneness of the church the promises will be established. Through the work of the church God's promises to the church and His punishments on the world will be proved to be real. However, because the church has forgotten its heavenly calling and has called the place where the Lord was killed its home, it has denied God's promises. If God's promises are indeed glorious, why would one still be seeking after the world? If the world is to be judged and all that is not God's will pass away, why would one strive the same way as all the others do? This is what men will say. The conduct of the church shows whether it is one with God. The church may not have borne a heavenly testimony through the Holy Spirit, but God cannot be without a testimony. Hence, Christ reveals Himself as the Amen.</P><P>(2) He is also "the faithful and true Witness." He reveals Himself in this way to show the vast difference between Himself and the church. The church has failed. Actually the church has had nothing except failures. Because the church has become unfaithful and unchaste, He is now rejecting its stand as a testimony. The church should have been a golden lampstand, shining and testifying for God. It should be manifested to be "a letter of Christ" (2 Cor. 3:3). But since it has considered itself rich, it can no longer be a testimony for the Lord who has nowhere to lay His head. Yet His people's lack does not equal His lack. "If we are faithless, He remains faithful" (2 Tim. 2:13). Soon He will arise and will bring in the day the world looks for. In that day everything will be made manifest. Even His faithfulness will be clearly revealed.</P><P>Now is the time to bear the testimony, but all the testimony of God is in Christ. This resurrected and glorified Man is the faithful and true Witness. His presence in heaven today is a testimony to His death on earth before. His death testifies that the fleshly man is fully corrupt and that God has no other way to deal with him except by judgment. His death also testifies to the great love of God. Now a man has ascended to heaven. According to God's purpose before the foundation of the world, this man has now secured God's pleasure before Him. God's thought and grace toward man are all expressed in this ascended and glorified Man. This is the Witness of God's mind and motive. God wants us to leave the corrupted and condemned place of Adam and to come to the accepted and blessed place of the glorified Man. All true witnesses, whether as a church or as individuals, must testify to what and how He is. The church ought to continue the work of Christ and be a witness on earth. However, it has utterly failed, while Christ has remained faithful. The witness of Christ will draw man's heart once more near to Him and to everything that God treasures. All those who will not be witnesses will be spewed out of His mouth.</P><P>Christ shows in this letter how He is the faithful and true Witness. What a self-flattery it is that Laodicea considers itself beyond comparison! But Christ considers it as most pitiful. How different are the two views! The Lord first shows the kind of Witness He is so that they may realize that all His coming rebukes are true!</P><P>(3) He is also "the beginning of the creation of God." He is the cause of all creation. John has already mentioned this aspect of the Lord Jesus more than once (John 1:1-3). This is, of course, related to the Lord's word in other passages: "I am the Alpha and the Omega...He who is and who was and who is coming, the Almighty" (Rev. 1:8); "I am the Alpha and the Omega, the First and the Last, the Beginning and the End" (22:13). We have mentioned before that these titles indicate that the Lord Jesus is God.</P><P>These titles are also linked to Proverbs 8. There the Lord Jesus is called Wisdom, the Wisdom of God. "The Lord possessed me in the beginning of his way, before his works of old. I was set up from everlasting, from the beginning, or ever the earth was" (vv. 22-23). Here it says that the Lord Jesus is the beginning of Jehovah's creation. It means the same as what is said in Revelation. However, this does not mean that the Lord Jesus did not participate in the creation of the world itself because He existed even before all creation.</P><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_059.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_061.html">Next</a> </body></html>
