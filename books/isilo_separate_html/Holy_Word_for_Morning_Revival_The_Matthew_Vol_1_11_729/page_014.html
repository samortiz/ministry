[The Lord Jesus]...was physically hungry, and the tempter came to Him and said, &#8220;If You are the Son of God, speak that these stones may become loaves of bread&#8221; (v. 3). To this proposal the Lord replied, &#8220;Man shall not live on bread alone, but on every word that proceeds out through the mouth of God&#8221; (v. 4)....This word reveals that while the Lord Jesus was fasting, He was eating. Physically He was fasting, but spiritually He was eating. ...Here we see an important principle. In the Lord&#8217;s ministry and economy, if we do not know how to lower our physical demands and take care of the spiritual demand, we are not qualified for His ministry....A good living, good food, good clothing, and proper housing are all secondary. Eating spiritual food is primary.</p><p>[In this first temptation] the tempter tempted the new King to take His position as the Son of God [v. 3]. But He answered with the Word of the Scriptures, &#8220;Man,&#8221; indicating that He stood in the position of man to deal with the enemy.</p><p>Defeated in [the matter of human living, the devil] turned his second temptation to religion, tempting the new King to demonstrate that He is the Son of God from the wing of the temple [vv. 5-7]....Any thought of doing things miraculously in religion is a temptation of the devil....If we would defeat the enemy, we must be a nobody. Never do anything to prove that you are somebody or something.</p><p>Because the Lord Jesus defeated him the first time by quoting the Scriptures, the tempter imitated His way and in his second temptation tempted Him by also quoting the Scriptures, however in a subtle way. To quote the Scriptures concerning something in one aspect requires us to take care of the other aspect as well, in order to be safeguarded from the deception of the tempter. This was what the new King did here to counter the tempter&#8217;s second temptation. Many times we need to tell the tempter, &#8220;Again, it is written&#8221; [v. 7].</p><p>[The third test was] in the realm of the glory of this world [vv. 8-9],...[which] is a matter of worldly glory, promotion, ambition, position, and a promising future.... Behind every ambition there is a hidden idol....For this reason, the apostle said that covetousness is idolatry (Col. 3:5)....The new King rebuked the devil&#8217;s presentation and defeated him by standing on the ground of man to worship and serve God only [Matt. 4:10].
