THE COMING FORTH OF GOD,<br />
AND THE SPIRIT BEING<br />
THE ENTERING IN OF GOD</h1>

<p>Second Timothy 3:16-17 says, &ldquo;All Scripture is God-breathed and profitable for teaching, for conviction, for correction, for instruction in righteousness, that the man of God may be complete, fully equipped for every good work.&rdquo; All Scripture, the Bible, is profitable for teaching, instruction, and equipping us for every good work. First John 2:27 says, &ldquo;As for you, the anointing which you have received from Him abides in you, and you have no need that anyone teach you; but as His anointing teaches you concerning all things and is true and is not a lie, and even as it has taught you, abide in Him.&rdquo; Here the matter of teaching is associated with the anointing, the moving of the Spirit in us. When we contrast these two portions of the Bible, it is easy to see that the Scriptures and the anointing are related to each other.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE WORD OF GOD BEING<br />
THE COMING FORTH OF GOD</h2>
<p>God is the Word, and He is in the Word (John 1:1). God is also the Spirit, and He is in the Spirit (4:24). If God were not the Word, it would be very difficult for us to contact or touch Him. However, as the Word, God is tangible and touchable because the Word is God expressed. If God were not the Word or if He did not speak, we would not be able to touch Him. This truth applies not only to the invisible God but even to visible men. If I stood on the podium but remained silent for an hour and a half, the saints would be puzzled and ask, &ldquo;What is the matter? What is Brother Lee thinking?&rdquo; However, when I speak, the saints know what I am thinking. The more I speak, the more they know me, because I am expressed through my words.</p>
<p>Words are the expression of a person. If a person does not speak, everything within him remains hidden, but as soon as he opens his mouth, everything begins to be revealed. Consider the story of Peter&rsquo;s denial of the Lord. When the Lord Jesus was arrested, Peter followed Him until he was in the courtyard of the high priest. While he was sitting with the attendants and warming himself in the light of the fire (Mark 14:54), a servant girl saw him and said, &ldquo;You also were with Jesus the Galilean.&rdquo; But Peter denied it, saying, &ldquo;I do not know what you are talking about!&rdquo; (Matt. 26:69-70). However, the more he denied it, the more he was exposed by his Galilean accent (v. 73). This shows that a person&rsquo;s words are the expression of the person.</p>
<p>In the same way, the Scriptures are God&rsquo;s words. God expresses Himself and explains Himself through His words. Consequently, 2 Timothy 3:16 says, &ldquo;All Scripture is God-breathed.&rdquo; When God breathes out, He breathes out Himself. All the words in the Bible, whether they relate to God&rsquo;s purpose, plan, or acts, express and explain God so that we may know Him and gain Him. Hence, we can say that the Scriptures are God expressed.</p>
<p>Since the Bible is such a wonderful book, we should never regard it as an academic book or as a book of religious teachings. The Bible surpasses every book. Although there are portions in the Bible that contain teachings which are seemingly related to conduct, the essence of the Bible is the expression of God, that is, God expressed. Every time we read the Bible, we should have a strong sense that the Bible is the expression of God Himself. We should realize that we are contacting the God who has been expressed. If this is our concept when we read the Bible, we will meet God and sense that God is appearing to us, no matter what chapter or verse we are reading.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Being Unable to Understand the Bible<br />
Not Being a Problem</h2>
<p>Some brothers and sister often say, &ldquo;Brother Lee, when I read the Bible, I cannot understand what I am reading, and I cannot remember what I have read. Consequently, I do not have much desire to read the Bible.&rdquo; When I hear this, I tell them that these are not problems at all, and I say, &ldquo;When you are invited to a meal, sometimes you are served Western food, and sometimes you are served Asian food. Although you do not always know what you are eating, you are still satisfied. As long as we are nourished and satisfied in our reading of the Bible, understanding what we have read is a secondary matter.</p>
<p>When we read 1 and 2 Chronicles, Daniel, or Revelation, there are many portions that are very difficult to understand. The book of Daniel, for example, records King Nebuchadnezzar&rsquo;s dream of a great human image with a head of gold, a breast and arms of silver, an abdomen and thighs of bronze, legs of iron, and feet partly of iron and partly of clay (2:31-33). The meaning of this dream is not easy to understand. In the book of Revelation there are seven seals, seven trumpets, and seven bowls (5:1-2; 8:6; 16:1), all of which are confusing to us. Nevertheless, after reading about Nebuchadnezzar&rsquo;s dream and about the seven seals, the seven trumpets, and the seven bowls, we feel as if we have been fed and satisfied, even though our understanding is limited. Even though we do not understand everything that we read, we do not have a feeling of being empty and hungry. After reading the Bible, we are fed and satisfied, even though our understanding is limited.</p>
<p>The benefit that we receive from reading the Bible is not utterly dependent upon our understanding, because the Bible, as the expression of God, is different from all other books. The usefulness of an ordinary book is utterly dependent upon our ability to understand what we have read. If we do not understand what we are reading, we will gain nothing. However, the Bible is not an ordinary book. Even when we do not fully understand what we are reading, we have a sense of satisfaction and nourishment when we open to the Lord in the Word. At such a time, we have a deep sensation that we have touched something spiritual that goes beyond our mental apprehension. This is because we have touched God Himself.</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_035.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_037.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Leading the Young People with the Word and the Spirit &nbsp; pg 36</div><br></body></html>
