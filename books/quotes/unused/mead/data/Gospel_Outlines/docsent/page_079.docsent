   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Subject Seventy-eight HIMSELF HE CANNOT SAVE Scripture: Mark 15:22-39 Jesus was crucified on the cross First describe how men brought the Lord Jesus to Golgotha and crucified Him on the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>When Jesus was crucified on the cross, He was treated like a prisoner, because He was crucified with two others who were robbers.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>He was placed among the transgressors.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>According to the mocking cries of men, He should never have been crucified, and being on the cross He should have been able to save Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The reasons for the crucifixion of Jesus Before Jesus was crucified on the cross, He was examined three times by the Jews according to God s law, and then examined again three times by the Romans according to men s law; yet they could find no fault at all with Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>So the Lord Jesus was not crucified because He had sin.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Although the Lord Jesus was sinless and did not deserve the death penalty, yet for the sake of jealousy, people still used an excuse to sentence Him to death.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Such jealousy can be considered the reason for the crucifixion of the Lord Jesus on man s side.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Because men were jealous of Him, therefore they crucified Him on the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The reason for the Lord s crucifixion on man s side is very light compared to the reason on God s side.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>On God s side, it was because God put all of our sins upon the Lord Jesus and caused Him to bear those sins for us.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Thus, the main reason for the crucifixion of the Lord Jesus was to bear the burden of sins for us.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The setting of Jesus crucifixion The setting of Jesus crucifixion included both the natural and the supernatural aspects: The natural aspect was an act of men.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Men set up a wooden cross, nailed the hands and feet of Jesus to the cross, and then parted His garments, which meant that they stripped Him naked.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>They put Him to shame publicly, shook their heads, and mocked Him.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The supernatural aspect was an act of God.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>God caused the whole earth to be darkened, which was not an act of men, but of God.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>When the Lord Jesus gave up His breath, the veil of the temple was rent in two from the top to the bottom.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>This was also an act of God.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The setting of men s act occupied the first half of the Lord s crucifixion, which covered the period from nine in the morning until noon.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The setting of God s act occupied the second half of the Lord s crucifixion, which covered the period from noon until three in the afternoon, when the whole earth was darkened.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The setting of men s act depicts the killing of Jesus by human hands; the setting of God s act depicts the judgment upon Jesus by God.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>During the second half of the Lord s crucifixion, the whole earth was darkened.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Darkness is the symbol of sin.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>When Jesus died, the veil of the temple was rent from the top to the bottom.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The veil represents the barrier between man and God because of sin.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The fact that the earth was darkened and the veil rent was a proof that God was judging the Lord Jesus, because at that time the Lord Jesus became man s sin-bearer.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Jesus could not save Himself If Jesus had only been killed by men, He could have saved Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>He was capable of saving Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>For thirty-three years on earth, many had attempted to kill Him, but He escaped them.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>It was very easy for Him to save Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>He did not save Himself but rather on the cross He was mocked and killed by men.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Furthermore, He was forsaken and judged by God because He was bearing man s sins.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>If He had saved Himself, our sin problem would never have been resolved.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Because He would not save Himself, we are saved.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>By not saving Himself, He became our substitute and became our Savior.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The attitude we should have toward Jesus We should appreciate the fact that He suffered persecution and endured crucifixion for us.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>But just to appreciate His sufferings could not save us.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>That is not enough to cause us to be saved.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>We must thank Him for not saving Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>We must thank Him for becoming our substitute to bear our sins, thus being judged by God s righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Whoever thanks Him and treats Him in this way is a believer, one saved by Him.</S>
