God's complete salvation is based upon His righteousness and through our faith.<br>2. By the two divine transfers: out of Adam into Christ and out of the flesh into the Spirit.<br>3. In the one spiritual union of the Spirit of life with our spirit, forming a mingled spirit.<br>4. For us to reign in life by the abundance of grace and of the gift of righteousness.</P><P>I hope that our entire being with our living will be occupied by these four statements, which are actually one long sentence.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>I. CARRIED OUT ON AND BROUGHT INTO<br>THE BELIEVERS BY THE POWER OF GOD</H2><P>The complete salvation of God in the book of Romans is carried out on and brought into the believers of Christ by the power of God through His complete gospel (Rom. 1:16, 1). Power of God in Romans 1:16 denotes a powerful force that can break through any obstacle. This power is the resurrected Christ Himself, who is the life-giving Spirit, and it is unto salvation to every one who believes.</P><P>The gospel of God, as the subject of Romans, concerns Christ as the Spirit living within the believers after His resurrection. This is higher and more subjective than what was presented in the Gospels, which concern Christ only in the flesh as He lived among His disciples after His incarnation but before His death and resurrection. This book, however, reveals that Christ has resurrected and has become the life-giving Spirit (8:9-10). He is no longer merely the Christ outside the believers, but He is now the Christ within them. Hence, the gospel in this book is the gospel of the One who is now indwelling His believers as their subjective Savior.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>II. COMPOSED OF GOD'S JUDICIAL REDEMPTION<br>AND HIS ORGANIC SALVATION</H2><P>Such a complete salvation of God is composed of God's judicial redemption and His organic salvation. God's judicial redemption is the procedure of God's complete salvation for the believers to participate in God's organic salvation as the purpose of God's complete salvation. The procedure is judicial, and the purpose is organic.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>A. God's Judicial Redemption</H2><P>God's judicial redemption, accomplished by the death of Christ (5:10a), includes the following items.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>1. God's Forgiveness of the Believers' Sins</H2><P>Forgiveness of sins (4:7) is based on the redemption of Christ, which was accomplished through His death (Acts 10:43; Eph. 1:7; 1 Cor. 15:3); it is the initial and basic blessing of God's full salvation.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>2. God's Justification of the Believers</H2><P>Justification (Rom. 3:24) is God's action whereby He approves people according to His standard of righteousness. God can do this on the basis of the redemption of Christ.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>3. God's Reconciliation of the Believers to Himself</H2><P>Propitiation and forgiveness of sins are adequate for a sinner but not for an enemy. An enemy needs reconciliation (5:11), which includes propitiation and forgiveness but goes further, even to resolving the conflict between two parties. Our being reconciled to God is based on Christ's redemption and was accomplished through God's justification (Rom. 3:24; 2 Cor. 5:18-19). Reconciliation is the result of being justified out of faith.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>B. God's Organic Salvation</H2><P>God's organic salvation is carried out by Christ's life (5:10b) and includes the following items.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>1. Regeneration</H2><P>Regeneration in Titus 3:5 refers to a change from one state to another. Being born again is the commencing of this change. The washing of regeneration begins with our being born again and continues with the renewing of the Holy Spirit as the process of God's new creation, a process that makes us a new man. It is a kind of reconditioning, remaking, or remodeling, with life.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>2. Sanctification</H2><P>Sanctification (Rom. 6:19, 22; 15:16) involves not only a change in position; it involves a transformation in disposition, that is, a transformation from the natural disposition to a spiritual one by Christ as the life-giving Spirit saturating all the inward parts of our being with God's nature of holiness.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>3. Renewing</H2><P>To be renewed (12:2b) means that a new element is wrought into our being. This produces an inward metabolic transformation, making us suitable for the building up of the Body of Christ.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>4. Transformation</H2><P>Transformation is the inward, metabolic process in which God works to spread His divine life and nature throughout every part of our being, particularly our soul, bringing Christ and His riches into our being as our new element and causing our old, natural element to be gradually discharged.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>5. Conformation</H2><P>Conformation (8:29), the end result of transformation, includes the changing of our inward essence and nature and also the changing of our outward form, that we may match the glorified image of Christ, the God-man.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>6. Glorification</H2><P>Glorification (8:30) is the step in God's complete salvation in which God will completely saturate our body of sin, which is of death and is mortal (6:6; 7:24; 8:11), with the glory of His life and nature according to the principle of His regenerating our spirit through the Spirit. In this way He will transfigure our body, conforming it to the resurrected, glorious body of His Son (Phil. 3:21). This is the ultimate step in God's complete salvation, wherein God obtains a full expression, which will ultimately be manifested in the New Jerusalem in the coming age.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>III. THE DYNAMIC COMPLETE SALVATION OF GOD</H2><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>A. Taking the All-inclusive Christ of God<br>as Its Centrality and Universality</H2><P>Romans is full of Christ. Many expositions of Romans divide it into sections: condemnation, justification, sanctification, selection, and Christian behavior. But this way of exposition is not adequate. It is only by taking the all-inclusive Christ as the center and circumference of the entire book that our exposition can be thoroughly adequate. Christ is the centrality and universality of the entire book of Romans.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>B. Based upon God's Righteousness, Which Is Christ</H2><P>God's complete salvation is based upon God's righteousness (Rom. 1:17a), which is Christ. God's righteousness is a great matter because it is the power of God's salvation. God's righteousness, which is solid and steadfast, is the foundation of His throne (Psa. 89:14) and the base on which His kingdom is built (Rom. 14:17). If there were no righteousness, God Himself would be finished, the entire universe would collapse, and we could not exist. The universe, including us, exists based on the righteousness of God.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>1. To Cover the Believers<br>That They May Be Justified Objectively</H2><P>Christ covers the believers that they may be justified objectively (Rom. 3:20-22). The best robe (Luke 15:22) put upon the prodigal son by the father signifies Christ as the God-satisfying righteousness to cover the penitent sinner (Jer. 23:6; 1 Cor. 1:30; cf. Isa. 61:10; Zech. 3:4).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>2. To Be Given to the Believers<br>as Their Righteousness Subjectively</H2><P>Christ is given to the believers as their righteousness subjectively to become their living that they may be justified before God subjectively (Rom. 4:24-25). As the resurrected One, Christ is in us to live for us a life that can be justified by God and that is always acceptable to God.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>C. Through the Believers' Faith</H2><P>God's righteousness is Christ, and the believers' faith (1:17b; 10:8) is also Christ (Gal. 2:20b), whom they appreciate and receive in their hearing of the gospel. The more we hear the gospel concerning Christ, the more we appreciate Him and the more we receive Him. The more we say, "O Lord Jesus, I love You. I appreciate You," the more He enters into us to be our faith. Faith has an object, and it issues from its object. The object is Jesus, who is God incarnate. When man hears Him, knows Him, appreciates Him, and treasures Him, He causes faith to be generated in man, enabling man to believe in Him. Thus, He becomes the faith in man by which man believes in Him. Hence, this faith becomes the faith in Him, and it is also the faith that belongs to Him. We have no righteousness or faith in ourselves. The righteousness of God is Christ, and the faith in us is also Christ.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>IV. THE CONTENT OF ROMANS</H2><P>God's judicial redemption is covered by the first four chapters of the book of Romans, and God's organic salvation is covered by the last twelve chapters, from chapter five to sixteen. This organic salvation equals reigning in life by the abundance of God's grace and by the abundance of God's gift of righteousness.</P><P>Romans 5:10 points out that God's full salvation revealed in this book consists of two sections: one section is the redemption accomplished for us by Christ's death, and the other section is the saving afforded us by Christ's life. The first four chapters of this book discourse comprehensively regarding the redemption accomplished by Christ's death, whereas the last twelve chapters speak in detail concerning the salvation afforded by Christ's life. Before 5:11, Paul shows us that we are saved because we have been redeemed, justified, and reconciled to God. However, we have not yet been saved to the extent of being sanctified, transformed, and conformed to the image of God's Son. Redemption, justification, and reconciliation, which are accomplished outside of us by the death of Christ, redeem us objectively. Objective redemption redeems us positionally from condemnation and eternal punishment; subjective salvation saves us dispositionally from our old man, our self, and our natural life.</P><H1 CLASS=SERIES>CRYSTALLIZATION-STUDY<br>OF THE COMPLETE SALVATION OF GOD<br>IN ROMANS</H1><H1 CLASS=MSG>MESSAGE TWO</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>TWO DIVINE TRANSFERS</H1><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>OUTLINE</H2><ol class="upper-roman"><li>The factual and positional transfer&#151;Rom. 6:3-8:</li>	<ol class="upper-alpha">	<li>Out of Adam through Christ's death.</li>	<li>Into Christ through His resurrection.</li>	<li>In Adam we inherited:</li>		<ol class="decimal">		<li>Sin that constitutes us sinners&#151;5:12a, 19a.</li>		<li>Death that on the one hand, weakens us, disabling us to do things pleasing God, and on the other hand, reigns over us&#151;5:12b, 14a, 17a.</li>		<li>Condemnation under the law unto death&#151;5:16a.</li>		</ol>	<li>In Christ we have been gifted with:</li>		<ol class="decimal">		<li>Righteousness&#151;5:17b.</li>		<li>Life&#151;5:17b.</li>		<li>Justification under grace unto life, in which we reign with grace over all things&#151;5:17b, 18b, 21.</li>		</ol>	</ol><li>The practical and experiential transfer:</li>	<ol class="upper-alpha">	<li>Out of the flesh (the practical and experiential Adam) through our being crucified with Christ&#151;7:1-6.</li>	<li>Into the Spirit (the practical and experiential Christ) through our union with the Spirit&#151;8:16a.</li>	<li>By:</li>		<ol class="decimal">		<li>Setting our mind not on the flesh but on the mingled spirit unto life and peace&#151;8:5-6.</li>		<li>Walking and having our being not according to the flesh but according to the mingled spirit unto the fulfillment of the righteous requirement of the law&#151;8:4.</li>		<li>Reigning in life with grace over all things unto eternal life&#151;5:17b, 21.</li>		</ol>	</ol></ol><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>I. THE FACTUAL AND POSITIONAL TRANSFER</H2><P>God's organic salvation is fully revealed in the book of Romans. To carry out God's organic salvation there is the need of two divine transfers and one spiritual union. The first transfer is out of Adam into Christ and is factual and positional (Rom. 6:3-8). The second transfer is out of the flesh into the Spirit of life and is practical and experiential (7:1-6; 8:16a). The flesh is the practical, experiential Adam. We are transferred out of the flesh into the Spirit, who is the practical and experiential Christ. The way to carry out our union with the Spirit is to set our mind not on the flesh but on the mingled spirit unto life and peace (8:6) and to learn to walk and to have our being not according to the flesh but according to the mingled spirit (v. 4). By ourselves in our flesh there is no possibility for us to fulfill the righteous requirements of the law. They can be fulfilled only by our walking and living according to the mingled spirit. The result of setting our mind on the mingled spirit and walking according to the mingled spirit is our reigning in life with grace over all things unto eternal life (5:17b, 21).</P><P>The two divine transfers cover four chapters of the book of Romans which may be regarded as the kernel of the New Testament. Chapter five may be entitled "In Adam"; chapter six, "In Christ"; chapter seven, "In the Flesh"; and chapter eight, "In the Spirit." The first transfer is objective, factual, and positional. The second is subjective, practical, and experiential.</P><P>In Adam we inherited the nature of Satan as sin, constituting us sinners in essence and element. We also inherited death, which on the one hand, made us passive, weak, and impotent with respect to the things of God, and on the other hand, reigned first in our spirit, then through our soul, and eventually over our body. Furthermore, in sin and death, we became subject to the condemnation of the righteous law of God. As believers, we have been baptized into Christ and also into His death, a death that took us out of Adam. In addition, we were regenerated at the time of Christ's resurrection, and in that rebirth, through His resurrection, we were transferred into Christ.</P><P>God has made Christ righteousness to us (1 Cor. 1:30). Because of this, God considers us as righteous as Christ. In Christ we have righteousness as a gift, and we have been approved by God according to His standard of righteousness. In Christ we also have been given God as our life. What a wonder that God the Father and we have the same life! When we call God Father, we are expressing our organic relationship with Him in life.</P><P>According to Romans 5:18, justification is unto life. The goal of being justified is to have life and reign in life. We are saved in life to the extent that the life that saves us enthrones us as kings. Through righteousness and under grace we reign in life over everything. By being in Christ, we are justified unto life, that under grace and through righteousness we can be kings. What a glory to the Lord and what a shame to the enemy that people such as we can reign in life.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>II. THE PRACTICAL AND EXPERIENTIAL TRANSFER</H2><P>The Spirit today is Christ in application, Christ coming to us for our experience. Practically speaking, only when we are in the Spirit are we in the reality of the divine transfer. Our daily living depends almost entirely on where we are. "Where art thou?" (Gen. 3:9) was the first question God addressed to the human race, and today He is still asking this same question. Paul's desire was to be found in Christ as a realm (Phil. 3:9). Our need is not to behave in a certain way but to be found in Christ by being found in the Spirit through our union with the Spirit.</P><P>Our spirit deep within is one with the consummated Spirit of the processed and consummated Triune God. The all-inclusive Spirit, who includes the Father, the Son, and the Spirit, is in us and is mingled with our spirit. Our spirit is joined to the Lord as one spirit (1 Cor. 6:17), and His Spirit witnesses together with our spirit that we are children of God (Rom. 8:16), that we may live together, exist together, work together, and speak together as one spirit. To be one spirit with the Lord is to be in the reality of the divine transfer.</P><P>Romans 8:5-6 shows a miniature Garden of Eden, with the flesh and death on one side, the spirit and life on the other side, and the mind in the middle. What realm we are in depends on where we set our mind. When our mind is set on the spirit, our mind is full of life. We also have peace because there is no discord between our outward behavior and our inner being. Then when we speak, life is embodied in our words because we are one with the Lord.</P><P>The righteous requirement of the law is fulfilled in those who walk according to the mingled spirit (v. 4). If we try to be a Christian, we are in the flesh. That is the old man trying to keep the law. Being a Christian is a living out of the life of God by walking according to the mingled spirit within. If we would see this vision, give up our effort, and simply be in the spirit, another One will live in us. The Spirit always acts according to the righteous requirements of God's law.</P><P>We reign in life with grace over all things unto eternal life (5:17b, 21). Righteousness gives us the ground to claim God as our grace. We may say, "Lord, You cannot withhold Yourself from me as grace, because I stand on the ground of my justification. You have given Christ to me as my righteousness as a gift, and I stand on this position. Lord, give Yourself to me as grace for my enjoyment." Grace means that we cannot do what God requires, but the Triune God can do it. We cannot be what we should be, but there is One living in us, the consummated Spirit as grace, who can be. We have an abundance of grace, and in this grace we reign unto eternal life.</P><P>Romans 5:21 speaks of reigning through righteousness unto eternal life. Unto eternal life is a particular expression. John 4:14 says, "But whoever drinks of the water that I will give him shall by no means thirst forever; but the water that I will give him will become in him a fountain of water gushing up into eternal life." Into eternal life actually means "into the New Jerusalem" because the New Jerusalem is the totality of eternal life. Just as a person's being is the totality of his life, the New Jerusalem is the totality of the life of God. The consummation of the gushing living water that we drink will be the New Jerusalem as the totality of the eternal life. For grace to reign unto eternal life means that we are now enthroned as kings and we are reigning in life over all things unto an issue, a consummation. The issue of our present reigning in life will be the New Jerusalem as the universal incorporation of God and man. Revelation 22:5 says, "And they will reign forever and ever." That reigning is an issue, a glorious, eternal, corporate consummation of our present reigning in life through the abundance of grace and of the gift of righteousness unto eternal life.</P><H1 CLASS=SERIES>CRYSTALLIZATION-STUDY<br>OF THE COMPLETE SALVATION OF GOD<br>IN ROMANS</H1><H1 CLASS=MSG>MESSAGE THREE</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>ONE SPIRITUAL, PRACTICAL,<br>AND EXPERIENTIAL UNION</H1><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>OUTLINE</H2><ol class="upper-roman"><li>Of the Spirit of life, the Spirit of God, the Spirit of Christ (the pneumatic Christ), and the Spirit of resurrection indwelling our spirit&#151;Rom. 8:2, 9-11:</li>	<ol class="upper-alpha">	<li>To free us from the law of sin and death, releasing us from the lusts of the flesh by the law of life&#151;8:2; 7:17-25.</li>	<li>To give life to our mortal bodies and to put to death the practices of the body&#151;8:11b, 13b.</li>	</ol><li>With our spirit, the regenerated spirit of the believers in Christ indwelt by the Spirit&#151;8:16a, 11b:</li>	<ol class="upper-alpha">	<li>To witness that we are children of God, even heirs of God and joint heirs with Christ, possessing the spirit of sonship to cry, "Abba, Father"&#151;8:16-17a, 15.</li>	<li>To pray with groanings by the interceding Spirit&#151;8:26.</li>	</ol><li>Forming a mingled spirit&#151;8:4-5:</li>	<ol class="upper-alpha">	<li>He who is joined to the Lord is one spirit&#151;1 Cor. 6:17.</li>	<li>By the mutual abiding of the Spirit with our spirit&#151;Rom. 8:11b; 1 John 3:24.</li>	</ol></ol><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>I. OF THE SPIRIT OF LIFE</H2><P>The one spiritual, practical, and experiential union is of the Spirit of life, the Spirit of God, the Spirit of Christ (the pneumatic Christ), and the Spirit of resurrection indwelling our spirit (Rom. 8:2, 9-11), with our spirit, the regenerated spirit of the believers. The Spirit and life are mentioned in Romans 8:2, but only in connection with the working of the law of the Spirit of life. Life is the content and issue of the Spirit, and the Spirit is the ultimate and consummate manifestation of the Triune God after His being processed through incarnation, crucifixion, and resurrection and becoming the indwelling, life-giving Spirit, who is life to all the believers in Christ. The law that has freed us from the law of sin, which is of Satan, who dwells in the members of our fallen body (Rom. 7:23, 17), is of this Spirit of life. It is this law, not God nor the Spirit, that works in us to deliver us from the working of the law of sin in our flesh and to enable us to know God and gain God and thereby live Him out. This law of the Spirit of life is the spontaneous power of the Spirit of life. Such a spontaneous law works automatically under the condition that fulfills its requirements (see note 2 on Rom. 8:4). Both Satan and God, after entering into our being and dwelling in us, work within us not by outward, objective activities but by inward, subjective laws. The working of the law of the Spirit of life is the working of the processed Triune God in our spirit; this is also the working of the Triune God in us in His life.</P><P>The Spirit of God and the Spirit of Christ are not two Spirits but one. Paul used these titles interchangeably, indicating that the indwelling Spirit of life in 8:2 is the all-inclusive, life-giving Spirit of the entire Triune God. God, the Spirit, and Christ&#151;the three of the Godhead&#151;are all mentioned in verse 9. However, there are not three in us; there is only one, the triune Spirit of the Triune God (John 4:24; 2 Cor. 3:17; Rom. 8:11). The Spirit of God implies that this Spirit is of the One who was from eternity past, who created the universe and is the origin of all things. The Spirit of Christ implies that this Spirit is the embodiment and reality of Christ, the incarnated One. This is the Spirit of Christ in resurrection, that is, Christ Himself dwelling in our spirit (v. 10) to impart Himself, the embodiment of the processed Triune God, into us as resurrection life and power to deal with the death that is in our nature (v. 2). Thus, we may live today in Christ's resurrection, in Christ Himself, by living in the mingled spirit.</P><P>We must put to death the practices of the body, but we must do it by the Spirit (v. 13). On the one hand, we must take the initiative to put to death the practices of the body; the Spirit does not do it for us. On the other hand, we should not attempt to deal with our body by relying on our own effort without the power of the Holy Spirit. Inwardly, we must allow Him to make His home in us that He may give life to our mortal body (v. 11). Outwardly, we must put to death the practices of our body that we may live. When we take the initiative to put to death the practices of our body, the Spirit comes in to apply the effectiveness of Christ's death to those practices, thus killing them.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>II. WITH OUR SPIRIT</H2><P>God's organic salvation is carried out by the two divine transfers, out of Adam into Christ and out of the flesh into the Spirit, in one spiritual union. This is for us to reign in life with grace over all things unto eternal life. All the things mentioned in Romans 5 through 16 are under the reigning in life, and the totality, the aggregate, of the eternal life is the New Jerusalem. The New Jerusalem is the divine and human constitution, which is just Christ as the Son of Man. Since the Son has been incorporated with us, we and the Son become the incorporation, the uplifted standing stairway, the ladder that joins earth to heaven and brings heaven to earth.</P><P>The one spiritual, practical, and experiential union is of the Spirit with our spirit, the regenerated spirit of the believers in Christ indwelt by the Spirit (Rom. 8:16a, 11b). The two spirits are united together to be in one union. It is not only that the Spirit witnesses and our spirit witnesses also. Rather, it is that the Spirit witnesses with our spirit. This indicates that our spirit must take the initiative to witness first; then the Spirit will witness with our spirit. This reveals that the Spirit of God today, the all-inclusive Spirit of the Triune God, dwells in our regenerated human spirit and works in our spirit. These two spirits are one; they live together, work together, and exist together as one mingled spirit.</P><P>The Spirit witnesses with our spirit that we are the children of God and the heirs of God. This means that we will inherit God. We are the joint heirs with Christ and possess the spirit of sonship to cry, "Abba, Father" (vv. 16-17a, 15). Abba is an Aramaic word that means "father," and Father is the translation of the Greek word Pater. Such a term was used first by the Lord Jesus in Gethsemane while He was praying to the Father (Mark 14:36). The combining of the Aramaic title with the Greek title expresses a stronger affection in crying to the Father. Such an affectionate cry implies an intimate relationship in life between a genuine son and a begetting father. After being regenerated, we are no longer merely God's creatures; we are His children. Because we have now been born of God and are related to Him in life, it is very normal and sweet for us to call Him Father. When we cry, "Abba, Father," there is the witnessing of the Spirit. Such a witnessing testifies to us and assures us that we are the children of God, who possess His life; it also limits us and restricts us to a living and walk that are according to this life, in keeping with our being children of God. The Spirit witnesses to our most basic and elementary relationship with God, namely, that we are His children. Therefore, this witnessing of the Spirit begins from the time of our spiritual birth, our regeneration.</P><P>The Spirit of life and our regenerated spirit become one in one spiritual union. We then pray with groanings by the interceding Spirit (Rom. 8:26). We do not know how to pray as we ought, but the Spirit is with us in like manner and helps us in our weakness. The weakness here is our ignorance of how we should pray. We do not know the kind of prayer God desires, and we are not clear how to pray, according to the burden we feel, for our being conformed to the image of God's Son; hence, we groan (v. 23). In our groaning the Spirit groans also, interceding for us. His interceding is mainly that we may experience the transformation in life for growth into the maturity of sonship that we may be fully conformed to the image of God's Son (v. 29).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>III. FORMING A MINGLED SPIRIT</H2><P>God's complete salvation is in one spiritual, practical, and experiential union of the Spirit of life with our spirit, forming a mingled spirit. The practical union is by the two divine transfers in one spiritual union for us to reign in life by enjoying the abundance of grace and of the gift of righteousness. This union is of the Spirit of life, the Spirit of God, the Spirit of Christ (the pneumatic Christ), and the Spirit of resurrection indwelling our spirit. The one spiritual union is with our spirit, the regenerated spirit of the believers in Christ indwelt by the Spirit, forming a mingled spirit. The two spirits are not only united to be a union; they are also mingled to be a mingled spirit.</P><P>The Spirit of life is the Spirit of Christ, and Christ corresponds with the law of God. This Spirit within us spontaneously fulfills all the righteous requirements of the law through us when we walk according to Him. The requirements that we must fulfill in order that the law of the Spirit of life (which has already been installed in us) may work are: (1) to walk according to the spirit (v. 4); (2) to mind the things of the Spirit&#151; to set the mind on the spirit (vv. 5-6); (3) to put to death by the Spirit the practices of the body (v. 13); (4) to be led by the Spirit as sons of God (v. 14); (5) to cry to the Father in the spirit of sonship (v. 15); (6) to witness that we are the children of God (v. 16); and (7) to groan for the full sonship, the redemption of our body (v. 23).</P><P>It is difficult to discern the word spirit used in Romans 8, in Galatians 5, and in other places in the New Testament, unless it is clearly designated to denote God's Holy Spirit or our regenerated human spirit, as in Romans 8:9 and 16. According to the usage in the New Testament, the word spirit as used in Romans 8:4 denotes our regenerated human spirit indwelt by and mingled with the Spirit, who is the consummation of the Triune God (v. 9). This corresponds with 1 Corinthians 6:17, "He who is joined to the Lord [who is the Spirit&#151;2 Cor. 3:17; 1 Cor. 15:45] is one spirit"&#151;one mingled spirit.</P><P>Being joined to the Lord refers to the believers' organic union with the Lord through believing into Him (John 3:15-16). This union is illustrated by that of the branches with the vine (John 15:4-5). It is a matter not only of life but in life (the divine life). Such a union with the resurrected Lord can only be in our spirit. One spirit in 1 Corinthians 6:17 indicates the mingling of the Lord as the Spirit with our spirit. Our spirit has been regenerated by the Spirit of God (John 3:6), who is now in us (1 Cor. 6:19) and is one with our spirit (Rom. 8:16). This is the realization of the Lord, who became the life-giving Spirit through resurrection (1 Cor. 15:45; 2 Cor. 3:17) and who is now with our spirit (2 Tim. 4:22). This mingled spirit is often referred to in Paul's Epistles, as in Romans 8:4-6.</P><P>It is by the all-inclusive compound life-giving Spirit (see note 4 in Phil. 1:19) that we are born of God, we receive the divine life as the divine seed in us, we have the fellowship of the divine life, we are anointed with the Triune God, and we abide in the Lord. This wonderful Spirit is given to us as the promised blessing of the New Testament (Gal. 3:14); He is given without measure by the Christ who is above all, who inherits all, and who is to be increased universally (John 3:31-35, 29a). This Spirit and the eternal life (John 3:15) are the basic elements by which we live the life that abides in the Lord continuously. Hence, it is by this Spirit, who witnesses assuringly with our spirit, that we are the children of God (Rom. 8:16) and that we know that the Lord of all abides in us (1 John 4:13). It is through this Spirit that we are joined to the Lord as one spirit (1 Cor. 6:17), and it is by this Spirit that we enjoy the riches of the Triune God (2 Cor. 13:14).</P><H1 CLASS=SERIES>CRYSTALLIZATION-STUDY<br>OF THE COMPLETE SALVATION OF GOD<br>IN ROMANS</H1><H1 CLASS=MSG>MESSAGE FOUR</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>REIGNING IN LIFE</H1><H1 CLASS=PAREN>(1)</H1><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>OUTLINE</H2><ol class="upper-roman"><li>In the spiritual, practical, and experiential union&#151;Rom. 8:16a.</li><li>By the mingled spirit&#151;8:11b.</li><li>Through the abundance of grace and the abundance of the gift of righteousness&#151;5:17b:</li>	<ol class="upper-alpha">	<li>In being sanctified in the Spirit&#151;6:19, 22; 15:16.</li>	<li>In being renewed by the mingled spirit in our mind&#151;12:2b; Eph. 4:23.</li>	<li>In being transformed&#151;12:2b:</li>		<ol class="decimal">		<li>To the image of Christ from glory to glory&#151;2 Cor. 3:18a.</li>		<li>By the Lord Spirit&#151;2 Cor. 3:18b.</li>		</ol>	<li>In being conformed&#151;8:26-29:</li>		<ol class="decimal">		<li>To the image of God's firstborn Son&#151;v. 29b.</li>		<li>Through the Spirit's interceding&#151;vv. 26-27.</li>		<li>That all things may work together for the conformation of those who love God&#151;v. 28.</li>		</ol>	<li>In being glorified&#151;8:30:</li>		<ol class="decimal">		<li>To be redeemed in our body&#151;8:23c.</li>		<li>To participate in our divine sonship ultimately&#151;8:23b.</li>		<li>Through the sealing of the indwelling Spirit&#151;Eph. 4:30.</li>		</ol>	<li>In more than conquering the environmental hardships and sufferings&#151;8:31-39:</li>		<ol class="decimal">		<li>By having God being for us, who did not spare His own Son, who gives us freely all things with Him, and who has chosen us and justified us&#151;vv. 31-33.</li>		<li>By having Christ who died for us, who was raised, and who is sitting at the right hand of God interceding for us&#151;v. 34.</li>		<li>By being captivated by the love of Christ and by the love of God in Christ from which we are inseparable&#151;vv. 35-39.</li>		<li>By being faithful to Christ and God unto death&#151;v. 38.</li>		</ol>	<li>In gaining the righteousness of God which is the subjective Christ&#151;9:18-33; Phil. 3:9; 1 Cor. 1:30:</li>		<ol class="decimal">		<li>Out of faith to faith&#151;1:17a.</li>		<li>According to His mercy in order to make known the riches of His glory upon vessels of mercy&#151;9:18-23.</li>		</ol>	<li>In enjoying the riches of God&#151;10:12-15:</li>		<ol class="decimal">		<li>By calling on the name of the Lord&#151;v. 13.</li>		<li>By believing in the Lord's word&#151;v. 14.</li>		<li>By announcing the glad tidings&#151;v. 15.</li>		</ol>	<li>In living a grafted life&#151;11:17-24; Gal. 2:20a:<br>	(Not living an exchanged life: the good life replaces the bad one, and the bad one becomes functionless.)</li>		<ol class="decimal">		<li>Being the branches of the wild olive tree&#151;vv. 17, 24.</li>		<li>Grafted into Christ, the cultivated olive tree, who is one with Israel&#151;v. 24; Psa. 80:15-17; Matt. 2:15.</li>		<li>Standing by faith to partake of the root (which bears us&#151;v. 18) of fatness of the olive tree&#151;vv. 20, 17.</li>		<li>We, as the grafted branches, and Christ, as the cultivated olive tree, live together one mingled life in one mingled living.</li>		</ol>	</ol></ol><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>I. IN THE SPIRITUAL, PRACTICAL,<br>AND EXPERIENTIAL UNION</H2><P>We reign in life in the spiritual, practical, and experiential union. Romans 8:16a says, "The Spirit Himself witnesses with our spirit." The Spirit of God today, the all-inclusive Spirit of the Triune God, dwells in our regenerated human spirit and works in our spirit. These two spirits are one; they live together, work together, and exist together as one mingled spirit.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>II. BY THE MINGLED SPIRIT</H2><P>We reign in life by the mingled spirit. Romans 8:11b says, "He who raised Christ Jesus from the dead will also give life to your mortal bodies through His Spirit who indwells you."</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>III. THROUGH THE ABUNDANCE OF GRACE<br>AND THE ABUNDANCE OF THE GIFT OF RIGHTEOUSNESS</H2><P>We reign in life in the spiritual, practical, and experiential union by the mingled spirit through the abundance of grace and the abundance of the gift of righteousness, with which God has gifted us (5:17b). Grace is for us to experience God's organic salvation, whereas the gift of righteousness is for God's judicial redemption.</P><P>The outline which begins in this message presents cases from Romans 6 through 16 to show that if we reign in life, we are in all the matters presented in chapters six through sixteen.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>A. In Being Sanctified</H2><P>We reign in life in being sanctified in the Spirit (6:19, 22; 15:16). To be in sanctification requires us to reign in life.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>B. In Being Renewed</H2><P>We reign in life in being renewed by the mingled spirit in our mind (12:2b; Eph. 4:23).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>C. In Being Transformed</H2><P>We reign in life in being transformed to the image of Christ from glory to glory by the Lord Spirit (Rom. 12:2b; 2 Cor. 3:18).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>D. In Being Conformed</H2><P>We reign in life in being conformed to the image of God's firstborn Son through the Spirit's interceding that all things may work together for the conformation of those who love God (Rom. 8:26-29).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>E. In Being Glorified</H2><P>We reign in life in being glorified (v. 30) to be redeemed in our body (v. 23c) to participate in our divine sonship ultimately (v. 23b) through the sealing of the indwelling Spirit (Eph. 4:30).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>F. In More Than Conquering</H2><P>When we reign in life, we more than conquer the environmental hardships and sufferings by having God being for us, who did not spare His own Son, who gives us freely all things with Him, and who has chosen us and justified us (Rom. 8:31-33); by having Christ who died for us, who was raised, and who is sitting at the right hand of God interceding for us (v. 34); by being captivated by the love of Christ and by the love of God in Christ from which we are inseparable (vv. 35-39); and by being faithful to Christ and God unto death (v. 38).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>G. In Gaining the Righteousness of God</H2><P>When we receive the abundance of grace and of the gift of righteousness to reign in life, we gain the righteousness of God which is the subjective Christ (9:18-33; Phil. 3:9; 1 Cor. 1:30). This righteousness is gained out of faith to faith (Rom. 1:17a) according to His mercy in order to make known the riches of His glory upon vessels of mercy (9:18-23).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>H. In Enjoying the Riches of God</H2><P>When we reign in life, we enjoy the riches of God (10:12-15) by calling on the name of the Lord (v. 13), by believing in the Lord's word (v. 14), and by announcing the glad tidings (v. 15). It is only when we reign in life that we can call on the Lord properly.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>I. In Living a Grafted Life</H2><P>We reign in life in living a grafted life (11:17-24; Gal. 2:20a). This is not an exchanged life, with the good life replacing the bad one and the bad one becoming functionless, but this is a grafted life. We are branches of the wild olive tree (Rom. 11:17, 24) that were grafted into Christ, the cultivated olive tree, who is one with Israel (v. 24; Psa. 80:15-17; Matt. 2:15). We stand by faith to partake of the root (which bears us, Rom. 11:18) of fatness of the olive tree (vv. 20, 17). Furthermore, we, as the grafted branches, and Christ, as the cultivated olive tree, live together one mingled life in one mingled living.</P><P>Reigning in life is the full experience of the organic salvation of God. God's complete salvation is through our receiving grace and righteousness, and this complete salvation issues in our reigning in life as the goal of His complete salvation. Reigning in life in chapter five is the key to open up the rest of the book. We need to see everything in Romans chapters six through sixteen in this light. This is altogether a new way to interpret the book of Romans.</P><P>When we are reigning in life, we are in all the matters presented in Romans six through sixteen. When we are reigning in life, we are being soaked and saturated with the holy nature of God for sanctification in our disposition, and our mingled spirit spreads into our mind to renew our mind. When we are reigning in life, we can be conformed to the image of God's firstborn Son and glorified through the sealing of the indwelling Spirit throughout our entire life. When we are reigning in life, we more than conquer the environmental hardships and sufferings, even being faithful to Christ and to God unto death. We also gain the righteousness of God, which is the subjective Christ, and we enjoy the riches of God. It is when we receive the abundance of grace and of the gift of righteousness to reign in life that we call on the Lord in a proper way. When we are reigning in life, we live a grafted life with Christ. If we do not reign in life, we cannot participate in these processes, but if we reign in life, we can be in all these things, and we can be constituted Christ's overcoming bride for His satisfaction, pleasure, and delight.</P><!-- saved from url=(0022)http://internet.e-mail --><H1 CLASS=SERIES>CRYSTALLIZATION-STUDY<br>OF THE COMPLETE SALVATION OF GOD<br>IN ROMANS</H1><H1 CLASS=MSG>MESSAGE FIVE</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>REIGNING IN LIFE</H1><H1 CLASS=PAREN>(2)</H1><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>OUTLINE</H2><ol class="upper-roman" start="3"><li>Through the abundance of grace and the abundance of the gift of righteousness&#151;Rom. 5:17b:</li>	<ol class="upper-alpha" start="10">	<li>In living the Body life&#151;chs. 12&#151;13:</li>		<ol class="decimal">		<li>Being captivated by the compassions of God&#151;12:1a.</li>		<li>Presenting our bodies a living sacrifice&#151;12:1b:</li>			<ol class="lower-alpha">			<li>Holy.</li>			<li>Well pleasing to God, our reasonable service.</li>			</ol>		<li>Not being fashioned according to this age&#151;12:2a.</li>		<li>Being transformed by the renewing of the mind&#151;12:2b.</li>		<li>Proving what the will of God is, that which is:</li>			<ol class="lower-alpha">			<li>Good.</li>			<li>Well pleasing.</li>			<li>Perfect&#151;12:2c.</li>			</ol>		<li>Not thinking more highly of ourselves than we ought to think&#151;12:3a.</li>		<li>Thinking so as to be sober-minded, as God has apportioned to each a measure of faith&#151;12:3b.</li>		<li>Considering that we have many members in one body and all the members do not have the same function&#151;12:4.</li>		<li>Realizing that we who are many are one Body in Christ and individually members one of another, having gifts that differ according to the grace given to us&#151;12:5-8:</li>			<ol class="lower-alpha">			<li>Prophesying as prophets according to the proportion of faith&#151;v. 6.</li>			<li>Serving as deacons and deaconesses faithfully in their particular service&#151;v. 7a.</li>			<li>Teaching as teachers faithfully in teaching&#151;v. 7b.</li>			<li>Exhorting as one who exhorts faithfully in exhortation&#151;v. 8a.</li>			<li>Giving as givers in simplicity&#151;v. 8b.</li>			<li>Leading as leaders in diligence&#151;v. 8c.</li>			<li>Showing mercy as one who shows mercy in cheerfulness&#151;v. 8d.</li>			</ol>		<li>Living a life of the highest virtues&#151;12:9-21:</li>			<ol class="lower-alpha">			<li>Loving people without hypocrisy&#151;v. 9a.</li>			<li>Abhorring what is evil and clinging to what is good&#151;v. 9b.</li>			<li>Loving one another warmly in brotherly love&#151;v. 10a.</li>			<li>Taking the lead in showing honor one to another&#151;v. 10b.</li>			<li>Not being slothful in zeal&#151;v. 11a.</li>			<li>Being burning in spirit, serving the Lord&#151;v. 11b.</li>			<li>Rejoicing in hope&#151;v. 12a.</li>			<li>Enduring in tribulation&#151;v. 12b.</li>			<li>Persevering in prayer&#151;v. 12c.</li>			<li>Contributing to the needs of the saints&#151;v. 13a.</li>			<li>Pursuing hospitality&#151;v. 13b.</li>			<li>Blessing those who persecute us; blessing only and not cursing&#151;v. 14.</li>			<li>Rejoicing with those who rejoice; weeping with those who weep&#151;v. 15.</li>			<li>Being of the same mind toward one another&#151;v. 16a.</li>			<li>Not setting our mind on the high things but going along with the lowly&#151;v. 16b.</li>			<li>Not being wise in ourselves&#151;v. 16c.</li>			<li>Repaying no one evil for evil&#151;v. 17a.</li>			<li>Taking forethought for things honorable in the sight of all men&#151;v. 17b.</li>			<li>If possible, as far as it depends on us, living in peace with all men&#151;v. 18.</li>			<li>Not avenging ourselves, but giving place to the wrath of God; for vengeance is God's, He will repay&#151;v. 19.</li>			<li>Feeding our enemy in hunger and giving him a drink in thirst; for in doing this we will heap coals of fire upon his head&#151;v. 20.</li>			<li>Not being conquered by evil, but conquering evil with good&#151;v. 21.</li>			</ol>		<li>Being subject to authorities&#151;13:1-7:</li>			<ol class="lower-alpha">			<li>Recognizing God's sovereignty over all the authorities&#151;vv. 1-6.</li>			<li>Rendering to all the things due: tax to whom tax is due, custom to whom custom is due, fear to whom fear is due, and honor to whom honor is due&#151;v. 7.</li>			</ol>		<li>Owing nothing to anyone except to love one another; loving our neighbor as ourselves&#151;13:8-10.</li>		<li>Living a watchful life in the day&#151;13:11-14:</li>			<ol class="lower-alpha">			<li>Being raised from sleep&#151;vv. 11-12a.</li>			<li>Casting off the works of darkness and putting on the weapons of light&#151;v. 12b.</li>			<li>Walking becomingly as in the day, not in reveling and drunkenness, not in fornication and licentiousness, not in strife and jealousy&#151;v. 13.</li>			<li>Putting on the Lord Jesus Christ and making no provision for the flesh to fulfill its lusts&#151;v. 14.</li>			</ol>		</ol>	</ol></ol><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>J. In Living the Body Life</H2><P>All the items mentioned in Romans 12 through 13 are for the living of the Body life. Each item requires us to be ruled by the divine life. All these items are small things, yet they can be done by us only when we are ruled by the divine life.</P><P>To present our bodies a living sacrifice (12:1) is a matter of reigning in life. Without reigning in life, no one can present his body a living sacrifice. When we reign in life, we are not being fashioned according to this age but are being transformed by the renewing of the mind, proving what the will of God is (v. 2).</P><P>When we are controlled by the divine life, we surely will think so as to be sober-minded, as God has apportioned to each a measure of faith (v. 3b). Our thinking about ourselves is like a wild horse. But by reigning in life our thinking is bridled.</P><P>Often the deacons or deaconesses may not take their proper position. This means they are not ruled by the divine life. When they are ruled by the divine life, they will serve faithfully in their particular service (v. 7a).</P><P>As we are under the ruling of the divine life, we are able to teach, exhort, give in simplicity, lead in diligence, and show mercy in cheerfulness (vv. 7b-8). Likewise, when we are a person under the ruling of the divine life, we will take the lead in showing honor one to another (v. 10b).</P><P>Romans 12:9-21 is a section on living a life of the highest virtues for the Body life. We must realize that in ourselves we could never practice these virtues. We can have such a living for the Body life only by reigning in life. If we check our church life, we will find that we are short in nearly every point. Romans 12:15 says, "Rejoice with those who rejoice; weep with those who weep." When others are rejoicing, we may be jealous, and when others are weeping, we may despise them. To rejoice with those who rejoice and to weep with those who weep are impossible except when we are under the ruling of the divine life. Our natural life cannot make it; but by living a life under the ruling of the divine life, we are able to live the Body life with these virtues. To see the Body life built up as a practical reality, we must reign in life, and to reign in life in practice is to be under the ruling of the divine life.</P><P>God's will is to have the Body life. Romans 13 presents some additional aspects of the life of one who is living in the Body life. As we have seen, we cannot have this kind of living in ourselves. Only by living under the ruling of the divine life can we be this kind of people. We must be subject to all authorities, realizing that they have been established under the sovereign arrangement of God. Furthermore, we must owe nothing to anyone except to love one another, loving our neighbor as ourselves. Finally, we must live a watchful life "in the day" (v. 13). One effect of our reigning in life is that we are awakened, made alert, made watchful, and not lulled to sleep by this age. We must be those who make no provision for the flesh to fulfill its lusts, but rather are awake as in the day, putting on the Lord Jesus Christ as our second garment (Psa. 45:13-14) to live Him as our subjective righteousness and to magnify Him.</P><P>God's complete salvation is for us to reign in life by the abundance of grace (God Himself as our all-sufficient supply for our organic salvation) and of the gift of righteousness (God's judicial redemption applied to us in a practical way). When we are all reigning in life, living under the ruling of the divine life, the issue is the real and practical Body life.</P><H1 CLASS=SERIES>CRYSTALLIZATION-STUDY<br>OF THE COMPLETE SALVATION OF GOD<br>IN ROMANS</H1><H1 CLASS=MSG>MESSAGE SIX</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>REIGNING IN LIFE</H1><H1 CLASS=PAREN>(3)</H1><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>OUTLINE</H2><ol class="upper-roman" start="3"><li>Through the abundance of grace and the abundance of the gift of righteousness&#151;Rom. 5:17b:</li>	<ol class="upper-alpha" start="11">	<li>In living the church life&#151;14:1&#151;15:13:</li>		<ol class="decimal">		<li>Receiving the believers under the reigning in life.</li>		<li>According to God's receiving&#151;14:1-23:</li>			<ol class="lower-alpha">			<li>Receiving the weak one, not for judgment on his doctrinal considerations concerning eating and keeping of days&#151;vv. 1-6.</li>			<li>By living to the Lord and caring for standing before the judgment seat of God, without judging one another and despising others, nor putting a stumbling block or cause of falling before a brother by not walking according to love&#151;vv. 7-16, 20-23.</li>			<li>Living the kingdom life not for eating and drinking, but for righteousness, peace, and joy in the Holy Spirit, pursuing peace and the building up of one another&#151;vv. 17-19.</li>			</ol>		<li>According to Christ's receiving&#151;15:1-13:</li>			<ol class="lower-alpha">			<li>The strong ones needing to bear the weaknesses of those who are weak; not pleasing ourselves but pleasing our neighbor for his building up as Christ did&#151;vv. 1-4.</li>			<li>That the God of endurance and encouragement may grant us to be of the same mind toward one another according to Christ Jesus so that with one accord we may glorify God in receiving one another as Christ also received us to the glory of God&#151;vv. 5-7.</li>			<li>Who (Christ) became the minister of both the circumcision and the Gentiles that the God of hope may fill us with all joy and peace for us to abound in hope in the power of the Holy Spirit&#151;vv. 8-13.</li>			</ol>		</ol>	<li>In the apostle Paul's setting up a pattern of living the church life for the living of the Body life&#151;15:14&#151;16:27:</li>		<ol class="decimal">		<li>Preaching the gospel to raise up the local churches in the Gentile world through the sanctification of the Holy Spirit, in the power of signs and wonders, and in the power of the Spirit of God&#151;15:14-24:</li>			<ol class="lower-alpha">			<li>From Jerusalem to Asia Minor&#151;v. 19a.</li>			<li>From Asia Minor to eastern Europe (Illyricum)&#151;vv. 19b-23a.</li>			<li>Intending to go to Spain through Rome&#151;vv. 23b-24.</li>			</ol>		<li>Bringing the Gentile churches into the fellowship of the Body of Christ with the Jewish churches in the communication of the provision of the Gentile churches to meet the necessity of the Jewish churches&#151;15:25-33.</li>		<li>Blending together many saints and many local churches under his ministry for the practical living of the Body of Christ in the universal fellowship of the Body by recommendations and greetings between the saints and the churches mutually through him&#151;16:1-16, 21-24.</li>		<li>Being very strict with the divisive and dissenting ones who make divisions, without compromise or yielding&#151;16:17-19 and note 172.</li>		<li>Affording the God of peace a situation in which He will crush Satan under the feet of the churches by the saints' enjoyment of the grace of Christ in the blending and the universal fellowship of the Body&#151;16:20.</li>		<li>Carrying out, based upon the righteousness of God and through man's obedience of faith (1:17), the mystery kept in silence in the times of the ages, concerning the complete salvation of God in the preaching of the complete gospel of God (1:1), in the fulfillment of the eternal economy of God for the glory to the only wise God through Jesus Christ&#151;16:25-27.<br><br>		Note: In the conclusion of this book, the glory to the consummated God indicates that the consummated God is glorified in the humanity of the glorified church under its reigning in life in the fulfillment of the eternal economy of God in carrying out His mystery hidden in the ages.</li>		</ol>	</ol></ol><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>K. In Living the Church Life</H2><P>To reign in life is to be under the ruling of the divine life. If we look at the life of the Lord Jesus as the God-man in His humanity on the earth, He was absolutely under the ruling of the divine life of the Father. Everything He did was under the Father's ruling. As a man, He rejected His natural humanity and lived a human life under the restriction of the divine life of His heavenly Father. By practically being under the ruling of the divine life of the Father, He was reigning in life. This is the pattern we should follow.</P><P>By living under the rule of the divine life, by reigning in life, we can live the church life. There is no possibility for us to live the church life if we are not under the ruling and control of the divine life. We must reign in life to live the church life.</P><P>Romans 14:1&#151;15:13 covers our reigning in life in the church life. The reason why there are so many divisions among Christians today is that their receiving of the believers is not under the restriction, the control, of the divine life. If all Christians would receive one another according to the divine life, all divisions would be gone. Only by reigning in life can we receive all whom God has received.</P><P>We must receive the believers according to God's receiving (14:1-23). God is our example as to how we should receive one another. In writing this chapter, Paul's heart was tolerant, his attitude was broad, and his view was noble. In order to practice the church life that he introduced in chapter twelve, we must strictly observe the matters set forth in chapter fourteen. Many saints who love the Lord and seek to live the church life have failed because they were either negligent or mistaken in this matter. In order to practice the church life revealed in chapter twelve, we must learn the practical lessons of receiving the believers, that the church life may be all-inclusive, able to include all kinds of genuine Christians. For this, we must all be under the reigning of the divine life.</P><P>Our receiving of the believers under the reigning in life is first according to God's receiving and then according to Christ's receiving (15:1-13). We should receive one another in the same way that Christ receives us. The strong ones need to bear the weaknesses of the weak, not pleasing themselves but pleasing the brothers and sisters for their building up, even as Christ did not please Himself but bore God's reproach (vv. 1-4). We should be of the same mind toward one another according to Christ Jesus so that with one accord we may glorify God in receiving one another as Christ also received us to the glory of God (vv. 5-7). Christ has become a minister of both the circumcision and the Gentiles that the God of hope may fill us with all joy and peace for us to abound in hope in the power of the Holy Spirit (vv. 8-13).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>L. In the Apostle Paul's Setting Up a Pattern</H2><P>Finally, we see how Paul set up a pattern of living the church life for the living of the Body life (15:14&#151;16:27). The first item in the pattern of one who is reigning in life is the preaching of the gospel. When we are under the ruling of the divine life, we will spontaneously preach the gospel. It is by our reigning in life that we preach the gospel.</P><P> Paul first preached the gospel to the Gentiles (15:14-24) and then brought them into the fellowship of the Body of Christ with the Jewish churches through their giving in love to provide for the necessities of the saints in Jerusalem (vv. 25-33). This was to bring the two into the fellowship of the one Body.</P><P>Paul by his recommendations and greetings in 16:1-24 is blending together many saints and many churches under his ministry for the practical living of the Body of Christ in the universal fellowship of the Body. In verses 17 through 19 Paul was very strict with the divisive and dissenting ones who make divisions, without compromise or yielding. In chapter fourteen Paul was liberal and gracious regarding the receiving of the believers, but here he is unyielding and resolute in saying that we must turn away from those who are dissenting, who make divisions, and who make causes of stumbling. The purpose in both cases is the preserving of the Body of Christ that we may have the normal church life. Today there is the need for all the believers who have received the abundance of grace and of the gift of righteousness to practice the life restriction and limitation in the divine life.</P><P>Paul afforded the God of peace a situation in which He will crush Satan under the feet of the churches by the saints' enjoyment of the grace of Christ in the blending and the universal fellowship of the Body (16:20). Hence, Paul was carrying out, based upon the righteousness of God and through man's obedience of faith (1:17), the mystery kept in silence in the times of the ages, concerning the complete salvation of God in the preaching of the complete gospel of God (1:1), in the fulfillment of the eternal economy of God for the glory to the only wise God through Jesus Christ(16:25-27). In the conclusion of this book, the glory to the consummated God indicates that the consummated God is glorified in the humanity of the glorified church under its reigning in life in the fulfillment of the eternal economy of God in carrying out His mystery hidden in the ages.</P></body></html>
