<P>Do not put demands on others. As long as someone is a dear brother in the Lord, that is good enough. No matter what he does in the meeting, you have to love him because he is a brother in Christ. Remember that you do not have a choice. If you have seen the church, you will lose all the choices. Do not think that I am an easygoing person. But by His mercy and by His grace, I can say that I am happy with all of the brothers. As long as one is a brother, we all have to be happy with him. Are you ready to give up all your choices? Maybe some of you are always nice and quiet. But the Lord will bring a lot of people who are noisy and who like to jump and shout, "O Lord! Amen! Hallelujah!" If you decide to drop the church because you dislike the noisy ones, this means you are keeping your choice and giving up your destiny.</P><P>What I am fellowshipping with you is not a small matter. By His mercy and grace, we have to be happy with all genuine Christians. As long as they are brothers and sisters in the Lord, we have to say, "Hallelujah!" If some like to shout, we should shout with them. But if we like to be quiet, the ones who like to shout should also be willing to be quiet with us. You should not demand that I shout with you yet refuse to be quiet with me. Neither should I demand that you be quiet with me yet refuse to shout with you. It must be fair. Eventually, we will all say, "We do not care for shouting or for being quiet; we care only for Christ."</P><P>This is the way to have the church life. No one insists on anything. All the leading ones and all the leaders of the different groups here in Los Angeles can testify that throughout the years none among us has ever insisted on anything. We have always been open to one another unto the Lord. We have no regulation. This is why we are changing over the years. Someone said, "Oh, the church in Los Angeles is changing so fast. If you go away for two months and come back, it will be absolutely different." You are right. Because we do not have regulations, we keep changing, or it is better to say that we are always improving.</P><P>We have no regulations, no rituals, no forms, and therefore no ordinances. Sometimes I heard some brothers say, "I think the Chinese people won't like this." Immediately I advised them not to say that. If you say that, it means you are keeping a kind of Chinese ordinance. In the church we have no ordinance. We have only Christ. Since this is the case, we can easily have the oneness. This is why many visitors in the past years who came to us were deeply impressed with the oneness of the church in Los Angeles. By His mercy, there are no ordinances in the church here. This is the main point in the Lord's recovery. The Lord is going to recover the proper church life, not only in Los Angeles but also throughout the world. But this needs all of us to have a strong realization that there should not be any kind of ordinance.</P>
