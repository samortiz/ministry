   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER NINE THE NEED OF A CLEAR VISION</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>OF GOD S NEW TESTAMENT ECONOMY Scripture Reading: Col 2:9; John 1:1, 14; Col 2:2b; Eph 3:8; 1:23; 3:2-4; 5:32; Col 1:25-29</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In order to practice the scriptural way to meet and to serve for the building up of the Body of Christ, we need a clear vision of God s New Testament economy.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>For this reason, this chapter is a very, very crucial chapter in this book.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The word economy is an anglicized word from the Greek word oikonomia.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Some English translations of the Bible translate oikonomia into dispensation see 1 Tim 1:4 of Darby s New Translation, the American Standard Version, and the Recovery Version .</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Many readers of the Bible do not know what this word means.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Dr. C. I. Scofield said that there were seven dispensations in the Bible concerning God s dealing with man from the time Adam was created to the end of the millennium.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>According to this usage, the seven dispensations are understood as seven ages.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>These seven ages are the ages of innocence, conscience, human government, promise, law, grace, and the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>According to Dr. Scofield these dispensations are the seven different ways that God deals with man.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Although this understanding is right, the Lord has shown us something further concerning the word economy.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>This Greek word oikonomia is composed of two words: oikos meaning house or household and nomos meaning law.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Thus, economy refers in the scriptural sense to a household law, or household administration.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>This administration is a plan, an arrangement, or a dispensation.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>According to today s common usage, the word economy is used for financial matters or the financial situation.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>But according to the biblical usage in the Greek language, God s economy is God s eternal plan, God s eternal arrangement for His administration according to His heart s desire.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>In the Old Testament there was God s Old Testament economy, God s old arrangement.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Now in the New Testament there is a new arrangement, that is, the New Testament economy of God.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>In order for us to understand the divine revelation, we must understand God s New Testament economy.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Since the Lord s recovery began among us in China in 1922 through Brother Watchman Nee, the Lord has used us to recover a number of truths from the Word.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>But the expression the New Testament economy was not used among us in mainland China nor was it used in our work on the island of Taiwan.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>I did not pick up the term God s economy until we had a summer conference in Los Angeles in 1964.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The fellowship from this conference is contained in a book entitled The Economy of God.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>That was the first time we used the word economy in our publications.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Then in 1984, I made a thorough study of this matter.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>First I went to Brazil and gave a series of messages contained in a book entitled The Divine Economy.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Then I went to Stuttgart, Germany and several localities in the United States to release a series of messages contained in the book God s New Testament Economy.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Now that the messages in this book have been released, I believe that the all-inclusive truth concerning God s New Testament economy has been fully recovered.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>On pages 12 and 13 of this large volume is a chart of God s New Testament economy.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>This chart shows that in the Gospels is the Son with the Father and by the Spirit; in Acts and the Epistles is the Spirit as the Son and with the Father; and in Revelation is the seven Spirits out from the Eternal One and of the Redeemer.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>In other words, the content of God s New Testament economy is a wonderful Person, and this Person is the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>I recommend that we study this chart and read this book.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>This book is an extension of this chapter and thoroughly covers the truth concerning God s New Testament economy.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>In my speaking, I cannot stay away from the Triune God because the Triune God is the basic element in the construction of the Bible, especially of the New Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Nearly every book is constructed with the Triune God as the basic element, the basic factor.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>If we take the Triune God out of the Holy Bible, the Holy Bible will become empty.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The real essence of the content of the Bible is the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The first chapter of the Bible reveals the Triune God vv.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>1, 26 .</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Books such as the Gospel of John, Ephesians, and Revelation are absolutely constructed, composed, and constituted with the divine Trinity as their elements and factors.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>No one can fully understand the Gospel of John without understanding the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>In John 14:16 the Lord says, And I will ask the Father, and He will give you another Comforter, that He may be with you forever.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>In this short sentence, the Triune God is revealed.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The Son asks the Father to give the disciples another Comforter, who is the Spirit of reality v. 17 . Each of the six chapters in the book of Ephesians reveals the Triune God 1:4-14; 2:18; 3:14-19; 4:4-6; 5:19-20; 6:10, 11, 17 . Note 14 1 of 2 Corinthians 13:14 in the Recovery Version presents a birds-eye view of the divine Trinity throughout the Holy Scriptures.</S>
