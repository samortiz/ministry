I do not believe that many could answer adequately. Some might answer that the Lord's recovery has recovered matters such as baptism by immersion, the presbytery (that is, the managing and administrating of the church by a group of presbyters, or elders), head covering, and the Lord's table. Although items such as these may be included in the Lord's recovery, all of these are minor things. None of them directly touches God's New Testament economy; none of them involves the divine dispensing or the divine mingling. In contrast, matters such as God's New Testament economy, the dispensing of the divine Trinity into the tripartite being of the believers, the mingling of divinity with humanity, and the building up of the organic Body of Christ are great matters.</P><P>The divine things of God have been with His New Testament people for almost twenty centuries. However, it seems that during this period there has been little improvement in Christian theology. When I speak of improvement, I do not mean that we can change the truth. To illustrate: no one can change the earth. The earth was created by God, and no human hand can change it. But transportation, the means of traveling on the earth, has been improving steadily for nearly six thousand years. History tells us that in order to travel on the earth, the human race first learned to use the wheel. The wheel is a basic element in nearly all forms of transportation. Wagons, bicycles, automobiles, and even jet airplanes utilize the wheel. From the wagon, to the bicycle, to the motor vehicle, to the jet airplane, there has been a great improvement in the means by which man travels on the earth. Many people have studied diligently in the fields of transportation and computer technology, and great improvements have been realized in these fields. But few Christians have devoted their time and energy to study the divine things; consequently, there has been little improvement over the centuries in this field.</P><P>If we are faithful and mean business with the Lord, we must learn something. Matters such as God's New Testament economy and the dispensing of the divine Trinity are not my inventions; all these things can be found in the Bible. For example, by reading Romans 8:2-11 again and again, we will see the dispensing of the divine Trinity. This dispensing takes place first in our spirit (v. 10); then, from our spirit it spreads into our mind (v. 6) to saturate our soul; and eventually, it will permeate our body (v. 11). First, this dispensing makes our spirit life, then it makes our soul life, and finally, it makes our body life. By this dispensing all three parts of our human being will be saturated and permeated with the divine Trinity. Out of this kind of dispensing, a mingling takes place. When one element saturates and permeates another, the two elements become mingled. Such a dispensing and such a mingling are for the building up of the organic Body of Christ, which is composed of all the churches.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>I. THE RECOVERY OF THE DIVINE REVELATION<br>CONCERNING GOD</H2><P>The first item of the Lord's recovery is the recovery of the divine revelation concerning God. There is no need to recover God Himself; but among Christians the revelation concerning God has been lost, missed, put aside, and even given up. Thus, there is a need to recover the divine revelation concerning God.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>A. In His Essence</H2><P>In His essence, God is essentially one, the one unique God, that is, the one Spirit (Isa. 45:18b; 1 Cor. 8:6a).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>B. In His Economy</H2><P>In His economy, God is economically three. Essentially, God is one, but economically, He is three&#151;the Father, the Son, and the Spirit (Matt. 28:19; 2 Cor. 13:14). An illustration of this principle can be seen in the lampstand. In the Old Testament, the lampstand was placed in both the tabernacle and the temple (Exo. 26:35; 1 Kings 7:49). In the New Testament, the lampstand is seen in Revelation 1:11-13 and 20. The lampstand is one stand, but it has seven lamps. The seven lamps do not refer to the essence of the lampstand; rather, they refer to its function. Function is a matter of economy. Hence, economically speaking, the lampstand has seven lamps for shining, and the shining of the lamps is to fulfill the function of the lampstand, that is, to carry out the economy of the lampstand. In essence, the lampstand itself is one, but in economy, it is seven. This is a very good illustration of our God's divine being.</P><P>In His economy, God is three&#151;the Father, the Son, and the Spirit. The great theologians of the fourth and fifth centuries referred to the Three of the Trinity as three hypostases. The primary sense of the Greek word for hypostasis is something which stands underneath, that is, a support or a foundation. To illustrate, one table has four legs supporting it, and the four legs of the table are its four hypostases. Likewise, there is one God, but He is the Father, the Son, and the Spirit. These three&#151;the Father, the Son, and the Spirit&#151;are the three divine hypostases. The word hypostasis, which was used in the theological writings that appeared in the Greek language, can also be translated substance. Later, when theology entered into the Latin language, the word persona was used. Then, in the English language, the term became person. Thus, it is said that the Father, Son, and Spirit are three persons. However, we should not understand this to mean that They are three separate persons according to the common understanding of the word person.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>1. The Father, as the Origin, Being the Fountain,<br>the Son, as the Expression, Being the Spring,<br>and the Spirit, as the Transmission, Being the Flow</H2><P>The Father, as the origin, is the fountain; the Son, as the expression, is the spring; and the Spirit, as the transmission, is the flow. A fountain is the origin, the source, of a stream or a river; a spring is the emergence, the expression, of the fountain; and the stream or river is the flow. In Jeremiah 2:13 God refers to Himself as the fountain of living waters; in John 4:14 Christ is the spring of water that wells up in the believers unto eternal life; and in Revelation 22:1 the Spirit is the flow, the river of water of life. This shows that God is essentially one yet economically three.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>2. Not Three Separate Gods (Tritheism),<br>Not with Two Divine Fathers,<br>and Not "Jesus Only"</H2><P>It is wrong to say that the Three of the divine Trinity are three separate Gods; that is the teaching of tritheism. Likewise, it is wrong to say that there are two divine Fathers, one, the Father among the Trinity (Matt. 28:19), and the other, the Father of eternity mentioned in Isaiah 9:6 (lit.). We do not have two divine Fathers; we have only one divine Father. Thus, the Father of eternity is the Father among the Three of the divine Trinity. Moreover, the particular teaching expressed in the term "Jesus only" also is wrong.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>3. The Father Being Embodied in the Son<br>and the Son Being Realized as the Spirit</H2><P>The Father is embodied in the Son, and the Son is realized as the Spirit. This is fully revealed in John 14:16-20. If we read those five verses, we will see that the Spirit is the realization of the Son, Christ.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>4. The Father Purposed,<br>the Son Accomplished<br>What the Father Had Purposed,<br>and the Spirit Applies<br>What the Son Has Accomplished</H2><P>The Father purposed (Eph. 1:4-6), the Son accomplished what the Father had purposed (Eph. 1:7-12), and the Spirit applies what the Son has accomplished (Eph. 1:13-14).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>5. The Son and the Father Being One,<br>and the Spirit Being One<br>with both the Father and the Son</H2><P>The Son came with the Father to accomplish redemption (John 6:46), and the Father was with the Son all the time while the Son was on the earth (John 8:16b, 29). In John 6:46 the preposition translated from carries the sense of from with. Thus, when the Lord Jesus came to the earth to accomplish redemption, He came not only from the Father but also with the Father. In John 8:16 and 29 the Lord Jesus told us that He was not alone, but the Father was always with Him.</P><P>The Son also came in the name of the Father (John 5:43). This is why in Isaiah 9:6 the Son is called the Father. Moreover, the Father sent the Spirit in the Son's name (John 14:26a). These two things are evidence not only that the Son and the Father are one, but also that the Spirit is one with both the Father and the Son. The Three of the divine Trinity are one.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD4>a. For the Dispensing of the Divine Trinity<br>into the Believers</H2><P>This kind of economy, arrangement, or plan, is for the dispensing of the divine Trinity into the believers. In Romans 8:5-11 we can see this dispensing.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD4>b. For the Believers to Experience and Enjoy<br>the Processed Triune God</H2><P>This arrangement is also for the believers to experience and enjoy the processed Triune God (2 Cor. 13:14).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD4>c. That the Processed Triune God<br>and the Regenerated Believers May Be Mingled as One<br>for the Building Up of the Organic Body of Christ</H2><P>This arrangement is also that the processed Triune God and the regenerated believers may be mingled as one (Eph. 4:4-6) for the building up of the organic Body of Christ (Eph. 4:12-13, 15-16). Ephesians 4:4-6 tells us that there is one Body, one Spirit, one Lord, and one God and Father of all. This indicates that the Triune God is mingled with the Body of Christ, that is, with us, the believers. This mingling is for the building up of the organic Body of Christ. Ephesians 4:12-13 and 15-16 are four verses that show us that the mingling of the divine Trinity with the believers is for an organic building, the building up of the Body of Christ.</P><P>All the aforementioned items have been altogether missed by most Christians today. In the training received by most students of theology, they are merely told in a general way that God is triune&#151;the Father, the Son, and the Spirit. Most Christians have not gone beyond this point in their understanding of the divine Trinity. However, all the points mentioned above are clearly revealed in the divine revelation, especially in the New Testament.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>II. THE RECOVERY OF THE DIVINE REVELATION<br>CONCERNING CHRIST</H2><P>The second major item of the Lord's recovery is the recovery of the divine revelation concerning Christ.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>A. In Eternity, Christ Being<br>the Word of God and God Himself</H2><P>In eternity, Christ was the Word of God and God Himself (John 1:1). He was not only the Word of God, but He was also God Himself. John 1:1 says, "In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God." The Word was not only with God, but the Word was God.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>B. In Time, Christ as the Word of God<br>Becoming Flesh to Be a Man and to Tabernacle<br>among Men, Full of Grace and Reality</H2><P>In time, Christ as the Word of God became flesh to be a man and to tabernacle among men (John 1:14), full of grace (God for men to receive as their enjoyment) and reality (God to be realized by men as their reality).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>C. Christ Being both the Complete God<br>and the Perfect Man, Possessing<br>the Divine Nature and the Human Nature As Well,<br>to Be the Embodiment<br>of the Fullness of the Godhead</H2><P>Hence, Christ is both the complete God and the perfect man, the Triune God and the tripartite man, possessing the divine nature and the human nature as well, to be the embodiment of the fullness of the Godhead (Col. 2:9).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>D. Christ Being the All-inclusive<br>and All-extensive One</H2><P>Christ is the all-inclusive and all-extensive One (Eph. 1:23b). According to Ephesians 1:23, Christ is the One who fills all in all; hence, He is all-extensive. As the all-extensive One, surely He is all-inclusive.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>1. Being the Only Begotten Son of God<br>from Eternity, and the Firstborn Son of God<br>from His Resurrection in Humanity</H2><P>This all-inclusive, all-extensive Christ is the only begotten Son of God from eternity (John 3:16a; 17:24b), and the firstborn Son of God from His resurrection in humanity (Rom. 8:29b; Acts 13:33). Christ as the Son of God has two statuses: the only begotten Son of God and the firstborn Son of God. Most Christians have no realization concerning this, and some may even say that this is heresy. However, this is not heresy, for it is clearly mentioned in John 3:16, which says that Christ is the only begotten Son of God, and in Romans 8:29, which says that He is God's firstborn Son among many brothers.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>2. As the Son Given,<br>Being Called the Father of Eternity<br>and, Hence, Being One with the Father</H2><P>As the Son given, Christ is called "the Father of Eternity" (Isa. 9:6); hence, He is one with the Father (John 10:30; 14:8-10). We can say that Christ is both the Father and the Son because He is all-inclusive. If He were only the Son and not the Father, He would not be all-inclusive.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>3. In His Resurrection, Becoming<br>the Life-giving Spirit and, Hence,<br>Being the Spirit and the Lord Spirit</H2><P>In His resurrection Christ became the life-giving Spirit (1 Cor. 15:45b). He is not only the Son and the Father; eventually, He became the life-giving Spirit as well. Hence, He is the Spirit and the Lord Spirit (2 Cor. 3:17-18).</P><P>In 1964 shortly after I came to the United States, a dear friend warned me, saying that although this kind of teaching is in the Bible, Christianity would not accept it. So he advised me to put this teaching aside. In response, I told this brother that since this teaching is in the Bible, he should give me the liberty to speak this matter as the Lord had led me to do. I told him that if I could not speak on Christ as the Spirit, I would have nothing to speak. Now, twenty-six years later, it is common to hear the saints in the Lord's recovery speak of Christ being the Spirit. In the Lord's table meetings, many of the saints praise the Lord not only for dying for us on the cross and resurrecting from the dead, but also for being the life-giving Spirit who indwells us. If we could praise the Lord only for dying for us on the cross, for resurrecting, and for now being seated in the heavens, our feeling would not be so sweet, for Christ would be far away from us. But, hallelujah, today the crucified and resurrected One has become a life-giving Spirit indwelling us! No one can deny this. This is an important item in the New Testament. It is also a major item in the Lord's recovery.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>4. In His Resurrection and Ascension, Becoming<br>both the Lord of All and the Christ of God</H2><P>In His resurrection and ascension, Christ became both the Lord of all and the Christ of God (Acts 2:36; Rev. 11:15). He became the Lord of us, and He became the Christ of God to carry out God's economy. He is the Christ of God, the anointed One of God to carry out God's economy.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>5. Being the Firstborn of All Creation<br>and the Firstborn of the Resurrection<br>from among the Dead</H2><P>Christ is the Firstborn of all creation and the Firstborn of the resurrection from the dead (Col. 1:15, 18). God has two creations, the old creation and the new creation. The old creation came into being by God's creating work. Colossians 1:15 says that Christ is the Firstborn of the old creation. The second creation, God's new creation, came into being by and in resurrection. According to Colossians 1:18, Christ is the Firstborn of the resurrection from among the dead. Thus, Christ is the Firstborn of both creations.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>6. Being the One Who Is Worthy<br>to Open the Seven Seals of God<br>concerning God's Administration in the<br>Whole Universe according to God's Economy</H2><P>Christ is the One who is worthy to open the seven seals of God concerning God's administration in the whole universe according to God's economy (Rev. 5:2-5). He is the only One who is worthy to open the sealed secret of God's economy.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>7. Being the Head of the Body<br>and Also Being the Body of the Corporate Christ</H2><P>Christ is the Head of the Body (Col. 1:18), and He is also the Body of the corporate Christ (1 Cor. 12:12). This means that He is both the Head and the Body.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>8. Being All the Members of the New Man</H2><P>Thus, Christ is all the members of the new man (Col. 3:10-11). The new man is Christ. Christ is all-inclusive.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>9. Being the God-allotted Portion of the Believers<br>as Their Life and Life Supply Today<br>and Their Glory in the Future</H2><P>Christ is the God-allotted portion of the believers (Col. 1:12) as their life and life supply today (Col. 3:4) and their glory in the future (Col. 1:27). Colossians 1:27 says that Christ in us is the hope of glory. As our God-allotted portion, Christ is our life today, and He will be our glory in the future.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>10. Being the Foundation Stone,<br>the Cornerstone, and the Topstone<br>of God's Building</H2><P>Christ is the foundation stone (1 Cor. 3:11; Isa. 28:16), the cornerstone (Eph. 2:20b), and the topstone (Zech. 4:7) of God's building.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>11. Being Resurrection, Life, Power, Wisdom:<br>Righteousness, Sanctification, and Redemption,<br>and the Reality of All Positive Things</H2><P>Christ is resurrection, life, power, wisdom: righteousness, sanctification, and redemption, and the reality of all positive things (John 11:25; 14:6; 1 Cor. 1:24, 30; Col. 2:16-17; Gal. 3:27; John 10:9; 1 Cor. 10:3-4). Colossians 2:16-17 says that eating, drinking, holidays, the Sabbath, and new moons all are shadows, and that the body of these shadows is Christ. According to Galatians 3:27, Christ is our clothing; that is, we wear Him. In John 10:9, Christ is our door; through Him we go out of the religious fold and enter into the rich pasture. In 1 Corinthians 10:3-4, Christ is our spiritual food and our spiritual drink; He is also the spiritual rock that follows us. He is the reality of all positive things.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>12. His Riches Being Unsearchable</H2><P>According to Ephesians 3:8, Christ's riches are unsearchable.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>13. Giving the Spirit Not by Measure</H2><P>Christ gives the Spirit not by measure (John 3:34b). Because He is all-inclusive and all-extensive, Christ is also immeasurable.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>14. His Grace Being Sufficient for Us</H2><P>The grace of Christ is sufficient for us (2 Cor. 12:9).</P><P>All of the above items concerning Christ are included in the Lord's recovery. Nearly all of them have been lost, missed, or put aside by Christianity.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>III. THE RECOVERY OF THE DIVINE REVELATION<br>CONCERNING THE SPIRIT</H2><P>The third item of the Lord's recovery is the recovery of the divine revelation concerning the Spirit.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>A. The Holy Spirit, the Spirit of God,<br>the Spirit of Jesus, the Spirit of Christ,<br>the Spirit of Jesus Christ, and the Spirit of Life</H2><P>The Spirit is the Holy Spirit (Acts 16:6b), the Spirit of God (Rom. 8:9a), the Spirit of Jesus (Acts 16:7), the Spirit of Christ (Rom. 8:9b), the Spirit of Jesus Christ (Phil. 1:19b), and the Spirit of life (Rom. 8:2a). Although I was in Christianity for years, I never heard anyone speak concerning the Spirit of Jesus, the Spirit of Christ, and the Spirit of Jesus Christ. However, the Spirit of Jesus is mentioned clearly in Acts 16:7, the Spirit of Christ is spoken of in Romans 8:9, and the Spirit of Jesus Christ is mentioned in Philippians 1:19. By reading these three books, we can see that today the Holy Spirit, who is the Spirit of God, has become something further: He is the Spirit of Jesus, the Spirit of Christ, and the Spirit of Jesus Christ. Not only so, He is also the Spirit of life.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>B. The Compound Spirit<br>as the Anointing Ointment</H2><P>The Spirit is also the compound Spirit as the anointing ointment (2 Cor. 1:21; 1 John 2:20, 27; cf. Exo. 30:23-26). The word anointed is used by the apostle Paul in 2 Corinthians 1:21, and the word anointing is used by the apostle John in 1 John 2:20 and 27. This word is taken from Exodus 30:23-26 which speaks concerning the compound anointing ointment. That ointment was not merely olive oil, but was compounded of olive oil as the base and four kinds of spices. The four spices were ground into powder and then compounded with olive oil to make an ointment. This ointment was for anointing the tabernacle, the altar, and all their furnishings and utensils.</P><P>I became familiar with this through the writings of the Brethren. In Exodus 30 the Scofield Reference Bible has a note telling us that the compound ointment is a type of the Holy Spirit. However, it does not go on to tell us that this ointment is a compound with oil as the base and with another four spices as elements for compounding. I myself spent much time over a period of more than fifty years to study this matter. Through my study I found out that the oil signifies the Spirit of God and that each of the four spices typifies Christ with His death and resurrection. The first spice, myrrh, typifies the precious death of Christ; the second, cinnamon, typifies the sweetness and effectiveness of Christ's death; the third, calamus, typifies the precious resurrection of Christ; and the fourth, cassia, typifies the power of Christ's resurrection. These ingredients have been compounded with the Spirit of God to become an ointment. This is the compound Spirit as the anointing ointment. The Spirit today is the compound Spirit, who is compounded with God the Spirit and with Christ's humanity, with Christ's death and the effectiveness of Christ's death, and with Christ's resurrection and the power of Christ's resurrection. All these are now in the one Spirit. Eventually, this compound Spirit is referred to in the Bible as the Spirit (John 7:39; Rev. 22:17).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>C. The Life-giving Spirit</H2><P>The Spirit is also the life-giving Spirit (2 Cor. 3:6b). We should not forget that today the life-giving Spirit is a compound Spirit.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>D. The Indwelling Spirit</H2><P>As the life-giving Spirit, the Spirit is also the indwelling Spirit (Rom. 8:11).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>E. The Sevenfold Spirit</H2><P>In Revelation 1:4b, 4:5b, and 5:6b, the Spirit is revealed as the sevenfold Spirit. In these verses the one Spirit of God is called "the seven Spirits." However, here we do not have seven separate Spirits; rather, we have one Spirit who is sevenfold&#151;one sevenfold Spirit.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>F. The Spirit as the Consummated Spirit<br>to Be the Consummation<br>of the Processed Triune God</H2><P>Eventually, the Spirit in all of the above aspects is simply the Spirit as the consummated Spirit to be the consummation of the processed Triune God (John 7:39; Rev. 22:17). In this Spirit we have God, Christ, man, Christ's death, Christ's resurrection, the power of Christ's death, and the fragrance of Christ's resurrection. In all of today's Christianity, it would be difficult to find one person who has any knowledge of these things. This is the recovery of the divine revelation concerning the Spirit.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>IV. THE RECOVERY OF THE DIVINE REVELATION<br>CONCERNING THE ETERNAL LIFE</H2><P>The fourth item of the Lord's recovery is the recovery of the divine revelation concerning the eternal life. Many Christians hold the concept that eternal life is a blessing given to the believers, in which they merely go to a heavenly mansion to enjoy a better life. When I was in Christianity, no one told me that eternal life is not a blessing, but that it is simply life. In our physical body we have a biological life (bios), and in our soul we have a psychological life (psuche). We had these two kinds of life before we were saved. But when we were saved, we received another life, the eternal life (zoe).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>A. The Life That Is Not Only Everlasting<br>but Eternal both in Time and in Nature</H2><P>The eternal life is the life that is not only everlasting but eternal both in time and in nature (John 3:16, 36; 1 John 1:2). This life is unlimited both in time and in nature; hence, it is eternal.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>B. The Uncreated Life of God,<br>the Indestructible Life, and the Incorruptible Life</H2><P>The eternal life is the uncreated life of God (Eph. 4:18), the indestructible life (Heb. 7:16), and the incorruptible life (2 Tim. 1:10). Concerning the definition of the eternal life, I received much help through the writings of Watchman Nee, Mary McDonough, Ruth Paxson, and T. Austin-Sparks. Through their writings I came to know that to be regenerated is simply to receive God into us as our life, to receive a life that is divine, a life other than our human life.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>C. The Life That Is in the Son of God<br>and That Is the Son of God</H2><P>The eternal life is the life that is in the Son of God and that is the Son of God (1 John 5:11-12; 1:2; John 14:6). This life is not only in the Son of God, but it is the Son of God Himself.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>D. The Life with Which<br>the Believers Are Regenerated<br>and Which Becomes the Believers' Life,<br>Making the Believers the Children of God<br>and the Members of Christ</H2><P>The eternal life is the life with which the believers are regenerated and which becomes the believers' life (Col. 3:4a), making the believers the children of God (John 1:12-13) and the members of Christ (Eph. 5:30).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>E. The Life on Which We Should Lay Hold</H2><P>In 1 Timothy 6:12 the apostle Paul charged us to lay hold on this eternal life.</P><P>The New Testament teaches us that the eternal life has three stages, and these three stages are in three ages&#151;the present age, the church age; the coming age, the kingdom age; and the eternal age, in the new heaven and the new earth with the New Jerusalem as the center. In the first age, the church age, we receive the eternal life. Thus, it becomes our life, and we enjoy this life and live by it. In the church age it is a matter of receiving the eternal life, but in the next age, the age of the kingdom, the eternal life is not for people to receive, but for people to enter into. In Matthew 25:46, those among the nations who are judged by the Lord Jesus to be "sheep" will enter into eternal life in the kingdom age. Thus, in the coming age the eternal life will become a sphere for people to enter into. In that age the eternal life will be given as a reward. In this age the eternal life is for us to receive as a free gift (Rom. 6:23b), but in the coming age the eternal life will be for us to enter into, not as a free gift but as a reward. This reward will be given to both the overcoming believers and to the "sheep" in Matthew 25 who paid a price to take care of Christ's brothers during the great tribulation. Then, in the eternal age, that is, in the new heaven and the new earth with the New Jerusalem as the center, the eternal life will eventually be the consummated gift for all God's redeemed people to manifest the Triune God for eternity.</P><P>If we have this view, we will be able to understand a number of verses in the Gospels. In the Gospels the Lord told people both to enter into eternal life and to receive eternal life. In Matthew 19:17 the Lord told the young man to enter into eternal life, but in John, especially in chapter three, He spoke of receiving eternal life. We have received eternal life as a gift, but whether or not we will enter into eternal life as a reward in the future remains to be determined. We may receive the eternal life without doing any work, as a free gift, but to enter into the eternal life requires us to do the proper works, to have the proper virtues, and to pay a price. If we are not clear concerning this, we may feel that the New Testament contradicts itself by saying, on the one hand, that we can receive the eternal life as a free gift, and, on the other hand, that we must pay a price to enter into it. We need to be clear that in the present age, eternal life is a gift given for us to receive, but in the coming age, eternal life will be a reward to recompense us for the price that we have paid for the Lord's sake. Then, in the eternal age, the receiving and the entering will become one.</P><P>It is by this eternal life and in this eternal life that the believers have been brought forth. The eternal life is crucial for the producing of the believers and for the building up of the organic Body of Christ.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>V. THE RECOVERY OF THE DIVINE REVELATION<br>CONCERNING THE BELIEVERS</H2><P>The fifth item in the Lord's recovery is the recovery of the divine revelation concerning the believers.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>A. The Believers Being Tripartite Beings<br>of Spirit, Soul, and Body</H2><P>The believers are tripartite beings of spirit, soul, and body (1 Thes. 5:23).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>B. The Believers Being Redeemed, Justified,<br>and Reconciled to God in Christ</H2><P>The believers are redeemed, justified, and reconciled to God in Christ (Rom. 3:24; 5:10a). We have not only been saved; we have been redeemed, justified, and reconciled to God in Christ.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>C. The Believers Having Been Baptized<br>into the Triune God to Have an Organic Union<br>with the Processed Triune God</H2><P>The believers have been baptized into the Triune God to have an organic union with the processed Triune God (Matt. 28:19). In his Word Studies in the New Testament, M.R. Vincent, writing on Matthew 28:19, said, "Baptizing into the name of the Holy Trinity implies a spiritual and mystical union with Him." Such a thought, such a revelation, has been lost in Christianity. Baptism is to baptize us into the Triune God that we may have an organic union with the processed Triune God.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>D. The Believers Being Regenerated in Their Spirit<br>by the Spirit with the Divine Life, Which Is Christ,<br>to Be the Children of God, Having<br>the Divine Nature, and the Members of Christ<br>in the Union of the Divine Life</H2><P>The believers are regenerated in their spirit by the Spirit (John 3:5-6) with the divine life, which is Christ (Col. 3:4a), to be the children of God (John 1:12-13), having the divine nature (2 Pet. 1:4b), and to be the members of Christ (Rom. 12:5) in the union of the divine life. Regeneration takes place in our spirit. It is carried out by the Spirit with the divine life, and it makes us, first, the children of God, and then, the members of Christ.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>E. The Believers Having Been Crucified with Christ,<br>Being Terminated in Their Old Man</H2><P>The believers have been crucified with Christ, being terminated in their old man (Gal. 2:20; Rom. 6:6).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>F. The Believers Having Christ Living in Them as<br>the Pneumatic Christ, the Spirit, Indwelling Them</H2><P>The believers have Christ living in them as the pneumatic Christ, the Spirit, indwelling them (Rom. 8:11).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>G. The Believers Having Been<br>Sanctified Positionally by the Blood of Christ<br>and Being Sanctified Dispositionally<br>by the Spirit, That They May Be Renewed,<br>Transformed in Their Soul, Conformed<br>to the Image of the Firstborn Son of God,<br>and Glorified in Their Body in the Glory<br>of the Processed Triune God</H2><P>The believers have been sanctified positionally by the blood of Christ (Heb. 13:12) and are being sanctified dispositionally by the Spirit (Rom. 15:16; 6:19, 22), that they may be renewed, transformed in their soul (Rom. 12:2a; 2 Cor. 3:18), conformed to the image of the firstborn Son of God (Rom. 8:29), and glorified (redeemed) in their body (Rom. 8:23) in the glory of the processed Triune God (Rom. 8:30, 17-18). Although the believers have been regenerated in their spirit, their soul and body remain old. Thus, the believers need to be renewed, transformed in their soul, conformed to the image of the firstborn Son of God, and glorified in their body in the glory of the processed Triune God. The believers are tripartite beings composed of spirit, soul, and body. First, their spirit is regenerated, then their soul is transformed, and finally, their body will be glorified. Thus the believers' whole being will be saturated with God's splendid life. God's life is a life of splendor, and that splendor is the glory of the divine life. When we are permeated, saturated, and soaked with the splendor of the divine life, we will be in glory.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>H. The Believers Being Saturated<br>with the Dispensing of the Divine Trinity<br>in Their Tripartite Being, So That They Are<br>Mingled with the Processed Triune God</H2><P>The believers are saturated with the dispensing of the divine Trinity in their tripartite being (Rom. 8:5-11), so that they are mingled with the processed Triune God.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>I. The Believers Being Joined<br>to the Lord as One Spirit</H2><P>The believers are joined to the Lord as one spirit (1 Cor. 6:17).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>J. The Believers Being the Branches of Christ<br>as the Vine Tree, the Organism of the Triune God,<br>to Express the Processed Triune God<br>in Bearing Fruit for the Increase of Christ</H2><P>The believers are the branches of Christ as the vine tree, the organism of the Triune God, to express the processed Triune God in bearing fruit for the increase of Christ (John 15:1-5, 8, 16). As the branches of Christ, the believers should live a fruit-bearing life for Christ's increase.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>K. The Believers Being<br>God's New Testament Priests of His Gospel<br>to Offer the Saved Sinners<br>as Sacrifices to God</H2><P>The believers are God's New Testament priests of His gospel to offer the saved sinners as sacrifices to God (Rom. 15:16; 1 Pet. 2:5, 9). As the priests of God, the believers should have a sinner-saving service for offering sacrifices to God.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>VI. THE RECOVERY OF THE DIVINE REVELATION<br>CONCERNING THE CHURCH</H2><P>The sixth item of the Lord's recovery is the recovery of the divine revelation concerning the church.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>A. The Church Being the Church of God,<br>Chosen and Predestinated by God the Father,<br>Redeemed by God the Son,<br>and Sealed by God the Spirit</H2><P>The church is the church of God (1 Cor. 10:32), chosen and predestinated by God the Father (Eph. 1:3-6), redeemed by God the Son (Eph. 1:7-12), and sealed by God the Spirit (Eph. 1:13-14).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>B. The Church Being the Body of Christ,<br>the Fullness of the One Who Fills All in All,<br>as His Expression, United Organically to the<br>Resurrected, Ascended, and Transmitting Head</H2><P>The church is the Body of Christ, the fullness of the One who fills all in all (Eph. 1:23), as His expression, united organically to the resurrected, ascended, and transmitting Head (Eph. 1:19-22).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>C. The Church Also Being<br>the Fullness of the Processed Triune God,<br>Filled with the Riches of Christ<br>and with the Immeasurable Christ</H2><P>The church is the fullness of Christ, and it is also the fullness of the processed Triune God (Eph. 3:14-19), filled with the riches of Christ and with the immeasurable Christ (Eph. 3:8b, 17-19a). The church is filled with Christ Himself and with the riches of Christ. Such a church is the fullness of the processed Triune God.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>D. The Church Being the Counterpart of Christ<br>as His Increase, a Glorious Church,<br>Holy and without Blemish</H2><P>The church is the counterpart of Christ, as Eve was to Adam (Gen. 2:21-23), as His increase (John 3:29-30), a glorious church, holy and without blemish (Eph. 5:27).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>E. The Church Being the New Man<br>Created in Christ, through His Cross,<br>with the Jewish and Gentile Believers</H2><P>The church is the new man created in Christ, through His cross, with the Jewish and Gentile believers (Eph. 2:14-16).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>F. The Church Being the Mingling<br>of the Processed Triune God with the Believers,<br>Being Built Up as the Organic Body of Christ<br>by the Gifted Members and by Each<br>Functioning Part through the Growth in Life</H2><P>The church is the mingling of the processed Triune God with the believers (Eph. 4:3-6), being built up as the organic Body of Christ by the gifted members (every joint of the rich supply) and by each functioning part through the growth in life (Eph. 4:11-13, 15-16). The church as the organic Body of Christ is built up by two categories of persons: first, the gifted persons, who are the joints of the rich supply, and second, each functioning part. We should have and we do have these two kinds of persons among us. In the building up of the Body of Christ, the gifted persons perfect the saints that the saints may do the work of the New Testament ministry, that is, that they may build up the Body of Christ.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>G. The Church Being the House of God,<br>the Habitation of God in Our Spirit</H2><P>The church is the house of God (Eph. 2:19b; 1 Tim. 3:15), the habitation of God in our spirit (Eph. 2:22).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>H. The Church Being the Kingdom of God Today,<br>the Reality of the Kingdom of the Heavens</H2><P>The church is the kingdom of God today, the reality of the kingdom of the heavens (Matt. 16:18-19). In Matthew 16:18 the Lord said, "On this rock I will build My church." Then, in verse 19 He said, "I will give to you the keys of the kingdom of the heavens." This shows us that today the proper church life is the reality of the kingdom of the heavens.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>I. The Church Existing Universally<br>as the Unique Universal Church, but Being<br>Expressed Locally as Many Local Churches</H2><P>The church exists universally as the unique universal church (Eph. 1:22-23), but it is expressed locally as many local churches (Rev. 1:4a, 11).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>J. This All Being according to<br>the Arrangement of God's Eternal Economy</H2><P>This is all according to the arrangement of God's eternal economy (Eph. 3:9-11; 1:9-11).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>VII. THE RECOVERY OF THE CHURCH GROUND</H2><P>Following the above six main items of the Lord's recovery, I would like to add two more items, that is, the recovery of the church ground and the recovery of the practice of the local churches.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>A. The Definition of the Church Ground</H2><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>1. Not the Foundation but the Site</H2><P>The word ground that we use in reference to the church ground does not carry the denotation of a foundation, like the foundation of a building; it bears the denotation of a site, like the site on which the foundation of a building is laid.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>2. The Three Crucial Elements<br>of the Church Ground</H2><P>According to the divine revelation of the New Testament, the church ground is constituted of three crucial elements, as follows:</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD4>a. The Unique Oneness of the Universal Body of Christ</H2><P>The first element of the constitution of the church ground is the unique oneness of the universal Body of Christ, which is called "the oneness of the Spirit" (Eph. 4:3). This is the oneness that the Lord prayed for in John 17. It is a oneness of the mingling of the processed Triune God with all the believers in Christ. This oneness is in the name of the Father (John 17:6, 11), denoting the Father's person, in which is the Father's life. This oneness is even in the Triune God through sanctification by His holy word as the truth (John 17:14-21). This oneness is ultimately in the divine glory for the expression of the Triune God (John 17:22-24). Such a oneness was imparted into the spirit of all the believers in Christ, in their regeneration by the Spirit of life with Christ as the divine life; this oneness has become the basic element of the church ground.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD4>b. The Unique Ground of Locality of a Local Church</H2><P>The second element of the church ground is the unique ground of the locality in which a local church is established and exists. The New Testament presents us a clear picture that all the local churches, as the expression of the universal church&#151;the universal Body of Christ&#151;are located in their respective cities. Hence, we see the church in Jerusalem (Acts 8:1), the church in Antioch (Acts 13:1), the church in Cenchrea (Rom. 16:1), the church in Corinth (1 Cor. 1:2), and the seven churches in Asia in seven respective cities (Rev. 1:4, 11). Every city as the boundary in which a church exists is the local ground of that church. Such a unique ground of locality preserves the church from being divided by many different matters as different grounds in the way that divisive denominations such as the Baptists, the Presbyterians, the Lutherans, the Methodists, and the Episcopalians are divided.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD4>c. The Reality of the Spirit of Oneness</H2><P>The third element of the church ground is the reality of the Spirit of oneness, expressing the unique oneness of the universal Body of Christ on the unique ground of locality of a local church. Briefly, the third element of the church ground is the reality of the Spirit, who is the living reality of the divine Trinity (1 John 5:6; John 16:13). It is by this Spirit that the oneness of the Body of Christ becomes real and living. It is also through this Spirit that the ground of locality is applied in life and not in legality. And it is by this Spirit that the genuine ground of the church is linked with the Triune God (Eph. 4:3-6).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>B. The Genuine Ground of the Church<br>Keeping the Genuine Oneness<br>of the Church in Practicality</H2><P>The above-defined ground of the church keeps, in practicality, the genuine oneness of the church both locally and universally (Eph. 4:3), without any division. This is the only way to avoid today's situation of division and confusion among the members of Christ.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>C. The Base of the Genuine Fellowship<br>of the Believers</H2><P>The above-defined ground of the church is also the base of the genuine and proper fellowship of all the believers, which is called "the fellowship of the apostles" in the divine revelation (Acts 2:42), a fellowship that is with the Triune God and with all the members of Christ (1 John 1:1-3). This is the unique fellowship of the Body of Christ locally and universally. Because of the many divisive grounds of today's Christianity, the fellowship among the members of Christ also is divided into many divisive fellowships. The way to be saved out of all these divisive fellowships is to take and keep the unique, genuine, and proper ground of the church. This is not a matter of doctrine and regulation; it is a spiritual fact and a practical necessity.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>VIII. THE RECOVERY OF THE PRACTICE<br>OF THE LOCAL CHURCHES</H2><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>A. The Need of the Local Churches</H2><P>The church of God, as the living Body of Christ, needs the local churches for its existence and function. Without the local churches, the Body of Christ has no way to exist and to carry out its function in practicality. Actually, the local churches are the Body of Christ, and the Body of Christ is all the local churches.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>B. The Many Expressions<br>of the One Body of Christ</H2><P>The local churches are the many expressions in many localities of the one Body of Christ. The local churches, being the existence of the Body of Christ for its function, are the many expressions of the Body of Christ. The Body of Christ may exist in the heavens, but to express itself, it must become the local churches.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>C. Existing in a Locality as a City</H2><P>A local church is one that exists in a locality as a city, the jurisdiction of the church being within the boundary of the city. We have seen that all the local churches are located, respectively, in different cities. To locate a church in a city is practical and convenient for its administration and its function. The jurisdiction of a local church for its administration is within the boundary of the city in which it exists; but its work and testimony should not be limited or restricted by any boundary. For its administration, the jurisdiction of a local church is local; but the testimony of a local church through its work is both local and universal.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>D. The Administration of a Local Church</H2><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>1. By the Elders</H2><P>A local church is administrated by the eldership, composed of a group of elders (1 Tim. 3:1-5; 5:17) appointed by the gifted persons who have established the church (Acts 14:14, 23; Titus 1:5). A local church, being an organic expression of the Body of Christ as the organism of the Triune God, should not be administrated in any organizational way that makes it a worldly organization. It should be administrated by the eldership as an organic body, the components of which are all organic persons who have been regenerated by the living God with His divine life and who are living in and with that life (1 Tim. 3:1-4; Titus 1:5-9). Furthermore, its administration under its eldership should, in everything, be carried out in the organic way, not by any organizational method.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>2. Not under the Control of a High Church</H2><P>The administration of a local church should not be under the control of any high church. Among the local churches, there is no center; there is no high church or low church; there is no archbishop above the bishops and no bishop over the elders. All the local churches are on the same level, and all the elders, as the overseers, also are on the same level; and each eldership administrates only its own local church.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>3. With the Ministry of the Apostles,<br>Prophets, Evangelists, and<br>Shepherds and Teachers</H2><P>After being established by the gifted persons and having its elders appointed by the gifted persons, a local church still needs the ministry of the gifted persons who established it and appointed its elders, for its building up as a living testimony of Christ. This aspect is fully proven by the case of the church in Ephesus which received the ministry of the apostle Paul (Acts 20:17-35) without any termination, until the apostle was martyred (Eph. 6:19-22; 2 Tim. 4:6).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>4. Without Any Absolute Autonomy or Federation</H2><P>Among the local churches, there is no absolute autonomy in the administration of any local church, nor is there any federation among the churches. The business affairs of a local church are absolutely local, but all the other matters, especially its testimony for Christ and its fellowship, should be both local and universal, and should be the same and common among all the local churches. This is strongly proven by the seven local churches in Asia (Rev. 2&#151;3). Although they differed from each other in their localities, in their situations, and in negative things, they, as the seven golden lampstands, were absolutely identical for the testimony of Christ. The seven lampstands are absolutely identical in nature, in shape, in appearance, and in function (Rev. 1:12-13). Thus on the one hand, the Lord treated them separately by writing an epistle to each one, respectively; on the other hand, He treated them corporately by addressing the seven epistles as one epistle to them all, and charging each one of them to hear what the Spirit said in all the seven epistles.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>E. The Building Up of a Local Church</H2><P>A local church is built up by the functioning of all its members with the perfecting of the gifted persons, such as the apostles, prophets, evangelists, and shepherds and teachers (Eph. 4:12), through:</P><P>1) the preaching of the gospel to get sinners saved and baptized (Matt. 28:19);<br>2) the feeding of the new believers in their homes for the growth in life and in truth (John 21:15; 1 Pet. 2:2);<br>3) the perfecting of the saints in the group meetings for the building up of the Body of Christ (Eph. 4:12); and<br>4) the prophesying in the church meetings for the building up of the church (1 Cor. 14:1-5, 23-26, 31).</P><P>The gifted persons carry out their ministry in perfecting all the members of a local church in a locality, that all the members of that local church will be able to do what the gifted persons can do (Eph. 4:12) in the above-mentioned four items, for the building up of that local church, issuing in the building up of the universal Body of Christ. The gifted persons do not build up the church directly; rather, all the members who have been perfected by the gifted persons build up the church directly.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>F. The Building Up of a Local Church<br>Being for the Building Up<br>of the Entire Body of Christ</H2><P>The building up of a local church is not only for its own building up locally (1 Cor. 14:3), but for the building up of the entire body of Christ universally (Eph. 4:12). Actually, the building up of the local churches is the building up of the Body of Christ, because the local churches are the Body of Christ as its expression. Without the building up of the local churches, by what other way could the Body of Christ be practically built up?</P><H1 CLASS=TITLE>A SUPPLEMENTARY WORD</H1><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>I. THE FELLOWSHIP OF THE CHURCHES<br>IN THE LORD'S RECOVERY</H2><H1 CLASS=SCRIPTURE>Scripture Reading: Eph. 4:3-6; Acts 2:42a; 1 John 1:3; John 17:11b, 20-23; Rev. 1:11; Rom. 14:1-6; 15:1-7; 16:17; 2 John 7-11; 1 Cor. 5:9-13; 2 Cor. 2:5-11; Titus 3:10</H1><P>In this supplementary word, I am burdened to share with you, first, concerning the fellowship of the churches in the Lord's recovery. Today we need to have a complete, thorough knowledge concerning the fellowship of the Body of Christ, and also concerning the fellowship of the local churches.</P><P>As we have seen in this book, the Lord's recovery is the recovery of the divine revelation concerning eight basic and major items: God, Christ, the Spirit, the eternal life, the believers, the church, the proper ground of the church, and the practice of the local churches. Among these items, the recovery of the proper ground of the church touches a major practical problem that we are facing today. The recovery today is very practically the recovery of the proper ground of the church. All the divisions and confusions among Christians today have come from this one source: the fact that most Christians are destitute of the knowledge of the proper ground of the church. Today all of Christianity is full of divisions. Division eventually leads to confusion; these two are actually two sides of one thing. In the past three years we have been facing a real problem among us, a problem that may be termed a rebellion, a turmoil, or a division. This problem has been due not to the lack of knowledge concerning the proper ground of the church, but to the fact that those responsible for the problem would not practice the truth concerning the proper ground of the church. They would not keep the proper ground of the church. In addition to the knowledge concerning the ground of the church, for the proper practice of the local churches, the adequate knowledge of the fellowship of the Body of Christ is needed.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>A. The Fellowship of the Body of Christ</H2><P>We need to see in a brief way the fellowship of the Body of Christ. In our physical body there is a current of blood, which we may call the circulation of the blood. This current, or this circulation, is going on continuously in our physical body. If this circulation, or this current of blood, were to stop for only a few minutes, we would die. Thus, it is the circulation of our blood that keeps us alive. The health of our body depends on the circulation of our blood. We may say that this circulation is the fellowship of our body.</P><P>The fellowship of the Body of Christ is very similar to the circulation of the blood in our body. We have been enlightened to see that Christ has a Body and that we are members of His Body, that is, members of Christ Himself. Just as our physical body has many members, Christ's Body also has many members. And just as a man has only one body&#151;this is a principle ordained in God's creation&#151;Christ also has only one Body. If we do not understand the church as the Body of Christ, we should simply look at our own body. We can understand Christ's Body by knowing our own body. I have learned a great deal concerning the Body of Christ by learning to know my own body. If we learn to know our body, we will know the Body of Christ.</P><P>The circulation of the blood is the fellowship of our body. The fellowship of Christ's Body also is a kind of circulation. In our physical body we have the circulation of the blood, but Christ's mystical Body does not have blood. The fellowship in Christ's Body, then, is the circulation of the Spirit. The Spirit today is the "blood" in Christ's Body. If there were no blood in our body, our body would be dried up and would be dead. Likewise, if Christ's Body did not have the Spirit, it would be like a corpse. Thus, the fellowship of the Body of Christ is simply the circulation, the current, of the Spirit&#151;not the Holy Spirit or the Spirit of God, but the Spirit. In the New Testament the Spirit denotes the consummated Spirit, the Spirit who has been consummated, compounded, and mingled, and who is now dispensing. In this Spirit there is divinity, that is, God's divine nature, and there is humanity, that is, man's human nature. There is also Christ's person, Christ's wonderful, all-inclusive death, and Christ's empowering resurrection with His ascension. All these elements have been compounded into this one Spirit. When this one Spirit is circulating within the Body of Christ, divinity, humanity, Christ's person, Christ's death, and Christ's resurrection all are circulating. How wonderful this is!</P><P>The circulation of the blood is very important to our physical body. This circulation carries nourishment to every part of our body, and it also causes our body to be cherished. At times we may need to do some physical exercises to improve the circulation in our body. This may cause us to be more healthy. Romans 10:12 says that whenever we call on the name of the Lord, the Lord becomes rich to us. I have discovered that the more we call on the Lord with a loud voice, the more our spirit is released and the more we are healed and strengthened. Such calling on the Lord will make us very healthy, because to call in this way is to exercise. If we are always quiet and shut up within ourselves, we will be very weak. But if we call, "O Lord Jesus! O Lord! O Lord, Amen, Hallelujah!" for ten minutes, the Lord will become rich to us. We will have joy, and eventually we will have strength. The joy of the Lord will be our strength (Neh. 8:10). I have learned the secret of calling on the name of the Lord. The Lord is rich to all who call on Him. To call is not merely to pray. The Greek word for call means to cry out, even loudly. In certain situations it would not be appropriate for us to call on the Lord loudly. However, when we are in a proper situation to do so, we should call loudly, "O Lord Jesus! Amen!" By calling on the Lord in this way, we will enjoy the riches of Christ, and we will be strengthened. This is because our calling on the name of the Lord causes the Spirit to circulate within us. This circulating Spirit is the compound Spirit, who includes divinity, humanity, Christ's person, Christ's death, and Christ's resurrection. The riches in this compound Spirit are unsearchable. When this Spirit circulates within us, we enjoy all Christ's riches. This circulation is the fellowship of the Body of Christ.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>1. The Body of Christ<br>Being Uniquely One Universally</H2><P>The Body of Christ is uniquely one universally (Eph. 4:4-6). Individually, we are members of the Body of Christ, and all the local churches are parts of this one unique Body of Christ. As those who are in the Body, we need to realize that we are one with all the saints in the entire universe. Ephesians 4:4-6 depicts a oneness that is universal: "One Body and one Spirit, as also you were called in one hope of your calling; one Lord, one faith, one baptism; one God and Father of all, who is over all and through all and in all." In these verses we can see that the Triune God is mingled with the Body. The Body mentioned here is not local; rather, it is universal. This is the universal oneness of the Body of Christ.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>2. The Fellowship of the Body of Christ<br>Also Being Uniquely One Universally</H2><P>Since the Body of Christ is uniquely one universally, the fellowship of the Body of Christ also is uniquely one universally.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>B. The Fellowship of the Apostles</H2><P>The fellowship of the Body of Christ is the fellowship of the apostles&#151;the divine fellowship between all the believers and the Triune God. The term the fellowship of the apostles is used in Acts 2:42: "And they were continuing steadfastly in the teaching and the fellowship of the apostles." Then, 1 John 1:3 tells us that the fellowship of the apostles is not merely with us, the believers, but also with the Father and the Son. Here John did not mention the Spirit directly, because he was speaking in the Spirit. The Spirit was there already. The fellowship of the apostles is the fellowship of the Body of Christ, the divine fellowship between all the believers and the Triune God.</P><P>The fellowship of the apostles is based upon the apostles' teaching. Fellowship always comes after teaching. If there is no teaching, there is no element or realm of the fellowship. Actually, the teaching is the element and the realm of the fellowship. By the Lord's mercy, today in the Lord's recovery we are under the apostles' teaching and in the apostles' fellowship. The fellowship of the recovery which we are in is the recovered fellowship of the apostles. This fellowship was lost, but it has been recovered. Today we are in the fellowship of the apostles, which is the fellowship of the Lord's recovery. If you are a Baptist, you are in the fellowship of the Baptists. But the fellowship of the Baptists is narrower than the fellowship of the apostles, so they cannot claim that their fellowship is the fellowship of the apostles. We need to see and have the boldness to say that we are in the fellowship of the recovery which is the recovered apostles' fellowship.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>C. The Fellowship<br>for the Lord's Unique Recovery</H2><P>We always need to remember that we are in the Lord's recovery and that His recovery is unique. There is not another recovery, just as there is not another Body of Christ or another New Testament. The fellowship of the apostles is the fellowship for this unique recovery of the Lord. When we see something going on in the recovery which is not so good, we need to have this kind of fellowship and a proper attitude. When a man marries someone, he is bound to her for as long as he lives. If he is unhappy with her, he cannot divorce her. He should try the best to help his wife by fellowshipping to improve in a nice and living way. He should not charge her to improve but help her to improve. This is the right way. When we see something wrong in the recovery or in any of the local churches, we should try the best to help the situation by fellowshipping so that it can be improved and corrected. If there is anything wrong, we can and should fellowship and pray together and seek the Lord's leading to improve the situation for the benefit of all the saints. This will be a real help to the Lord's recovery.</P><P>We should not have the thought that we can do a particular work according to our way in the recovery. We may be very gifted and have a large capacity to work out something. But what we work out may be the same as worldly people carrying out a certain enterprise. We have to realize that in the Lord's recovery there is only one work.</P><P>When I came into the recovery, I realized what the recovery was and that it was uniquely one. The one who brought the recovery to China among us was Brother Watchman Nee. If I would not have taken the way of the recovery, I could have had a work in northern China, but I gave that up. I fully realized that the Lord has only one Body, one work, one Bible, one revelation, and one current, one flow, in one fellowship. At that time Brother Nee was being used by the Lord. I never tried to speak anything different from his teaching. This does not mean that I did not have any other teachings, but my speaking always followed Brother Nee's speaking in order to keep the unique fellowship in the Lord's unique recovery. I felt that it was a glory to participate in the Lord's recovery in such a subjective way with Brother Nee. I thank the Lord that He had mercy upon me in helping me to have the best choice. In Moses' blessing in Deuteronomy 33, there is the term "the choicest things" (vv. 13-16). I realize that the Lord has been giving me the choicest things throughout my years in the recovery. This is due to His mercy in placing me and keeping me all the time in His recovery. As long as we are preserved in the Lord's way, we are preserved in the oneness in the unique fellowship. There is only one Lord, one Body, one Bible, one divine revelation, one speaking, one recovery, one fellowship, and one way to practice the recovery.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>D. The Need for the Fellowship<br>among the Churches</H2><P>Our problem today is related to the matter of fellowship. We are in the fellowship of the recovery, but do we fellowship? For example, do the brothers in Sacramento fellowship with the brothers in Chicago, Cleveland, or Wichita? Among the churches in the Lord's recovery, there is not much fellowship. We have seen that the problems between Barnabas and Saul were probably due to a lack of proper and adequate fellowship. If we are not in fellowship, problems can come in among us.</P><P>The circulation of blood in our physical body is a good picture of the fellowship, the flow of the divine life, in the Body of Christ. If our blood circulation is not proper, this can cause much sickness to our body. The proper blood circulation swallows up all kinds of germs. I was in Taipei for about five years beginning in late 1984. After about three of those years, trouble came in among the churches. The trouble in the churches today is due to the shortage of the fellowship, the circulation of the blood. This lack of fellowship gave the enemy an opportunity to come in.</P><P>We are even very short of fellowship with the churches who are close to us geographically. There is very little circulation. If my shoulder were not participating adequately in the blood circulation of my body, it would be sick. No part of my physical body can be separate from the other parts since all the parts must participate in the one blood circulation. Some may think that they are wise to keep themselves separate. But if any part of the Body of Christ is separate, that part will eventually die. The best way to stay healthy is to "receive more blood and to give more blood," that is, to stay in the fellowship, the circulation of life. Then we will save ourselves and promote the healing of the Body. In some places there has been no peace because of a lack of fellowship. The more fellowship we have, the more peace we have.</P><P>The reason why many people are weak physically is because they sit too much. They do not move. It is the same spiritually. We are sick and weak because we remain with ourselves, in ourselves, and for ourselves. We are sick because we are so much in ourselves. We need to get out of ourselves by fellowshipping with the other churches. If we want to get helped, the secret is to go to see some brothers in another locality. The brothers in Texas should not have traffic among themselves only. They need to go to Chicago, Cleveland, and Seattle, and break the boundary of Texas.</P><P>I would like to make a proposal to the leading brothers. Perhaps ten days from today, fifty brothers from fifty cities can go to a certain church to be in their Lord's Day morning meeting at 10 a.m. I can assure you that you will receive the help and that the church will be helped. Today there are many opinions among the churches concerning the churches. Other churches have opinions concerning the church in Cleveland and the church in Anaheim. The church in a certain city may have many opinions about other localities. Each local church may have some opinions about other local churches. All of these opinions need to be thrown away. How can they be thrown away? They can be thrown away by the circulation, the fellowship. If the waste in our physical body is not discharged regularly, we will die. The circulation of blood within our body is like a river that always carries away the waste in our being so that it can be discharged. In like manner, the fellowship in the Body carries away all the negative things.</P><P>Some brothers may be afraid for others to come and visit them. But what we need today among the churches is more divine circulation, more fellowship. There are about fifty churches in California, but there is not much fellowship among them. This is where our shortcoming is, and this is why we are weak. The circulation helps us and helps others. It helps everyone in the Body. We need the fellowship. This fellowship is the fellowship of the apostles, which is today the fellowship of the recovery. The fellowship today among us is the recovered apostles' fellowship.</P><P>All the churches around the globe are part of the one recovery of the Lord. There should not be any boundaries of separation among the churches. Some co-workers in the past did have the feeling that a certain area was their territory. But we need to see that it is not healthy or profitable in the Lord's recovery for anyone to have a boundary for his work. The only boundary is the boundary of the recovery. We should not say, "That's my church. That's the work in my territory." We have only one work. That work is the work of the recovery based upon the teaching of the apostles. The remedy to the problem of so-called boundaries and territories among the churches is the fellowship. We should not have the thought that others coming to our place may disturb our work. We do not need to defend our work. Our work is the Lord's work, which is the recovery's work. We need the adequate fellowship among all the churches in all the nations, and we need a clear vision concerning the apostles' teaching and the apostles' fellowship.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>E. To Keep the Universal Oneness<br>of the Body of Christ</H2><P>This fellowship is to keep the universal oneness of the Body of Christ (John 17:11b, 20-23; Eph. 4:3-6). Ephesians 4:3 charges us to endeavor to keep the oneness of the Spirit. We can keep this oneness because it is our possession already. We have this oneness; thus, we only need to keep it. Regardless of how weak we may be, we still have this oneness. This is because we still have the circulation of the "blood," the circulation of the Spirit. If we did not have this circulation, we would be spiritually dead. As long as we have life, regardless of how weak we may be, we have this oneness. It is the possession of every believer. What we need, then, is just to keep this oneness. When we keep this oneness, we are in the unique fellowship of the Lord's recovery.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>F. The Fellowship of the Local Churches</H2><P>Now we come to another aspect of the fellowship, that is, the fellowship of the local churches. It seems that there is no problem with the universal fellowship of the Body of Christ; however, when we put this fellowship into practice, immediately it becomes a local fellowship, the fellowship of the local churches.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>1. The Local Churches<br>Being Many in Different Localities</H2><P>The local churches are many in different localities (Rev. 1:11). The Body of Christ as the church, the unique universal church, is expressed through the local churches. It is impossible for the Body of Christ to be expressed without the local churches. The local churches, which are the expressions of the unique Body of Christ, are scattered on this earth in the localities where the local churches exist to express the Body of Christ.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>2. The Local Churches<br>Being Locally Kept Away from One Another,<br>but Not Being Divided Universally</H2><P>The local churches are locally kept away from one another by their being in different localities. I do not say that they are separated from one another; the word separated may carry the connotation of division. I have used the term kept away because to be kept away is not to be divided. The churches are kept away from one another only by their localities, not by anything else. However, they are not divided universally.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>3. The Local Churches Needing to Fellowship<br>with All the Genuine Local Churches<br>on the Whole Earth</H2><P>The local churches should fellowship with all the genuine local churches on the whole earth to keep the universal fellowship of the Body of Christ. Any local church that does not keep this universal fellowship of the Body of Christ is divisive and becomes a local sect. Some so-called local churches are not genuine and have become divisions; we do not need to fellowship with such "churches." But we should have fellowship with all the genuine local churches on the whole earth to keep the universal fellowship of the Body of Christ. If not, we are no longer a church but a sect. A church is one that remains in the Body; a sect is a group of believers who divide themselves from the Body. When my arm remains in the body, it is a part of my living body. If it is cut off and separated from the body, it becomes a dead thing.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>4. Every Local Church Needing to Receive<br>All Kinds of Genuine Believers in Christ</H2><P>Every local church should receive all kinds of genuine believers in Christ (Rom. 14:1-6; 15:1-7). We have no right to give up any believer, unless he is divisive. When a believer becomes divisive, he is divided from the church already. But as long as a believer is not divisive, we should not give him up. If a believer prefers to keep the Sabbath whereas we take the Lord's Day, or if he eats only vegetables whereas we eat every kind of food, we still must receive him. We must receive him because God has received him (Rom. 14:3) and because Christ has received him (Rom. 15:7). We must receive every believer in Christ according to Christ (Rom. 15:5).</P><P>We should not receive the believers according to their diet or according to our preference. Whether we like a particular believer or not, we have no choice but to receive him. Suppose you were born into a family of twelve brothers. You might like only yourself and one of your brothers and not like the rest. However, the fact that the other ten are in the same family is not up to you; it is up to your parents. They begot those peculiar ones. Therefore, you have no choice but to receive them as your brothers. Likewise, in the church a particular brother may have certain characteristics that are offensive to us. But we need to realize that our Father has begotten him and has received him. If we give up this brother, we would give up our Father. Thus, we must receive all kinds of genuine believers, not according to anything of ourselves but according to Christ. We must receive them because they have Christ; Christ is in them. If a church does not receive all kinds of genuine believers, it is divisive and becomes a sect.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>5. A Believer to Be Kept Away<br>from the Fellowship of a Local Church<br>Because of Only Three Things</H2><P>A believer can be kept away from the fellowship of a local church, that is, the fellowship of the Body of Christ, because of only three things.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD4>a. Being Divisive</H2><P>The first thing is being divisive, making divisions and causes of falling contrary to the apostles' teaching (Rom. 16:17). In Romans 14 Paul said that we must receive all kinds of genuine believers, whether they keep certain days or consider every day alike, whether they eat herbs or eat meat (vv. 1-6). Then, in chapter fifteen Paul said that we must receive genuine believers according to Christ (vv. 5-7). In these portions of the Word, Paul was very broadminded, very generous, and, in a sense, very liberal. But at the end of chapter sixteen Paul said, "Now I beg you, brothers, keep a watchful eye on those who make divisions and causes of falling contrary to the teaching which you have learned, and turn away from them." These two things&#151;the making of divisions and causes of falling&#151;have been and still are going on among us. Thus, we need to keep a watchful eye on those who make divisions and causes of falling contrary to what we have learned of the apostles, and we must turn away from them.</P><P>In dealing with the divisive ones, we must also take Paul's word in Titus 3:10, "A factious man after the first and second admonition refuse." A factious person is a divisive and sectarian person. According to Paul's word in Romans 16:17 and in Titus 3:10, after the first and second admonitions, we must reject such persons and turn away from them. To do this is to quarantine such persons. To quarantine a person does not mean that we hate that person. If one member in a family became ill with a contagious disease, the rest of the family would need to quarantine him for the safety of the whole family. Otherwise, the entire family would be affected. Likewise, to practice Paul's word in Romans 16:17 and in Titus 3:10 is to quarantine the divisive members in the Body of Christ. This is not my teaching; it is my presentation of the holy Word to you.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD4>b. Being Heretical</H2><P>The second thing for which a believer can be kept away from the fellowship of the church is being heretical, denying that Christ came in the flesh (2 John 7-11). This implies the denying of Christ's redemptive work, which was accomplished by Christ in His flesh (Rom. 8:3; Col. 1:22). Teaching heresy is not merely a matter of teaching wrongly or differently. In 1 Timothy 1:3 Paul said that he had urged Timothy to remain in Ephesus in order that he might charge certain ones not to teach differently. However, in 2 John 7-11, John was not referring to those who taught differently, but to those who taught heretically, denying that Christ came in the flesh, that is, denying Christ's person in His humanity, and denying His redemptive work. They do not believe that Christ is both God and man who came in the flesh to accomplish redemption for us, the sinners. The apostle John said that if such a one comes to us, we should not receive him into our home, and we should not even greet him. Then John said that if we greet him, saying to him, "Rejoice," we will share in his sin. This is not my word, but the word of the apostle John.</P><P>Thus far, among us there is no one who is teaching heretically. However, there are some who are making divisions and causes of falling.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD4>c. Committing Gross Sins and Living in Them</H2><P>The third thing for which a believer can be kept away from the fellowship of a local church is the committing of gross sins and living in these sins, not being willing to repent of them and forsake them (1 Cor. 5:9-13). A person who commits gross sins in this way should be removed from the fellowship of the church. But once such a one would repent and forsake his sins, the church should forgive him and receive him into the fellowship of the church, that we may not be taken advantage of by Satan (2 Cor. 2:5-11). In his first Epistle to the Corinthians, Paul charged the church in Corinth to remove a sinful brother from the fellowship of the church. Later, this one repented, and the news came to Paul. Immediately, Paul wrote the second Epistle, charging the church to forgive this one and to receive him back. If we do not do this, we may be taken advantage of by Satan in that he might devour such a repentant one.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>G. How to Deal with the Divisions</H2><P>In dealing with the divisions that have separated themselves from the genuine local churches and have broken the unique fellowship of the Body of Christ, I would like to present to you my proposal, and I believe that this is according to the holy Word.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>1. Considering Them Divisive Sects</H2><P>First, we should consider these divisions as divisive sects, like the denominations, not according to their condition but according to their standing, their ground. If you were to go to a meeting of the divisive ones, as a pretense they might behave in a very spiritual way. This kind of behavior is a matter of their condition. In this book I have used the illustration of marriage. Marriage is based upon the chastity of the wife, not upon her niceness. A wife may be very nice, but if her husband is Mr. Smith and she begins to call herself Mrs. Jones, regardless of how nice, humble, and submissive she may be toward her husband, the base of her marriage will be annulled. The base of a marriage is not the wife's condition but her chastity. If a wife is chaste, even though at times she may not treat her husband nicely, that is, even though her condition may be somewhat poor, she still has the proper standing as a wife. Concerning today's situation among us, we need to exercise the proper discernment. We must discern whether a certain group of believers is a genuine church or a division, not according to their condition but according to their standing, their ground. Regarding one's condition, it is possible to pretend, but concerning the ground on which one stands, no one can pretend. We are either on the proper ground or we are not. Just as a woman cannot pretend to have one unique husband, we cannot pretend to be on the proper ground of the church in the unique fellowship.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>2. Not Recommending Any Believer<br>in the Local Churches<br>to Have Any Share in the Divisions</H2><P>Second, we should not recommend any believer in the local churches to have any share in the meetings and activities of the divisions. Nevertheless, there may be some who attend the Lord's table meeting in a local church and, after taking the table, they leave to go to a meeting of the divisive ones to listen to a message. If any believer in the local churches would attend the meetings and share the activities of those divisions, the local churches should not put him away from the fellowship of the church, as long as he is not infected by and does not promote anything that is divisive. Our dealing with such a person depends on whether or not he has been infected by the "germs" of division, and whether or not he is passing on those germs to others. If he does pass on those germs, we must advise him not to do this. We cannot tolerate any germs of division.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>3. Not Rejecting Any Believer<br>Who Does Not Promote Anything Divisive</H2><P>If any believer who is meeting with any of these sectarian divisions would attend the meetings of the local churches, or contact the believers meeting in the local churches, he should not be rejected, as long as he does not promote anything divisive.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>4. Considering as Divisive and Rejecting Anyone Who Promotes Sectarian Divisions</H2><P>However, anyone who is aggressive for and promotes the sectarian divisions should be considered divisive and should be rejected after a first and second admonition (Titus 3:10). I believe that this is the fair and scriptural way to deal with the divisions that have separated themselves from the genuine local churches and have broken the unique fellowship of the Body of Christ. Anyhow, according to the apostles' teaching in the New Testament, anyone who makes the division, who is divisive and bears the "germs" of division, that is, who is factious, sectarian, we should refuse them (Titus 3:10) and turn away from them (Rom. 16:17).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>II. THE NATURE, GROUND,<br>AND CONDITION OF A LOCAL CHURCH</H2><H1 CLASS=SCRIPTURE>Scripture Reading: 1 Cor. 1:2; Rom. 16:16b; Eph. 4:3; Acts 8:1; 13:1; Rom. 16:1; 1 Cor. 1:2; Rev. 1:11</H1><P>In this supplementary word we shall consider, second, the nature, ground, and condition of a local church.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>A. The Nature</H2><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>1. The Church of God,<br>Possessing the Divine Nature of God</H2><P>Concerning the nature of a local church, first we must realize that the church is the church of God (1 Cor. 1:2). A local church must be a church of God, possessing the divine nature of God. The title "the church of God" denotes not only that the church belongs to God, but also that the church must have the nature of God.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>2. The Churches of Christ,<br>Being in the Element of Christ</H2><P>Second, the churches are the churches of Christ (Rom. 16:16b). A local church must be a church of Christ, being in the element of Christ. Every element has a nature, and the nature is the essence of the element. Christ is the element of the church, and God is the nature of the church. God is in Christ; this indicates that the nature is in the element. A local church must possess the divine nature of God and be in the element of Christ.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>B. The Ground</H2><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>1. The Genuine Oneness of the Body<br>of Christ&#151;the Oneness of the Spirit</H2><P>The ground of a local church is the genuine oneness of the Body of Christ, that is, the oneness of the Spirit. Ephesians 4:3 charges us to be diligent to keep the oneness of the Spirit. The oneness of the Spirit is the oneness of the Body of Christ, which is the basic element of the unique ground of a local church.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>2. In the Limit of the Boundary and Jurisdiction of a Locality&#151;the Ground of Locality</H2><P>The genuine oneness of the Body of Christ must be practiced with the unique ground of locality within the limit of the boundary and jurisdiction of the locality in which a church exists, that is, on the ground of locality, as with the church in Jerusalem (Acts 8:1), the church in Antioch (Acts 13:1), the church in Cenchrea (Rom. 16:1), the church in Corinth (1 Cor. 1:2), and the seven churches in the seven cities in Asia (Rev. 1:11). All these churches were on the local ground, the ground of locality.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>C. The Condition</H2><P>The condition of a local church may fluctuate and may differ from that of all the other local churches, just as the conditions of the seven churches in Revelation 2 and 3 differed from one another. The church in Ephesus was in one condition, and the church in Smyrna was in another condition. All the seven churches were different in their conditions. However, although the conditions of the churches may differ, the ground of the local churches remains the same. Because the condition of a church may fluctuate, our recognizing of a local church should be based upon its nature and ground and not upon its condition.</P><P>A local church is preserved from being divided by its ground, not by its condition. The unique ground&#151;the unique oneness of the Body of Christ, plus the unique ground of locality&#151;preserves a church from being divided. The condition of a certain church may be good, but that does not assure that the ground of that church is right. A local church may be low in its condition, yet it is still a genuine local church as long as it keeps the genuine ground of the oneness of the Body. On the other hand, a local church may be high in its condition, but it is a division, a local sect, as long as it does not care for the genuine ground of the oneness of the Body of Christ expressed in its locality. We may use marriage as an illustration of this principle. The ground of a marriage is the chastity of the wife. As long as a wife is chaste, she has a proper standing, even though her character may be rough. She may not be loving or kind&#151;this is her condition&#151;but this does not annul the ground of her marriage. However, if her husband's name is Smith, and she begins to call herself Mrs. Jones, even if she is loving, kind, humble, and submissive toward her husband, her calling herself Mrs. Jones annuls the ground of her marriage. A wife's base in her marriage is her chastity. In Revelation 3:8 the Lord praised the church in Philadelphia for not denying His name. It is a terrible thing for a wife to deny her husband's name. That annuls the base of their marriage. Regardless of how good a wife may be in character or in daily life, if she denies her husband's name, she has lost her base in the marriage life. The ground of a local church is the very base upon which we recognize that church. We recognize a church not because its condition is according to our preference. Our recognizing of a church depends upon its ground, and this ground is composed of two things: the oneness of the Body and the locality in which the church exists. Concerning the ground of locality, the principle in the New Testament is "one city, one church." In a particular city there should not be more than one church. The condition of a local church can change, and sometimes it does change; but the ground of a local church should remain unchanged permanently.</P><P>In the past two years, some have left the genuine local churches and have begun to meet in a divisive way. They may say that they are not a division but are simply a group meeting of the church. However, these are not genuine group meetings but sectarian divisions, because they do not care for the oneness of the Body or for the ground of locality.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>III. THE FACTORS OF A DENOMINATION (SECT)</H2><H1 CLASS=SCRIPTURE>Scripture Reading: Acts 2:42</H1><P>In this supplementary word my third burden is to show you the factors of a denomination. A denomination is a sect. However, there is a difference between a denomination and a sect: a sect is not a denomination if it does not denominate itself. The divisions that have been produced among us in recent years have not yet denominated themselves. Hence, they are not yet denominations, but they are surely sects.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>A. A Special Teaching</H2><P>The first factor of a denomination or a sect is a special teaching that differs from "the teaching of the apostles" (Acts 2:42) in the entire New Testament, such as baptism by immersion, the presbytery (to administrate the church by the eldership), head covering, the keeping of days, diet, or a particular stress on a certain point of prophecy. All of these matters may be scriptural, but we should not make any of these a special teaching. It is right for us to have all our practices according to the Bible. Thus, in our practice we baptize people by immersion and we have the eldership, but we do not make these things particular items that divide us from other believers. Certain Christians divide themselves from other Christians over the matter of baptism by immersion. If a believer desires to be received into their membership, they require him to be baptized by immersion in their baptistry, by their pastor, and in their water. If he is baptized by immersion in another place and by other people, they will not recognize him. This is a special, particular teaching that divides these believers from other Christians, making them a sect and a denomination.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>B. A Special Fellowship</H2><P>The second factor of a denomination is a special fellowship based upon a special teaching in a realm narrower than that of "the fellowship of the apostles" (Acts 2:42). The fellowship of the apostles is the fellowship of the entire Body universally, covering all kinds of genuine believers. Romans 14 tells us that we must receive different kinds of genuine believers, regardless of what days they observe or what dietary regulations they keep. Whether they eat herbs or eat meat, they are genuine believers because they believe in the Lord Jesus. Thus, we must receive them.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>C. A Special Name</H2><P>The third factor of a denomination is a special name, either according to a special teaching or according to a particular practice, that designates a certain group of believers who are of the same teaching or the same practice. The taking of such a name denominates a particular sect, making it a denomination.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>D. Any of the Three Factors<br>Being Adequate to Make a Division</H2><P>Any of the above-mentioned three factors is adequate to divide the believers from others who are different from them in teaching or in practice. Therefore, although we should practice things such as baptism by immersion, the presbytery, and head covering, we should not make these things a special item that divides us from others. Furthermore, we should not make them our creed, and we should not designate ourselves by a name, such as Lutheran, Baptist, or Presbyterian, that is according to a particular teaching or practice.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>IV. THE DISCERNING OF THE ONE BODY</H2><H1 CLASS=SCRIPTURE>Scripture Reading: 1 Cor. 11:29-30; 10:17; Eph. 4:4</H1><P>My fourth burden in this supplementary word is the discerning of the one Body. First Corinthians 11:29 says that we need to discern the Body. Moreover, it says that if we do not discern the Body, we will suffer some kind of discipline by the Lord.</P><P>The first item we need to discern is the bread on the Lord's table. The bread on the Lord's table should be a symbol not only of the Lord's physical body, but also of the Lord's mystical Body, which is universally one (Eph. 4:4). Although we may take the Lord's table in many different cities around the globe, we all are taking just one bread, because the bread we partake of is a symbol of Christ's mystical Body, which is universally one. Thus, 1 Corinthians 10:17 says, "We who are many are one bread, one Body; for we all partake of the one bread."</P><P>Any bread on the Lord's table that does not signify the Lord's one universal Body but the body of a certain sect is divisive. The denomination in which I grew up in mainland China had their "communion" at regular intervals of time. Each time they made a strong announcement that whoever was not a member of that denomination had to leave the premises. The bread that they partook of was not a symbol of the Body of Christ; it was a symbol of the sect of that denomination. We should not partake of that kind of bread, that kind of "communion," or that kind of table. We should not have any share in it; it is a sign of a sect.</P><P>If we partake of such a divisive table without discernment, we participate in a division, which is condemned by the apostle (1 Cor. 11:29-30). Some who have recently left us to form divisions are taking the Lord's table. They have told people that they are simply a group meeting that is having the Lord's table. Should these group meetings be considered as proper and genuine meetings of the local churches? If a proper, genuine group meeting has the Lord's table, that table will be the table of a local church, with the bread as a symbol of the entire Body of Christ. That is a practice that keeps the oneness of the Body. Suppose, however, that we have a group of believers who originally were meeting with the church, but because of certain reasons, they left the church and keep themselves separate from the church, without having any fellowship with the church. Suppose, further, that these believers have what they call the Lord's table. Such a table immediately becomes a symbol of division, a symbol of a sect. Hence, 1 Corinthians 11:29 charges us to discern. When we partake of any bread on a table that is called the Lord's table, we must discern carefully whether that bread signifies the universal Body of Christ, without division, or not. If it does not, we should not partake of it. If we do not discern, and partake of such a thing, this is condemned by the apostle, that is, by the Lord.</P><P>Some of the new believers among us may wonder what the difference is between the Lord's recovery and Christianity. In this book with the supplementary word we have seen, first of all, that we are here for the recovery, and second, that we are here for the oneness of the Body. We are here in the recovery of the Triune God, Christ, the Spirit, life, the believers, the church, the church ground, and the practice of the local churches. In total, we are in the recovery of the oneness of the Body of Christ. Thus, we need to conduct ourselves properly, and we also need to exercise our discernment because of the confusion that is around us. As long as there are divisions, there will be confusion. So we must be careful and look to the Lord that we may be able to discern the situation among us.</P></body></html>
