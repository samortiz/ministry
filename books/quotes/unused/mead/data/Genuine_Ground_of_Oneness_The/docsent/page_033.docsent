   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>SUBDUED BY COMING</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>TO GOD'S CHOSEN PLACE</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>We may think that this requirement is ridiculous.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>God's thought, however, is higher than ours.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>By being limited to God's chosen place, we are kept from abusing God's grace, and we are subdued with respect to our desires, temperament, and disposition.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>We all have our particular natural disposition, temperament, and characteristics.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>But no matter what our peculiarities may be, we all must be subdued.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>If we remain in our natural life and in our natural disposition with its particular characteristics, it will be impossible for us to have the kind of worship God is seeking.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>We all must be subdued by coming to the unique place, to the unique ground.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>This means that we all need to be subdued by the church.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>If we are not willing to be subdued, we shall fight with the elders, with the other brothers and sisters, and even with our husband or wife.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Even concerning spiritual things, the things of God, we shall have disagreements with others.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>We may prefer matters to be a certain way, but someone else may prefer another way.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>How we all must be subdued by taking the way of the church!</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>In the Life-study of Colossians we pointed out that the peace of Christ must arbitrate in our hearts.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>However, apart from the church life, it is difficult to experience the arbitrating peace of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Yes, the peace of Christ does arbitrate within our hearts, but it does so in the context of the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>In a very real sense, it is the church that is the arbitrator.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The way of the church is the way of being subdued.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Because we are subdued by the ground of the church, we are preserved in oneness.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The unique place of God's choice keeps us from abusing God's grace and it also subdues us.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Furthermore, this unique way gives us the real enjoyment of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>When we have the genuine enjoyment of Christ, we are one.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>We are one in the enjoyment of Christ, that is, in the eating of the rich produce of the good land.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>But as we have pointed out, we can present our offerings of this produce only in the place of God's choice.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Like the psalmist, we must bring our offerings to the house of God.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>INCENSE TO GOD</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Psalm 66:15 says, "I will offer unto thee burnt sacrifices of fatlings, with the incense of rams: I will offer bullocks with goats."</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>I am fond of the phrase "with the incense of rams."</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The Chinese version speaks of the fragrant offering of rams.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>When our offering becomes an incense to God, it means that there is fragrance in our offering.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>When we bring our burnt offerings to the church and offer them to the Lord in the church, there is incense to match our offerings.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>This incense is fragrant and pleasant to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>It is possible to present offerings to the Lord outside the church, but with these offerings there is no fragrance.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>However, when we offer something to the Lord in the church, we sense that we present our offerings "with the incense of rams."</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Oh, the fragrance of the offerings presented to God in the church!</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Although this fragrance is especially for God, we can sense it also.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>We cannot experience such incense apart from the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Only in the church life can the offerings be presented to God in a proper way, in a way that is fragrant and satisfying to Him.</S>
