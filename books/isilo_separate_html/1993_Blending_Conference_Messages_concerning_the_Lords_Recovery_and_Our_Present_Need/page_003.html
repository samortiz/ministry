THE LORD'S RECOVERY BEING THE RECOVERY<br>OF THE DIVINE TRUTHS AS REVEALED IN<br>THE HOLY SCRIPTURES&#151;THE HOLY WORD OF GOD</H2><P>First, the Lord's recovery is the recovery of the divine truths as revealed in the holy Scriptures, the holy Word of God (2 Tim. 3:16). The divine truths are not according to what anyone thinks or imagines; they are revealed in the holy Scriptures, that is, the holy Word. The Bible is a great blessing that God, the Lord, has given to mankind on this earth. If there had not been such a book as the Bible, the holy Scriptures, on the earth, what a pity and what a devastation there would have been among the human race! The Bible is justifiably called "the Book" because the Bible is "the Book" among all books. The Bible is the book of books because it is in this book that we can see all the divine truths.</P><P>All the holy Scriptures, as the holy Word of God, are God-breathed (2 Tim. 3:16). Although there are many doctrines and teachings in the Bible, we should not think that the Bible is merely a book of doctrines or teachings in letters. The entire Bible is God's breathing, God's breath. It is not merely doctrines in empty or dead letters, but it is God's breathing in life. Because of this, many Bible readers can testify that when they come to the Bible, they receive light and life.</P><P>The content of the Scriptures is very deep. Some sentences of the Bible are very simple. For example, in John 8:12 the Lord Jesus said, "I am the light of the world." This is a simple word, but the significance is deep, profound, and all-inclusive. The truths as revealed in the Scriptures have been lost, missed, misunderstood, misinterpreted, and wrongly taught throughout the ages. Hence, there is the need of the Lord's recovery. In the age of the early apostles, in the age of the church fathers, in the age of the church councils, in the age of Catholicism with the papal system, and in the age of the Protestant practice, the Lord has always recovered some of the lost, missed, misunderstood, misinterpreted, and wrongly taught truths through some of His saints who loved Him and His holy Word.</P><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_002.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_004.html">Next</a> </body></html>
