 <h1 class="msg">CHAPTER EIGHT</h1>

<h1 class="title">THE FUNCTIONS OF THE SPIRIT</h1>
<h1 class="title">(4)</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Rom. 8:2, 5b, 9, 11, 13b, 14, 16, 23, 26-27; 1 Cor. 2:4, 9-15</h1>
<h2 class="head1">IN THE NEW TESTAMENT&mdash;THE EPISTLES</h2>
<p>In message seven we saw the functions of the Spirit in the book of Acts. In this message we want to begin to see the functions of the Spirit in the Epistles. We will start with Romans and 1 Corinthians.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Being the Essence of Christ&rsquo;s Divinity</h2>
<p>Romans 1:4 reveals the Spirit as the essence of Christ&rsquo;s divinity. This verse speaks of the Spirit of God in a particular way, in a way that is different from any other place in the Bible. Verse 3 says that Christ came out of the seed of David according to the flesh. According to the flesh, Christ was a descendant of David. Then verse 4 says that Christ was &ldquo;designated the Son of God in power according to the Spirit of holiness out of the resurrection of the dead.&rdquo; In verses 3 and 4 &ldquo;according to&rdquo; is used twice in a contrasting way. According to the flesh in His humanity, Christ was out of the seed of David. But according to the Spirit of holiness, Christ was designated the Son of God out of the resurrection of the dead. As the flesh in verse 3 refers to the human essence of Christ, so the Spirit of holiness in verse 4 does not refer to the person of the Holy Spirit of God, but to the essence of Christ&rsquo;s divinity. In Romans the first function of the Spirit is to be the essence of Christ&rsquo;s divinity. Christ has two essences. The essence of the nature of Christ&rsquo;s humanity is flesh. Of course, in His flesh there was no sin. The essence of the nature of Christ&rsquo;s divinity is the Spirit of holiness. This indicates that the nature of His divinity is something holy, and holiness belongs to the Spirit. The divine essence of Christ, being God the Spirit Himself (John 4:24), is of holiness, full of the nature and quality of being holy.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Being the Law of the Divine Life</h2>
<p>The Spirit functions as the law of the divine life. Romans 8:2 speaks of &ldquo;the law of the Spirit of life.&rdquo; To refer to the law of the Spirit means the Spirit is the law. Every person has a life, and based upon that life he has a law. A bird flies because of the law of its life. Actually, the bird itself is the bird life and the law of the bird life. The three are one. Concerning the law of the Spirit of life, we may say that the law, the Spirit, and the life are one. Cats chase mice according to the law of the cat&rsquo;s life. The cat&rsquo;s life is a mouse-chasing life. Dogs bark according to the law of the dog&rsquo;s life. The dog&rsquo;s life is a barking life.</p>
<p>Our life is our law and our person. Actually, every person is a law. We are a law in the sense that we always do things according to ourselves. To rise up late is a natural law for some people; they rise up late according to what they are. A person walks and talks in a certain way because he himself is a natural law. The Spirit Himself as the processed Triune God is the law of the Spirit of life. He is a law working within us. The Spirit works in us to free us by His law of life from the law of sin and death.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Love-pouring</h2>
<p>Romans 5:5 says, &ldquo;The love of God has been poured out in our hearts through the Holy Spirit who has been given to us.&rdquo; The Holy Spirit is used by God to pour His love into our hearts. From the day that we first called on the Lord Jesus, the love of God has been poured into our hearts through the Holy Spirit. This means that the Spirit confirms and assures us with the love of God. Although we may be afflicted, we cannot deny the presence of God&rsquo;s love within us.</p>
