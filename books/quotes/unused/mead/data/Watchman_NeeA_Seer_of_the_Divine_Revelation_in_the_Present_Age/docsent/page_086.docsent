   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>DENOMINATIONS</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Opposition from the denominations was a third source of Watchman Nee's suffering.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>He was an anti-testimony against them, and because of this it caused him much suffering.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>A. Despised</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The denominations thoroughly despised Watchman Nee, and this caused him a great deal of suffering.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>He began writing the three volumes of The Spiritual Man at the age of twenty-three.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>One top theologian in China reacted by saying, "Watchman Nee is just a clever young man who has excelled in reading English books.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>He has gathered all these things from the books and translated them into Chinese."</S>

   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>In his paper, The Christian, published from 1925 through 1927, he strongly exposed the deviation of the denominations from the pure truths of the Scriptures.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>They could do nothing but criticize him.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>They put out many writings criticizing his ministry.</S>

   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>On the heels of the criticism came the opposition.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Such a ministry to God's people as Watchman Nee's stirred up the opposition of the denominations, and they rose up to oppose him.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>They opposed him secretly and openly.</S>
