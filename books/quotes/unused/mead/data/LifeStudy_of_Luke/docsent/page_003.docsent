   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>SUBJECT THE MAN-SAVIOR AND HIS SALVATION</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>IN THE HIGHEST STANDARD OF MORALITY</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Because Luke s Gospel is one of the synoptic Gospels concerning the Savior s humanity, its purpose is to present the Savior as a genuine, normal, and perfect Man, revealing God among men in His saving grace to fallen mankind.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>It narrates a complete genealogy of the Man Jesus, from His parents back to Adam, the first generation of mankind.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>This shows that He is a genuine descendant of man a son of man.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Its record of this Man s life impresses us with the completeness and perfection of His humanity.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Hence, its emphasis is the Man-Savior.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>It presents, based upon the moral principles which apply to all men, gospel messages as in 4:16-21; 7:41-43; 12:14-21; and 13:2-5; gospel parables as in 10:30-37; 14:16-24; 15:3-32; and 18:9-14; and gospel cases as in 7:36-50; 13:10-17; 16:19-31; 19:1-10; and 23:39-43; these are not recorded in the other Gospels.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Luke does not stress the dispensational aspect or the Jewish background as Matthew does.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The Gospel of Luke is the Gospel written to mankind in general, announcing the good news to all people 2:10 .</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Its characteristic is absolutely not Jewish, but Gentile 4:25-28 .</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>It is a Gospel to all sinners, both Jews and Gentiles.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>As such, its record is according to the sequence of morality, not according to the sequence of historical events.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The subject of the Gospel of Luke is marvelous: the Man-Savior and His salvation in the highest standard of morality.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Here we have the Man-Savior, His salvation, and the highest standard of morality.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>I believe that most readers of this Gospel would realize that this book speaks of a Man who is our Savior.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Hence, we may call Him the Man-Savior.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Also, it is rather easy to realize that this book shows us the Man-Savior s salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>However, not many readers of this Gospel realize that the Man-Savior and His salvation are both in the highest standard of morality.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>When some hear that Luke presents the Man-Savior and His salvation in the highest standard of morality, they may say, We can t find the word morality in this book.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>We do not even see the thought of morality.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Apparently, this may be the case.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>But if we search into the depths of this book, we shall see that it does convey the highest standard of morality.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>According to the Gospel of Luke, our Savior lives, behaves, and works in the highest standard of morality.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Moreover, His salvation is carried out in the highest standard of morality.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Therefore, we need to keep in mind that the subject of the Gospel of Luke is the Man-Savior and His salvation in the highest standard of morality.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The Man-Savior Conceived of the Holy Spirit</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>with the Divine Essence</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>We need to see that the Lord Jesus is the Man-Savior.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>As the Man-Savior, He was conceived of the Holy Spirit with the divine essence.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Unlike other biographies, Luke records the conception of the one whose life he records.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Other biographies may speak of a person s birth, but not his conception.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>In this matter, Luke is unique.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>He tells us how the Man-Savior was conceived.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>He was not conceived of a man; rather, He was conceived of the Holy Spirit with the divine essence.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The Holy Spirit is God Himself reaching man.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>This means that when God reaches man, He is the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>With the conceiving of the Man-Savior, the Holy Spirit came into humanity.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>We have pointed out that the Man-Savior was conceived of the Holy Spirit with the divine essence.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Here we are using the word essence in a strong sense to denote something even more intrinsic than nature.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The essence is the intrinsic constituent of a certain substance.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The Man-Savior was conceived of the Holy Spirit not only with the divine nature but with the divine essence.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>It is extremely important that we see this matter.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Born of a Human Virgin with the Human Essence</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The Man-Savior was born of a human virgin with the human essence.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>In 1:27 and 31 we see that a virgin named Mary conceived in her womb and bore a Son whose name was Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Because the Man-Savior was conceived of the Holy Spirit with the divine essence and was born of a human virgin with the human essence, He has two essences, the divine and the human.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>With Him there is the mingling of the divine essence with the human essence.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>In contrast to the Man-Savior, we have only one essence, the human essence, for we were conceived of man and born of woman.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Our Savior is different, for He was conceived of the Holy Spirit and born of a human virgin.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>With the Holy Spirit there is the divine essence, and with the human virgin there is the human essence.</S>
