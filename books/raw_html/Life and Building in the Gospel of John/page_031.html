        <h2 class="head1">RECEIVING GRACE UPON GRACE</h2>
<p>John 1:16 says, &ldquo;Of His fullness we have all received, and grace upon grace.&rdquo; The phrase <em>grace upon grace</em> indicates that grace is like sea waves that come upon the shore one after another. For example, when we are newly saved, we touch the elements of His redemption, of His bearing of our sins, and of His being judged on our behalf. Our sins are forgiven, and we have joy and peace. Thus, we receive of His fullness. After a period of time, our inner being becomes bright and full of light. Then grace comes as life and continues to come as lowliness and submission to the Lord&rsquo;s kingship. Gradually, grace comes to us as the living of God in our humanity. Although we are a man living on the earth, the source of our living is the life of God within us. All these experiences cause us to not only see but also touch something, that is, to see and touch the element of His fullness as grace. In this way we receive and experience grace upon grace, and more of His element becomes our element. This is grace upon grace in our experience.</p>
<p>At the end of 1934, some of the co-workers who lived in Shanghai prayed with fasting on New Year&rsquo;s Eve, asking the Lord for His promises related to the upcoming year. One co-worker received a word while in prayer: &ldquo;To know Him and the power of His resurrection&rdquo; (Phil. 3:10). He felt that this was the Lord&rsquo;s word to him, but he did not know the reason for this word. Not too long after, he encountered a particular environment that he could not bear. When he asked the Lord about this situation, he had an inward realization that the Lord allowed it so that he could know Christ and the power of His resurrection. Then he gave himself to the Lord, and throughout this time he experienced the power of resurrection. Later, he was placed in another situation with a person whom he did not love and for whom he had no strength to love. Even though he knew that he needed to love this person, he had no love for him. This situation was not related to his learning how to love but to showing him that he had no love in himself and that he could not love by himself. When he sought the Lord about this situation, the Lord said, &ldquo;This is for you to know Me and the power of My resurrection.&rdquo; The Lord showed him that He was the love in him and that the power of His resurrection was the source of this love. Then the brother said to the Lord, &ldquo;I give myself to You. I am unable to love, and I have no way to change. I give myself to You. You are in me as my life, and You have the power of resurrection. This is Your business.&rdquo; Spontaneously, he began to experience Christ as love in him, enabling him to love the one whom he could not love. This is grace upon grace. Day by day, as we receive more of the Lord, more of His element becomes our element, and more of His fullness becomes our fullness.</p>
<h2 class="head1">BEING DELIVERED FROM THE FLESH<br />
BY RECEIVING OF THE LORD&rsquo;S FULLNESS</h2>
<p>After Paul says, &ldquo;You have been made full in Him,&rdquo; in Colossians 2:10, he gives an example of being made full. Verse 11 says, &ldquo;In Him also you were circumcised with a circumcision not made with hands, in the putting off of the body of the flesh, in the circumcision of Christ.&rdquo; We cannot deal with our flesh and lusts; however, there is an element in the fullness of Christ that can circumcise us. Once this element in His fullness enters into us, it has the effect of circumcising us.</p>
<p>For example, after being saved, our previous fleshly indulgences often continue to encumber us. However, as we gradually receive more of His fullness, these indulgences begin to fall away. Some weaknesses cannot be overcome quickly, even though others may admonish us and we may make many resolutions. As we receive grace upon grace, however, these weaknesses begin to fall away spontaneously.</p>
<p>After being saved, a brother may have no problem other than losing his temper with his wife. He may be patient with everyone except his wife. Although he knows and acknowledges this problem, and even condemns it, he cannot overcome it. However, as long as he is receiving of the Lord&rsquo;s fullness with grace upon grace, this is not really a problem. Eventually, he will receive the grace that will kill his temper toward his wife.</p>
<p>I know of a brother who was saved for many years, but he did not like to read the Bible, and even when he read the Bible, he found it difficult to understand. He was familiar with the words in the Bible, but he did not understand what he was reading. Furthermore, he could not sing any of the hymns. In one meeting, however, all the saints experienced the outward filling of the Holy Spirit. As a result of this receiving, he was able to sing the words in the hymnal and understand the words in the Bible. His mind was opened as a result of this receiving. This is God&rsquo;s grace. &ldquo;Of His fullness we have all received, and grace upon grace.&rdquo; This word is true! His fullness is like an immeasurable and unlimited ocean. His grace is like ocean waves that come to us one after another.</p>
<h2 class="head1">ALL RECEIVING OF HIS FULLNESS</h2>
<p>Although John 1:16 says, &ldquo;Of His fullness we have all received,&rdquo; this does not mean that we have received everything of His fullness. His fullness is inexhaustible. The word <em>all</em> refers to us, to those who have received the fullness. Every saved person has received of His fullness. Paul received it, John received it, and we have received it. All the saved ones have received of His fullness. Although some have received more and others less, all have received. Furthermore, we have grace upon grace; we can receive, obtain, and enjoy grace upon grace. Every experience of grace involves an element of Himself. The more we receive His grace, the more we will be filled with His element, and the more His fullness will become our fullness. May we learn to be those who receive grace, ceasing from our struggling, striving, and reliance on ourselves. Everything that we have, we have received from Him. Praise the Lord that we can receive of His fullness as grace upon grace.</p>

 	<h2>Noise Words</h2>
 	<p>Common words, such as "and", "is", "but", and "the", also known as noise words, are bypassed in a search. The search string, the Spirit &amp; who, would result in an error since who, which stands by itself, is a noise word. The following is a list of noise words:</p>
	<p>$, a, also, an, and, another, any, are, as, at, be, because, been, being, both, but, by, came, can, did, do, each, for, has, had, he, have, her, here, him, himself, his, how, if, in, into, is, it, like, make, me, might, much, my, of, on, or, our, out, over, said, should, since, some, still, such, take, than, that, the, their, them, then, there, these, they, this, those, to, too, very, was, way, we, well, were, what, where, which, while, who, with, would, you, your</p>

<div id="myModalRanking" class="reveal-modal">
  	<h2>Ranking</h2>
  	<p>Rank is a value from <strong>0</strong> to <strong>1000</strong> indicating how closely a match scored or ranked against the original search string. Rank values are affected by the following factors:</p>
		<ol>
            <li><span>The total number of occurrences of the original search words/phrases in a portion of a book.</span></li>
            <li><span>Content that includes the search words in close proximity to each other are ranked above those that do not. Therefore, a portion of a book that has the search words in close proximity may have a higher ranking than another portion of a book that has a higher hit count but the words are not in close proximity to one another. Therefore, we also include a search word hit count for reference.</span></li>
            <li><span>The rank values are relative to each other. Therefore, it is not possible to interpret the RANK value as a percentage or group the rank values into high/medium/low ranges. Think of rank as a method to order the results for a specific search.</span></li>

 	<h2>Search Scope</h2>
 	<h3>Include All Word Forms</h3>
	<p>This option breaks out the search string into its individual words and generates all conjugations and declensions for each word in the search phrase. A search on the word, dwell, would search for dwell, dwelling, dwelling's, dwells, dwelt, and dwelled.</p>
	<p>There is no need to use ^ (inflectional search) or * (prefix search) when using the Include all word forms search scope.</p> 
	<h3>Specified Word Forms</h3>
	<p>This option searches for exact matches of the specified words or phrases used in the search string. Use of ^ (inflectional search) with a particular word in the search string will broaden the search for that given word in that all conjugations and declensions for that word will be searched. Similarly, use of * (prefix search) with a particular word in the search string will broaden the search for that given word in that all words with that prefix will be searched as well.</p> 
	<h3>Note</h3>
	<p>Common words, such as "and", "is", "but", and "the", also known as noise words, are bypassed in a search. A list of all noise words is as follows:</p>
