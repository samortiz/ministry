   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER TWO A LOVER OF MEN ONE</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Every worker of the Lord must have not only a love for the brothers but also a love for all men.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Solomon once said, "Whoso mocketh the poor reproacheth his Maker" Prov 17:5 .</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>God is the Creator of all men; therefore, every man is worthy of our love.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>A servant or worker of the Lord is not fit to serve Him if he is lacking in brotherly love or if he only has brotherly love but is lacking in love for all men.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>He must have a love for all men, a genuine affection for men, before he can serve God.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>All those who find men to be wearisome, troublesome, or contemptible are unqualified to be God's servants.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>We must see that in God's eyes man was created by Him.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Man certainly has fallen, but he has become the object of the Lord's redemption.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Although by nature man is stubborn, the Holy Spirit has chosen to touch man.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Even the Lord Jesus became a man when He came to earth a man like other men, gradually growing from infancy to full maturity.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>God's intention is to set up a "standard" man, a representative man, in whom all the plans of God are realized.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>After the Lord Jesus' ascension, the church was brought into being, which is the "one new man."</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The whole plan of redemption involves the uplifting and glorification of man.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>When we really come to understand the Word of God, we will realize that the term children of God is not so weighty as the term man, and we also will realize that God's plan, selection, and predestination have a glorified man as their objective.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>When we see the place that man occupies in the purpose of God, when we see man as the focus of all His plans, and when we see how the Lord humbled Himself to become a man, we will learn to appreciate all men.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>When our Lord was on earth, He said, "For even the Son of Man did not come to be served, but to serve and to give His life as a ransom for many" Mark 10:45 .</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The Lord's word is clear.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The Son of Man came to serve many.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Many does not refer to the church or to God's children, but to all men.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Furthermore, He did not say that the Son of God came to serve, but the Son of Man.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Here we see the Lord's attitude toward man.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>A serious problem with many who are engaged in God's work is their total lack of love and respect for man, and their total failure to realize the value of man in God's sight.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Today we feel as if we have attained great heights when we begin to love God's children.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Formerly we did not love anyone.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Now that we can love the brothers a little, we feel as if we have done a tremendous thing.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>But, brothers and sisters, this is not enough.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>We need to be enlarged by God; we need to see that all men are precious to God.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Whether or not we will build up a good spiritual work depends on how much we love man and how much interest we have in man.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>What I want to know is not whether we are interested in a few particularly intelligent men, a few who in one way or another are outstanding, but whether we are interested in man in general.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>This is a matter of great importance.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The Son of Man's coming firstly implies that the Lord was intensely interested in man; He was so interested in man that He became a man.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The Lord was very interested in man, but what is the extent of our interest?</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>We may not think much of this or that individual.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>But how does our Lord look on those people?</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The Lord said that the Son of Man came.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>This means that He came into the midst of men as the Son of Man.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>It also means that He is interested in man, that He has a feeling for man, and that He has a high regard for man.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>He so values man that He took the place of a man in order to serve men.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>It is amazing that many of God's children have little concern for men.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>We cannot help but be somewhat indignant about this apathy.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Brothers and sisters, do we know the meaning of the phrase the Son of Man did not come to be served, but to serve?</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>We should ponder these words before the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>They tell us that Christ cared for man.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Brothers and sisters, it is absolutely wrong for anyone to say, "I am among men, yet I have no interest in them whatsoever."</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>An interest in man is a basic requirement in the life of every worker.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>This does not mean that one picks out certain individuals and develops an interest only in them.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>It does not mean that one can be exclusively interested in and affectionate towards certain men.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>It means an interest in all men.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>We must pay attention to the Lord Jesus, whose outstanding characteristic is a feeling and a love for all men.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>He was so interested in man that He could say, "The Son of Man did not come to be served, but to serve."</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>If we go to a certain place and insist on not being served by the men there but instead serve them, we are not far from the attitude we are talking about.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>This would put us on the right track with the right stand.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Brothers and sisters, God's servants cannot reserve their love just for their brothers.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>A worker of the Lord is a total failure if he selfishly reserves his love for his brothers.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Brotherly love is not the first thing on our list.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>It is something in addition to our love for all men.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>We have to have a love for all men.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>John 3:16 says, "God so loved the world."</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>What does the world refer to?</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>It refers to everyone in this world, including unsaved ones and those who have no knowledge of God.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>God loves the world; He loves everyone in this world.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>This is the meaning of God so loved the world.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>If God loves everyone yet you do not, or if you extend your love only after a person has become a brother, your heart is different than the Lord's, and you are not qualified to serve God.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Your heart must be broadened to the extent that you love everyone and are interested in every man.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>As long as someone is a man, you should be interested in him.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>This is the only way to serve God.</S>
