   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE BLESSING OF ABRAHAM</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Galatians 3:13 and 14 say, Christ has redeemed us out of the curse of the law, having become a curse on our behalf; because it is written, Cursed is every one hanging on a tree, in order that the blessing of Abraham might come to the nations in Jesus Christ, that we might receive the promise of the Spirit through faith.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Because it combines the promise of the Spirit with the blessing of Abraham, verse 14 is extremely important.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The blessing of Abraham is the blessing promised by God to Abraham Gen 12:3 for all the nations of the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>This promise was fulfilled, and this blessing has come to the nations in Christ through His redemption by the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The context of verse 14 indicates that the Spirit is the blessing which God promised to Abraham for all the nations and which has been received by the believers through faith in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The Spirit is the compound Spirit and actually is God Himself processed in His Trinity through incarnation, crucifixion, resurrection, ascension, and descension, for us to receive as our life and our everything.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>This is the focus of the gospel of God.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The physical aspect of the blessing God promised to Abraham was the good land Gen 12:7; 13:15; 17:8; 26:3-4 , which was a type of the all-inclusive Christ Col 1:12 .</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Since Christ is eventually realized as the all-inclusive life-giving Spirit 1 Cor 15:45; 2 Cor 3:17 , the blessing of the promised Spirit corresponds to the blessing of the promised land.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Actually, the Spirit as the realization of Christ in our experience is the good land as the source of God s bountiful supply for us to enjoy.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>If we read the book of Genesis, we shall see that the focal point of God s promise to Abraham was that Abraham s seed would inherit the land.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>According to Galatians 3, Christ is this seed, the unique seed.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Furthermore, as we have often pointed out, the good land is a full type of the all-inclusive Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>On the one hand, the seed is Christ; on the other hand, the land is a type of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The blessing of Abraham is altogether related to Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Christ is the focus of the promised blessing.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>RECEIVING THE SPIRIT AS THE BLESSING</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>However, verse 14 does not say that in receiving the blessing of Abraham we receive Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Instead, this verse tells us that we receive the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Surely this indicates that the Spirit here is the blessing of Abraham.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>What kind of Spirit could be the blessing God promised to Abraham?</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>What Spirit would be the all-inclusive blessing, which is Christ as the seed and as the land?</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>It must be the Spirit, the all-inclusive life-giving Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>First Corinthians 15:45 says that the last Adam became a life-giving Spirit, and 2 Corinthians 3:17 declares that now the Lord is the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>In 2 Corinthians 3:17 the King James Version says that Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>This rendering is not accurate, for the Greek word uses the definite article.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Hence, the proper rendering is the Spirit, referring to the Spirit who was not yet until Christ had been glorified.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>At the time of the Lord s incarnation, the Holy Spirit began to have the element of humanity as well as divinity.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>From that time, the Holy Spirit was compounded with the Lord s human living, crucifixion, and resurrection and became the Spirit, the all-inclusive Spirit compounded with divinity, humanity, and the Lord s human living, death, and resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>All that God has purposed and planned and all that He has accomplished through incarnation, human living, crucifixion, and resurrection is included in the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Hence, the Spirit is all-inclusive, the Triune God processed to be everything to us.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>This Spirit is the blessing of the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>RECEIVING THE SPIRIT BY FAITH</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>We have received this Spirit by faith.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>When we began to appreciate the Lord Jesus and believe in Him, we received the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>In this receiving of the Spirit, the manifestation of gifts or the speaking in tongues had no place, for we received the Spirit by the hearing of faith.</S>
