<h2 class="head3">Producing the Church&mdash;Eve Being Built</h2>
<p>When Adam awoke from his deep sleep, he immediately saw Eve, who had been built with his rib (Gen. 2:22). Since Eve typifies the church, this means that Christ produced the church with the resurrection life that He released. The church is a woman.</p>
<p>Eve was bone of Adam&rsquo;s bones and flesh of Adam&rsquo;s flesh; in other words, she was part of Adam (v. 23). Eve was out of Adam; she was a part of Adam that came out of him. We can even say that Eve was Adam. Similarly, the church was produced by the life flowing out from Christ; hence, the church is a part of Christ, and the church is Christ. This matter is clearly presented in the Bible. First Corinthians 12:12 says, &ldquo;Even as the body is one and has many members, yet all the members of the body, being many, are one body, so also is the Christ.&rdquo; The word <em>Christ</em> at the end of this verse obviously refers to the church.</p>
<p>When Adam saw Eve, he said that she should be called <em>woman</em> (Gen. 2:23). In Hebrew, <em>woman</em> is <em>ishshah,</em> and <em>man</em> is <em>ish.</em> These two words share the same root. <em>Man</em> is <em>ish,</em> and <em>woman</em> is <em>ish</em> plus <em>shah, ishshah.</em> Eve came out of <em>ish,</em> so she was <em>ishshah.</em> Similarly, <em>Christian</em> comes out of <em>Christ,</em> and a married woman takes the last name of her husband. The man is one half of a unit; the woman is the other half. When they are joined, they become a complete unit. This may be likened to two halves of a watermelon; when the two halves are put together, they become one complete watermelon. All those who know God realize that God is one half of a unit and that man is the other half. When God and man are joined together, they become one complete unit. The main point is that we must see what the church is. The church is a part that comes out of Christ and will go back to Christ. The church is out of Christ and unto Christ; she can be joined together with Christ as one. This is the church.</p>
<h2 class="head3">Becoming One with Man&mdash;<br />
Adam and Eve Becoming One Flesh</h2>
<p>The sixth step is that Adam and Eve were joined together as one flesh. This shows that there was a person who came out of Adam and who could return to Adam. This symbolizes that the church, a group of people who are of Christ, is produced out of Christ and that they are joined to Him as one spirit (1 Cor. 6:17). At this point man has the life of God and becomes part of God, so man is joined to God, and God becomes one with man. May God open our eyes to see that this is the ultimate purpose that He is seeking to fulfill.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Issue</h2>
<p>When Eve was produced, Adam gained a counterpart. This counterpart truly matched Adam, because she was the same as Adam. Likewise, when the church was produced, Christ gained a counterpart in the universe. However, there is a difference. As soon as Eve came out, she was married to Adam. But after the church was produced, there is a period of time before she can be married to Christ. This is because Eve did not have the problem of sin when she was produced. The people who constitute the church, however, are sinners who are deeply fallen. Therefore, the church still has spots and wrinkles and other such things, and there is a need for Christ to continue working until the church is washed, sanctified, and without blemish (Eph. 5:26-27). When the church is made ready, the marriage of Christ will come (Rev. 19:7).</p>
<p>When Adam and Eve were married, God said, &ldquo;They shall become one flesh&rdquo; (Gen. 2:24). Eve came out of Adam and returned to Adam, and the two were joined as one. It will be the same when Christ and the church are married. At that time God and man will be fully joined as one, and God&rsquo;s ultimate purpose will be fulfilled.</p>
<p>At that time there will be a great rest in the universe. God will have rest, and man will have rest as well. God and man will enjoy rest together in full satisfaction. This is symbolized by Adam and Eve being married and enjoying a blessed life together.</p>
