   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>LIFE-STUDY OF COLOSSIANS MESSAGE THIRTY-FOUR THE ALL-INCLUSIVE CHRIST 1 Scripture Reading: Col 1:12-29</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In this message we shall consider the all-inclusive Christ as revealed in Colossians.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Most of the saints in the Lord s recovery are familiar with this term, the all-inclusive Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In various messages we have emphasized that the Christ in the book of Colossians is the all-inclusive One.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Nevertheless, I do not have much assurance that the all-inclusiveness of Christ has been revealed adequately to the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In what way is Christ all-inclusive?</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>In what aspects, items, and matters is He all-inclusive?</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>We need to be able to point out the various aspects of the all-inclusiveness of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>In 1:12 we see that Christ is the portion of the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>But not even this general term tells us in what aspects Christ is all-inclusive.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>To say that Christ is our portion is like saying that we have just eaten dinner.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>What particular courses made up the dinner?</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Many things can be put together and called a dinner.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>We may proclaim that Christ is our portion.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>But in what particular way is He our portion?</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Concerning the all-inclusiveness of Christ, we need to be more definite and specific.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>THE IMAGE OF THE INVISIBLE GOD</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>According to Colossians, the first aspect of the all-inclusiveness of Christ is that He is the image of the invisible God 1:15 .</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>This aspect of Christ s all-inclusiveness involves all the verses from 1:15 to the end of chapter one.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>In verse 15 Paul says, Who is the image of the invisible God, firstborn of all creation.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>As we read this verse, it is easy for us mentally to insert the conjunction and between the words God and firstborn.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>To do this is to greatly change this verse, for the conjunction would imply that the image and the firstborn are two different things.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>However, the phrase firstborn of all creation actually stands in apposition to the image of the invisible God.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The image of the invisible God is expressed in the firstborn of all creation.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Furthermore, the firstborn of all creation is the image of the invisible God.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>As the image of the invisible God, Christ is the firstborn of all creation.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The image of God denotes the expression of God, just as the image of a person denotes that person s expression.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>If we did not have an image, we would have no way to express ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Christ is God s expression, God s image.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>As God s image, Christ expresses God in being the firstborn of all creation.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The entire universe is the expression of God.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>A BIRD S-EYE VIEW OF THE BIBLE</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Regarding this aspect of the all-inclusiveness of Christ, it is helpful to have a bird s-eye view of the Bible, God s complete revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Although it is true to say that the Bible reveals God, the Bible is not simple in its revelation of Him.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Genesis opens with the words, In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth Heb .</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Then in the opening verses of Malachi, the last book of the Old Testament, God is revealed as the one who loves Jacob.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>In the Old Testament God is revealed as the Creator of the universe and as the One who loves Israel.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>No wonder that the Jews love the Old Testament!</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Coming to the New Testament, we see that Matthew begins with the words, The book of the generation of Jesus Christ, Son of David, Son of Abraham.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The Gospel of John opens like this: In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>In the last book of the New Testament, Revelation, we read the following: John to the seven churches which are in Asia: Grace to you and peace from Him who is, and who was, and who is coming, and from the seven Spirits who are before His throne, and from Jesus Christ, the faithful Witness, the Firstborn of the dead, and the Ruler of the kings of the earth 1:4-5a .</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>What a difference there is between these verses in Revelation and the opening words of Genesis!</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>They even far surpass the beginning of Matthew and John.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Today we are in the local churches.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>To the churches there is a dispensation not only from God or from the Word, but from the Triune God: from Him who is, who was, and who is coming, from the seven Spirits, and from Jesus Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>In Revelation 1:5 Christ is described as the faithful Witness, the Firstborn of the dead, and the Ruler of the kings of the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The name Jesus implies the incarnation, and the title Christ indicates that the Lord Jesus is God s anointed One.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>He was the faithful Witness in His human living, and He is the Firstborn of the dead in His resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>In His ascension and enthronement He is the Ruler of the kings of the earth, for He is now Lord and Head of all.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Furthermore, He will rule over all nations when He comes to reign in His kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Therefore, the description of Christ in this verse covers everything from Christ s incarnation to His eternal kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>The divine revelation in the Bible shows that Christ as the all-inclusive One is for the church.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>In an even more definite way, the book of Revelation shows that He is for the churches.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Hence, the revelation of the Bible is that Christ is for the churches.</S>
