   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>C. Christ Becoming Flesh Yet Without Sin</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Although the Lord became flesh, He was without sin.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Christ was made in "the likeness of the flesh of sin" Rom 8:3 , but He did not participate in the sin of the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>All of Adam's descendants have inherited Adam's sinful nature Rom 5:12,19 ; everyone is born in sin in Adam.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>This is why the Lord's virgin birth is very important.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Although the Lord had the likeness of Adam, He did not inherit the sinful nature of Adam.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>He was not born in Adam.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>He was conceived of the Holy Spirit in the virgin Mary.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>As we shall see in a later lesson, it was necessary for Christ to know no sin 2 Cor 5:21 and to be without sin Heb 4:15 in order for Him to accomplish redemption.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>III.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>CHRIST BEING THE MINGLING OF GOD AND MAN</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The incarnation of Jesus means more than the birth of a Savior.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>For four thousand years after Adam was created, God was God, and man was man.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Yes, man had something to do with God, and God sometimes made contact with man, yet the two remained separate.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>However, when Christ was born as a man, a strange and wonderful event took place God was brought into man and thereby formed a mingling of divinity with humanity.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Jesus was God and He was man; He was a God-man.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Because He was conceived of the Holy Spirit, Jesus has the divine essence; and because He was conceived in a human virgin, Jesus has the human essence.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Therefore, He is a Person with two essences the divine and human mingled together.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>It is unbelievable to our natural mind that the Almighty God would one day mingle Himself with man.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>But remember what God's eternal purpose is God wants to get into man so that man would fully express God.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>This is just mingling.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>If Adam had eaten of the tree of life, he would have been a God-man, a man fully one with God.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>He would have been not just a good man but a God-man.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Although Adam failed, Christ, through His incarnation, became the very first man to be mingled with God.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Praise the Lord!</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The Lord Jesus was the Triune God embodied in a man.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>All the fullness of the Godhead dwelt in Him bodily Col 2:9 .</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>"In the beginning was the Word..and the Word was God...and the Word became flesh" John 1:1, 14 .</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Never in the history of the universe had such a thing taken place.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>You should be very impressed with the great significance of the incarnation.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>It was so great that it caused an army of excited angels to burst forth from the heavens and praise God Luke 2:8-14 .</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Four thousand years after man's fall, God became Jesus Jehovah our Savior and Emmanuel God with us .</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Hallelujah!</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>God with us!</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Christ's incarnation inspired Charles Wesley to write a wonderful hymn.</S>
