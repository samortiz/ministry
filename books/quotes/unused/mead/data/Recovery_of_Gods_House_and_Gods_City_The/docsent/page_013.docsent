   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE STRENGTHENING BY THE PROPHET</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>But sometimes these two are not sufficiently strong.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Then there is the need of the support and strengthening by the prophets.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>It is not the teaching that is required, but the ministry of the real prophet.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Haggai came to strengthen Zerubbabel, the governor, and Joshua, the high priest.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>He did not come to replace the priesthood or the kingship, but to strengthen these two ministries.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The prophet only strengthens; he does not replace.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>For the building up of the churches, we do need the ministry of the priesthood and the ministry of the kingship.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>But sometimes we need the strengthening from the prophet.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The prophet should not replace these two ministries, but strengthen them.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Listen to what Haggai said; "Yet now be strong, O Zerubbabel, saith the Lord; and be strong, O Joshua, son of Josedech, the high priest; and be strong, all ye people of the land, saith the Lord, and work: for I am with you, saith the Lord of hosts" Hag 2:4 .</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Haggai did not build the house for them.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>He did not take over their position.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>He simply strengthened and supported them.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Why is it necessary to point out all these things?</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>It is simply due to the background of Christianity.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Many times in the churches, those who can speak take over the position of the priesthood and the kingship to build up the church themselves.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>This is wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Regardless of how strong their ministry is in speaking, they should not replace the others and occupy their position.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>All they should do is strengthen and help others.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Ephesians 4:12 tells us very clearly that the gifted persons such as the apostles and prophets do not build the church directly.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>"For the perfecting of the saints unto the work of ministry, unto the building up of the Body of Christ."</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>They do the work of perfecting the saints; then the saints build up the Body directly.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The gifted persons should not replace the saints; they should only perfect them so that they themselves can build up the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Brothers and sisters, we all must experience the ministry of the priesthood and the kingship so that we all can rise up to build the house of God directly.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The prophets never built the temple in the recovery directly.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>It was the people, under the two ministries of the priesthood and the kingship, who built the temple.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The church will never be built up by any preacher or teacher.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The churches must be built up by the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>"O Zerubbabel, be strong!</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>O Joshua, be strong!"</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>It was the people who built the house directly, not the prophets.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Today all the brothers and sisters in the churches are the builders.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>What we need are not simply the teachings and doctrines, but the strengthening under the ministry of the priesthood and the kingship for the building.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>We all have the wrong concept.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>If by the mercy of the Lord I could help you abandon it, I will have done a good work.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>What is this wrong concept?</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>We all still think that it is the great speakers and teachers who build up the church.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>But this is absolutely wrong!</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Unless the church is built up by the saints, it will never be built up!</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>If we were to ask the people in today's Christianity, "Who builds up the church?" immediately they would answer, "Our pastor, with the help of the assistant pastor and music director."</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>I am afraid that this concept is still within many of us subconsciously.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Why is your church not so strong?</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>I fear that you will say, "Our church is weak because we do not have very good elders and we are lacking good speakers."</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>But the church cannot be built up directly by the gifted persons.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The church is to be built up by all the local saints, including you.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Do not say that your church is weak because the elders are weak.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>You must say that it is weak because you are weak!</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>If you are not weak and everybody else is not weak, your church will be very strong.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>It is the saints who build up the church directly.</S>
