   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>GUILT IN YOUR CONSCIENCE</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Man s second crucial problem is with himself.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Within him, in his conscience, there is a heavy load of guilt.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>How many young people today are burdened by guilt!</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Guilt is a big problem to man.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Sins offend God on the one hand and defile us on the other.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>What is guilt?</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Guilt is the stain of sins on your conscience.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>When you are young, your conscience is only stained a little.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>But as you grow older, these stains accumulate.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Like a window which is never washed, the conscience grows darker and darker until eventually little light can penetrate.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>No detergent, no chemical, no acid can wash the stain of guilt from your conscience.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Not even a nuclear bomb can dislodge this stain; no, your conscience demands something more powerful than that.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Your conscience needs the precious blood of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Hebrews 9:14 says, How much more will the blood of Christ...purify our conscience from dead works to serve the living God?</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The blood of Christ is powerful enough to purge, or cleanse, your conscience from every guilty stain.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>How does the blood of Christ purge guilt from your conscience?</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Suppose you receive a traffic ticket for parking on the sidewalk.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>You have three problems: first, you broke the law; second, you owe the government a fine; and third, you have a copy of the traffic ticket to remind you of the fine.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Now suppose you are penniless and find it impossible to pay the fine.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>You cannot just throw away the ticket, because the police hold a copy, and they will prosecute you if you do not pay.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>You have a real problem.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>This is a picture of what happens whenever you sin.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>First, you have broken God s law; that is, you have done something that offends God.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Second, you owe God s law something.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Romans 6:23 says that the wages of sin is death.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>This is a rather stiff fine, impossible for you to pay.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>And third, you have guilt in your conscience, like the traffic ticket in your pocket, as a nagging reminder of your offense.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Now here is the good news.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>When Jesus Christ died on the cross, His death fully met all the requirements of God s law for you.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>In other words, your debt of sin has been paid.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Praise the Lord!</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Jesus Christ, through His death on the cross, paid it all!</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>So now, the first two problems have been solved: God is no longer offended, and the debt of sin has been fully paid.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>But what about your conscience?</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The stain of guilt, like the traffic ticket, remains as a record of your sin.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>This is where the blood of Christ cleanses your conscience.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Because Christ s death has paid the debt of sin, His blood may now wipe out the record of that debt.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Just as when the fine is paid, the traffic ticket may be torn up and thrown away, so also any guilt on your conscience may be wiped out.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>This is so easy to experience.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Whenever you sin and sense guilt within, you may simply open to God and pray something like this: O God, forgive me for what I did today.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Thank You, Lord, on the cross You died for me and paid for this sin that I have committed.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Lord, I believe that this sin has been forgiven by You.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Right now I claim Your precious blood to cleanse my conscience from any stain of guilt.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Remember 1 John 1:9: If we confess our sins, He is faithful and righteous to forgive us our sins and cleanse us from all unrighteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>And as Psalm 103:12 says, As far as the east is from the west, / So far has He removed our transgressions from us.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Who can say how far east is from west?</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>In the same way, when you confess your sins, God removes them infinitely far away from you.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>They are not associated with you anymore.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Because of this, you may have rest in your conscience.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>When God forgives, He forgets.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Do not think that after God has forgiven your sins, He may one day come back and remind you of them again.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>No, when it comes to your forgiven sins, God has a very short memory.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Sometimes you may have a better memory than God.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Can God really forget?</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>This is what Jeremiah 31:34 says: I will forgive their iniquity, and their sin I will remember no more.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>If God forgets your sins, you may forget them also.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Don t remind God of something He has already forgotten.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Christ died nearly two thousand years ago.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>His blood has already been shed and is available twenty-four hours a day to cleanse your conscience.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Whenever you sin, there is no need to wait.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Waiting does not improve the power of the blood.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>The blood is all-powerful.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Wherever you are, any time of day, if you sense guilt in your conscience, just claim the precious blood.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Blessed is he whose transgression is forgiven;...</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>/ Blessed is the man to whom / Jehovah does not impute iniquity Psa 32:1-2 .</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Through the precious blood of Christ, the problem of guilt is solved.</S>
