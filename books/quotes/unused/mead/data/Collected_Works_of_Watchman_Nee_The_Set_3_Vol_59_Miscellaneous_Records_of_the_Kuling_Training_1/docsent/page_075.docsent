   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER TWENTY-ONE THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>REASON AND OBEDIENCE Date: Morning, July 5, 1948</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Place: Kuling Mountain THE SOURCE OF REBELLIOUS SPEAKING REASONS</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Man's rebellion against authority is manifested in his speaking as well as in his reasons.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Those who do not know authority revile, and this reviling comes from reasoning.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Man reviles because he reasons within himself.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>For example, Aaron and Miriam reviled Moses because Moses married a Cushite.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>They said, "Has Jehovah indeed spoken only through Moses?</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Has he not spoken through us also?"</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Num 12:2 .</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Our words always follow our reasons.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Aaron and Miriam first reasoned in their mind.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Perhaps they thought, "All three of us are servants of God, and God has spoken to all of us.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Miriam is the first prophetess, and Aaron is the high priest.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>All of us are appointed by God.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Does God speak to Moses only and not to us as well?"</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Apparently, nothing was wrong with such a thought; it seemed reasonable enough.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Reasons are hidden in the heart, and words are uttered through the mouth.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Words of rebellion occur because there are reasons within one's heart.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The first cause of rebellion is reasons within one's heart.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Unless one deals thoroughly with his reasons, he cannot stop his speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>In the Bible God never reasons with man.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Where reasoning abounds, authority is absent.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>God's decisions are beyond the consent or dissent of human mentality or reasoning.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>All we need to ask is whether or not there is the presence of authority.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Under God's authority, reason has no ground to assert itself whatsoever.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Outwardly rebellion is expressed through our speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Before we open our mouth, however, we first have reasons within our heart.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Unless we first are delivered from reasons, we will never find deliverance in our speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The speaking of Korah's company and the two hundred fifty leaders was reasonable enough in its own way.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>They said, "For all the assembly is holy, every one of them, and Jehovah is among them.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Why then do you exalt yourselves above the congregation of Jehovah?"</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Num 16:3 .</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>This was not simply rebellious speaking; it was backed up by reasons.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>If the whole congregation was short in holiness, perhaps God's exclusive communication with Moses and Aaron was justified.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>But if the whole congregation was holy, how could Moses and Aaron claim that God was speaking to them alone?</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>They judged the two leaders with their words, and their words were fully backed up by reasons and arguments.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Their heart was full of reasons.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>As soon as we have reasons in our heart, we have words in our mouth.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>All revilings come from reasons.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Therefore, the first expression of rebellion is reasons.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>In addition to the words of Korah's company and the two hundred fifty leaders, there were also the words of Dathan and Abiram.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Their words were of a cruder nature.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Outwardly speaking, the words of Korah's company were more reasonable and convincing than Dathan and Abiram's. Dathan and Abiram's words implied that they were being cheated.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>They were sarcastic.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>In a mocking way they implied, "God was going to lead us into the land flowing with milk and honey, but you have brought us into the wilderness.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>We have not seen any land flowing with milk and honey; instead, we were led out of a land flowing with milk and honey."</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>They thought that there were plenty of fields, meat, and vineyards in Egypt, and they thought they had none of these in the wilderness.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>They indeed had many reasons.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>A person who is under authority would never say, "Moses and Aaron said this."</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>They would only consider what God had said.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Everyone who places himself under authority does not reason; he only acts according to God's word.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>What the hand touches, the eyes see, and the heart feels mean nothing to him.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>According to human eyes, the wilderness was much inferior to Egypt, but those who walk by faith are satisfied with God's will.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>They walk according to God's word.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>The rebellious ones said, "You have brought us to a barren land to kill us.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Are you going to make yourself a ruler over us?</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>You have not led us to the land flowing with milk and honey, and have not given us fields and vineyards for our inheritance."</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Their words were cruder than those of Korah's company.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Korah's company spoke in spiritual terms, but Dathan and Abiram spoke in material terms.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>We cannot help but marvel at the reasons and tongues of the rebellious ones!</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Dathan and Abiram continued, "Will you put out the eyes of these men?" v. 14 . It was as if they were saying, "Are you trying to cover the eyes of everyone with your two hands? This is the wilderness.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Where are the fields and the vineyards that you have promised?"</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Their eyes could only see the wilderness; they could not see any land flowing with milk and honey.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>God's promised land was not yet in sight; they could only regard the place they had left behind as being better.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>They thought they were very clear and that they had reasons to back up their words.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Similarly, those whose eyes are on the earth are like Dathan and Abiram.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Moses was not blind, but he was not acting by sight.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>It seems as if he was void of sight, reason, or argument.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>He only had God.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>He did what he did because God had told him to do it.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Do not think that these rebellious ones were altogether wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>In terms of human reason, they were, in fact, quite right.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>Human thoughts and reasons indeed have their place.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>Yet they do not count in the eyes of God.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>In our pursuit of the knowledge and the things of God, we often have to "cut out" our fleshly eyes.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>We have to ignore reasons and consider what God has said.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>Those who take the way of obedience and subject themselves to God's authority do not have anything to say.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>In fact, they do not have any reasons to give.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>Once we cast all reasons aside, our speaking stops.</S>
