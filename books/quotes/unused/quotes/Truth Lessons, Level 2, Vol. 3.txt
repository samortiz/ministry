In Volumes Three and Four of Level One of Truth Lessons we saw the initial stage of God's full salvation, the stage of regeneration
Beginning with this lesson we will go on to see the progressing stage of God's full salvation, the stage of transformation
God is also sanctifying us by His Holy Spirit with His holy nature, through His discipline and His judgment in His own house
In the initial stage of God's salvation we receive the Triune God the Father, the Son, and the Spirit and are joined to Him as one
In the progressing stage we need to further experience and enjoy the processed Triune God in the dispensing of the Divine Trinity
Corinthians 13:14 says, 'The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ and the love of God and the fellowship of the Holy Spirit be with you all'
While we are enjoying the fellowship of the Spirit, we also have the grace of the Lord Jesus Christ and the love of God
The fellowship of the Holy Spirit issues in the grace of Christ, and in the grace of Christ we receive the love of God
Spirit denotes the nature of God's person; love, the nature of God's essence; and light, the nature of God's expression
When the divine love appears to us, it becomes grace, and when the divine light shines on us, it becomes truth
Galatians 4:6 says, 'And because you are sons, God has sent forth the Spirit of His Son into our hearts, crying, Abba, Father'!
We have the position with the full right to participate in the Spirit of God, who has the bountiful supply of life
Such an affectionate cry implies an intimate relationship in life between a genuine son and a begetting father
God the Father can be in three positions over all, through all, and in all because God is triune and even God the Father also is triune
The Triune God the Father, the Son, and the Spirit comes to us in a threefold, triune way for the divine dispensing
Through His overshadowing us, going through us, and indwelling us, God dispenses Himself into us in a triune way
When we experience and enjoy this dispensing, we sense God the Father in three aspects He is over us, through us, and in us
To be pure in heart is to be single in purpose, to have the single goal of accomplishing God's will for God's glory
When we see Him, He will reveal Himself in us, dispense Himself into us, and infuse Himself into our entire being
Whenever we worship Him by the Spirit, we are able to touch Him and are brought out of ourselves into the realm of the heavens
In the initial stage we receive the Triune God the Father, the Son, and the Spirit and are joined to Him as one
When we experience and enjoy God the Father in the love of God, we first experience and enjoy God as our Father
In the progressing stage of God's full salvation, we experience and enjoy the processed Triune God in the dispensing of the Triune God
In this lesson we will go on to see other aspects concerning the experience and enjoyment of God as the Father
By being humble toward God being subject to God the believers withstand stand against the devil causing God to give them grace as He desires
Of being proud and having a show of ourselves above others, we should be humble toward God that we may receive the grace given by God
We have received the initial grace, yet this grace needs to be multiplied in us that we may participate in all grace
If we are truly humble toward God the Father, not having self-esteem but becoming lowly, we will receive His grace
Eventually, this will be a mutual abode for the Triune God to abide in the believers and for the believers to abide in Him
These two verses show us that because God has given to us of His Spirit, we know that we abide in Him and He in us
The Spirit, whom God has given to dwell in us, is the witness in our spirit , witnessing that we dwell in God and God in us
By Him we are assured that we and God are one, that we abide in each other, indwelling each other mutually, and are not to be separated
To abide in love is to live a life that loves others habitually with the love that is God Himself, that He may be expressed in us
To abide in God is to live a life that is God Himself as our inward content and outward expression, that we may be absolutely one with Him
When God the Father transmits Himself to us, He transmits to us the power which He caused to operate in Christ
We will be strengthened, and we will rise and be lifted up from all kinds of botherings, burdens, depressions, and oppressions
Philippians 2:13 says, 'For it is God who operates in you both the willing and the working for His good pleasure'
The willing takes place in our will, indicating that God's operation begins from our spirit and spreads into our mind, emotion, and will
Ephesians 3:20 says that God is 'able to do superabundantly above all that we ask or think, according to the power which operates in us'
When we experience and enjoy God the Father in the love of God, He operates in us to do superabundantly above all that we ask or think
To accomplish God's redemption, Christ our Savior was willing to be weak in His body that He might be crucified
We follow the pattern of Christ and are willing also to be weak in the organic union with Him that we may live with Him a crucified life
He dispenses to us the great power that He operated in Christ, and He also operates in us that we may live together with Christ by His power
While we were living in our sins, God forgave us of our sins and reconciled us to Himself through Christ's death
A sinner who was brought to God through the reconciliation of the propitiating blood entered into the Holy Place by passing this screen
We believers were reconciled to God, having passed through the first veil and having entered into the Holy Place
Corinthians 5:21 says, 'Him who did not know sin He made sin on our behalf that we might become the righteousness of God in Him'
By becoming one with us through being incarnated in the flesh, Christ was made sin on our behalf to be judged by God
In the progressing stage of God's full salvation, the believers also experience and enjoy God the Father as the One who sanctifies them
In John 17:17 the Lord Jesus prayed to the Father for the believers, saying, 'Sanctify them in the truth; Your word is truth'
God's living word works in us, the believers, to separate us from the world and its usurpation unto God and His purpose
Quantitatively, God sanctifies us wholly; qualitatively, God preserves us complete, that is, He keeps our spirit, soul, and body perfect
For this God is preserving our spirit from any deadening element our soul from remaining natural and old and our body from the ruin of sin
By thus sanctifying us, God transforms us in the essence of our spirit, soul, and body, making us wholly like Him in nature
Such a sanctified living is necessary for us to have a church life that is pleasing to God and that expresses Him
Such a dispensing by God the Father will not merely heal our mortal, dying body but also cause it to be enlivened to carry out God's will
In this way we have the closest and most intimate fellowship with God, and we are able to enter into His heart and apprehend all its secrets
The deep and hidden things of God are Christ in many aspects as our eternal portion, foreordained, prepared, and given to us freely by God
Christ, the all-inclusive and all- extensive One, is the center of God's economy, the portion given by God to us for our enjoyment
The Spirit of God explores the depths of God concerning Christ and shows them to us in our spirit for our realization and participation
Through regeneration the believers have received the eternal life of God, and this life needs to be cultivated and grow in them
As far as the growth in life is concerned, all the ministers of Christ, whether planters or waterers, are nothing; but God is everything
After the planting and the watering, we continuously receive the supply of God's life, and spontaneously God causes us to grow in life
The riches of God's glory are the expressions of God's divine attributes and virtues in many aspects and in different degrees
It is according to the riches of His glory, through His Spirit, and with power that the Father strengthens us into our inner man
The inner man is our spirit, which has been regenerated by God's Spirit , is indwelt by God's Spirit , and is mingled with God's Spirit
The Father strengthens our whole being into our regenerated spirit that Christ may make His home and settle down in our hearts
The fine and deep work that God the Father is carrying out within us is also to make us, the believers, His poem
The Greek word for masterpiece means something that has been made, a handiwork, or something that has been written or composed as a poem
Not only a poetic writing may be considered a poem, but also any work of art that expresses the maker's wisdom and design is a poem
We, the church, the masterpiece of God's work, are the loftiest poem expressing God's infinite wisdom and divine design
He makes us the righteousness of God in Christ; hence, we are not only righteous, but we have become the righteousness of God
We, the church, the masterpiece of God's work, are the loftiest poem expressing God's infinite wisdom and divine design
In this lesson we will go on to other aspects of the experience and enjoyment of God as the Father in the love of the Triune God
When God gives grace to us, He dispenses Himself into us, and His dispensing is according to the operation of His power
By such an inward, operating power of life, the gift of grace was given to the apostle, that is, produced in him
All the members of the Body of Christ can have the same grace of life that Paul had, but their gifts differ from one another
We announce to people the unsearchable riches of Christ as the gospel for the producing of the church as the Body of Christ
In 2 Corinthians 35 Paul says Not that we are sufficient of ourselves to account anything as from ourselves but our sufficiency is from God
The ministers of the new covenant are those who are constituted with the Triune God of life by His life-giving Spirit
To them the smell of the incense was an odor of death unto death; to the rest who were spared, an odor of life unto life
When Christ ascended to the heavens, there was a train of conquered and captured foes celebrating His triumphant ministry
At the same time, however, they were incense-bearers, scattering the savor of the knowledge of Christ in His triumphant ministry
They were not merely a sweet savor produced by Christ, but Christ Himself was the savor being exhaled in their life and work to God
In those who were being saved, it was a savor out of life unto life, and in those who were perishing, a savor out of death unto death
Only the captives of God in Christ, who are saturated with Christ by the Spirit, are sufficient and qualified for this
Paul did not exercise his gift of healing; rather, he experienced and enjoyed the Father's love in the Father's dispensing
God the Father also encourages and comforts us through Christ that we may be able to encourage and comfort others
In verse 5 Paul went on to say, 'For even as the sufferings of the Christ abound unto us, so through the Christ our comfort also abounds'
Philippians 47 says And the peace of God which surpasses every mans understanding will guard your hearts and your thoughts in Christ Jesus
The peace of God in Christ is like a guard patrolling before our hearts and thoughts and keeping them that we may be calm and tranquil
We can find the antidote to this anxiety when we pray, practice communion with God, and enjoy the Father's dispensing in the Father's love
In verse 33 the Lord goes on to tell us that if we desire to have the Father's care, we need to seek first His kingdom and His righteousness
Today the Father's kingdom is the reality of the church life, and the Father's righteousness is Christ who is lived out by God's people
What we gain primarily is not His outward supply, but His inward dispensing, that is, His element wrought into us
We should respect the Father, who disciplines us, and be in subjection in every respect to the Father of spirits and live
God's discipline is not only for us to partake of His holiness but also for us to yield the peaceable fruit of righteousness
If we have never been permeated inwardly with God's holy nature, we can never have proper righteousness in our outward behavior
He makes us competent to bear the ministry of the new covenant, in which we dispense Christ into people for the building up of Christ's Body
He also will not allow that we be tempted beyond what we are able, but will make a way out, that we may be able to endure
Jude 24 tells us that God is able to guard us from stumbling and to set us before His glory without blemish in exultation
It is only when we experience and enjoy the divine dispensing in the church life that we can overcome Satan and crush him under our feet
Whenever we are separated from the church, we become a prey for Satan, for it is impossible for us to fight Satan individually
As long as we remain in the church and are one with the Body, Satan is under our feet, and we also enjoy God as the God of peace
God's crushing of Satan under our feet is not merely by the church, the Body of Christ, but also by the life that is in the Body
While we are suffering persecution, it seems that our God is not righteous, for He allows His children to be unrighteously persecuted
Throughout the centuries, thousands upon thousands of faithful followers of the Lord have suffered unrighteous persecution
Even today we are still undergoing unrighteous mistreatment, yet God does not come in immediately to judge and vindicate
And will not God by all means carry out the avenging of His chosen ones who cry to Him day and night though He is longsuffering over them
On the other hand, this parable indicates that we need to bother the Lord by praying persistently until He answers our cry and avenges us
We, the believers in Christ, have been made a new creation by God for good works, that is, for doing the will of God
When we live in the love of God and enjoy the divine dispensing, God will fulfill in His power our every good intention and our work
In all these divine acts, the bountiful supply of the divine life is ministered to us as grace in varied experiences
Perfecting leads to establishing, establishing to strengthening, and strengthening to grounding in the God of all grace
God establishes us that we may be set fast, confirmed, and that we may no longer wander and may no longer be changeable
The transfiguration of our body, the swallowing up by life of what is mortal, is the ultimate consummation of God's full salvation
Today He is already in our spirit and is continually spreading to our soul, and then from our soul He will spread to our body
On the one hand we have become Gods inheritance for Gods enjoyment on the other hand we inherit God as our inheritance for our enjoyment
From the time we were saved, God has been working in us to dispense Himself into us as our inheritance for our enjoyment
Eventually, we will be fully saturated with Him and constituted of Him to become His inheritance for His enjoyment
The final issue of our experience and enjoyment of God as the Father in love is that we believers will be led into glory
God's leading us, the believers, as His many sons into glory will be the ultimate consummation of the divine dispensing
It is only by the divine dispensing that we will be constituted into God's inheritance and brought into God's glory
God also promises us who are in the church life that He will crush Satan under our feet and that we will enjoy God as the God of peace
Meanwhile, He perfects, establishes, strengthens, and grounds us in Him by the suffering of persecution and different kinds of environment
The previous five lessons covered the believers' experience and enjoyment of God as the Father in the love of the Triune God
Beginning with this lesson we will go on to see the believers' experience and enjoyment of Christ as the Son in the grace of the Triune God
Corinthians 13:14 says, 'The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ and the love of God and the fellowship of the Holy Spirit be with you all'
With the Father we experience and enjoy the divine love; with the Son we experience and enjoy the divine grace
Paul used this term with the allotment of the good land among the Israelites in the Old Testament as the background
Today, as the New Testament believers, we do not have the physical land as our portion; rather, our portion is Christ
In verse 24 the Lord went on to say, 'God is Spirit, and those who worship Him must worship in spirit and truthfulness'
He died on the cross to accomplish eternal redemption for us , and His blood has obtained eternal redemption for us
In the book of 1 Corinthians Paul took the history of the children of Israel in the Old Testament as a type of the New Testament believers
After He did that, He revealed Himself as the bread of life and went on to speak concerning our need to eat His flesh and drink His blood
As the Lamb, the center of the Passover, Christ is our portion for our enjoyment to redeem us and to feed us as well
Saving, which is carried out within us by the working of Christ's life, saves us subjectively, daily through our whole life
Christ is the righteousness by which we have been justified by God so that we may be reborn in our spirit to receive the divine life
It is not the righteousness of Christ that has become our righteousness; it is Christ Himself who has become our righteousness
Before His incarnation, Christ was the only begotten Son of God, having only the divine nature and not the human nature
Hebrews 13:12 says, 'Therefore also Jesus, that He might sanctify the people through His own blood, suffered outside the gate'
According to 1 Corinthians 1:30, Christ is not only our righteousness and sanctification but also our redemption, the redemption of our body
As the Redeemer of our body, Christ will transfigure the body of our humiliation, conforming it to the body of His glory
The body of humiliation is our natural body, made of worthless dust and damaged by sin, weakness, sickness, and death
The body of glory is the resurrected body, saturated with God's glory and transcendent over corruption and death
As our sanctification, He indwells us to be our life, saturating us with His divine nature until we are thoroughly sanctified
When we believed in the Lord Jesus and received Him as our Redeemer, He as the life-giving Spirit came into us as our life
Christ as the all-inclusive One has now become the life-giving Spirit, the totality of all that He is for our experience and enjoyment
To be transformed into the same image is to be conformed to the resurrected and glorified Christ, to be made the same as He is
To the believers, Christ is also the door through which God's people leave the sheepfold and come into the pasture
In John 10:9 the Lord revealed that He is not only the door but also the pasture, the feeding place for the sheep
Now, since Christ has come, all God's people must come out of the law and come into Him to enjoy Him as their pasture
In our daily Christian life we should have a definite realization that it is in Christ as the pasture that we enjoy His rich life supply
As the Shepherd, Christ leads His sheep out of the fold through Himself as the door and into Himself as the pasture
As we are under His shepherding, there will be a life consciousness within us and also an instruction, a guidance, in life
In 10:16 the Lord said He will bring His other sheep, the Gentiles believers, to form them into one flock under one Shepherd
The fold is Judaism, which is of letters and ordinances, whereas the flock is the church, which is of life and Spirit
Once we believe into the Lord, we become the branches of Christ as the vine and we have Christ as our life and everything
The Greek word for abide means not only to remain in a certain place but to dwell there, even to make our home there
Christ is our abiding place, our home, and we can abide in Him to have fellowship with Him and enjoy all His riches
These riches are what Christ is to us, what He has for us, and what He has accomplished, attained, and obtained for us
The unsearchable riches of Christ are all the fullness of the Godhead spoken of in Colossians 29 which fullness now dwells bodily in Christ
When Christ became incarnate, clothed with a human body, all the fullness of the Godhead began to dwell in Him as One who has a human body
Christ is love, light, holiness, righteousness, wisdom, and power; He is also humility, patience, sincerity, and goodness
In the Old Testament the good land of Canaan which God gave to the children of Israel is a complete type of Christ as the allinclusive One
We should do our best to experience, enjoy, and apply such an all-inclusive One that we may obtain all His unsearchable riches
Since we have such a Christ, we are no longer under the custody of the law; rather, we are under the supply of grace
He is also the all-inclusive One with the unsearchable riches, including the divine attributes and human virtues
In this lesson we will continue to see other aspects of the experience and enjoyment of Christ as the Son in the grace of the Triune God
Corinthians 103 says that the children of Israel went out of Egypt crossed the Red Sea and all ate the same spiritual food in the wilderness
The spiritual food here refers to manna , which typifies Christ as the daily life supply for the believers' journey
As the true bread, He is the bread of truth, or reality; all other kinds of food are merely shadows of Him as the real food
To eat Jesus is to receive Him into us that He may be assimilated by the regenerated new man in the way of life
For our spiritual living, Christ should be our unique food for us to be daily strengthened, sustained, and satisfied by Him
Christ is not only our spiritual food to be our daily life supply; He is also the rock flowing with the spiritual drink to quench our thirst
Through incarnation He came to earth and was smitten on the cross by the law of God with its power and authority
Although eating and drinking are very common in our daily life, in the Bible they are matters of crucial significance
Similarly, as we eat and drink Christ, He works Himself into us to be our life element and becomes one with us organically
Many times, when we have called on the name of the Lord Jesus to contact Him and receive Him, the divine light came into us to shine in us
The shining of the light within us is a strong confirmation that we have been born of God, that we are God's children with God's life
When we hear the Lord's word and receive God's life, the life becomes the light shining within to enlighten us
Christ is the Word, which was from the beginning , as the definition, explanation, and expression of God by which we may know God
When we receive Him as the Word, the expression of God, we have the light of life that is in Him, and we live under His enlightening
Since the way is the Lord, a living person, the place to which the Lord brings man must also be a person, God the Father Himself
God has ordained that we should be brought into this glory , and, as believers, we have been called into this glory
Just as we hope for the blossoming of a seed that has been sown, so we hope for the full expression of the life of glory that is in us
Christ, who has accomplished full redemption for both the Jewish and the Gentile believers, is Himself our peace
Due to man's fall and God's selection and calling, there was a separation between Israel, God's chosen people, and the Gentiles
The peace the Lord gives overcomes all troubles and fears, especially those caused by the persecution of religion
For us to be branches of the divine vine and to bear fruit to express the divine life is a matter of joy a joyful life
When He abides in us, His joy abides in us to be the source of our joy that our joy may abound and become full
In Philippians, a book written by Paul concerning the experience of Christ, we are repeatedly told that we should rejoice in the Lord
Rejoicing is a sign of the believers, it is a portion measured by God to us, and it should be our living and condition
He submitted Himself fully to the will of His Father, not wanting to do anything for Himself or expecting to gain something for Himself
As the portion of the saints, Christ is our spiritual food, the true bread of life sent by God as our daily life supply for our journey
He was smitten and cleft for us on the cross to flow out the water of life; now He is always following us to quench our thirst
He is also the way, the living way for us to enter into God the Father, the living person; through Him we are able to get into the Father
He is God coming to be our reality and the reality of all the divine and spiritual things for our possession and enjoyment
Through His accomplished redemption, He removed the separation between the believers that they may be one with one another
Three times a year the Jews went up to Jerusalem to keep the feasts, to eat, drink, and rejoice together with God before Him
In the process of our growth, again and again we need Christ to be our fresh start, our new beginning, which is signified by the new moon
The significance of Christ's being our Sabbath is that we do not work but enter into what He has accomplished and rest in Him
Daily, weekly, monthly, and yearly Christ is to us the reality of every positive thing and is for our enjoyment and experience
Of these six items of Christ as our armor, only the sword is for offensive warfare against the enemy; all the other items are for defense
We must put on Christ as the whole armor of God that we may be able to stand against the stratagems of the devil
Truth here refers to God in Christ as reality in our living, that is, God realized and experienced by us as our living
No matter how good we may feel our conscience is, we still need to have it covered with the breastplate of righteousness
Under the cleansing of His blood, He becomes our righteousness as our breastplate of righteousness to cover our conscience
As we fight against the evil powers, the peace which Christ has accomplished is a firm foundation for our feet
If we have truth in our living, righteousness as our covering, and peace as our standing, we will spontaneously have faith
When we have the whole armor mentioned above, we are able to stand against the stratagems of the devil, and having done all, to stand
When we put on the whole armor of God, we are able to stand against the stratagems of the devil, and having done all, to stand
To eat the Lord Jesus is to receive Him into us that He may be assimilated by the regenerated new man in the way of life
The normal experience of Christ is to live Christ, and to live Christ is to have Christ magnified always under any circumstance
Christ is now living in us to constitute our entire being with Himself that every part of our soul mind, emotion, and will may be like Him
If we receive Christ as our person in our thinking, preference, and will, His element will gradually become our inner constituent
Our heart is composed of all the parts of our soul mind, emotion, and will plus our conscience, the main part of our spirit
According to Ephesians 3, the dimensions of Christ the breadth, length, height, and depth are the dimensions of the universe
He made Christ great in their eyes, and he displayed especially to the jailers who guarded him the unlimited greatness of Christ
It is the converse of the Lord's word concerning our organic union with Him in John 15:5: 'Apart from Me you can do nothing'
The indwelling Christ as the treasure in us, the earthen vessels, is the divine source of the supply of the Christian life
The Spirit of God explores the depths of God concerning Christ and shows them to us in our spirit for our realization and participation
To know the depths of God, that is, to know Christ in many aspects as our eternal portion, is deep and mysterious
Now, in resurrection He is the life-giving Spirit who indwells our spirit and who has become one spirit with us
Peter 2:21 says, 'Christ also suffered on your behalf, leaving you a model so that you may follow in His steps'
The Lord has set His suffering life before us as an under-writing so that we can copy it by tracing and following His steps
We need to become a reproduction of Him as the original writing-copy, not a mere imitation of Him by taking Him as our outward model
He is the Originator of faith in His life and in His path on earth, and He is the Perfecter of faith in His glory and on His throne of glory
We need to follow Him in our spirit and go on to enter the Holy of Holies that we may reach God's New Testament goal
As the Apostle, Christ came to us with God to share God with us that we may partake of His divine life, nature, and fullness
The Lord Jesus first was sent from God to us through incarnation to be our Apostle, our Author, and our Leader
Hence also He is able to save to the uttermost those who come forward to God through Him, since He lives always to intercede for them'
He appears before God on our behalf and prays for us that we may be saved and brought fully into God's eternal purpose
For such a High Priest was also fitting to us, holy, guileless, undefiled, separated from sinners and having become higher than the heavens'
In His ascension Christ passed through the heavens, and He is higher than the heavens, far above all the heavens
Christ, as the High Priest in the heavens, brings us into heaven, from the earthly outer court into the heavenly Holy of Holies
He is also our model who with all the riches of His life is reproducing Himself in us that we may become His reproduction for His expression
He is also the Author of salvation, who was made perfect through sufferings and who took the lead to enter into glory
Now we, as His followers, are taking the same way and will be brought by Him into the same glory ordained by God for us
He is also the Forerunner, who took the lead to pass through the stormy sea and enter the heavenly haven, the Holy of Holies within the veil
Now we need to follow Him in our spirit and go on to enter the Holy of Holies that we may reach God's New Testament goal
He is also the Apostle, who came to us with God to share God with us that we may partake of His divine life, nature, and fullness
He is also the High Priest, who went back from us and with us to God to bear us in the presence of God and to care for all our needs
He is also our unique Husband; we should belong only to Him, love Him, appreciate Him, and enjoy Him as our life and everything
When we thus take Christ as our Head and submit ourselves under His headship, we participate in and enjoy His headship
If we truly know Christ as our Lord and as the Lord of all the believers, we will fear Him, honor Him, and take Him as our unique Lord
We should not only recognize Jesus Christ as the Lord; we should enjoy Him as our Lord, more personally and more intimately
In Ephesians 6:5-9 Paul's word concerning the relationship between slaves and masters reveals that Christ is the Master of the believers
Paul exhorted the slaves to obey their masters with fear and trembling, in singleness of their heart, as to Christ
By purchasing us back through His redemption, Christ becomes our Sovereign Master, having absolute sovereignty and unlimited power over us
He was begotten in resurrection as God's firstborn Son in His divinity with His humanity that had died and resurrected
In God's economy Christ is the One appointed by God to accomplish God's plan, and we are Christ's partners in the divine interest
Hebrews 3:14 says, 'We have become partners of Christ, if indeed we hold fast the beginning of the assurance firm to the end'
When Joshua entered into the good land, Caleb was his companion, his partner, in entering into and possessing the good land
Today Christ is the real Joshua, and we are His Calebs, His partners, sharing with Him the rest of the good land
In God's economy we are partners of Christ, sharing with Him the spiritual anointing and the rest of the good land
A judge's judgment is according to righteousness, whereas a physician's healing is according to mercy and grace
Those who were ill, whom the Lord mentioned, refer to the tax collectors and sinners who were feasting with Him
Although the Lord may or may not heal us in our body, He is always ready to heal us in every part of our spirit and soul
We should always be satisfied with what we have so that we cannot be distracted from the church life by mammon
We need not fear; we need only to trust in Him as our Helper that we may be kept fully in the enjoyment of the church life
We should not only recognize Jesus Christ as the Lord; we should enjoy Him as our Lord, more personally and more intimately
We should obey Him the unique Master as slaves in singleness of heart that we may enjoy Him as our Master who cares for us in different ways
He heals, recovers, enlivens, and saves us so that we may have the life of God and be constituted the members of the Body of Christ
