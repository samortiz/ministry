<p>Revelation involves enlightenment, but enlightenment is also practical. Although we need to be enlightened in regard to the difference between the soul and the spirit, we need a practical shining upon the different aspects of our soul. We must realize that there is still an element of the self within us even after we receive the discipline of the Holy Spirit. Furthermore, even as we learn to not rely upon our soul to respond to the things that we encounter, elements of our soul are still involved and can be easily mixed into our response. At such a time, we do not need another striking; rather, we need the Lord&rsquo;s practical enlightenment. Hebrews 4:12 says, &ldquo;The word of God is living and operative and sharper than any two-edged sword, and piercing even to the dividing of soul and spirit...and able to discern the thoughts and intentions of the heart.&rdquo; This refers to God&rsquo;s practical enlightenment. Even after we receive the Lord&rsquo;s striking and breaking and even if we become useful to the Lord, there are still elements of our self in our thoughts and intentions. Thus, we need the Lord&rsquo;s practical enlightenment. When God&rsquo;s light comes to us, we will see the mixture in our soul and turn to our spirit.</p>
<p>We often think that a certain matter is altogether of the Lord and for the Lord, but because we are short of light, we have little realization that there is some mixture in our thoughts and intentions. With the Lord&rsquo;s shining, we often see that many things, which we thought were free from any selfish intention, were actually full of selfish intent. Under God&rsquo;s shining, we will detest our self even more and be even more ashamed of the self than before. God&rsquo;s light exposes us to the point that we see our condition as He sees it. Then the light will cause us to prostrate ourselves even more deeply before God, and it will also deliver us more from the self.</p>
<h2 class="head1">EXAMPLES OF BEING DELIVERED<br />
FROM THE SOUL</h2>
<p>Let us consider an example in order to see the application of these three steps. Suppose a certain brother has a strong mind and typically lives by this aspect of his soul. When he hears a message on living by the spirit, he longs to live such a life. The Holy Spirit will begin to work in him by revealing the difference between the soul and the spirit. Then a desire to be dealt with will rise up in him, and he will consecrate himself to the Lord. When the Lord accepts his consecration and begins to deal with him, the thoughts that once directed his mind will no longer produce the same results. Previously, his plans always seemed to work out, but now everything seems to turn out wrong. After passing through repeated dealings that expose his reliance upon his mind, he will become fearful and no longer have full confidence in his thoughts. This striking is the discipline of the Holy Spirit. After experiencing the Lord&rsquo;s dealing, he will not depend on his thoughts, and it will become easier for him to live by his spirit.</p>
<p>At this point in this brother&rsquo;s experience, he may think that he has been fully delivered from his self. However, God will continue to shine upon him, showing him that he has not been fully delivered, because there are still soulish elements mixed with his thoughts. Although there is an element of God in his mind, there is a substantial amount of the self as well. With God&rsquo;s further shining, the element of mixture in his mind is gradually sifted out by God. In his initial experiences of God&rsquo;s dealing, the Holy Spirit&rsquo;s discipline struck a fundamental blow to his mind. This later shining sifts out the elements of mixture that still remain in his mind. Thus, he is purified through God&rsquo;s shining. Then when he administrates the church, ministers the word, or touches other spiritual matters, he can do so without any mixed intentions.</p>
<p>Living by the spirit rather than the soul is one thing, but being pure without mixture is another thing. A person may be able to live according to the spirit without being completely pure. In order to be pure, we still need to experience God&rsquo;s further shining. Only those who are continually being shined upon can be pure. Please do not regard this as mere doctrine. Unless we love the Lord, pursue Him, and seek His pleasure, we cannot learn these lessons in a solid way. Although innumerable people have been saved throughout the centuries, not many have overcome to the point of being firstfruits. According to the book of Revelation, it is the overcomers in the churches, not the church as a whole, who satisfy God&rsquo;s heart. Hence, in the seven epistles in chapters 2 and 3 of Revelation, there is a continual call for overcomers. Although some Christians love the Lord very much, they do not live according to the spirit, and even fewer are overcomers who have been delivered from the soul to live by the spirit.</p>
<p>Today the Lord needs overcomers. Over the past two thousand years the gospel has been spread by the overcomers, His testimony has been maintained by the overcomers, Satan has been defeated by the overcomers, and God&rsquo;s life has flowed out through the overcomers. Every overcomer learns to live before God, that is, to live in the spirit and by the spirit. The overcomers uphold the life and testimony of the church. Throughout the generations the general situation of the church can be characterized as being dead (3:1), but the overcomers continue the testimony of the church. They will usher in God&rsquo;s kingdom and meet the Lord at His return. May the Lord grant us grace so that we may follow the footsteps of the overcomers to pay the price and allow ourselves to be severely broken in order to be delivered thoroughly from our soul to live in our spirit.</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_018.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_020.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Fellowshipping with the Lord for the Mingling of God with Man &nbsp; pg 19</div><br></body></html>
