   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Matthew 27:51 also says that "the earth was shaken and the rocks were split."</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The shaking of the earth signifies that the base of Satan's rebellion was shaken, and the splitting of the rocks signifies that the strongholds of Satan's earthly kingdom were broken.</S>

   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>After the Lord Jesus was buried, the chief priests and the Pharisees came to Pilate and asked him to secure the grave until the third day vv.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>62-64 .</S>

   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>On the negative side, this sealing was intended by the opposing Jewish leaders to be a precaution, but on the positive side, it turned out to be a strong testimony of the Lord's resurrection.</S>
