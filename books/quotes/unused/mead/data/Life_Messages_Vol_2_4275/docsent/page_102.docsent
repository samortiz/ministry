   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>OUR NATURAL THOUGHT</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>When we study the Bible, however, instead of seeing this plain word, we see only verses like this: "Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thine heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy might" Deut 6:5 .</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>We see that God is to be worshipped and feared.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>We see that we must labor for Him and that we must pay the price to live for Him.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Words like these stand out to us when we find them in the Scripture, because we already have such concepts within us naturally.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>We take from the Bible what is already in our thought, rather than open to take the Word itself into us.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>When a wife reads Ephesians, for example, she does not learn much about the church, or Christ, or the Spirit, or life.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The only verse she takes note of is Ephesians 5:25.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Because she is already preoccupied with the thought that her husband has to love her, she thinks the Bible is a wonderful book because of this one verse it contains!</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The husband, on his part, finds Ephesians 5:22, "Wives, be subject to your own husbands as to the Lord."</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>This is the only verse that stands out to him!</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The important things in the Bible pass us by, because they are not in our natural thought.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>"To me to live is Christ" does not attract much attention.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Matters concerning the spirit, though we may have heard many messages on the topic, simply go in one ear and out the other.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>They mean very little to us.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>We go on in our natural way, trying to behave properly and please God, figuring that this was what the message was about anyway.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>MAN'S SPIRIT</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>I beg you to notice how important the human spirit is!</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The eternal God one day created man.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Zechariah 12:1 says of Him that He "stretcheth forth the heavens, and layeth the foundation of the earth, and formeth the spirit of man within him."</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The spirit within man is small, but the Bible ranks it with the heavens and the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The three most significant things in God's creation are the heavens, the earth, and the human spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The heavens are for the earth, and the earth is for man.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>This man has a spirit in order that he may receive God.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Without the spirit, the heavens and the earth are meaningless.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Have you ever praised God that you have a spirit, a spirit which is as significant as the heavens and the earth?</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>TWO SPIRITS JOINED</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>At the time of the creation, however, God could not enter into man's spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>God first had to become flesh, live as a man on this earth, and then go to the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>In His death He redeemed us from our sins and terminated the old creation.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>He died, was buried, and arose from the dead.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>In incarnation He had become flesh; now in resurrection He, the last Adam, became a life-giving Spirit 1 Cor 15:45 .</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>As such, He can be joined with our spirit 1 Cor 6:17 .</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>When we turned to Him in repentance, sought His forgiveness, and opened to receive Him, He came into our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>We were regenerated.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>"That which is born of the Spirit is spirit" John 3:6 .</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>We have a spirit which has been born of this Spirit, who is also called "the Spirit of life" Rom 8:2 .</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>When He enters into us, He imparts life.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>This life is God's own life, eternal and uncreated, a life of death and resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Let us focus all our attention on this life.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>We must turn away from the fringes and come back to the center, to this all-inclusive Spirit, who supplies life to us.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>We are off center when our concern is how to worship God, how to love or submit to our spouse, how to be an overcomer, or how to live a spiritual life.</S>
