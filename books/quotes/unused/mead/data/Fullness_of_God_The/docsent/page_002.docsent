   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>THE CREATION OF MAN BEING</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>FOR THE FULLNESS OF GOD Scripture Reading: Eph 1:7, 18; 3:16, 19; Rom 9:23; 2:4; Gen 1:26 OUTLINE The meaning of the fullness of God: The fullness of God being the overflow of God s riches to become His expression.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The fullness of God being the expression of the riches of God.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The riches of God: The riches of God s grace Eph 1:7.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The riches of God s glory v. 18; 3:16; Rom 9:23.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The riches of God s kindness, forbearance, and long-suffering 2:4.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The creation of man being for the fullness of God: The fullness of God being the expression of the riches of all that God is.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Man being created in God s image for the expression of all that God is Gen 1:26.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>In this series of messages we will use four chapters to consider the fullness of God and another four chapters to consider life, truth, the church, and the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Many newly saved and baptized brothers and sisters may not have a clear understanding of the phrase the fullness of God.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>It is easier to understand God s power, authority, and greatness.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>It may also be easier to understand God s mercy, His abundant grace, and His deep love.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>A believer may also have a partial understanding of some deeper matters, such as God s holiness, righteousness, salvation, and redemption.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>However, even believers who have been studying the Bible for years find it difficult to understand the fullness of God.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>After many years of studying the truth and consulting the works of renowned writers throughout the centuries, I discovered that even Bible expositors have different views of this term, and their understanding is generally not according to the pure divine revelation in the Scriptures.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>MAN S NATURAL UNDERSTANDING OF THE BIBLE</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The Bible was written in human language.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The Old Testament was written in Hebrew, and the New Testament was written in Greek.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>These were then translated into other languages.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>A language is a means of communication.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>It is easy for a person who reads the Bible, whether in the original text or a translation, to have a natural understanding of the Bible if he only understands it literally.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>This is a common mistake among Bible readers.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>For example, the Bible speaks about faith.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The Chinese translation of faith literally means a believing, trusting heart.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>This definition is accurate according to a natural understanding, but it is not accurate according to the revelation in the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>When some people read the word faith in the Bible, it is easy for them to understand it as a kind of determination and resolution from a strong will.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Hence, they use the example of Columbus to explain faith.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>They say that during the time of Columbus very few people believed that it was possible to cross the ocean and find land, but Columbus had faith.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Hence, even after he sailed across the ocean for a long time, was in many storms, and his sailors conspired to kill him, Columbus firmly believed that they would find land and proposed that they sail on.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>He was unshaken in his faith and therefore kept saying, Sail on!</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>According to our natural understanding, that was an example of Columbus s faith, which was the result of a strong will.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>His faith together with his courage became an effectual resolve.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>However, this is not what the Bible means when it speaks of faith.</S>
