Ephesians 5:25 tells us that the Lord Jesus died for the church, and Matthew 16:18 tells us that He is now building the church
The last book of the New Testament, the book of Revelation, reveals to us the local churches in many localities
In Exodus 3 we are told that when God came to call Moses, He appeared to him in a burning bush as the angel of Jehovah
According to Exodus 3:3-4, when Moses turned to see the burning bush, it was Jehovah God who called to him out of the midst of the bush
The name Jesus is the Greek equivalent of the Hebrew word Joshua , which means 'Jehovah the Savior,' or 'the salvation of Jehovah'
In Exodus 3:6 God told Moses that He is the God of Abraham the father, the God of Isaac the son, and the God of Jacob the grandson
The fact that He is the God of three generations, not of one, two, or four generations, implies that He is the Triune God
In his Epistles to Timothy and Titus, Paul uses the titles 'our Savior God' , 'our Savior Christ Jesus' , and 'Jesus Christ our Savior'
Many of these so-called Christians say that Jesus was a great man, and that because of this people worship Him as God
One day He entered into the womb of a virgin named Mary, and He accomplished a wonderful conception in that human womb
In Luke 1:35 and Matthew 1:18 and 20 we are told that a child was conceived in the virgin Mary, not of any man, but of the Holy Spirit
The Holy Spirit, who is the very God reaching man, entered into Mary's womb and accomplished a marvelous conception
Do you believe that a child born out of a virgin and put into a manger two thousand years ago was the Mighty God?
When Jesus came out to minister at the age of thirty, He called four disciples, Andrew, Peter, James, and John
Later, a strong one among the Jews by the name of Saul was opposing and persecuting the people who declared that Jesus was God
The answer is that Jesus is actually the very God of Saul's forefathers , the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob
If Jesus were not God, how could it be that after He was crucified and buried, He spoke to Saul from the heavens?
Saul, who was also Paul , became the strongest among the Jews not only to believe that Jesus is God, but also to preach this fact
While Abraham sat in the door of his tent on a hot summer day, all of a sudden three men came to him, and he welcomed them
He had the divine power, He had the divine authority, including the authority to forgive people's sins, and He had the divine wisdom
It is important to realize that the One who died on the cross was a God-man, and that the blood shed on the cross was the blood of a God-man
Two verses, 1 John 1:7 and Acts 20:28, give us the biblical ground to say that the blood shed on the cross was the blood of a God-man
Jesus is God, but the Jews arrested Him and condemned Him to be crucified because they thought He blasphemed by saying that He was God
When He was asked about other things, He did not say anything, but when He was asked whether He was the Son of God, He said, 'You said it!
In Acts 7, while Stephen was being stoned to death, he saw the heavens opened and Jesus standing there in the heavens as the Son of Man
Many who have been Christians for years may not realize that Jesus died on the cross with seven qualifications
In dying in the likeness of the flesh of sin, He was made sin for the believers , and God condemned sin in the flesh through His death
In John 3:14 the Lord Jesus said that He would be lifted up on the cross as Moses lifted up the brass serpent on a pole in the Old Testament
In dying on the cross in the form of the brass serpent, the Lord Jesus bruised the head of the old serpent, Satan , and destroyed him
In dying as the first item of all creation, the Lord Jesus terminated the old creation and tasted death on behalf of everything
The seventh qualification is that the Lord Jesus died as a grain of wheat to release the divine life for His propagation
Through His death on the cross Jesus abolished all these differences to make all peoples one Body in Christ to be the new man
He also died as a grain of wheat to release the divine life within Him that He might be multiplied that He might be increased and propagated
Today in the heavens Jesus is the Lord of the entire universe, and there in the heavens He is carrying out God's commission
The Spirit is the all-inclusive life-giving Spirit, and life is the divine life, the eternal, uncreated life of God
As the Peacemaker, and even as the very peace, He made peace between us and God and between all the different nations
Lastly, He died as a grain of wheat to produce many grains for His multiplication, His increase, and His propagation
As the first item of all creation, He died on the cross not only with us, the sinners, but with all the creation
According to Colossians 2:14, when Christ died on the cross, God nailed the ordinances of the law to the cross
The third major ordinance in the law was the keeping of the dietary regulations recorded in Leviticus chapter eleven
When the Lord Jesus went to the cross, He brought all these ordinances with Him, and they were all nailed to the cross by God
We all need to realize that the Japanese kimono and the Chinese long gown have both been crucified on the cross
After His resurrection, He ascended to the heavens to be made the Lord of the entire universe, that He might possess the universe
Now within us we have the essential Spirit the Spirits divine essence and upon us we have the economical Spirit the Spirit of Gods economy
In other words, within us we have the processed Triune God as our essence, and upon us we have the processed Triune God for His economy
Whenever we read in the Bible concerning the Spirit, we need to realize that the Spirit is God Himself in His move
Speaking of God in His creation, Genesis 1:2 says, 'And the Spirit of God was brooding upon the surface of the waters'
As the embodiment of the Triune God, Christ went through incarnation, human living, and crucifixion and entered into resurrection
According to 2 Corinthians 3:17, today, after His resurrection, that is, after His glorification , Christ is the Spirit
We have Christ as the embodiment of God, we have the Spirit as God moving, and we have the divine life as God living within us
Prayer: Lord, how we thank You for this gathering, that You have gathered us together around You, through Your Word
The Spirit as the holy breath was breathed into the disciples essentially for their existence that they might live by this lifegiving Spirit
When this Spirit of life was breathed into the disciples, this meant that the divine essence of God was breathed into their inner being
After He was resurrected, the Lord Jesus stayed with the disciples for forty days in order to train them to enjoy His invisible presence
During those three and a half years, the disciples had enjoyed the Lord's physical presence which was visible to all of them
The doors of the room in which the disciples met were closed, yet the Lord Jesus came and stood in their midst
They did not know how the Lord entered the room, yet He came into the room, appeared to them, and breathed into them
Because of the weakness of the disciples, they sometimes needed His invisible presence to become visible for a short time
For forty days the Lord Jesus was with the disciples in this way, appearing and disappearing, becoming visible and invisible
After the Lord had appeared to them and then disappeared, Peter, John, and the other disciples might have asked one another what this meant
If you really believe that the Lord Jesus is within you, it is impossible for you to remain silent or stay still
On the day of resurrection the Spirit was breathed into the disciples, but on the day of Pentecost the Spirit was poured out upon them
We need to drink of Jesus, to have Jesus within us as the living water, and we also need to be clothed with the Spirit of power
We need the Spirit within as breath and as water for drinking, and we also need the Spirit without as our clothing
The Spirit of life within is for our life and living, and this Spirit is likened to breath and to water for drinking
A policeman may be a small man, but when he puts on his uniform and stands in the street, people pay attention to him
When a policeman in uniform orders someone to pay a traffic ticket it must be paid for he is one who has authority signified by his uniform
The Spirit of power was not for the disciples to live, but for them to work, to preach, to minister, and to carry out God's economy
Because Jesus was the name given to Him at His human birth, the term the Spirit of Jesus mainly denotes the Spirit of Jesus' humanity
The elements of His humanity, divinity, human living, anointing, crucifixion, resurrection, and ascension are all in this one Spirit
You have been regenerated with this divine life, and now this divine life is saving you with a daily salvation
To be saved in life as mentioned in Romans 5:10 is not to be saved from perdition, from hell, but to be saved from our daily 'hell'
Perhaps this morning or this afternoon a sister was in 'hell' for three hours because her husband offended her
Even today we can be kings ruling over our anxiety, over our anger, over our bad habits, over our bad temper, and over murmuring
In the previous chapters we have covered the first three factors that are vital to the recovery of the church life
To learn the truths in the Bible we need to have a sober mind, a mind which is clear, transparent, and enlightened by the Lord
There is no Anglican Church, no Chinese Church, no Korean Church, no Presbyterian Church, no Baptist Church, and no Pentecostal Church
Out of all the different ways of practicing the church life among Christians today, it is difficult to find one that is right
The universal church is the unique Body of Christ, and all the local churches are simply the local expressions of that one Body
Acts 15:41 speaks of the churches in Syria and Cilicia, and Romans 16:4 mentions the churches in the Gentile world
In the New Testament we can see many local churches, and together these local churches are considered as one universal church
In Matthew 18:17 the Lord said that if, as a believer, you have a problem with another believer, you should tell it to the church
Universally, all the churches are one Body, and locally, every local church is a local expression of that universal Body
Every building is built upon a certain piece of land, and this land is the ground on which the building is constructed
The proper answer is that, locally speaking, we are in many churches, but, universally speaking, we are all in one church
Since we are now in the city of Seoul, we should say that we are in the universal church by being in the church in Seoul
The best answer is that you are a member of the universal church which Jesus Christ is building, by being a member of a proper local church
The ground of locality is a protection which ensures that a church in a particular locality will always be preserved in oneness
Locally, the ground of the church is the ground of locality; universally, the ground of the church is the genuine oneness
Suppose all the local churches in Korea are one with each other, but are not one with the churches in other continents
All the local churches in the six continentsin North America in South America in Europe in Africa in Australia and in Asiaare one Body
The church is one locally based upon its locality, the city, and it is one universally based upon the one Body of Christ
In the proper church life, the administration of the church is local, but the fellowship of the church is universal
The highest is the central government, and under the central government are the provincial, or state, governments and the city governments
Even the administration of the smallest local church in Korea is equal with the administration of the church in Seoul
Although the administration of the church is separate and equal locally, the fellowship of the church is one universally
In these nations there are separate churches in many cities, but there is only one fellowship in the entire universe
In all the churches we should only teach one thing-Jesus Christ as the Spirit to be our life for the producing of the church
We accept only one kind of teaching, the teaching of the apostles, and have only one fellowship, the apostles' fellowship
Because all the elders in the local churches are established and appointed by the apostles, the apostles are over the elders
They select the more mature believers and appoint them to be elders to shepherd, to take care of, a local church
They should be patterns, examples, taking the lead to love the Lord, to seek after the truth, to grow in life, and to serve in the church
Outwardly we have the ground of locality to keep the oneness; inwardly we live by the Spirit for the oneness of the Body
If we have only the ground of locality without the Spirit, we merely have something outward with no inward reality
All the believers should be gospel preachers, but some members in the Body do have a particular gift to preach the gospel
As Christians, we all should be in such a proper church, and we should participate in such a proper practice of the church life
In the preceding chapters we have seen that the Bible first unveils four main items: God, Christ, the Spirit, and the divine life
God, Christ, the Spirit, the divine life, the believers, and the church are the crucial matters revealed in the Bible
We should not consider that Christ is One who is separate from God, or that the Spirit is a third One who is separate from Christ
As the One living in our spirit, He is our life, not our natural life, but the divine life added into our being
The sister, her husband, her mother-in-law, and her sister-in-law are all in the church, but they cannot love one another
Because the church was so scriptural, so much according to the Bible, you felt that you must come to the church meetings
The brothers and sisters in the church where you were seemed to behave more like turtles creeping than birds flying
In one sense we all are wonderful people because we have the divine life, but in another sense we still live in our old man
We still have our old nature, our bad temper, our likes and dislikes, our emotions, our intentions, our choices, and our peculiarities
We must confess that we are still sinful, that we are still not pure, and that we need the Lord's precious blood to cleanse us all the time
The Spirit who is operating in us is the all-inclusive Spirit of Jesus Christ, and He is operating in us in seven ways
Galatians 5:22-23 says that the Spirit within us is bearing many kinds of divine virtues, such as love, joy, and peace
To be transformed is not merely to change our character outwardly; it is to be changed in life by the divine element from within us
As we are being transformed and renewed, spontaneously we are being built together to be the habitation of God
For this seven-fold operation of the Spirit, there is always in this Spirit the full, bountiful supply of the unsearchable riches of Christ
Galatians 5:24 says, 'But they who are of Christ Jesus have crucified the flesh with the passions and the lusts'
Our eyes may be accustomed to looking into department store windows or reading newspapers in an unrestricted way
Perhaps a sister attends a meeting and hears a message concerning Christ as the embodiment of God and the Spirit as the reality of Christ
Although the speaker may repeat these points many times, after the meeting the sister may be unable to remember the content of the message
We remember the things which are not pleasant to the Lord, and we forget those things which are pleasant to Him
Often our body seems to be too tired to go to the church meetings, but it is full of energy to participate in worldly activities
When we think about going to a church meeting in the evening, we may feel quite tired and may even decide to stay home in order to rest
When we hear that a particular sporting event will take place the same evening, we may suddenly feel strong enough to attend
If she reads in the newspaper about a certain item which is on sale, she may insist that her husband buy it for her immediately
Our old man, the old 'I,' has been crucified with Christ , and now we need to deny our self and put aside our soul life
There are many problems in today's church life because there is too much of the old man, too much soulish life, and too much self
We should have no opinion, no self, no I, no soulish life, no old man, but only Christ, only the Spirit, and only the divine life
Ordinances are our habits, customs, ways of doing things, ways of living, and ways of practicing the church life
Next, we must experience the Spirit's operation through the cross destroying Satan, the one who has the power of death
John 12:31 tells us that when the Lord Jesus went to the cross, He judged the world and cast out its ruler, Satan
The church life will be wonderful, marvelous, and excellent because of the Spirit's operation through the cross
To continue this illustration, a third brother may ask the brother who took your books if it was right for him to do that
By these illustrations we can see that in the church life the standard of morality is much higher than the morality in human society
On one occasion these three contended with the heavy brother over how much space each should occupy on the bench
When the divine essence has been infused into your being, your human virtues will be altogether transformed, strengthened, and enriched
Doctrine may be likened to a menu or a recipe, while the unsearchable riches of Christ may be compared to the food itself
To be strengthened with power through His Spirit into the inner man, that Christ may make His home in your hearts'
Paul prayed that the believers would not only enjoy the riches of Christ, but be completely filled up and occupied by Christ
In this way Christ would make His home in the believers' hearts, and this very Christ would saturate their entire being
The believers are persons who always enjoy Christ and are filled with Christ, saturated with Christ, until they are full of God
Christ will make His home in our entire being, filling us and saturating us until we are filled unto all the fullness of God
In order to practice lowliness in the church life none of the brothers or sisters older ones or younger ones should remain in a high estate
We may illustrate the virtue of meekness by the story of a sister whose husband always came home very late at night
Even if you know that he is going to the theater, you should still wish him a good time and be ready to welcome him back
After we have buried the dead dog, we may boast to our friends that we have forgiven others and have buried the past
In Ephesians 4:2 Paul said that, in addition to exercising the virtues of lowliness and meekness, we also need to be longsuffering
It is true that Judas never changed, but still we must admit that without Judas, the Lord could never have been betrayed and crucified
