   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>C. The Spirit of Divinity</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>and the Spirit of Humanity</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Now the Spirit of Jesus Christ is not only the Spirit of divinity but also the Spirit of humanity.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>He, as the Spirit of God, has been compounded with divinity and humanity.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Hence, He is the compounded Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>D. The Type of the Holy Anointing Ointment</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>In typology, the type of the holy anointing ointment, as unveiled in Exodus 30:23-28, confirms this divine revelation concerning the Spirit of God.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Some of the Brethren teachers saw that this anointing ointment typified the Spirit of God, but they did not see the significance of the type of the compounded Spirit in Exodus 30.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>That type shows us that the Spirit of God is compounded not only with the divinity of God typified by a hin of olive oil and the humanity of man typified by the four kinds of spices , but also with the sweet death of Christ typified by myrrh , the sweet effectiveness of the death of Christ typified by cinnamon , the surpassing resurrection of Christ typified by calamus , and the repelling power of the resurrection of Christ typified by cassia .</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Such a compound was called the holy anointing ointment with which all the tabernacle and its utensils were anointed for their sanctification unto God, and such a compounded Spirit is the anointing Spirit as the sealing Spirit 2 Cor 1:21-22 , whose anointing within the believers is the reality of His indwelling within the believers 1 John 2:20, 27 .</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The one hin of olive oil signifies the unique God and the four spices signify man as the head of the creatures.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Here we see the mingling of God and man.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>For more details concerning the type of the compound ointment, see Life-study of Exodus, Messages 157-166, pp.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>1679-1776.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>This is a very significant point missed by today s Christianity concerning the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Those in today s Christianity have never seen that the Spirit of God through Christ s death and resurrection was compounded with divinity and humanity.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Through Christ s death and resurrection, the Spirit of God became the Spirit of Man compounded with four things: Christ s death, the sweet effectiveness of Christ s death, Christ s resurrection, and the repelling power of Christ s resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Thus, in the Spirit there is the killing element that puts everything of the old creation to death Rom 8:11 .</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Also, in the Spirit there is a repelling power.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>In ancient times, people used cassia as a snake and insect repellent.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>After the olive oil was compounded with the four kinds of spices, it became an ointment.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>An ointment is a compound.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Therefore, the Spirit of God today is a compound!</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Consummation equals compound .</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>This is why we say that the Spirit today is the consummation of the processed and consummated Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Now we would like to list the different functions of the anointing of the compound Spirit as God s anointing ointment Exo 30:25; 1 John 2:27; 2 Cor 1:21 :</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Sealing Eph 1:13; 4:30.</S>

   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Strengthening Eph 3:16.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Fellowshipping 2 Cor 13:14.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Keeping the oneness Eph 4:3.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The Bible is a book that unveils God to us, and this God is triune the Father, the Son, and the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>This Triune God came into time to pass through a long process of four major steps: incarnation, human living, death, and resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Through this process He became a life-giving Spirit 1 Cor 15:45b , and this life-giving Spirit, according to the type in Exodus 30, is a compound Spirit, a Spirit compounded with God and man and with four items concerning Christ: His death, the effectiveness of His death, His resurrection, and the power of His resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>He is now the compound Spirit, so He is the consummation of the processed and consummated Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>The Triune God who has passed through a long process of four steps has become a compound, and this compound is a living person, the Spirit of life.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Within Him are these six things God and man, Christ s death and its effectiveness, and Christ s resurrection and its power.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>All these are compounded into one entity, which is called the anointing ointment.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>This compound, the anointing ointment, the consummation of the processed and consummated Triune God, has become a medicine to us.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>It has the supplying element.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>It also has the killing, repelling element.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>So eventually the entire Bible presents us an all-inclusive dose which we need.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>If we receive this dose, we receive God, and we become God-men.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>This dose supplies us, nourishes us, and kills all the germs within us to make us a healthy, heavenly God-man, and this God-man is altogether in resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Resurrection is the equivalent of the consummation of the processed and consummated Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>The Bible presents us a dose, and this dose is the consummation of the processed and consummated Triune God.</S>
