   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>An Outlet for the Authority of the Holy Spirit</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Recently, I saw what happened to a brother who had carried a very heavy object over a long distance several years ago.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>His hand felt somewhat sore then, but now it has become so disabled that it can hardly move.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The brother said, "My whole body belongs to me except this hand.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>This member seems to belong to someone else, and it struggles with me."</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>I have never heard anyone say this in such a way before.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>I am often sick.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Through my sickness I found out that whenever the existence of a certain member is felt, that member must certainly have some kind of sickness.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>When the human body is in perfect condition, there is no consciousness that the body exists.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Whenever we feel the lungs breathing, the lungs must be sick.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Whenever we feel the heart beating, the heart must be sick.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>From my birth to my teens, I was never conscious of my teeth, but the day I became conscious of my teeth, I was unable to sleep the whole night.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The body is very natural and spontaneous.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Its harmony does not result in consciousness of any of its parts; rather, because of its harmony, it does not seem to feel its existence.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Today we may not feel like we have fingers.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>We would regard it as strange to be asked, "Do you feel that you have fingers?"</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>But if one of our fingers is broken, we will feel uncomfortable the whole day.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Whenever we feel something, then something is wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Whenever the body cannot use one of its members, the body is sick.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>In order for the Holy Spirit to have complete authority in the church, the whole Body must move freely without any hindrance.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>As soon as there is hindrance in a certain part, it means the Body is sick.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>When everyone is under the authority of the Holy Spirit, He can use everyone.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Then there is no hindrance in the Body, and everything moves smoothly.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>When authority operates smoothly, the Body is healthy.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>When everyone can be used by the Holy Spirit, then the Holy Spirit has authority and everything is very natural and spontaneous.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The complete authority of the Holy Spirit is the ground of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Where this authority exists, there is the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>A group today may have some brothers and sisters who are under the authority of the Holy Spirit and others who are not under the authority of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Immediately, we can see that there is no ground of the church there.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The ground of the church is the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Whenever the Holy Spirit is offended, the ground of the church is lost.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The unanimous decision of all the brothers and sisters does not make up the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>It is not a matter of sixteen hundred people raising their hands to pass a resolution, and then there is the church.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>It is not a matter of these sixteen hundred people, but a matter of whether or not the authority of the Holy Spirit has been executed.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>If the authority of the Holy Spirit is absent, there is no church ground.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Only when everyone submits to the authority of the Holy Spirit does the church have its ground.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The body is that which we can freely use and move around in. It has no conflicts or difficulties at all.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Whatever we want to do, it does.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>That which struggles with us is not the body.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Whether or not a local church can be manifested depends upon whether or not it can submit to the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>When this kind of submission is manifested, the church is manifested.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Therefore, if a brother likes to speak and make decisions by himself, the authority of the Holy Spirit is damaged, the Body of Christ is damaged, and the church is damaged.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Consequently, there is no church in that place.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>A place with a signboard does not constitute a church.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Instead, it is only as the brothers and sisters lay down their own thoughts and subject themselves to the authority of the Holy Spirit, allowing the authority of the Holy Spirit to flow through them without any hindrance, that there is the church.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>As those who serve God and bear responsibility in the work, we need to remember this one thing: After twenty, thirty, fifty, or even sixty years, when all our hair has become white, we will still be only a transmitter of authority, a channel or mouthpiece of authority.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>We still will not be the authority.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Whenever we become the authority, everything is finished.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>The brothers and sisters who are workers must thoroughly know what the authority of the Holy Spirit is.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Do not think that today we can give some proposals.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Our proposals will not do.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>The Lord has never granted us the authority to make our own proposals.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>We can only be a channel of authority, not authority itself.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>If we live to be a hundred years old and have followed the Lord for those hundred years, we should not think that we can give some proposals.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Only as our spirit becomes more trained, as we learn something, as the sense of our spirit becomes keener, as we receive more light, and as we touch God's basic principles, thus becoming more familiar with the Word of God, is it easier for the authority of the Holy Spirit to come out through us.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>We use authority to serve the brothers and sisters, not to govern them.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Authority is just one part of our service.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>I hope all the leading ones of the home meetings would take note of this.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Authority is related to your ministry; it is in fact one of your many ministries.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>It is not for governing others but for supplying others.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>In a certain matter other brothers may not see, but we see; they may not understand, but we can understand.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Since we understand God's heart's desire, we can tell them of God's desire, saying, "Brothers, you should not do this in such a way; I know this will not do.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>If you do it, you will violate God's authority.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>You must give up this matter."</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>This is not exercising authority to govern the brothers, but exercising it with a view to supply and serve them.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Before the Lord, we are learning to be an outlet for the Holy Spirit's authority to supply the brothers.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>We are not governing them.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>We are learning to let God's authority come out as a supply; we are not here to establish our own authority.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Regardless of what kind of position a brother may have, whether he is an overseer, an apostle, or a deacon, he loses and ruins the ground of the church in its entirety whenever he establishes or manifests his own authority.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>The ground of the church is entirely established upon the authority of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Whenever His authority is offended, the ground of the church is gone, and problems arise.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>When the whole church is under the authority of the Holy Spirit, it is like the Lord's own body given to Him by Mary when He was on this earth.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>He can speak, listen, and walk as He wishes.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>The body which Mary prepared for the Lord could not have been more appropriate.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>His body cooperated with Him to such an extent that it was as if such a body did not exist at all and that the Lord Himself was acting alone.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>It was so harmonious, so united, so free of problems and conflicts.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>His hands were never unavailable when they were needed, His eyes never malfunctioned when they were called upon to see, His tongue was never tied when it needed to speak, and His mind was never absent when it needed to think.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>The church likewise can reach such a level that it is as if it does not exist at all and that Christ is acting alone.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>The Lord can exercise Himself spontaneously and pass through such an outlet freely.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>It can be in such harmony, such oneness, and such spontaneity that it is as if the Lord is not passing through it at all.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>The authority of the Holy Spirit passes through the church so freely and harmoniously that it is as if He has not passed through the church at all.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>When the authority of the Holy Spirit is able to operate so completely, there is the church.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>Whenever there is resistance or hindrance, that is not the church.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>Whenever the Holy Spirit cannot move, whenever individuals stand out, there is some problem and the church is damaged.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>In such a case, it can no longer be considered the church.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>Now I want to go back to today's question.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>There are many so-called denominational churches.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>The Lord has not given us the freedom to criticize them.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>However, we do confess that there are many elderly brothers among us who have come out of the denominations.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>They know the histories.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>Many other brothers came out of the world and sin.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>They do not know how much man's opinions, decisions, methods, organizations, names, and traditions are in the groups that use the name of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>I do not wish to say more about this.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>From the beginning when we were called out by the Lord, we insisted on a fundamental ground that is, we must obey and establish the authority of the Holy Spirit in the church and destroy our own authority.</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>I ask the Lord to forgive me for saying this, because the authority of the Holy Spirit does not need to be established by man.</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>Excuse me for using the following illustration for the sake of the younger brothers.</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>If I release a tiger in the streets, is it necessary to send guards to protect it?</S>
   <S PAR='98' RSNT='1' SNO='98'>No, the tiger does not need any guards; it can protect itself.</S>
   <S PAR='99' RSNT='1' SNO='99'>Likewise, the Holy Spirit does not need our support.</S>
   <S PAR='100' RSNT='1' SNO='100'>The authority of the Holy Spirit is in the church.</S>
   <S PAR='101' RSNT='1' SNO='101'>It does not need our zeal to establish it.</S>
   <S PAR='102' RSNT='1' SNO='102'>The only thing needed in God's children is their willingness to consecrate and yield themselves to Him so that the authority of the Holy Spirit can come out of them unceasingly.</S>
   <S PAR='103' RSNT='1' SNO='103'>It is now a matter of whether or not we are willing to consecrate ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='104' RSNT='1' SNO='104'>Whenever God's children disobey, the authority of the Holy Spirit cannot come out.</S>
   <S PAR='105' RSNT='1' SNO='105'>The basic matter today is whether or not we have consecrated ourselves adequately.</S>
   <S PAR='106' RSNT='1' SNO='106'>I hope that we will consecrate ourselves afresh to the Lord for the authority of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='107' RSNT='1' SNO='107'>We must pray, "Lord, You are the Head in the church.</S>
   <S PAR='108' RSNT='1' SNO='108'>Grant me the grace that I may not be one who hinders or resists.</S>
   <S PAR='109' RSNT='1' SNO='109'>May I have nothing of my own."</S>
   <S PAR='110' RSNT='1' SNO='110'>We must realize that whenever we bring anything of our own into the church, regardless of how good it is, something extra has been added to the church, and there is a hindrance.</S>
   <S PAR='111' RSNT='1' SNO='111'>My body can only consist of its own members.</S>
   <S PAR='112' RSNT='1' SNO='112'>I cannot allow the things of others to be added to my body.</S>
   <S PAR='113' RSNT='1' SNO='113'>Even the best things of others cannot be put into my body.</S>
   <S PAR='114' RSNT='1' SNO='114'>What is of my body must be my own.</S>
   <S PAR='115' RSNT='1' SNO='115'>The things of others may be precious, but once they are added to my body they may be poisonous.</S>
   <S PAR='116' RSNT='1' SNO='116'>We must learn before God not to bring our own things into the church.</S>
   <S PAR='117' RSNT='1' SNO='117'>Some of them may be very good, but if they are not of the Holy Spirit, they cannot be brought into the church.</S>
   <S PAR='118' RSNT='1' SNO='118'>Once they are in the church, the church loses its ground.</S>
   <S PAR='119' RSNT='1' SNO='119'>In the church there is only one Holy Spirit, one authority, one power, one fellowship, one name.</S>
   <S PAR='120' RSNT='1' SNO='120'>Anything that is brought into the church which is not of the Holy Spirit will ruin the church ground, and then there is no more church.</S>
