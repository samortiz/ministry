   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>APPLYING THE LORD'S PRESENCE</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>We must be practical in applying this to our present situation.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>When the young people have their special meetings, they like to consider the way and format of their meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Many times they will come to the leading brothers asking for directions and fellowship as to how they must meet.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>In a sense this is good, but in another sense it is not.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>They must realize that the Lord is with them.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>They need only proceed to meet with the present Christ, the living Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>He will show them how to meet.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>When they come into His presence, He will lead them and reveal to them moment by moment how to go on.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>It is really difficult for people to believe that there has ever been such a group of believers meeting in this way on this earth.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>You see, we are still rather religious even when we come together to meet.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>We always have the concept that we must know beforehand how we are going to meet.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>When we come to the meeting we are not so open to the living Jesus, the present Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>We still retain certain religious concepts concerning how to meet.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>When we read the record in this chapter of what the Lord said and did, we cannot find even a hint of anything religious.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>If we compare the record of this chapter with all the records of the Old Testament, there is a great contrast and difference.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Not one matter resembles that which was spoken and performed in the Old Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Everything is changed; everything is new.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>We must realize and admit that in our concepts we still preserve the tenets of religion.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>If we were there, we would say to the Lord Jesus, "Please stay with us for another four weeks.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>We have so many questions; we have so many matters which require a solution.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>We don't know how to go on.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>You have told us to go and disciple the nations, but you have not told us: 1 Where?</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>2 When?</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>3 Who?</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>4 How? or 5 What?</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>O Lord Jesus, please stay with us.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Make everything clear."</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Be honest.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Would we not speak in such a way?</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>In the past eight years many have come to me with these same questions: What?</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Where?</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>When?</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Who?</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>How?</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>My answer all the time was, "I don't know.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Look to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The Lord knows."</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Has the Lord not told us that He will be with us all the days?</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>What else do we want?</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Why should anyone say to the Lord, "Don't go, Lord!"</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>He never has gone and He never will He is with us all the days.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Christians today believe that the Lord Jesus was resurrected, and they also believe that He ascended to heaven.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>But there are some who tell Him, "Lord, you stay there in the third heaven.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Don't come down to interfere.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>You be the exalted Lord there, and let us do a good job for you here."</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>So many behave in this way, leaving the Lord in heaven.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>When they encounter any problems, they fast and pray, asking the Lord to do something for them.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>But this is not the right way to go on.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>We must enjoy the Lord's presence continually.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Whenever we face a difficulty, we need only turn to Him saying, "O Lord Jesus, this is not our problem, this is Your problem.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>You are here.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>If You can go to sleep, then we can do the same."</S>
