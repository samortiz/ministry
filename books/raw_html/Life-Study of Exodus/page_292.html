<h2 class="head1">THE GOD-MAN</h2><p>We have seen that the ark was made of acacia wood overlaid with gold. The acacia wood and the gold typify the two natures of Christ: the gold typifies His divine nature, and the acacia wood, His human nature. Both within and without, the ark was overlaid with gold. This indicates that Christ is divine, that He is God. However, He is not only God, but also a man. Therefore, Christ is a God-man. The gold-wood ark typifies Christ as the God-man.</p><p>It is a mark of blindness and foolishness to oppose the truth that Christ is a God-man. Certain of our opposers seem to pay attention only to the gold of the ark, only to Christ&rsquo;s divinity. They do not pay adequate attention to the fact that the ark is made of wood overlaid with gold, to the fact that Christ is truly the God-man. We most assuredly believe that Christ is God. But we realize that just as the ark was made of wood overlaid with gold, so Christ has a human nature within His divine nature.</p><p>In time to come, more believers will realize that, as the One typified by the ark made of wood overlaid with gold, Christ is the God-man. The truth will go out, and it will convince, subdue, and enlighten. We praise the Lord for this.</p><p>As the God-man, the One who possesses both the divine nature and the human nature, Christ is both the Creator and a creature. Several years ago some who oppose this truth declared, &ldquo;Our Christ is the Creator&mdash;He is not a creature.&rdquo; What blindness! The Bible says clearly that Christ is the Firstborn of all creation (Col. 1:15). Because Christ is all-inclusive, He is the first of the creatures and He is the Creator of all. If Christ were only God and not man, only the Creator and not a creature, He would not be all-inclusive. He would not be the reality of all positive things in the universe.</p><p>Eventually, either in this age or in the coming age, all those who oppose today will come to believe that Christ is all-inclusive. In eternity we all shall know that Christ is God and man, the Creator and the creature, for He is the ark made of acacia wood overlaid with gold.</p><h2 class="head1">THE TOPMOST PART OF CHRIST</h2><p>The most crucial part of the ark of the testimony was its cover. Many buildings in ancient times had something called a topstone, or capstone. The cover of the ark was like a capstone of a building. The propitiatory cover of the ark signifies the topmost part of Christ. The Hebrew word for cover here means a lid. Most translators, however, do not regard the word lid as an adequate rendering, for they realize that this cover is not simple in its significance. For example, there were two cherubim on the lid, the cover, of the ark. Although no one can describe these cherubim, we know that they had faces, eyes, and wings. Exodus 25:20 says, &ldquo;And the cherubim shall spread out their wings above, covering over with their wings the propitiatory cover, with their faces each toward the other; toward the propitiatory cover the faces of the cherubim shall be.&rdquo; The cherubim were made at the two ends of the propitiatory cover, and their wings covered the entire lid. The cherubim were made of beaten work, signifying that Christ&rsquo;s expression of the divine glory was through sufferings. According to the Bible, these cherubim signify God&rsquo;s glory. Wherever the cherubim are, there the glory of God is also. Thus, the picture of the propitiatory cover with the cherubim shows that God&rsquo;s glory, signified by the cherubim, is upon Christ.</p><p>In verses such as these, it is necessary to have an accurate translation to obtain the proper understanding. However, it is not easy to translate the Bible. Do not think that simply because a person has a scholarly knowledge of biblical languages he is qualified to translate the Bible properly. To translate the Bible accurately we must know the truth of the Bible as a whole and we should also have experience in the Lord.</p><p>According to the truth of the Bible, blood was sprinkled on the propitiatory cover of the ark. This blood came from the sacrifices offered on the brass altar in the outer court for propitiation, sacrifices to make peace between sinners and God. The blood of these sacrifices was brought into the Holy of Holies and sprinkled seven times on the propitiatory cover. No doubt, at least a large area of the lid was covered by the sprinkled blood. As a result, the golden lid was eventually covered with blood. The ark in this way became a place of propitiation for man with God.</p><p>In a foregoing message we pointed out that the ark of testimony has a rim of gold. The King James Version uses the word crown. This may imply that the cover of the ark is a crown. This signifies that, as the One typified by the ark, Christ wears a crown. A crown is always placed on the top of a person&rsquo;s head and may be worn as a special hat, or cap.</p><p>In seeking to understand the significance of the ark of testimony for our spiritual experience, we should not rely on the ability of our natural mind. To attempt to do this is to be like cows listening to beautiful music: the sounds can be heard, but there is no understanding or appreciation. There were times many years ago that I was like such a cow listening to messages. Although I could easily recite all the points of a certain message even a year afterward, I didn&rsquo;t understand the &ldquo;music&rdquo; or appreciate it. I did not have genuine spiritual vision, and I was short of light from the Lord. By the Lord&rsquo;s mercy, my situation today is very different. Now I appreciate the &ldquo;music&rdquo; I hear from the Word. I hope that more and more of the saints will also come to appreciate the music. Concerning the ark, we need light from the Lord. In particular, we need light regarding the cover, the cherubim, the rim, and the sprinkling of the blood on the lid of the ark.</p><p>Exodus 25:22 says, &ldquo;And I will meet with you there, and will speak with you from above the propitiatory cover, from between the two cherubim which are upon the ark of the testimony, all that I shall command you concerning the sons of Israel.&rdquo; This verse indicates that God could meet with man and speak with man between the cherubim on the ark. Would you have the boldness to come into the Holy of Holies, stand before the ark, and meet with God face to face? Even though I have known the grace of God for many years, I would not have such boldness.</p>
