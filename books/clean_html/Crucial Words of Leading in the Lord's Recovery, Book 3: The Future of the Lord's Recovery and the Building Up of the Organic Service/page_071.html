<h2 class="head1">BEING ORGANIC, NOT ORGANIZATIONAL, IN SERVICE</h2>
<p>Before a brother is appointed as an elder, he may have had no sense of being anything but a saint who simply served the church. After being asked to coordinate in the eldership, he may regard himself as an elder, and from that day forward, all his service may be based on an organizational understanding.</p>
<p>We need to ask ourselves whether our service comes out of an organizational or organic understanding. If a sister serves only because she has been given an &ldquo;assignment&rdquo; by the elders, her service is organizational. We have fellowshipped that it is difficult to appoint elders. Prior to being appointed to the eldership, a brother may be good, always exercising to be in spirit and organic. However, the moment he is asked to join the eldership, he becomes organizational. An organic brother can easily become an organizational elder. This principle is true not only in the church but even in the world. As soon as someone is assigned to be in charge or to take the lead, he undergoes a change in disposition and behavior. Prior to the assignment he had one disposition, but after the assignment he behaves organizationally based on his position. This is difficult to avoid.</p>
<p>We should not have group leaders and deputy group leaders, or responsible ones and coordinators, because as soon as there is such an arrangement, everything becomes organizational. In 1976 we built a huge meeting hall in Anaheim, California, that could seat four thousand people, but we did not have much arrangement for service related to the building. Taking advantage of this situation, a brother began to arrange service groups. Eventually, he built up a pyramidal organization. Initially, the brothers were organic, but soon everyone became organizational. One day I told the brothers in the elders&rsquo; meeting to abolish and tear down all the service groups. The elders asked, &ldquo;How will the saints serve?&rdquo; And I responded, &ldquo;Whoever has the heart will come to serve; whoever does not have the heart will not serve.&rdquo; After that, our service became living, and the number of serving ones was not reduced.</p>
<p>Fallen people are organizational by birth, and they form groups or communities, which are also organizations. However, the Bible shows that God does not want an organization; God wants an organism. Revelation speaks of the messengers of the churches. Anyone who is organic, in the spirit, and in life is a messenger of the church. We need to be clear that we should not serve organizationally; instead, we should serve organically. Our service is not organizational; it is organic. When this basic issue is resolved, it is easy to deal with other matters.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE BODY OF CHRIST BEING ORGANIC,<br />
NOT ORGANIZATIONAL</h2>
<h2 class="head2">The Relationship between Apostles and Elders</h2>
<p>Influenced by the Lord&rsquo;s recovery, Christianity has begun to notice 1 Corinthians 12:28, which says, &ldquo;God has placed some in the church: first apostles, second prophets, third teachers; then works of power, then gifts of healing, helps, administrations, various kinds of tongues.&rdquo; I was born in Christianity. Since my youth I listened to preaching every Lord&rsquo;s Day, but I had never heard a pastor speak of apostles, prophets, and teachers. It was not until the Lord&rsquo;s recovery was raised up in China that Brother Nee took the lead to speak about these things and opened the door for us. Today in Christianity, especially in the East, people speak of apostles, prophets, and teachers, but they are not clear concerning what apostles, prophets, and teachers are. Even the saints among us are not clear, and some of our co-workers are not clear. What are apostles, prophets, and teachers? What are elders and full-time co-workers? What is the relationship between apostles and elders and between full-time co-workers and elders? The co-workers and elders need to be clear concerning these relationships.</p>
<p>The church in Jerusalem was the first church established on the earth. On the one hand, it was established by the Lord, and on the other hand, it was established by the first group of apostles through their preaching of the gospel. In Acts 2 Peter, standing with the eleven apostles, preached the gospel to the multitude, and about three thousand were saved. These three thousand new believers, in addition to the one hundred twenty disciples, became the church in Jerusalem (vv. 14-41; 1:15). Therefore, the first church was established by the twelve apostles. Although the Bible does not speak of the appointment of elders in Jerusalem, surely there were elders. Although it is not easy to see, the apostles who established the church in Jerusalem were the elders there, because it was through them that the three thousand were saved.</p>
<p>A large family may consist of multiple generations, including a grandfather, twelve sons, and the children of the twelve sons. When the grandfather dies, the twelve sons, that is, the second generation, become the elders. There is no need for them to be appointed, because it is clear to everyone in the family. Likewise, when the church was established at Pentecost, three thousand souls were saved, and afterward another five thousand were saved. There was no need to appoint elders, because it was obvious to all the believers that Peter and the other eleven apostles were the elders. In every family the children know who the father is.</p>
<p>Concerning the appointment of elders, the Bible does not say that elders were appointed in the church in Jerusalem. The elders were produced spontaneously, and they were the twelve apostles. Like the father in a family, they did not need to be appointed. The Bible first speaks of the appointment of elders in Acts 14:21-23, where Paul and Barnabas appointed elders in the churches in Lystra, Iconium, and Antioch. When Paul and Barnabas first passed through these places, they preached the gospel and raised up churches. After less than a year, they returned to appoint elders in every church.</p>
<p>Elders were appointed in every place where there was a group of believers meeting together as the church. Even though the believers were young, they were the church. Paul and his co-workers could not remain in these places to care for the churches; they had to leave. Consequently, there was a need for some to take care of the local affairs, so it was necessary to appoint elders in the churches that had been established for less than one year. Hence, the elders appointed could not have been very mature. They must have been considered as elders because they were a little more mature than the other believers in their locality. In order to avoid confusion, the apostles appointed elders in the churches, even elders who were not very mature or experienced. They were appointed elders because they were more mature compared to the other saints.</p>
