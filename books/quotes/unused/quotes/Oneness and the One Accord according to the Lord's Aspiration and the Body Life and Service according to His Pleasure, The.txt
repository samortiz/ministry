Lord, may there be nothing whatsoever hidden or veiled within us, and may we not shrink back and hide from Your face
Clear out everything in us that has the poison and the bite of the serpent so that he can be trampled out of us
Visit us once again so that we would have more of Your glory within and would express more of Your magnificence without
If we only speak of oneness without speaking about the one accord, we may have only some high and great doctrines
If we add the one accord to the oneness, we are 'pulling the oneness down close to us,' like pulling a kite down from the sky
Not only among those outside of us, but even among us the oneness and the one accord have suffered a great loss
We can say that the oneness we talked about in the past did not touch the intrinsic nature of the oneness spoken of in the Bible
When one buys a suit or an appliance, the most important thing to consider is the substance, for the value depends first on the substance
The first time oneness was mentioned, it is related to the Father's name and the Father's life-the eternal life
When these three levels of oneness are fulfilled, the Lord Jesus' prayer for the oneness of the believers is accomplished
Since the first level of the oneness which the Lord desires originates from the Father as the source, there is no need for our own person
It is not a oneness of people clustering together and convinced by one another to have the same thought and opinion
The oneness the Lord wants is one in which we have the same source and the same life, taking the Father as the source and living by His life
The second level of oneness is the oneness of all the believers in the reality of the Father's sanctifying word
One saint confessed that his mind was not sharp and that he tended to forget about the things he read in the Bible
In fact, when we read the Lord's Word again and again, all the worldly matters in us are removed, and we are cleansed and sanctified
If we have God's word within, this word with God's reality will do a sanctifying work within us to separate us unto God, thus making us pure
The word of reality sanctifies us and delivers us from the mixed-up world, turning us back to the purity in God
Lastly, the third level of the oneness is the oneness of all the believers in the expression of the divine glory
Rather, it is the Father's divine life with the divine nature, expressing a kind of divine radiance and splendor
The second level of the oneness is in the reality of the Father's sanctifying word, delivering us from the world
Now the third level of the oneness is in the Fathers glory delivering us from ourselves and causing us to become fully one in the Triune God
The word 'agree' here, in the original language, means to be in a musical harmony; this is the practice of oneness
In the epistles, through the conditions manifested in the various local churches, the Lord shows us further what the one accord is
Corinthians 1:10 says that we have to speak the same thing and to be attuned in the same mind and the same opinion
The whole book of 1 Corinthians shows us that this same speaking is Christ, and the same mind and same opinion are also Christ
In our daily life, if we take Christ as our center and everything, what we speak, think, and understand will all be Christ
At the same time, the practice of this oneness is also according to the same speaking of the Spirit to the churches
Finally, the practice of oneness indicates that the seven churches as the seven lampstands are completely identical
Although they are distinct and self-contained, they are completely identical in nature, shape, function and expression
Since we are bearing the responsibility of the church, we should see the way for the church to receive grace and blessing
In the Old Testament, Psalm 133 says, 'Behold, how good and how pleasant it is for brethren to dwell together in unity!
Perhaps we do not speak evil words of reviling, but our speaking may be loose, and our opinions may be plentiful
If we would first consider and think a little before we speak and would ask if it is Christ or not, there would be no problem
The commanded blessing of the Lord, which is life forevermore, is upon the brethren dwelling together in oneness
Rather it is a perfected oneness by all of us being in the Fathers name and life in His word of reality and in His divinely expressed glory
In order for us to receive God's blessing, we must practice the oneness, and the way to practice the oneness is by the one accord
Based on this view of the genuine oneness, we mentioned that to practice the oneness, there must be the one accord
The light which the Lord gave us concerning the oneness of the believers can be considered the most thorough and deep
Although our Recovery Version has listed this oneness in a clear way in its outline, it has not emphasized it as much as we did this time
The foundation of the third level of the oneness is the Father's glory, which is the divine expression of the Father
John 17:2 says, 'Even as You gave Him authority over all flesh, that He may give eternal life to all whom You have given Him'
The Lord has not only given us the Father's name, the Father's life, and the Father's word, but has also given us the Father's glory
The Lord has given us four things: the Father's name, the Father's life, the Father's word, and the Father's glory
Seemingly, the oneness which the Lord prayed for in John 17 and the oneness of the Spirit which Paul described in Ephesians 4 are not alike
When we dive into these two passages of the Scripture, we can see that as far as the intrinsic element is concerned, they are the same
They also become the elements of this oneness, mingling with the saints to produce a fourth factor, which is the one Body
To put it simply, oneness is the result of the Triune God being mingled with His redeemed, regenerated, and transformed people
He spreads outward from our spirit to the mind in our soul, renewing and transforming our mind and resulting in our mind becoming life
Finally, this oneness will deliver us from the self so that there will be only God, and the splendid glory of divinity will be expressed
Many problems arose and even divisions were created as a result of man becoming the source and man's natural life being active
When we come to Ephesians 446 we see one Body one Spirit one Lord and One God and Father of all who is over all through all and in all
At the same time this Body is of one Lord and is constituted by one God and Father who is over all, through all, and in all
As soon as we were baptized, we were brought into an organic union with the Triune God to become living members of the Body of Christ
The purpose of us believers being members one of another in the Body of Christ is that we would live Christ and express Him together
They think it is all right as long as they love and fear the Lord and preach the gospel to bring others to salvation
For this reason, all of us members have to hold to truth in love that we may grow up into the Head, Christ, in all things
The word 'Head' here indicates that our growth in Christ should be a growth as members in the Body under the Head
When we grow into the Head in this way, we can produce out from the Head many functions for the building up of His Body
We can see that the gifts come through the Spirit, the ministries are initiated by the Lord, and the operations are of God
The Spirit manifests Himself in this way in all the members so that the Body of Christ will receive the profit
Other than the miraculous gifts of the Spirit, there are also the gifts that come from the growth in life of the members
There are two categories of gifts: the miraculous gifts of the Spirit and the gifts that come through the growth in life
We all need to see the genuine oneness, the proper one accord, and the expression and service of the Body of Christ
With this basic understanding, many of the problems among us can be avoided and much misunderstanding between each other can be removed
The reason we cannot be one or cannot be in one accord is because the view is short and the viewpoints are different
Although with difficulty we understand a little that the church is the Body of Christ, such a thing is not in our concept basically
The reason we have to thoroughly replace, according to the Bible, our past methods is that they have produced serious effects
As a result, a situation has evolved in which we do not have the name of a clergy-laity system, but in reality there is such a system
Although the system has been changed for a few years now, to this day we still dare not say that we have the Body service
The main emphasis of the change of system is on removing the minority and having all the members do everything
On a specified date, a big gospel meeting was called, and all the saints were mobilized to coordinate together
Because the light of the revelation was not strong enough, it was more an outward activity rather than an inward organic matter
There is still not much of an organic functioning that originates from within as a result of the saints seeing the revelation
In the last message, we said that the Triune God has been consummated to become the Spirit and that He is in our spirit
In this way, one by one they will walk according to the spirit and touch life, and they will spontaneously have an organic service
On the one hand, the Body is for the expression of Christ; on the other hand, it is for the corporate service to Christ
We have to see clearly that not only our service is a matter of the Body, but even our living is a matter of the Body
Is our loving of the Lord and being spiritual, sanctified, and overcoming something in ourselves or something in the Body?
Humanly speaking, it is better to be spiritual than not to be spiritual, and it is better not to commit sin than to commit sin
From the view of Gods eternal economy unless we are in the Body whether or not we are spiritual and whether or not we sin are not worth much
To live the Body life, first we must be under the Head and take the Head as the life, the principal object, and the center
By doing so, we will neither overestimate ourselves nor despise others, and we will not have any complaints or feel mistreated
In the matter of the authority in the Body, first and foremost is the need for the authority of the Head flowing throughout the whole Body
It is impossible for us to say that we are submitting to the authority of the Head without caring for the Body
If we would only submit to Christ, without submitting to the Body, that kind of submission will cause problems
If no one cares for the Body, but everyone considers that he is submitting to the Head directly, division will result in the Body
Only by our submitting to the Head on the one hand and to the Body on the other hand can the Head be pleased and the Body preserved
We should not only take the feeling of the Head as our feeling, but also do so in the principle of caring for the Body
If one member suffers, all the members suffer with it; if a member is glorified, all the members rejoice with it'
In order for us to have the Body life, we must care for our fellow members and must be full of feeling for the Body
Superficially speaking, one cannot find one clear phrase in the whole New Testament that mentions the service in the Body
If we put together the portions in the Scripture concerning service, we can see a clear picture of the Body service
We all know that we do not live for our living, but for our work, that is, for the accomplishment of something
When there is the proper and thorough perception of matters, the frame of mind is normal; otherwise, the frame of mind is not normal
Once we are built up, we become a 'hood''; and when this 'hood'' preaches the gospel, it is the Body preaching the gospel
Now, in places overseas, especially in the United States, the glimmer of the new way has gradually begun to appear
Unless it is the whole Body moving, and moving in coordination, the Lord's gospel will have no way on earth today
If you asked them to change back to the old way, to have one man speaking and all the rest listening, they would be unwilling to do so
Whoever accepts the new way becomes overcoming and rejoicing, and whoever opposes the new way becomes sad and dead
We like to, number one, preach the gospel to people, number two, introduce the truth, and number three, help people to know the Bible
Not only do we have to save the sinners, but we also have to feed them, as nursing mothers cherish their own babies
Eventually, everyone will be able to do the work of the ministry, which is the building up of the Body of Christ
The first step is the preaching of the gospel for the bringing in of the saved sinners to be offered up as sacrifices to God
The second step of offering is the nourishing of the believers that they may grow in life and may present themselves as sacrifices to God
We beseech them, according to Romans 12:1, by the compassions of God, so that they would present themselves as a living sacrifice to God
For this reason, Paul said that he was laboring and struggling according to the Lord's operation, which operated in him in power
