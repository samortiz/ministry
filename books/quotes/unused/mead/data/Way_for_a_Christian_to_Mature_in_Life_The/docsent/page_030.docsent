   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Five Being the Number of Responsibility</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In the Bible the number twelve indicates eternal perfection, whereas the number ten indicates human perfection.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Everyone has ten fingers and ten toes.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The Chinese speak of perfection, but the perfection that they refer to is human perfection.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The Lord divided the ten virgins into two groups of five.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The number five in the Bible is the number of responsibility.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>For example, each of our hands has five fingers.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Our fingers do not consist of three fingers plus two fingers but four fingers plus one thumb.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>This is very meaningful.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>If we took away our thumb, it would be difficult for us to do things with only our four fingers.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Whatever we do requires that we use our thumb along with our other four fingers.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The four fingers plus the one thumb enables us to work.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Hence, we can bear responsibility.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Some may ask what the addition of four plus one means.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>In the Bible the number four is the number related to created beings.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>There are four living creatures in the book of Revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>These four living creatures signify the created beings.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The number one signifies the unique God as the Creator.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The addition of four plus one signifies the created beings plus God the Creator.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Those who have not believed into the Lord and are not saved are merely creatures, created people.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Spiritually speaking, they are four but not four plus one.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>They do not have God and, thus, cannot work or bear responsibility.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Today, we who have believed in the Lord Jesus and are saved have had a one added to us.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The Spirit of God has entered into us, God Himself has entered into us, and His life has entered into us.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Hence, we the created people have had God added to us.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Since we have the life of God, we have become five.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>We have become useful and can work and bear responsibility.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The Lord divided up the ten virgins into two groups of five, indicating that they had been created and had God added to them.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>They were saved and had God in them.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Thus, they had to assume some responsibility.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>None of those who have been saved should receive grace in vain.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Since we have received the grace to have God, and since God is now living inside of us, we should bear some responsibility before God.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>It is all right for the unbelievers, who do not have God, to live their lives in a loose and sloppy way.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>But it is not acceptable at all for us Christians who have gained God and have God inside of us to live loosely and sloppily.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>If a person is not saved and does not have God inside of him, although he may not be watchful, God may leave him alone.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>But if you are saved and have God in you as your life and strength, and yet you still live a sloppy life as the unbelievers do, then the Lord will come to warn you.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The Lord Requiring the Saved Ones</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>to Bear the Responsibility to Be Prudent Virgins</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The Lord requires all of us who have been saved to bear a certain responsibility before God.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>What is this responsibility?</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>It is to be a prudent virgin.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Since we have been saved, we must bear the responsibility to choose whether we will be prudent believers or foolish believers.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Whether we are foolish or prudent is under our control.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>God will not decide for us.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The Prudent Virgins Preparing Oil in Their Vessels</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Some may ask what it means to be prudent.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The Lord said, For the foolish, when they took their lamps, did not take oil with them; but the prudent took oil in their vessels with their lamps Matt 25:3-4 .</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The Chinese Union Version uses the phrase prepare oil in its translation of this verse For the foolish, when they took their lamps did not prepare oil with them; but the prudent prepared oil in their vessels with their lamps.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>The foolish did not prepare, but the prudent did.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Those who prepared were the prudent ones, and those who did not prepare were the foolish ones.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>What did the prudent ones prepare?</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>They prepared the oil.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Both the foolish and the prudent virgins took their lamps.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>The difference was that the foolish ones did not prepare oil in their vessels, while the prudent ones did.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>The prudent ones prepared oil not only in their lamps but also in their vessels.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>The lamp is one thing, and the vessel is another thing.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>This parable tells us that every virgin should have two portions of oil one portion burning in the lamp and a second portion prepared in the vessel in addition to the portion in the lamp.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>This is similar to a car, which normally has a spare tire besides the four tires.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>The prudent virgins were truly prudent because they prepared oil in their vessels besides the oil in their lamps.</S>
