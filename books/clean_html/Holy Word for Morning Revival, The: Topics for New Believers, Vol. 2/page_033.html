<h2 class="head2">Twelve Descriptions of the Church:</h2>
<h2 class="head3">The Mystery of Christ</h2>
<p>The mystery of God in Colossians 2:2 is Christ; the mystery of Christ in Ephesians 3:4 is the church.<sup>194</sup> All the &ldquo;stories&rdquo; of God are related to Christ, and all the &ldquo;stories&rdquo; of Christ are related to the church. The church came out of Christ; the church is also the expression of Christ.<sup>195</sup> God is a mystery, and Christ, as the embodiment of God to express Him, is the mystery of God. Christ also is a mystery, and the church, as the Body of Christ to express Him, is the mystery of Christ. This mystery is God&rsquo;s economy, which is to dispense Christ, as the embodiment of God, into God&rsquo;s chosen people in order to produce a Body to be the increase of God&rsquo;s embodiment in Christ, that God may have a corporate expression.<sup>196</sup></p>
<h2 class="head3">The Masterpiece of God</h2>
<p>The Greek word [for <em>masterpiece</em> in Ephesians 2:10], <em>poiema,</em> means <em>something that has been made, a handiwork,</em> or <em>something that has been written or composed as a poem.</em> Not only a poetic writing may be considered a poem, but also any work of art that expresses the maker&rsquo;s wisdom and design. We, the church, the masterpiece of God&rsquo;s work, are a poem expressing God&rsquo;s infinite wisdom and divine design.</p>
<p>The heavens, the earth, and man, created by God, are not God&rsquo;s masterpiece; but the church, the Body of Christ, the fullness of the One who fills all in all (1:23), the corporate and universal new man (2:15), is a masterpiece.<sup>197</sup> This masterpiece of God was created in Christ through His death and resurrection with His divine element in its all-inclusiveness. This is why this masterpiece is a poem.<sup>198</sup> The phrase &ldquo;we are His masterpiece&rdquo; indicates that we are His best; there cannot be any better.<sup>199</sup></p>
<h2 class="head3">The Israel of God</h2>
<p>In the Old Testament God had a people to be His testimony, expressing Him. This was the nation of Israel. In the New Testament the real Israel of God is the church. &ldquo;Israel of God&rdquo; is the term Paul uses in Galatians 6:16.</p>
<p> There is today the nation of Israel. This is Israel in the flesh. It is not the real Israel. The real Israel of God today is the church. Thus there are two Israels: the one in the flesh, located in what was called Palestine, and the one in the Spirit, to which we belong. Paul tells us that as many as walk according to the rule of the new creation [which is to walk by the Spirit (5:25)] are the Israel of God.<sup>200</sup> They... express God&rsquo;s image, and execute God&rsquo;s authority, and are typified by Jacob, who was transformed into Israel, a prince of God and a victor (Gen. 32:27-28).<sup>201</sup></p>
<p>We are the Israel of God in spirit. All the blessings promised by God in the Bible are our portion because we are the church.<sup>202</sup></p>
<h2 class="head3">The Flock of God</h2>
<p>[In 1 Peter 5:2,] literally, the Greek word rendered &ldquo;flock&rdquo; is &ldquo;little flock.&rdquo; This refers to the church of God (Acts 20:28),<sup>203</sup> which is little in number (Luke 12:32) compared with the world. The church as the little flock is a little herb for the supply of life, not a big tree for birds to lodge in (Matt. 13:31-32 and notes), not a huge religion like Christendom.<sup>204</sup> In today&rsquo;s Christendom, there are many evil persons, evil things, and evil matters. Christendom has become a big tree producing no fruit, but having become a lodging place for so many evil things....Although Christianity has become a big tree, in Luke 12 the Lord Jesus called His church the &ldquo;little flock.&rdquo; We should not be in the big tree, but remain in the little flock.<sup>205</sup> [Here] as the Shepherd, He...feeds His flock.<sup>206</sup> Here one can find food and rest.<sup>207</sup></p>
