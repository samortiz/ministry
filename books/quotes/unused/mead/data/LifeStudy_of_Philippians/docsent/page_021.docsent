   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE CONTRAST BETWEEN CHRIST AND GAIN</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In verse 21 Paul says, For to me to live is Christ, and to die is gain.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In this verse we have a contrast between Christ and gain.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Some may think that the gain here refers to Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Although in a sense it may refer to Christ, it refers to Christ in a different way, not to the Christ we experience by living Him.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In a practical way, the gain in verse 21 is the presence of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>When Paul said, To die is gain, he meant that to die is to enjoy Christ s presence in a better way.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>In verse 23 Paul says that his desire is to depart and to be with Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>To be with Christ is a matter of degree, not of place.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>While Paul was desiring to be with Christ in a higher degree, he was already with Him continually.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Through his physical death, he would be with Christ to a fuller extent than he enjoyed in this earthly life.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>When Paul was in prison, he enjoyed Christ and experienced Him in two ways.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>One way was to enjoy the presence of Christ, and the other way was to live Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>There is a vast difference between enjoying the presence of Christ and living Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>For example, I may enjoy my wife s presence, but I cannot live her.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>By this we see that we may enjoy a person s presence without living that person.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Paul not only enjoyed the Lord s presence, but he also lived Him.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>He knew that when he died he would have no further opportunity to live Christ, but he would enter into a higher enjoyment of the presence of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Therefore, to die would be gain.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>What Paul valued was not only the presence of Christ, but also the opportunity to live Him.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Throughout the centuries, Christians have been encouraged to practice the presence of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>However, there has been little encouragement, if any, to live Him.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Many believers are familiar with the famous book The Practice of the Presence of God and have been encouraged by it to endeavor to live in God s presence.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>However, the concept of practicing the presence of God is mainly an Old Testament concept, not a New Testament one.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Yes, according to the New Testament, we may enjoy the Lord s presence on the one hand.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>But, on the other hand, we should practice living Him.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>We have not only the Lord s presence, but we also have His Person.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Not only do we need to be in His presence; we also need to be one person with Him and live Him.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>To live Christ is a much deeper experience than simply to be in His presence.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Living Him goes far beyond the enjoyment of His presence.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Do you intend just to practice the presence of Christ, or is it your desire also to live Christ?</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>To live the Lord is even better than to be with the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Yes, it is a gain to die and be with the Lord in a greater degree than on earth.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>But it is even better to live Him while we are on earth.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Probably you have thanked the Lord for His presence, but have you ever thanked Him for the experience of living Him?</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>It is easy for us to thank the Lord for the sweetness and loveliness of His presence.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Many have the habit of doing this.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Sometimes when I am about to utter such a thanksgiving to the Lord, I have the conviction within that I am simply following an Old Testament practice.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>I am then reminded of my need to live Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>First Corinthians 6:17 says, He that is joined unto the Lord is one spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>We are one spirit with the Lord not only that we may enjoy His presence, but even more that we live Him.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>But what Christians today are being instructed and helped to live Christ?</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>For years we have been helped to develop the habit of practicing the Lord s presence.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>This experience is on the first floor of the Christian life.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Now in the Lord s recovery we must go on to the second floor, to the practice of living Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>There certainly is a difference in verse 21 between living Christ and gaining a greater degree of His presence.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>I can testify that my preference is to live Christ and not just to gain a greater degree of His presence.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>FRUIT FROM WORK</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>In verse 22 Paul goes on to say, But if to live in the flesh, this to me is fruit from work, and what I shall choose I cannot tell.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>To a great extent, the word work has been spoiled.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Many Christians care only for a work; they do not care for Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>But Paul could speak of fruit from work.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Paul s use of the word fruit indicates that his work was actually his living.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>When Paul wrote to the Philippians, he was living in prison; he was not working.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>This indicates that his living was his work.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>From such a living work, fruit would come forth.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>The fruit of this work was Christ lived out, magnified, and ministered to others.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>The fruit of Paul s work was thus the transfusion of Christ into others.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Therefore, the fruit of work in verse 22 is the issue, the result, of Paul s living in prison.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Paul s living work was to minister Christ to others and to transfuse the Christ he magnified into them.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>As far as Paul was concerned, to die was to gain, but to live was to carry on such a living and fruitful work.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>It was difficult for him to choose between the two.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>This was the reason he said, What I shall choose I cannot tell.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>If you had to choose between the gain which comes from dying physically and the fruit which comes from a living work, what would be your choice?</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>I would definitely prefer to live in the flesh in order to carry on the living work of magnifying Christ and transfusing Him into others.</S>
