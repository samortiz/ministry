 <h1 class="series">CRYSTALLIZATION-STUDY OF THE GOSPEL OF GOD<br />
in the Epistle to the Romans</h1>
<h1 class="msg">Message Seven</h1>
<h1 class="title">The Structure of the Gospel of God&mdash;<br />
the Righteousness of God, the Life of Christ,<br />
and the Faith of the Believers<br />
(3)</h1>
<h1 class="title">The Essence of the Faith of the Believers<br />
(1)</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: John 3:15, 36; Gal. 2:20, 16; 3:22, 26; Rom. 3:22; Heb. 11:6</h1>
<h2 class="head1">OUTLINE</h2>
<ol class="upper-roman" start="3">
<li>The faith of the believers:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>The word <em>faith</em> bears two denotations:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>The first denotation refers to the things the believers believe in; it is the objective faith&mdash; Eph. 4:13; 1 Tim. 1:19b; 2 Tim. 4:7.</li>
		<li>The second denotation refers to the believing action of the believers; this is the subjective faith&mdash;Gal. 2:20.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>The faith of the believers is actually not their own faith but Christ entering into them to be their faith&mdash;Rom. 3:22 and note 1; Gal. 2:16 and note 1:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>When they repent unto God, the pneumatic Christ as the sanctifying Spirit of God (1 Pet. 1:2a) moves within them to be their faith by which they believe on the Lord Jesus (Acts 16:31).</li>
		<li>By such a faith:
			<ol class="lower-alpha">
			<li>They believe that God raised Jesus Christ from the dead that they may be saved&mdash; Rom. 10:9b-10a; 5:1.</li>
			<li>They have the access into the grace in which they stand&mdash;Rom. 5:2.</li>
			</ol></li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>Eventually, all three, the righteousness of God, the life of Christ, and the faith of the believers, become the all-inclusive Christ. Hence, this all-inclusive Christ is not only the center but also the structure of the dynamic salvation of God.</li>
	<li>The importance of faith:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>Without faith it is impossible to please God&mdash; Heb. 11:6a.</li>
		<li>He who comes forward to God must believe that God is&mdash;Heb. 11:6b.</li>
		</ol></li>
	</ol></li>
</ol>
<p>I treasure this gathering, because for years I have been expecting to have this kind of meeting so that I could release all the depths of the holy Word, the essence of every critical point in the holy Word. For many years the Lord has not prepared the environment with the proper people for this kind of gathering until today. I am so happy. This is after speaking to the saints in the United States for thirty-two years. Through all of these messages, the Lord has shown us the depths of the holy Word in all its critical points.</p>
