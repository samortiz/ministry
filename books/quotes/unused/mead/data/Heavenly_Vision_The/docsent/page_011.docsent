   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE UNIQUE ONENESS OF THE CHURCH</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>THE PROPER GROUND OF THE CHURCH</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>We also need a vision of the unity of the church, a vision of the unique oneness of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>When we speak here of the unity of the church, we speak of the unique unity, the only unity.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>In the Presbyterian denomination there may be a unity, and in the Methodist denomination there may also be a unity.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>But neither of these unities is the unique unity, the only unity.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Rather, the unity of the Presbyterian denomination and the unity of the Methodist denomination are each a unity among many unities.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>What we need to see is the unique unity, not the unity among unities.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The unique unity, the unique oneness, of the church involves what we call the ground of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>In ancient times the people of Israel had a unique unity in the good land of Canaan, with Jerusalem as its center.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>At that time the people of Israel were one.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>With them there was not more than one unity there was the unique unity.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The situation changed when the people of Israel were carried away into captivity.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Most of them were carried away to Babylon, but some were carried away to Assyria and to Arabia.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The people were scattered, and as a result they lost their unique unity.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Suppose some of those in Babylon had said, "As the people of God, we have to be one.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Let us come together to practice unity."</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>They would have had a unity, but it would have been not the unique unity but the unity in Babylon.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Suppose those who had been carried away to Assyria and to Arabia had done the same thing.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Then in addition to the unity in Babylon there would have been the unity in Assyria and the unity in Arabia.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Each group would have had its own unity, but none of these unities would have been the genuine, unique unity.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>After seventy years some faithful ones, who stood with the Lord and took His word, went back to Jerusalem, and there they started to practice, to recover, the lost unity.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The unity they practiced was the unique unity, the only unity.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Thus, after the dispersion of the people of Israel and the return of the faithful ones, there were many unities, but only the unity in Jerusalem was the unique unity.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The others were not the real unity; they were unities as divisions.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Actually, those so-called unities were divisions.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Only the unity in Jerusalem was the unique, the only, unity.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>From this we see that there is only one ground for unity.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>If we have more than this one ground, the unity will be broken.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The only ground for unity is the proper ground of unity.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The proper ground of the unity of the church, therefore, is the ground of the unique unity.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>This is not the unity of the various denominations or groups; it is simply the unity of the church expressed in the places, the localities, where the saints are.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>When we say that the church is expressed in the place where the saints are, we need to define what we mean by place.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>What is the limit of this place?</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The limit is not a house nor a street.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>In the New Testament there are no street churches or avenue churches.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Today, however, so-called churches are designated by a street or an avenue.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Some might say, "In the Bible there are no street churches, but there are house churches."</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Concerning house churches or home churches we need to be careful.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Yes, the New Testament does mention the church in the house of certain saints Rom 16:5a; Col 4:15-16 .</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>If we read the New Testament carefully, we will see that in these cases the church in the house was the same in limit as the church in the city.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>In other words, the limit of the house church was equal to the city.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The church in that house was the church in that locality, in that city.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Therefore, we cannot have a street church, nor an avenue church, nor a church on a college campus, nor a church in a house that is not also the church in the city.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>According to the New Testament we can have only a city church, that is, the church in the city where we are.</S>
