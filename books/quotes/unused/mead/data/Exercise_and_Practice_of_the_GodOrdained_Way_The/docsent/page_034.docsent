   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE EXERCISE AND PRACTICE OF THE GOD-ORDAINED WAY MESSAGE TEN LEARN TO BE HUMAN Scripture Reading: Isa 49:15; 1 Tim 5:1-3</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>God's unit of salvation is the household Luke 19:5, 9; Acts 16:31; 1 Cor 1:16a .</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>We have to learn to be human in order to take care of such a household.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>If we remain in our natural man, this will be a very difficult task.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>In our natural, old man we do not have a tendency to love anyone but ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>We do not love the elderly, the middle-aged, the young, the children, or even the infants.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Many Christians will admit that they really loved no one but themselves before they were saved.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Some may argue that many young people love each other when they are engaged to be married.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>But why would so many separate or divorce after marriage?</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>They separate from each other or become divorced because marriage no longer fits into their self-interest.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Separation and divorce are expressions of self-love.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>While they are dating, a young couple may express great love toward each other.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Eventually, the real love, self-love, becomes expressed.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>One may say, "I am yours.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>I belong to you."</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Later it becomes obvious that actually he cares only for himself.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>PROPER CARE FOR THE UNIT OF GOD'S SALVATION</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>To properly care for the unit of God's salvation, we must love every member of that household.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>We have to love every man and woman, from the oldest to the youngest.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>It may be that the little children in a certain home are naughty or unruly.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Consequently, we may want nothing to do with them.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>But if we do not take proper care of such children, their parents may become offended with us and reject the gospel of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>If we are going to gain the whole household, we must learn to love every kind of person who is a part of that household strong, weak, healthy, sick, young, old, and even the infants.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>In 1955 and 1957, we invited Brother T. Austin-Sparks to visit us in Taiwan.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>At that time, he was close to seventy years of age.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>He told us that according to his experience he had learned that every mother considers her child to be either the most beautiful or the most handsome.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>If she has a girl, that is the most beautiful girl on earth.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>If she has a boy, that is the most handsome boy on earth.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Many mothers brought their children to meet Brother Sparks.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>If the child was beautiful, he would say so to the mother.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>But if the child was not beautiful, he realized that he would offend the mother by saying such a thing to her.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The mother would also be offended if he said nothing.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>So he handled the situation by saying, "Oh, what a child!"</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>When the mother heard this expression, she was very pleased.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>When we go to visit households with the gospel of Christ, we must learn not to be offensive to them.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Rather, we must learn to take care of their needs.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>If we are unwise, the parents' hearts may be damaged, and the door within them will be closed to us.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Further words from us will find no entrance or penetration.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>THE NEED FOR PREPARING OURSELVES TO VISIT HOUSEHOLDS</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>We all have to learn how to get ourselves prepared to preach the gospel to the whole household.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Even our gestures should invite their respect.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Before we speak something, our gesture or actions should stir up a respect in them toward us.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>We may be talking to a young adult in the family, yet we may affect an older adult in the same family by our actions.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>This may open up the older one to receive the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>At the proper time, that one may be ready to talk with us because a respect has been created by the manner in which we have visited the household.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>From this kind of example, we can realize that to preach the gospel to a family requires much learning.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>How a particular household would be opened to us depends upon our behavior, our manner of speaking, and the attitude we express to all the members of that household.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>If we really mean business for the Lord, we will have a desire to gain the whole household for His purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>We must be very human with them in order to gain them for the Lord.</S>
