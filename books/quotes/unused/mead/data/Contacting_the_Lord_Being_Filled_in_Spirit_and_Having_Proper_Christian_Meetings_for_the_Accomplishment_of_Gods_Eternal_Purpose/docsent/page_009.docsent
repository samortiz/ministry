   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE WAY TO BE FILLED WITH THE SPIRIT</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>AND TO BECOME GENUINE SPIRITUAL MEN CONTACTING THE LORD</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>IN A DEFINITE AND PREVAILING WAY</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Since our need today is to be filled and saturated with the Spirit, we must consider what we need to do in order to experience the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The Lord s Word reveals that on God s side everything is ready.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>God is ready and is waiting for us.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>We need to do something, but what is it that we need to do?</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The first thing we must do is to go to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>To do this we need to learn how to contact the Lord in a definite and prevailing way.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>I am afraid that many believers have been praying for a number of years and have spent much time reading the Word but have never contacted the Lord in a definite and prevailing way.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Thus, we need to consider at length how to contact the Lord in this way.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>I was born into a semi-Christian family.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>My family was about fifty percent Christian and fifty percent Buddhist.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>At a young age I began to study at Christian schools and was thereby brought into the realm of Christianity.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>I was exposed to Christianity, but I was not saved.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>In fact, I did not like Christianity at all.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>When I was nineteen years old, I heard an announcement that a young, twenty-five year old lady was coming to my town to hold a public gospel campaign.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>This surprised me greatly, and I decided that I would go to one of the meetings to see what it was all about.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>At the first meeting the Lord met me.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>I went to the meeting not to see the Lord but to see if anything strange would happen there, but when I got there, the Lord met me, and I was saved.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>In fact, I was saved in a prevailing way.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>After receiving the Lord, I thought that I needed to begin to behave like a Christian.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>In my mind this meant that I needed to be good and religious.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>With this concept, I began to read and study the Scriptures, and I also sought out a place where I could obtain the best knowledge concerning the Scriptures.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>After finding such a place, I studied the Bible and learned the Scriptures there for seven years.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Day after day and week after week I prayed and attended the meetings, but within I was dead.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>One day in August 1931 the Lord spoke within me.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>He asked me, What are you doing here?</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Are you living or dead?</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>What kind of Christian are you?</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>This was a real crisis for me.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The very next day I went up to a little mountain close to my home to pray.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>I went there early in the morning and knelt down and cried out to the Lord, saying, Lord, be merciful to me!</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>There must be something wrong with me.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Week after week I attend Christian meetings, study the Word, and pray, but I am still so dead and weak, and for many years I have not brought one soul to You.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>When I cried out in this way, the Holy Spirit flooded through me like a mighty tide.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>I realized that I was sinful, dirty, and rebellious.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>I cannot describe how I felt at that time.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>I simply prostrated myself on the ground and told the Lord, Lord, I am sinful.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>I am the most sinful person in the whole world.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>As I confessed to the Lord in this way, tears came down my face.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Later, as I was on my way down the mountain, I was filled with happiness, joy, peace, and a heavenly feeling.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>At that time I did not know where I was.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>I could not tell if I was in the heavens or on the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>From that day on, for more than seven months I rose up early every morning and went up to that mountain.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Day by day I went up to the mountain to pray to the Lord in a living way.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>During this time it was easy for me to meet the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>I would read the Word, pray, and call upon the Lord in a living way.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Sometimes when I would call upon the Lord, I had to stop calling because tears would be pouring down my face.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>For seven months I went up to the mountain by myself to pray in this way.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>I was just a young person at the time, and no one could understand me.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>My family thought that there was something wrong with me and even wondered whether something had happened to my mind.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>They realized that there had been a great change in my life.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>After seven months of praying in this way, I learned the difference between being religious and being spiritual, between reading the Scriptures with the mind and reading the living Word of God with the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>After seven months of praying to the Lord every morning on the mountain, something else very wonderful happened the Lord began His ministry through me.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>A few years before that time the pastor of our denomination had asked me to give a sermon on the Lord s Day during the morning service.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>I was only around twenty-three years old at the time.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>For an entire week before that day on which I was to give the sermon, I worked on my sermon.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>I wrote down notes concerning all the points on which I would speak, and when the time came for me to give my sermon, I spoke from the platform according to the notes that I had prepared.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Although I had written everything down, I still missed several points that I had intended to cover.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Years later, when the Lord began to use me to minister for Him and opened the way for me to begin speaking for Him, my first thought was to write down all my points on a piece of paper as I had done before.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Initially, I tried to do this, but eventually, I found out that this way does not work.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Once I discovered this, I dropped this way and simply began to speak from my spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>At that time I learned that there are two ways to speak.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>One way is to speak from memory, from the mind, which does not work.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>The other way is to speak from the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>God s desire is that all His people would be genuinely spiritual.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>However, in order for us to become spiritual, we all need to have at least one time when we come to the Lord and are met by Him in a definite way.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>We must come to the Lord in a definite, purposeful way, not to pray for various things but to meet the Lord and to be met by Him.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>We must tell the Lord, Lord, here I am.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>I am ready to be searched by You.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>I am ready for You to meet me, break me, and speak to me.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>I am ready.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>Lord, here I am.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>We all need to go to the Lord and have such a time with Him at least once in our life.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>Thus far we have considered our need to spend time with the Lord in the morning to practice contacting Him in a living way by reading His Word and praying in a prevailing way.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>We all need to do this, and it is absolutely right for us to do this.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>However, in order for our morning time with the Lord to be successful, we must first do one thing.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>We must go to the Lord to have a definite time in which we allow Him to search us, enlighten us, and meet us.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>We must go to the Lord in a purposeful and definite way to have such a time.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>We have no choice, and we cannot argue when it comes to this matter.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>If we desire to be normal, living, and spiritual Christians, we must go to the Lord in this way.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>If we do this and are met by the Lord in a definite way, what will be the result?</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>The result will be that we will be filled with the Holy Spirit, and there will be a great change in our life.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>We will realize that to be a Christian is to be in the spirit and that the Christian life is absolutely a matter in the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>All genuine believers have been regenerated, and all true Christians have the Spirit within them.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>However, most believers have never been truly filled with the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>They have not been occupied, possessed, and saturated with the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>This is our great need.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>Christians today, especially those in America, do not need more teachings or doctrines.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>They already have plenty of both.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>The primary need of Christians today is to be filled and saturated with the Spirit in a living way.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>The reason many believers are not satisfied with their present condition, church life, prayer life, and gospel preaching is that they have not been filled and saturated with the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>There are not many reasons; there is only this one reason.</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>Our greatest need today is to experience the infilling and outpouring of the Spirit, and the only way for us to receive this experience is to go to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>We must go to the Lord and allow Him to meet us in a definite way.</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>Once we have been met by the Lord in a definite way, I believe that the Lord will meet us again and again morning by morning.</S>
   <S PAR='98' RSNT='1' SNO='98'>May we all pray prevailingly and go to the Lord in a definite way that we may be brought into this experience.</S>
   <S PAR='99' RSNT='1' SNO='99'>QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS</S>
   <S PAR='100' RSNT='1' SNO='100'>Question: Can going to the Lord in the way that you are speaking of and praying in such a prevailing way be considered complete surrender?</S>
   <S PAR='101' RSNT='1' SNO='101'>Answer: This matter surely includes complete surrender.</S>
   <S PAR='102' RSNT='1' SNO='102'>We simply need to go to the Lord at least one time in our life and tell Him, Lord, I am not here to ask anything of You.</S>
   <S PAR='103' RSNT='1' SNO='103'>I am just here.</S>
   <S PAR='104' RSNT='1' SNO='104'>Lord, search me, enlighten me, and bring me into Your presence and light.</S>
   <S PAR='105' RSNT='1' SNO='105'>If you pray in such a way, the Lord will honor your prayer, and He will bring you into His presence and light.</S>
   <S PAR='106' RSNT='1' SNO='106'>When He does this, you will realize your faults and sinfulness.</S>
   <S PAR='107' RSNT='1' SNO='107'>Then when you confess them before the Lord, He will cleanse, purge, and search you.</S>
   <S PAR='108' RSNT='1' SNO='108'>As you open in this way, you will have some sense within as to what you should pray.</S>
   <S PAR='109' RSNT='1' SNO='109'>Simply follow this inner sense and utter your prayer to the Lord according to it.</S>
   <S PAR='110' RSNT='1' SNO='110'>Through this kind of prayer we breathe out all our filthiness and breathe in the Lord s riches.</S>
   <S PAR='111' RSNT='1' SNO='111'>Question: Have you ever been afraid of what the Spirit might do if you opened yourself to Him in this way?</S>
   <S PAR='112' RSNT='1' SNO='112'>Answer: There is no need for us to be afraid.</S>
   <S PAR='113' RSNT='1' SNO='113'>Matthew 7:11 says, If you then being evil know how to give good gifts to your children, how much more will your Father who is in the heavens give good things to those who ask Him!</S>
   <S PAR='114' RSNT='1' SNO='114'>This is the Lord s promise to us.</S>
   <S PAR='115' RSNT='1' SNO='115'>He will give us only good things when we ask.</S>
   <S PAR='116' RSNT='1' SNO='116'>Moreover, if we seek the Lord with a sincere heart, a right spirit, and a pure motive, the Lord will surely keep, guard, and protect us.</S>
   <S PAR='117' RSNT='1' SNO='117'>All those who desire to enter into the real Christian life and church life, to have the prevailing preaching of the gospel, and to realize the genuine testimony of the Lord Jesus in their city must be filled with the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='118' RSNT='1' SNO='118'>It is not difficult to receive this filling, so there is no need to worry.</S>
   <S PAR='119' RSNT='1' SNO='119'>We simply need to go to the Lord in a definite way to be met by Him.</S>
   <S PAR='120' RSNT='1' SNO='120'>May the Lord bring us all into such an experience and bring us from being good and religious men to being genuine spiritual men.</S>
