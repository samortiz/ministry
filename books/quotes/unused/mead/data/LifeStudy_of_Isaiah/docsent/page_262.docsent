   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>A. As the Complete God to Become a Perfect Man</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>As the complete God, signified by the arm of Jehovah, the power of God v. 1b; 1 Cor 1:24 , Christ became a perfect man, signified by a man of sorrows v. 3a; John 1:1, 14; 1 Tim 2:5b . The Old Testament term is the arm of Jehovah, whereas the New Testament term is the power of God.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>First Corinthians 1:22-24 says, "For indeed Jews require signs and Greeks seek wisdom, but we preach Christ crucified, to Jews a stumbling block, and to Greeks foolishness, but to those who are called, both Jews and Greeks, Christ the power of God and the wisdom of God."</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In these verses Christ crucified corresponds to the man of sorrows in Isaiah 53:3, and the power of God equals the arm of Jehovah in Isaiah 53:1.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Thus, in these two portions of the Word, incarnation is clearly mentioned.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>B. As a Perfect Man to Live</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>a Lowly and Sorrowful Human Life</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>As a perfect man, Christ lived a lowly and sorrowful human life.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>His birth was lowly, and His family also was in a lowly state.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>His living was also full of sorrow.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>1.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Growing Up like</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>a Tender Plant before Jehovah,</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>and like a Root out of Dry Ground</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>First, He grew up like a tender plant like a small, delicate person before Jehovah Isa 53:2a .</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The plant here actually refers to a sprout, which is very tender, small, and delicate.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Christ did not grow up like a large tree, but like a small, delicate sprout.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Because He was such, no one would pay any attention to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>He also grew up like a root out of dry ground, meaning that He was born of a poor family.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>His mother, Mary, and her husband, Joseph, lived in a despised city called Nazareth, in a despised region, Galilee.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>It is true that they were descendants of David, but David reigned approximately one thousand years before Jesus was born.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>When Mary and Joseph came into being, the royal family had become insignificant.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>In Isaiah 11:1 the royal family of Jesse was likened to the stump of a tree.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>From that stump a sprout, Christ, came out.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Hence, His birth was very lowly.</S>
