   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Having Organic Small Groups</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Following this, we have to go on to consider how the small group meetings should be conducted.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>According to the organic practice of the new way, the small group meetings must be organic.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In order to show you what is organic, I must first show you another blueprint of what it is to be non-organic.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The non-organic way is the way of a worship service.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>A worship service is for worshipping God.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>This is good.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>But the set of religious formalities that have to be carried out is not good.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The meetings in Christianity, especially the worship hour on the Lord s Day, whether in the West or in the East, all consist of some prescribed procedures and programs.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Before the meeting, a printed program that was prepared ahead of time is passed out to every attendant.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>On it is printed the name of the leader of the songs, the prayers, the reading of the Scriptures, and the names of the preachers.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>All these activities are performed by the professionals who have been trained.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The congregation has nothing to do.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>They only sit there.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>There is no need to labor, and everyone is spared the trouble.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>This kind of worship neither affords the enlightening, the supply, nor the edification or the perfecting, much less the building up of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>This is a vain worship service, and it annuls God s eternal purpose and the New Testament economy.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>What then is not a worship service?</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>To be organic is opposed to a worship service.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The small group meeting has to be organic.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>It should not be in the way of a worship service.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>However, I must say that even today, at least over half of our small groups are still in the way of a worship service rather than in an organic way.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Most of the small group meetings have a set time for starting the meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>When the time comes, the people come and sit.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>They look at the clock and at the leading brothers.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>After a while, some brother calls a hymn for singing.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Then some prayers follow.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>After the prayers, everyone waits for one another again.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Gradually, some reluctantly begin to say something.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>At a certain point, a brother would say that now is the time for sharing.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Only then will everyone share a little.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>In the end, all the meetings follow the same pattern.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Although there is no program sheet, in reality the programs are all there.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The only difference is that they are not printed.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Although there are the prayers, the fellowship, the mutual care, the studying of the truth, and the enlightening in life, the way is still that of the worship service.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>There is the lack of the organic flavor.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Even when there is some organic flavor, it is very weak.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Rejecting the Worship Service,</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>but Having Everyone Functioning</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The real small group is organic.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>It is not a worship service.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Organically speaking, the small group meeting begins at the latest from our homes.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>From that time on, we begin to pray.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>While we are on the way, we rejoice and praise.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>It is like what the psalmist says, that we are glad when others say to us, let us go into the house of the Lord Psa 122:1 .</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>When we arrive at the meeting place, we do not care whether there are people there already; we simply begin to pray and to praise.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>If other brothers and sisters come in, they spontaneously join in. Some can also give testimonies or discuss questions related to the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Another may come in with problems which he opens up in fellowship for mutual intercession and help.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>This kind of meeting does not follow a set rule.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Everything is organic.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Any question can be raised up in this meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>The answers should not come from some specialists.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Every attendant is a learner, and every attendant is also a teacher.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>The amount one speaks depends on the amount he has.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>But everyone has something.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Hence, every one should share that little bit that he has.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>When sharing his portion, no one should give long stories, and no one should take up too much time.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>If a question is raised up, and there are seven or eight answers with a word of some weight and experience at the end, the whole thing will only take about ten minutes, and the question will be thoroughly discussed.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>If it is a question that concerns the truth, everyone will have learned something.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>If it is one that concerns life, everyone will be stirred up to pursue after it.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>When a new one attends this kind of meeting ten times or more, he will also become organic in less than three months.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>In this kind of small group meetings, every attendant is living.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Spontaneously, everyone will be a priest.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>The gospel is preached, the new ones are brought in, the questions are answered, the truth is learned, and there is mutual fellowship and care.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Hence, within one small group meeting, everything is there; the content is all-inclusive.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>For this reason, a small group meeting should last for at least an hour and half.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>If it is shorter, it will not be a good meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>I am describing a little to you to show you that the small group meeting is not a worship service.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>It is a picture of the daily life of a Christian.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>It is natural, and it is not peculiar at all.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Today I have to cry out aloud and declare that the Lord Jesus worked on earth for three and a half years.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Not once did He attend a worship service.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Never did He call a meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>Rather, He was conducting a small group in an organic way.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>This small group comprised the twelve disciples, with Peter, James, and John being among them.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>He did not have a set date of meeting, nor did He have a set time and place.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>He was living together with the disciples, teaching and leading them along the way.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>If you do not understand what an organic small group is, just look at what the Lord Jesus did with the disciples during the three and a half years and you will understand.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>Today, for the sake of convenience, our meeting should have a proper date, time, and place.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>But we should not bring in elements of a worship service.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>Do not come together for a worship service and at the same time neglect your living.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>We are not Christians for a worship service.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>We are Christians for a living.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>When we, the ordinary Christians, come together to meet with no intention of having a worship service and having no set procedures, all the brothers and sisters who attend will have the opportunity to develop the spiritual function within them.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>In this way, meeting by meeting, we will receive some good perfecting, and the gifts will be developed Eph 4:11-12 .</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>In the end, everyone will be able to do what he is supposed to do.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>In the past, the old system of meeting did not afford the Holy Spirit the opportunity to develop the gifts within the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>At the same time, it annulled the spiritual function of the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>It only caused people to sit through the meetings with their mouths shut, listening to others speaking, while they themselves never had their spiritual gifts developed.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>Now we have the organic practice of the new way.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>All the opportunities are there before everyone.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>Whosoever will can make it.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>There is something within everyone.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>As long as they will speak meeting by meeting, sooner or later, everything will be manifested.</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>Every time we have this organic small group meeting, everyone learns, and everyone teaches.</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>You will perfect me, and I will perfect you.</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>In the end, everyone will open their mouths, and everyone will become useful.</S>
