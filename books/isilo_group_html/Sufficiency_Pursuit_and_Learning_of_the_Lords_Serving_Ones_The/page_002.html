<h1 class="title">TWO PROBLEMS FACING<br />
THE LORD&rsquo;S SERVING ONES&mdash;<br />
BEING DISCOURAGED AND BEING PROUD</h1>
<h2 class="head1">ASKING THE LORD TO INCREASE OUR FAITH</h2>
<p>Luke 17:5-10 says, &ldquo;The apostles said to the Lord, Increase our faith. But the Lord said, If you have faith like a mustard seed, you would have said to this sycamine tree, Be uprooted and be planted in the sea; and it would have obeyed you. But which of you, having a slave who is plowing or tending sheep, will say to him when he has come in from the field, Come immediately and recline at table? Will he not rather say to him, Prepare something that I may dine, and gird yourself and serve me until I eat and drink; and after that you will eat and drink? He does not thank the slave because he did the things which were ordered, does he? So also you, when you do all the things which are ordered you, say, We are unprofitable slaves; we have done what we ought to have done.&rdquo; This portion of the Word does not say that &ldquo;the disciples&rdquo; said to the Lord but that &ldquo;the apostles&rdquo; said to the Lord. The speakers were in a position of service. They were apostles, serving ones; they were not merely disciples, saved ones. The serving ones asked the Lord to increase their faith. The Lord replied that if their faith was the size of a mustard seed, they could tell a sycamine tree to be uprooted and planted in the sea, and it would obey them. Then the Lord told them a parable. On the surface, the parable seems unrelated to what was being discussed. However, verse 7 begins with the conjunction <em>but.</em> This shows that the two portions are related.</p>
<p>This portion of the Bible is simple and uses plain words, but most Bible readers admit that it is rather difficult to grasp the meaning in these verses. This portion begins with the apostles chosen by the Lord, His serving ones, asking to have their faith increased. The Lord did not answer them regarding how to increase their faith. Rather, He spoke of the effectiveness of having faith the size of a mustard seed. The Lord continued by speaking of slaves who, after plowing the land, tending the sheep, and doing many things, could not take credit for anything before their master. They needed to learn to serve the master so that he would be satisfied. Not only so, they should have the sense, the attitude, that they are unprofitable slaves. It is not easy to understand the meaning of this portion, even after reading it many times. Only after we have some experience in the Lord&rsquo;s work, in the service, can we understand the meaning of this portion.</p>
<p>The main purpose of this portion is to show that a person who is chosen by God to serve Him should not be discouraged; that is, he should learn to have faith. He should learn to believe. Believing saves us from being discouraged. As those who serve the Lord, we often encounter a discouraging situation. Sometimes we feel that we have not received a burden from the Lord, or we lament that we do not see the result of our work. As a result, many serving ones are discouraged instead of being strong and happy.</p>
<p>If we are always discouraged, we will be inwardly disturbed and continually ask the Lord to increase our faith. When the apostles asked the Lord to increase their faith, they seemed to be saying that they were not able to serve because they were short of faith. Hence, they asked the Lord to increase their faith. Instead of telling them how they could increase their faith, the Lord said that as long as they had faith, that was good enough. The apostles&rsquo; concern was that their faith was too small, but the Lord&rsquo;s concern was related to their thought concerning the absence of faith. The Lord seemed to be saying, &ldquo;As long as you have faith, even if it is as small as a mustard seed, you can tell this sycamine tree to be uprooted and planted in the sea, and it will obey you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This word shows that those who serve the Lord do not need to ask Him to increase their faith. They only need to see that there is something in them called faith. Therefore, they should not say, &ldquo;My faith is too small.&rdquo; Christians often say, &ldquo;Please pray for me so that my faith would be increased.&rdquo; In these verses the Lord does not touch the size of our faith. Instead, the Lord points out that we have faith. It was not possible for the apostles not to have faith, nor is it possible for those whom the Lord has called not to have faith. Perhaps we consider that our faith is small, but the Lord&rsquo;s reply to the apostles shows that even a small measure of faith is sufficient. We must believe the Lord&rsquo;s word. We need to see that we do not need to increase our faith. We simply need to have faith. Every believer has faith.</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_001.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_003.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>The Sufficiency, Pursuit, and Learning of the Lord's Serving Ones &nbsp; pg 2</div><br></body></html>
