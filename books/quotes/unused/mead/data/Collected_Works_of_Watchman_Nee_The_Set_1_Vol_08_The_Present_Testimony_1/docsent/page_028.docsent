   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>A LETTER ON BEHALF OF THE EDITOR By Ruth Lee Issue No. 8</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Thank the Lord that He has not disappointed us.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>This eighth issue of The Present Testimony has not been published with too much delay.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Dear readers, we do wish you to know how much hope we cherish in our prayers every time The Present Testimony is sent out!</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>We do not want the truths of God to be stored only in the heads of men, nor to be always displayed on bookshelves.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Rather, we want them to be assimilated into the human spirit and to be manifested in human living.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Hence, although every issue contains only a few pages, the messages therein are important.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>We hope that with every issue you receive you do not merely read through it, but rather spend time to comprehend it in depth.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>It is not simply by knowing the truth that it becomes yours.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Rather, it is after you have experienced the truth that you obtain its deliverance and freedom.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Although Brother Nee has been resting according to God's will during the past few months, he is still responsible for the messages in The Present Testimony.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Therefore, please continue to pray for him so that the ninth issue of The Present Testimony can be ready soon.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>It seems as if we have become completely silent on our end!</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Many concerned brothers and sisters have inquired about us.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>All we can say is that during these few months, some brothers and sisters continue to travel around for gospel work, the literature work continues, and the music score for the Little Flock Hymnal is being prepared, but we have no new work to report to you.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>We are now praying.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>If we receive any definite revelation from God concerning our work in the future, and when there is the need to inform you of our work, we will report to you.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>May 18, 1929</S>
