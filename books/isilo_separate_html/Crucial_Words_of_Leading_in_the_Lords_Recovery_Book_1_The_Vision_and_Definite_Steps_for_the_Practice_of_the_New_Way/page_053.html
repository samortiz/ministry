DISPENSING FOOD AT THE PROPER TIME</h2>
<p>Concerning the home meetings, we must pay attention to three things. First, all the elders, co-workers, and full-timers should learn to minister God&rsquo;s word to the home meetings at every opportune time. However, do not try to preach; that will only lead to failure. Do not try to be big. If there are only three people in a home meeting, do not be disappointed. Even if there are only two people&mdash;or even one person&mdash;we should still not be discouraged. Always minister a little of God&rsquo;s word and render others some timely help. This is what the Lord meant when He spoke of dispensing food at the proper time (Matt. 24:45).</p>
<p>Second, we need to prepare ourselves ahead of time for the home meetings. Do not prepare a long message. Rather, look to the Lord and seek Him. We should be prepared to speak only the few words that we have enjoyed that day. Some people will not be saved even if we deliver two or three long messages to them. Other people are saved when we speak to them only for five minutes. Do not go into a long discourse in the home meetings. Rather speak with wisdom by addressing the peoples&rsquo; need. We can cover some of the <em>New Believers&rsquo; Lessons</em> if we have a newly saved person, but with the unbelievers we should speak something about the gospel.</p>
<p>Third, even after we have prepared something, we should not take up all the time. Rather, allow the brothers and sisters to speak. We should supplement their speaking only when they run out of things to say. This will give them the opportunity to learn.</p>
<h2 class="head1">BELIEVING IN THE LORD&rsquo;S TIMING</h2>
<p>We must believe that every home meeting will survive. In order for that to happen, we must endeavor with our all, but for what should we endeavor? We should endeavor to give &ldquo;injections,&rdquo; to fight the adverse environment, and to supply nutrition, which is the Lord&rsquo;s word, in order for the saints to grow. We must believe that not only every word in the Bible is God&rsquo;s word but that all the truths we have released according to the Bible are also the Lord&rsquo;s present speaking. As long as it is the Lord&rsquo;s word, His Spirit will bear witness to it with His work. The Lord&rsquo;s Spirit delights in working upon and strengthening His own word. The minute we speak the Lord&rsquo;s word, His Spirit will follow such a word with His work, and there will surely be the result.</p>
<p>I believe the words that I have spoken are from the Lord. I believe the Spirit will also follow such words and work within us in a silent way. This work is of life, and this life is something that human language cannot describe. It is something that human feeling cannot fathom. When a seed falls into the ground, after a period of time it brings forth flowers, yet we cannot explain how the seed has grown and blossomed. The same can be said about our home meetings. We should speak something in every meeting. Even if there is only one person, we should still speak something. We may think that we are speaking in vain, but we do not realize that we are actually sowing. We have not spoken in vain. In the long run we will see the result, and the result will be rewarding. When we speak to one person, we may not realize that in five years our word will produce results in that person. He may perfect another one, who may turn out to be a great vessel of the Lord. We can never anticipate such things. Yet such things do happen all the time.</p>
<h2 class="head1">LEARNING TO SPEAK BY SEIZING THE OPPORTUNITY</h2>
<p>For this reason, we cannot look merely at the present condition. We need to believe that our work is a work of life; it has eternal value. What we speak is the truth of the Bible, and life will follow this truth and work on man. We must learn to speak in an organic way. We should not preach in a dead way. Suppose we need to visit a sick and elderly sister or a busy and heavy-laden brother. If we ramble on mechanically about &ldquo;the organic functioning of the believers&rdquo; the minute we meet him, we may not be able to impart anything to him. Such speaking is neither organic nor effective. But if we take care of people&rsquo;s situation by seizing the opportunity, we will meet the needs of all kinds of people.</p>
<p>For example, we can say to a sister who is lying on a sick bed, &ldquo;Sister, 1 Peter 2:24 says that the Lord Jesus bore up our sins in His body on the tree, and by His bruise we are healed. Simply call on His name and He will deliver you from your sickness.&rdquo; We may not have the absolute assurance that she will be healed, but we should believe that she will be comforted by the Lord&rsquo;s word. After this we can lead her to pray, &ldquo;Lord, I commit my sickness to You. You know my pains. Have mercy on me.&rdquo; If we seize the opportunity in this way, there will be a perfecting work in her. We can then turn around and speak a little to her family. Do not give a message on the &ldquo;organic functioning of the believers.&rdquo; Instead, seize the opportunity to say a suitable word. We all must learn this.</p>
<p>Concerning the truth, we must be absolute. We cannot discount anything with regard to God&rsquo;s truth, and we cannot discredit God&rsquo;s word, but in our practice we need to be flexible and skillful. Take baptism as an example. Strictly speaking, as soon as a man is saved, he should be baptized. However, we cannot say under what condition a man is qualified to be baptized, nor can we say with surety what way we should baptize people. To do this will not help a person to be saved. When John the Baptist baptized men, he did not baptize in a certain prescribed way. He lived in the wilderness. When men went to him to be baptized, they did not need to change their clothes. They did not need to be in a prearranged place. As long as there was water, he baptized them. Regarding the truth we must be absolute, but in practice, we must learn to work as the opportunity arises.</p>
<h2 class="head1">A PRACTICE FOR THE INCREASE AND SPREAD<br />
OF THE CHURCH LIFE</h2>
<p>Once the small groups are divided into the homes, the opportunity for everyone to speak greatly increases. No longer is it like the big meetings, where one&rsquo;s mouth is sealed the minute he walks into the meeting. Such big meetings are actually &ldquo;mouth-sealing&rdquo; meetings. Once the saints arrive at the big meeting, their mouths are sealed. The elders in particular have taken the lead to shut up their mouths and have allowed the co-workers to set up their little &ldquo;platforms&rdquo; and erect their &ldquo;stages&rdquo; to deliver their wonderful, savory, and well-rehearsed messages. In the long run, however, such meetings deprive the saints of their organic ability to function. This is a great loss to the Lord&rsquo;s recovery! Let me say a frank word: We have been doing this in Taiwan for more than twenty years. Every meeting was impressive, but what is the result? Where is the increase today? How many saints are functioning?</p>
<p>We are not here to do the work of gardening; we are here to raise orchards. We are not for appearance; we are for fruit, for the increase, and for the spread. In order to achieve this goal, we need to do the following two things: First, we should not lose heart, not be discouraged, and not give up. Rather, we should be strong, be persistent, and have a will that does not settle for anything less than the determined goal. Second, we should learn to dispense food at the proper time, apply the Lord&rsquo;s word suitably at the right time, and make the home meeting a meeting where everyone speaks.</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_052.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_054.html">Next</a> </body></html>
