   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>The Reality of the Kingdom of the Heavens</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The second aspect of the kingdom of the heavens is the reality of the kingdom of the heavens.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In order to know the reality of the kingdom of the heavens, we must know what the kingdom of the heavens is.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>A kingdom is a realm where authority is exercised.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Thus, the kingdom of the heavens is the realm where the heavens exercise authority.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Daniel 4:25-26 shows that the heavens rule; that is, the Most High is the Ruler.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>This means that God rules and exercises authority from the heavens as His dwelling place 1 Kings 8:39 .</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The throne of God s authority is also in the heavens Psa 103:19 .</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Therefore, the kingdom of the heavens is the reign of the heavens where God dwells; simply speaking, it is the rule of the heavens.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>This heavenly ruling is the reality of the kingdom of the heavens.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The reality is the ruling of the heavens, which governs us, restricts us, and causes us to submit to God s authority in all things so that we may be one with God in the heavens in all situations.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Thus, the reality of the kingdom of the heavens involves the heavenly authority that true Christians submit to today; it is the heavenly control and exercise that they accept today.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Only overcoming believers know this reality; everyone else including both defeated, genuine believers and false Christians have no part in it.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The words that the Lord spoke on the mountain in Matthew 5 through 7 are related to the reality of the kingdom of the heavens.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>1.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Blessed are the poor in spirit, for theirs is the kingdom of the heavens Matt 5:3 .</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>According to the Lord, the kingdom of the heavens belongs to those who are poor in spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>When a person is poor in spirit, he is under the ruling of the heavens, and he is in the reality of the kingdom of the heavens.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>To be poor in spirit means that one feels poor and empty in the depths of his heart and spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>He is dissatisfied with his condition and even more dissatisfied with the things of this world.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>By being poor and empty in spirit, there is a constant pursuit of spiritual growth and of God s riches, which are simply God Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Such a person is under the governance of the heavens, and he is in the reality of the kingdom of the heavens.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Consequently, he does not have to wait to enter into the kingdom of the heavens, because the kingdom of the heavens is his already.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>2.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Blessed are those who are persecuted for the sake of righteousness, for theirs is the kingdom of the heavens Matt 5:10 .</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The kingdom of the heavens also belongs to those who are persecuted for the sake of righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>To be persecuted for the sake of righteousness means to be persecuted and troubled by others because one refuses to do unrighteous, improper things in order to keep himself in accord with God s ways.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>This is possible only when one submits to God s authority and lives under God s heavenly governing in the reality of the kingdom of the heavens.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Such a one is in the kingdom of the heavens, and the kingdom of the heavens is his.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Verses 3 and 10 speak of the heavens ruling in a person in reality today; therefore, they both speak of the reality of the kingdom of the heavens.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>However, these are not the only verses that speak of this reality.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>All the teachings of the Lord on the mountain in Matthew 5 7 relate to the reality of the kingdom of the heavens and reveal the situation of those who are under the heavenly ruling.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>1.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Those who are under the governance of the heavens are poor in spirit 5:3 .</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Such ones feel empty and lacking in spiritual matters, especially in God Himself, and thus are desperately seeking.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>They are mournful in heart v. 4 . Such ones repent and mourn for their poor and desolate condition.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>They are meek v. 5 . Such ones are as lambs led to the slaughter, suffering persecution without resisting and enduring opposition, shame, and attack.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>They hunger and thirst for righteousness v. 6 . Such ones seek to have their actions and behavior according to God s righteous ways and to keep themselves righteous.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>They are merciful v. 7 . Such ones are sympathetic to the sufferings of others, making allowances for others weaknesses, being broad and gracious toward them, while requiring strict righteousness for themselves.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>They are pure in heart v. 8 . Such ones have no tendencies or hopes apart from God and His will.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>They are peacemakers v. 9 . Such ones end disputes, restrict the flesh, and hold their tongue.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>They are persecuted for the sake of righteousness v. 10 . Such ones pay a price for the sake of righteousness and suffer loss to be righteous.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>They rejoice when reproached, persecuted, and slandered for the Lord s sake vv.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>11-12 .</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Such ones endure and consider it a joy to be persecuted and cruelly treated by others for the Lord s sake.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The living of those who are in the reality of the kingdom of the heavens and under the heavenly ruling comes out of the first six items, which are conditions of the heart and spirit; such ones also display the last three items as conditions of their outward behavior.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>These nine items show who is under the governance of the heavens.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>2.</S>

   <S PAR='142' RSNT='1' SNO='142'>The Lord s teachings on the mountain show that the reality of the kingdom of the heavens is our living according to the heavenly rule within us, which causes us to leave sin, to overcome our temper, to deny our flesh and our self, to reject the world, to oppose Satan, to submit to the heavenly authority, to receive the heavenly restriction, and to live on the earth today without any flavor of the earth, bearing only a heavenly likeness.</S>
   <S PAR='143' RSNT='1' SNO='143'>In the Old Testament age God required the children of Israel to wear fringes on the borders of their garments with a cord of blue on the fringe of each border Num 15:38-39 .</S>

   <S PAR='147' RSNT='1' SNO='147'>In the New Testament age God wants us to be separated from the earth, to leave all earthly things behind, and to live in a heavenly situation to an even greater extent than the children of Israel.</S>
   <S PAR='148' RSNT='1' SNO='148'>This is because His salvation saves us to the extent that we are able to live under the reality of the heavenly ruling in the reality of the kingdom of the heavens.</S>
   <S PAR='149' RSNT='1' SNO='149'>He regenerates us with His heavenly life from the heavens John 3:3, 5; born can be translated born from above ; He gives us His heavenly nature 1 Cor 15:47-48 , makes us citizens of His heavenly kingdom Phil 3:20 , and causes us to sit together with Christ in the heavenlies Eph 2:6 .</S>

   <S PAR='153' RSNT='1' SNO='153'>This is similar to an American citizen who was born in China.</S>
   <S PAR='154' RSNT='1' SNO='154'>Although he has not been to America, he has the American life within him.</S>
   <S PAR='155' RSNT='1' SNO='155'>He is in China, but he is American and belongs to America.</S>
   <S PAR='156' RSNT='1' SNO='156'>He is a genuine American who can enjoy the privileges of being an American and live in an American family with the American life supply and flavor.</S>

   <S PAR='160' RSNT='1' SNO='160'>Our living, work, speaking, and actions will bear a heavenly likeness and be full of a heavenly flavor.</S>
   <S PAR='161' RSNT='1' SNO='161'>One who lives in the reality of the kingdom of the heavens submits to the heavenly authority, receives the heavenly restriction, and does not need man to govern him.</S>
   <S PAR='162' RSNT='1' SNO='162'>He can keep the law and be orderly much more than other human beings because the heavens rule, govern, and restrict him.</S>
   <S PAR='163' RSNT='1' SNO='163'>The governance of heaven is stricter and more thorough than the governance of man.</S>
   <S PAR='164' RSNT='1' SNO='164'>What national laws, household rules, school ordinances, or regulations from superiors can govern us more strictly and more thoroughly than the rule of the heavens?</S>
   <S PAR='165' RSNT='1' SNO='165'>The need for these kinds of regulation proves that we are not up to the standard of a Christian because we do not allow the heavens to govern us and do not live in the reality of the kingdom of the heavens.</S>
