   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Waiting</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>We should learn to wait on God.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>This is a trying lesson.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Even in human relationships waiting is an important element.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Suppose I want a brother to help me.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>If he is busy when I go to see him, I cannot make my request.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>I must wait until he is no longer busy before I can open my mouth.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>We should not think that we can skip this step when we pray.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Many times when God asks us to do something for Him, He does not force us.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>He waits until we are ready.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>If God can wait on us, should we not wait on God?</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The book of Psalms is filled with the matter of waiting on God.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>In the prayers of the psalmists the word waiting is uttered numerous times.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>We need to wait on Jehovah 37:9 .</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Our soul should wait in silence for God alone 62:1 .</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>We cannot breathe in God without first waiting on Him.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Waiting on God is to allow Him to determine the timing.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>We cannot dictate the time; He dictates the time.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>We need to wait.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>When we pray, we need to inquire of God, and we also need to wait on God.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Musing</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>We also need to learn to muse or meditate on everything about God.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>We must meditate on God s loveliness, His lovingkindness, His dignity, His glory, His attributes, and His acts.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>We must learn that when breathing in God through prayer, we should not only inquire of Him and wait on Him but also meditate on Him and ponder His acts.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>We should not think that it is a waste of time to temporarily set aside other matters in our prayers while we meditate on God.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>God already knows our needs.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>What touches His heart the most and gives Him the sweetest thought is our musing on Him in His presence.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>This is the reason the psalmist says, May my musing be sweet to Him 104:34 .</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>We should remain in His presence and behold Him in silence.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>While we behold Him in this way, we inquire of Him, wait on Him, and muse on Him.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>We can muse on His dealings with us and on His dealings with the saints of old.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>We can also muse on the sweetness of His person.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>We can meditate on His desire, love, patience, character, glory, and sweetness.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>In this musing, we absorb God, and His elements fill us.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>We should gain this experience and learn this lesson.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Please trust in my word.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>We must leave our many affairs, our business, health, family, finance, and livelihood, in God s hand and remember His promise that our heavenly Father knows that we need all these things Matt 6:32 .</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>We must cast all our anxiety on Him 1 Pet 5:7 .</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>There is no need to spend much time praying for these things.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>There is no need to pray for every point.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>We should believe that He bears the responsibility for all our needs.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>In our prayers we should forget about ourselves and spend more time to muse on Him, allowing Him and His acts to fill our spiritual eyes and inward senses.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>God treasures this type of musing; He appreciates this kind of meditation.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>When we enjoy Him in this musing, He dispenses Himself into us and takes care of all our other needs.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>We should be at peace and focus on His sweetness instead of focusing on our own affairs.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>We need to spend time to muse upon His sweetness.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Worshipping</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>As we touch Him, remain in Him, behold His loveliness, converse with Him, inquire of Him, wait on Him, and muse upon Him, we should worship Him.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>We should worship Him in our spirit and with our whole being.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>We should attune our entire being to His holy splendor and worship Him in holy splendor Psa 29:2 .</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>We should prostrate ourselves before Him and offer Him our worship.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Praising</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>We should also praise God.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Praise always follows worship.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>As we muse upon a certain matter, praises should flow forth from within us.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Interceding</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>We also should learn to participate in intercessory work.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>If time permits and we are able to spend more time before God, He will surely tell us things that concern Him.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>As soon as we know these things, we need to do the work of intercession.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Abraham stood before God.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>As he remained in His presence, God seemingly said, Shall I hide from Abraham what I am about to do?</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>I have to let him know that I will destroy Sodom.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>But there is a child of mine in Sodom.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>On the one hand, I will destroy Sodom; on the other hand, I want to save Lot.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>This is My desire.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Once Abraham heard this, he immediately began his intercessory work before God.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>In his prayer he said, Suppose there are fifty righteous within the city; will You indeed destroy and not spare the place for the sake of the fifty righteous who are in it?...Shall the Judge of all the earth not do justly?</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Gen 18:24-25 .</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Abraham s intercession was absolutely in the form of inquiring; he did not ask or beg.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Abraham kept inquiring all the way to the end. This is the best kind of intercession.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>As we remain in God, muse upon Him, worship Him, and praise Him, He reveals His desire to us, and we intercede by inquiring.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>This kind of prayer is sweet.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Allowing God to Finish His Speaking</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>We also need to allow God to finish what He is speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>This was what Abraham did.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>He prayed, but God spoke.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>The Scripture says, Jehovah went away as soon as He had finished speaking with Abraham v. 33 . Many times in our prayers we go away as soon as we have finished speaking rather than letting God go away when He is finished speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>In our prayers we have no thought of God s speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>We simply speak what we want.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>After praying, we say, In the name of Jesus, Amen.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>Then we leave.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>We do not care if God is leaving or staying.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>Let me say this jokingly: It is perhaps a good thing that God s presence is not with us during this type of prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>If God were with us He would feel very lonely.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>It is very impolite to meet someone, not allow him to speak, and leave as soon as we are finished speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>This, however, is the way many people pray to God.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>Although Abraham inquired in his prayer, God was the One speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>In his prayer Abraham did not finish speaking and then walk away.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>Rather, Jehovah finished speaking and then left.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>After Jehovah departed, Abraham left.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>Can we wait for God to finish speaking before we say, In the name of Jesus, Amen ?</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>Many times as soon as we finish our speaking, we say Amen.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>We may say Amen to such a prayer, but has God said Amen?</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>We have finished, but God has not finished.</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>This is a pitiful condition.</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>We have never learned to absorb God, to receive God, and to breathe in God.</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>We pray in a wild and reckless way.</S>
   <S PAR='98' RSNT='1' SNO='98'>We have never been trained in the matter of prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='99' RSNT='1' SNO='99'>We have never surrendered in this matter.</S>
   <S PAR='100' RSNT='1' SNO='100'>We have never allowed God to speak.</S>
   <S PAR='101' RSNT='1' SNO='101'>Consequently, we do not gain much God at the end of our prayers.</S>
   <S PAR='102' RSNT='1' SNO='102'>We have not absorbed Him or received very much of Him.</S>
   <S PAR='103' RSNT='1' SNO='103'>In summary, when we come to God to breathe Him in, we must first turn to our spirit to touch Him.</S>
   <S PAR='104' RSNT='1' SNO='104'>We should be calm, behold Him, inquire of Him, and learn to wait on Him.</S>
   <S PAR='105' RSNT='1' SNO='105'>We should also muse upon Him, worship Him, praise Him, and learn to intercede before Him.</S>
   <S PAR='106' RSNT='1' SNO='106'>Later we should allow Him to finish His speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='107' RSNT='1' SNO='107'>Then we can let Him know that we are satisfied.</S>
   <S PAR='108' RSNT='1' SNO='108'>This is the best kind of prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='109' RSNT='1' SNO='109'>It is a prayer that receives and absorbs God.</S>
   <S PAR='110' RSNT='1' SNO='110'>If we always pray in this way, we will surely receive and appropriate much more of God, and He will surely be our real enjoyment.</S>
   <S PAR='111' RSNT='1' SNO='111'>This is what it means to enjoy God through our prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='112' RSNT='1' SNO='112'>May the Lord graciously enable us to live in this reality!</S>
