   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>II.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>NO WATER IN THE NATURAL WAY</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>We are told in 15:22 that during this journey of three days in the wilderness, the children of Israel did not find any water.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>This signifies that in the realm of resurrection there is no natural water, no natural supply.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>After we are baptized and brought into the realm of resurrection, we may expect to receive a certain kind of help, the help that comes from natural water.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Before we were saved, and when we were living in the old realm of the world, we had an abundant supply of natural water from the Nile.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>But in the realm of resurrection there is no such water.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>III.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>THE WATERS OF MARAH</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>God led the people to Marah, which means bitterness.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Exodus 15:23 says, And when they came to Marah, they could not drink of the waters of Marah, for they were bitter: therefore the name of it was called Marah.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The fact that God led His people to Marah indicates that as we walk in the realm of resurrection, God will lead us to a place of bitterness, to Marah.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The pillar of cloud led the people to a place where there were waters, but these waters were bitter.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>When the people discovered that the waters were bitter, they murmured against Moses, saying, What shall we drink? v. 24 . Like the children of Israel, we also have complained and murmured about our bitter situations.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Many times we have said in a complaining way, What shall I do?</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>What shall we drink?</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>What kind of help is this?</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>If I had been Moses, I would have told the people not to complain to me.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>I would have reminded them that they were led to this place by the same cloud that protected them from Pharaoh and his army just three days before.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>But as a true servant of the Lord, instead of striving with this murmuring and complaining people, Moses cried out to the Lord v. 25 .</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>In response to his cry, the Lord showed him a tree v. 25 . When Moses cast the tree into the waters, the waters were made sweet.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>First Peter 2:24 indicates that this tree signifies the cross of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Thus, the tree that healed the bitter waters denotes the cross on which the Lord was crucified.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The cross of Christ, the unique cross, is the healing cross.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>This picture corresponds to our spiritual experience.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>After we are baptized and begin to walk in newness of life, we are troubled because we have no natural water.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>On the one hand, we are like the people who complained and murmured.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>On the other hand, we are like Moses who cried to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>When we cry out to the Lord in prayer, He shows us the vision of the crucified Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>We need to see a vision of the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Seeing this vision, we apply the cross of Christ to our situation, and immediately the bitter waters become sweet.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>I have the full assurance that everyone who has truly been baptized into Christ has had this kind of experience.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Our experiences may differ in degree, but in principle and in nature they are the same.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>According to Romans 6:4, we walk in the realm of resurrection, in newness of life, after we are baptized.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>This realm is the real wilderness of Shur, a realm in which we are separated from the world by the wall and by the sea.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>As we walk in this realm, we have no natural resources, and we face much bitterness.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>But in resurrection we may experience the cross of Christ and live a crucified life.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>As we do this, our bitter situation becomes sweet.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Last year my wife and I came to a real Marah, a very bitter situation.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>But because we were walking in the realm of resurrection, we could experience the cross of the Lord Jesus and live a crucified life.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>We richly enjoyed the healing tree cast into the bitter situation.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>This tree caused the bitter waters to become sweet.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>For this reason, I gave a number of messages last year on the crucified life.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Yes, my wife and I suffered from the bitterness in our situation.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>However, eventually we enjoyed sweetness because the healing tree with the crucified life had been applied to our circumstances.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>This is the way to experience and enjoy Christ s death in the realm of resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Whatever we experience in the realm of resurrection is an experience in resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>In the wilderness of Shur the children of Israel experienced the cross of Christ in resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>The bitter waters of Marah were changed into sweet waters in the realm of the wilderness.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>In the same principle, in the realm of resurrection we experience the death of Christ changing our bitterness into sweetness.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>May the Lord give us more experience of this.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>We do not experience the bitter waters of Marah once for all.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>As long as we live on earth, we shall walk in the realm of resurrection and come to Marah again and again.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>The experience of the children of Israel at Marah portrays a principle, not merely an incident.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>This principle is basic in our Christian life.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>As we walk in the realm of resurrection, we shall thirst, only to discover that there is no natural water to supply our need.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Only the waters of bitterness are available.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Whenever we are in such a situation, we need to see the vision of the tree and then apply this tree to our circumstances.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>This tree will then heal our situation and change the bitter waters into sweet.</S>
