<P>Recently the Cleveland area called a gathering for those who had been in the full-time training in Taipei to train some of the other full-timers and anyone available to go. For three days fifty saints went out, and they baptized over forty. Saints, wake up! There is a way. Do not think that there is no way. Thank the Lord that He has shown us the way. Fifty saints going out and baptizing over forty people within three days should be enough to wake up all of us. Would we remain in a drugged situation? If I were one of the elders or co-workers, I would tell the saints that from now on I will go out to knock on doors morning and evening, every day of the week. Our main work from now on is to knock on doors. If you went out in such a desperate way, do you not think you could gain one per day?</P><P>To have aggressive desperation, you have to be "crazy." If a person is in a burning building and is desperate for his life, he will jump out of the window. If we do not get someone baptized within a short period of time, we need to be desperate to "jump out of the window," to do anything and everything it takes to get someone baptized. Why would we not go out in this way? All the elders need to "go on strike" from their congregation and go out to knock on doors. Then every home you gain will be a "chapel." After one year, you can set up one hundred "chapels." Some of the homes you go to may even prepare a dinner for you. The trainees in Taipei reported that some homes even gave them gifts. They felt that they owed the saints something.</P><P>Saints, wake up! Now is the time. The elders need to realize that the church is not theirs. The church is the church of God (1 Cor. 10:32), the church of Christ (Rom. 16:16), and the church of the saints (1 Cor. 14:33b). If the saints will not fire you as their "pastor," you need to fire yourself by the new way. Blessed are all the elders who fully give themselves to go door-to-door. The elders should leave some of the prayer meetings and the Lord's table meetings to the saints and go to knock on doors. After a month of going door-to-door, you can have the Lord's table in the homes you gain. The elders need to go to create the increase, and their wives need to give up all their opinions and follow their husbands to knock on doors. You do not need to close the hall. The hall is not yours. It belongs to the saints. Just go to knock on doors. You can gain sixty within a short time and have the Lord's table with these new ones in their homes. Where there is a will, there is a way. Do not say there is no way; there is a way, and the Lord has shown us the way. He has dedicated this way; He has cut this way.</P><P>Matthew 25:14-30 is a parable for faithfulness. The slothful slave seemingly did not do anything wrong. He did not lose anything. What the Lord gave him, he kept throughout all the years until the Lord came back (v. 25). He even gave the Lord a message pointing out that the Lord was a hard man, reaping where He did not sow and gathering where He did not scatter (v. 24). Did the Lord justify him? He did not. Right away the Lord condemned him. He said, "Evil and slothful slave, you knew that I reap where I did not sow, and gather where I did not scatter. You ought therefore to have deposited my silver with the bankers, and when I came I would have recovered what is mine with interest" (vv. 26-27). The slothful slave should have taken the Lord's word solemnly. He was not desperate. Just to keep what the Lord gave you is not sufficient. He wants the interest, the fruit.</P>
