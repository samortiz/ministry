THE LAST SEVEN PLAGUES</h2><p>In 8:13 an eagle flying in mid-heaven says, &ldquo;Woe, woe, woe, to those who dwell on the earth because of the remaining sounds of the trumpet of the three angels who are about to trumpet.&rdquo; The three woes of the last three trumpets (9:12; 11:14) will be the woes of the great tribulation (Matt. 24:21). The first woe is the fifth trumpet in chapter nine, and the second woe is the sixth trumpet, also in chapter nine. The third woe (11:14), part of the negative contents of the seventh trumpet, is the seven bowls. These seven bowls are the last seven plagues (15:1). The sixth seal plus the first four trumpets of the seventh seal may be considered as a preliminary to the great tribulation, but the great tribulation itself is composed of the fifth trumpet, the sixth trumpet, and part of the negative contents of the seventh trumpet.</p><h2 class="head1">II. THE SCENE IN HEAVEN<br />BEFORE THE OUTPOURING OF THE SEVEN BOWLS</h2><p>The scene in heaven is revealed before the seven seals, again before the seven trumpets, and again before the seven bowls. Prior to the opening of the seven seals, we have the scene portrayed in chapters four and five. In this scene we see a throne set in heaven, One sitting on the throne, a rainbow around the throne, twenty-four elders sitting on twenty-four thrones, four living creatures, and the worthy Lion-Lamb (4:2-8; 5:5-6). This scene indicates that God on the throne is administrating His economy through the worthy Lion-Lamb, the One who is qualified to open God&rsquo;s hidden economy. The throne of God&rsquo;s administration in this scene is primarily for judgment.</p><p>In 8:3-5 we have the scene in heaven prior to the sounding of the seven trumpets. In this scene all heaven becomes silent for about half an hour (8:1). Here Christ as another Angel comes to minister as the High Priest to God by bringing the prayers of the saints to God and by adding incense to them that these prayers might be acceptable to Him. Through His incense, the saints&rsquo; prayers become a sweet savor to God and bring in His judgment upon the earth. This scene reveals that God is about to answer the saints&rsquo; prayers, offered by Christ and with Christ, by the judgments of the seven trumpets.</p><p>In 15:5-8 we have the scene in heaven before the outpouring of the seven bowls. By this time many things have transpired: the sixth seal, the first six trumpets, and even a portion of the seventh trumpet. Now is the time for the fury of God to be finished (15:1). The fury of God mentioned in 15:1, 7 and 16:1 indicates that God is angry with His enemy, especially with Antichrist and his kingdom. Although God has executed a great portion of His judgment and has accomplished nearly everything He must do, His fury has not yet been exhausted. The fury of His wrath remains to be poured out. Before this takes place, however, another scene in heaven is revealed. Now we need to consider the aspects of this scene.</p><h2 class="head2">A. The Temple Being Opened</h2><p>Revelation 15:5 says, &ldquo;And after these things I saw, and the temple of the tabernacle of the testimony in heaven was opened.&rdquo; It is somewhat difficult to understand the phrase &ldquo;the temple of the tabernacle of the testimony&rdquo; because historically the tabernacle preceded the temple and was replaced by it. Actually, the tabernacle and the temple are one. The Greek word for temple, <i>naos,</i> does not mean the general temple, but the inner temple, the Holy of Holies. Hence, the temple of the tabernacle means the Holy of Holies of the tabernacle. The tabernacle in the Old Testament was composed of the Holy Place and the inner part, the Holy of Holies. The temple in this verse is the inner part of the temple, the Holy of Holies, where the ark is. The testimony is the law of God which testifies God and which was put into the ark (Exo. 25:16). Because the ark was put in the tabernacle, the tabernacle was called the tabernacle of the testimony. Here we see that the temple of the tabernacle of the testimony in heaven was opened. It is no longer hidden, but unveiled for all the universe to see.</p><p>Verse 5 is the continuation of 11:19 and must be understood in relation to it. Revelation 11:19 says, &ldquo;And the temple of God which is in heaven was opened, and the ark of His covenant was seen in His temple.&rdquo; The throne with the rainbow in 4:2-3 is the center of all the judgment executed over the earth in chapters six through eleven, on the negative side; whereas the temple with the ark is the center of all God&rsquo;s accomplishments in the universe carried out in chapters twelve through twenty-two, on the positive side. Hence, in the first section of the book of Revelation, chapters one through eleven, the center of the revelation is the throne with the rainbow. In the second section, chapters twelve through twenty-two, the center of the revelation is no longer the throne with the rainbow, but the temple with the ark.</p><p>The throne with the rainbow is mainly for God&rsquo;s judgment on the earth, but the temple with the ark is mainly for God&rsquo;s building to express Himself. In other words, the temple and the ark are for God&rsquo;s testimony.</p><p>God&rsquo;s testimony is God&rsquo;s expression of Himself through His building. At the end of chapter eleven there is a great earthquake, probably the greatest earthquake in history. But at the end of the second section there is the New Jerusalem, which is God&rsquo;s building, God&rsquo;s expression, and God&rsquo;s testimony. The entire New Jerusalem is the Holy of Holies. This city will be a cube twelve thousand stadia (approximately thirteen hundred miles, about the distance from Los Angeles to Dallas) in length, width, and height (21:16). This is the enlarged temple, the issue of the last eleven chapters of the book of Revelation. The first eleven chapters consummate with a great earthquake, and the last eleven chapters consummate with the New Jerusalem. What a contrast!</p><p>The earthquake at the end of chapter eleven comes from the throne with the rainbow. Although God will cause this tremendous earthquake, He will not destroy all mankind. Rather, the rainbow encompassing the throne reminds Him of His covenant. This rainbow is Christ. In 10:1 we are told that another strong Angel, who is Christ, will come down out of heaven clothed with a cloud and with a rainbow upon His head. Christ is the universal rainbow. As God in His fury is carrying out His judgment upon rebellious mankind, Christ in the cloud will be the rainbow to remind God of His covenant with Noah. It seems that, as the rainbow, the Lord Jesus will say, &ldquo;God, I agree with Your righteous fury, but I remind You of Your faithfulness. You cannot forget the covenant You made with Noah. I am the rainbow in the cloud.&rdquo; Eventually, God&rsquo;s judgment, carried out with the remembrance of the rainbow, will spare those who become the &ldquo;sheep&rdquo; of Matthew 25, who will be the nations in the millennial kingdom. If it were not for this rainbow, none would survive to be the nations in the coming kingdom.</p><p>The temple with the ark is God&rsquo;s expression with God&rsquo;s Christ. The temple is God&rsquo;s dwelling, God&rsquo;s expression, and the ark is Christ as God&rsquo;s testimony. Because the last eleven chapters of Revelation are for God&rsquo;s expression and His Christ, the center of this section is God&rsquo;s temple and God&rsquo;s ark. Ultimately, the New Jerusalem will be the enlarged temple, and in it will be the ark, Christ, as the Lamb. Therefore, as the issue of God&rsquo;s acts in chapters twelve through twenty-two, we see the eternal temple with the eternal ark.</p> <p>In order to know the book of Revelation, we must have such an all-inclusive view. Only by having this view do we know where we are. The woman and the man-child are necessary for God&rsquo;s temple and God&rsquo;s ark. The bright woman is for the New Jerusalem. Eventually, that city will be the woman, for, as a city-woman, she will be the wife of the Lamb (21:9-10).</p><p>God will also use the dragon negatively to accomplish His purpose. When He has no further use for Satan, He will be ready to say, &ldquo;Satan, go to the lake of fire.&rdquo; God is great and He is sovereign. This book reveals that Satan is wholly in the hands of God. Do not think that it is unfair of God to use Satan. God is more fair, much fairer than you are. Who can presume to argue with Him? In Romans 9:20 and 21 Paul said, &ldquo;But, O man, who are you that replies against God? Shall the thing formed say to him who formed it, Why did you make me thus? Or has not the potter authority over the clay, out of the same lump to make one vessel to honor and another to dishonor?&rdquo; If you would dare to argue with God, He might reply, &ldquo;I am the Maker, and you are the clay. Don&rsquo;t you know that I have the authority to make anything I please? I have the power to make of you anything I want. Who are you to argue with Me?&rdquo; God is sovereign. After reading the book of Revelation again and again, I can only say, &ldquo;O God, I worship You for Your sovereignty. I worship You that You have chosen me to be one of Your children and even to be one of Your servants.&rdquo; Oh, how we all must worship Him!</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_196.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_198.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Life-Study of Revelation &nbsp; pg 197</div><br></body></html>
