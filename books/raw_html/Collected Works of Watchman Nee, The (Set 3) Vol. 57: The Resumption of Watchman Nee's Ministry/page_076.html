<h1 class="msg">CHAPTER FIFTEEN</h1><h1 class="title">THE DESOLATION OF THE CHURCH<br />AND THE ADVANCE OF THE CHURCH</h1><h2 class="head4">(Church Conference)</h2><h1 class="scripture">Date: April 19, 1948, Friday, evening<br />Place: Hardoon Road, Shanghai</h1><p>Brother Witness Lee: First I would like to explain the nature of this meeting. The purpose of this meeting is to share with the majority of the brothers and sisters the things that we, the co-workers, have been discussing for the last few days. I will first begin with a question: From the Bible and from church history, what is the way for us to serve in the church?</p><p>Brother Watchman Nee: We have to ask first of all if the church has taken a different stand with respect to its service to the Lord. Is the church different today in its stand toward service? Here we have two absolutely contradictory views. Many people do not realize that the church is in desolation on the one hand and is advancing on the other hand.</p><h2 class="head1">THE DESOLATION OF THE CHURCH</h2><h2 class="head2">Beginning from the Time of the Apostles</h2><p>The way that the church has taken for the past two thousand years has become progressively poorer. In God's view the church is fully in desolation. We see many sins and errors existing in the church today. From the Bible we see that even the early churches were already in desolation. During Paul's time there were already false shepherds, false prophets, and false apostles. The condition at Ephesus seemed to be better. Yet in reality it was also in desolation. In Philippians Paul said that all were seeking after their own things and no one was seeking after the things of Jesus Christ (2:21). Second Timothy was written by Paul right before he died. There we see also the condition of the desolation of the church. First Timothy speaks of the elders and the deacons (3:2, 8). But in 2 Timothy Paul could only entrust the testimony to the faithful ones (2:2). It was as if he was saying that even the elders and the deacons had become untrustworthy. In 1 Timothy he spoke concerning how the elders had to be faithful. But in 2 Timothy he could only concede that there were wooden and earthen vessels in the great house (2:20).</p><p>Second Peter tells us that at Peter's time some had betrayed the Lord and denied Him (2:1). By the Middle Ages the church had become degraded. It was not carried into Babylon at the fourth century; it had already fallen into desolation at the time of the apostles. This is why judgment begins from the house of God (1 Pet. 4:17).</p><p>John's Epistles were written thirty years after Paul's Epistles. In John's Epistles we see that some had even denied Jesus as the Christ. They did not acknowledge that Christ had come in the flesh. These were those who had come as the antichrists (1 John 2:22; 4:3). Furthermore, the book of Revelation, written between A.D. 90 and A.D. 95, speaks of seven churches. Other than two that did not receive a rebuke, the remaining five received severe rebukes (Rev. 2&mdash;3). All the way from the degradation of Ephesus to the Lord's vomiting of Laodicea out of His mouth, there was a continuation of degradation. The lampstand at Ephesus was removed, and Laodicea was vomited out of the Lord's mouth. Although there were some recoveries in between, it was a situation of desolation for the most part. The book of Jude has only one chapter. It tells of some who had crept into the church unnoticed (v. 4).</p><p>Historically speaking, the situation of desolation continued. From the second century forward, the Roman Catholic Church was formed in a general way. During the second to the third century, the practice of the local church was abolished. By the fourth century, at the time of Constantine, the formal church was established.</p><p>In the early churches once a man believed in the Lord, he immediately dropped the world. The believers did not work for money, but for the sake of the church. The saints had all things in common. The brothers and sisters continued steadfastly in meeting and in the apostles' teachings (Acts 2:42-46). Because those who believed risked everything to believe, many were afraid to believe. Acts says that three thousand and then five thousand were added into the church. But it is possible that a few times more than three thousand and five thousand people had not dared to believe. Many people would say that to go in this way would cost them their name and position. Pentecost not only brought in people; it also kept people away. Pentecost is something that cannot be touched. Once a man touches it, it ruins his life.</p>
