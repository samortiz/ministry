   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>To Teach Things Other Than God s Economy Producing Questionings</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Different teachings produce questionings, but the teachings that minister Christ do not cause questionings.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The teaching of the law was according to the Old Testament and was therefore scriptural, yet it was different from God s New Testament economy, which is to dispense Christ as the life supply to God s children that the church might be built up.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Although teaching the law is according to the Scriptures, it is different from God s economy, and it therefore produces questionings rather than building up the church.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>When the law is taught, questions may be stirred up regarding matters such as the keeping of the Sabbath, circumcision, and diet.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>However, when we minister only Christ to God s people, there are no questions.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Recent Questionings in the Lord s Recovery</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Being Produced by Different Teachings</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The Lord brought His recovery to the United States in 1962.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>For more than ten years, nothing but Christ for the church was ministered here, and there were no questionings.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>In the past few years the enemy has crept in with dissenting, distracting talk of different ways, producing questions.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Certain churches have been in confusion as a result of different teachings and the questionings they produce.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>For example, some have taught that the saints do not need to go to the Lord s Day morning meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>They say that whoever goes to the Lord s Day morning meetings is religious.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Life is mysterious and profound, but the experience of life is always simple.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The most crucial matters of life are the simplest.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>For example, nothing is as simple as breathing.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Christ is mysterious and profound, but to experience Christ is simple.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>We do not need to be complicated by considerations of whether or not we should do certain things or go to certain places.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>We need to forget about teachings that are different from God s economy and experience Christ in a simple way.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>We should care only for God s economy, that is, for Christ being ministered and dispensed into our being.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>We should not care for any other thought, concept, idea, or opinion.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>We should reject any teaching other than God s economy.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>In the Lord s recovery we do not care for anything other than Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The Lord s recovery is not the recovery of certain concepts or of so-called good meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Also, the Lord s recovery is not the recovery of excitement.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The Lord s recovery is the recovery of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Our meetings should minister Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>God s Economy Being Christ as the Vine</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>We need to experience Christ in our daily life.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>We need to live by Him, live Him, and live Him out.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Every day we need to pray, Lord, You are one with me.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>You are my life and my person.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>I am one with You.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Lord, You are God s economy.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>You are the vine, and we are the branches.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The branches in the vine simply live.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>But they do not live themselves; they live the vine, grow the vine, and produce the vine.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>This is God s economy.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>In John 15:1 the Lord said, I am the true vine, and My Father is the husbandman.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>God the Father is a farmer, and His economy is to grow a universal vine that includes Christ and all the believers.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The Lord s recovery is for God s economy.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Christians today are divided according to different teachings, concepts, ways, activities, and organizations.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>In the Lord s recovery we reject these things.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>We have nothing but Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Our dictionary has only one word Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>To this word we would add a footnote and the church.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>We care only for Christ and the church.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>We need to come back to Christ and take the simple way of life.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>God s economy is Christ for the church.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Christ is within us.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>As branches in the vine, we simply need to be one with Him and live Him.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Christ is our life, our person, and our everything.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>He is our life necessity.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>We do not need to care for any concept.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>We need to care only for Christ and to live Him.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Whatever He does, we do.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Wherever He goes, we go.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>This is to live Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>As the unique life necessity, Christ is the One we need to experience for the church life.</S>
