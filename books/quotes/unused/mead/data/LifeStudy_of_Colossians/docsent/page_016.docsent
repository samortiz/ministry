   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>I. CHRIST IN THE GOSPELS A. Incarnated to Put On the Old Creation</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Let us now, in the way of an overall survey, look at Christ in the Gospels, in the Acts, in the Epistles, in Revelation, and then in Colossians.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In the Gospels we see that Christ was incarnated to put on the old creation.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>John 1:14 says that the Word became flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Flesh here denotes man of the old creation.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Strictly speaking, God did not create the flesh; He created a body for man.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>But through the fall, sin entered into man s body and caused it to become flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Hence, the flesh in John 1:14 refers to man as part of the old creation.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Man, the head of creation, had become flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>By incarnation Christ became a man and thereby put on the old creation.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>B. Passing through Human Living to Express God</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Throughout His human living, Christ expressed God.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>John 1:18 says that no one has ever seen God, but the Son has declared Him.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>During the thirty-three and a half years of His life on earth, Christ declared God and expressed Him.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>C. Crucified to Terminate the Old Creation</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>When Christ was crucified, He terminated the old creation.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>If a Jew were asked what happened when Jesus was crucified, he would probably answer that a man named Jesus of Nazareth died on the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>A new Christian may say that it was his Savior who was crucified.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>A more advanced Christian may reply that not only was Christ crucified as his Savior, but that he himself also was crucified with Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>An even more advanced Christian may answer that Christ, the self, Satan, and the world were all dealt with on the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>However, not even this answer is sufficient.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>On the cross, Christ crucified sin, Satan, the world, the old man, and the entire creation.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Moreover, the law of commandments in ordinances was also crucified there.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Therefore, the death of Christ terminated the entire old creation.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>D. Resurrected to Produce the Church,</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>the New Creation</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>According to the Gospels, Christ was resurrected to produce the church, the new creation.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>He was the one grain of wheat that fell into the ground and produced many grains in resurrection to form the church John 12:24 .</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>II.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>CHRIST IN THE ACTS</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>In the Acts we see that Christ has been exalted to be the Head over all things to the church.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Acts also reveals that after His exaltation Christ descended as the Spirit to carry out God s intention.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Furthermore, the book of Acts reveals that Christ has been propagated to bring the church into existence.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>III.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>CHRIST IN THE EPISTLES</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>In the Epistles we see that Christ is our righteousness 1 Cor 1:30 , our life 1 John 5:12 , our life supply Phil 1:19 , our holiness 1 Cor 1:30 , our redemption 1 Cor 1:30 , and our glory 1 Tim 1:1 .</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>All these aspects of Christ indicate that we shall experience a full transformation resulting in glorification.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>IV.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>CHRIST IN REVELATION</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>In the book of Revelation we see that Christ is the testimony of the churches.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>In the churches we testify only to Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Furthermore, in Revelation we see that Christ is the King in the coming kingdom and, ultimately, the center of the New Jerusalem in eternity.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>V. CHRIST IN THE BOOK OF COLOSSIANS</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>We have seen that in the book of Colossians Christ is the preeminent One 1:15, 18 and the all-inclusive One 3:11 .</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>He is the centrality and universality of God s economy.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>In Colossians Paul uses a number of unique expressions to describe Christ, expressions that are not found elsewhere in the Scriptures.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>This indicates that in Colossians we have the highest revelation of Christ found in the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>This book is like Mount Zion, the highest peak among the mountains.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>We appreciate this book because, in a unique way, it presents Christ as the preeminent and all-inclusive One, the centrality and universality of God.</S>
