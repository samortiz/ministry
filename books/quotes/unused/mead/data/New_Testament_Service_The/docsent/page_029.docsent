   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER NINE FOLLOWING CHRIST Scripture Reading: Matt 4:12-22; 5:1-2, 13-16; Eph 4:12; 1 Cor 1:10; 1 Thes 3:10; Gal 6:1</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Following the case of John the Baptist is the fourth case in Matthew, the case of the disciples following Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The arrangement of the chapters in Matthew is not according to historical sequence, but according to doctrine.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Matthew put all the facts together under the inspiration of the Holy Spirit for a definite purpose, not according to chronological order.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>THE FOURTH CASE, THE DISCIPLES</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>FOLLOWING CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>If we study the four Gospels carefully, we will see that Peter was not the first one who came to Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>According to John 1, Andrew came to the Lord first and then brought his brother Simon.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>However, in Matthew 4 the Lord comes to Peter first, because Matthew is not giving the historical order; rather he is arranging his Gospel according to a certain teaching.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>In chapter one, we see the case of conceiving and bringing forth Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Chapter two records the case of finding Christ, and chapter three tells of the testifying for Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Then the fourth case, the following of Christ, is in chapter four.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>After the conceiving and bringing forth of Christ comes the finding of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>After the finding of Christ, there is the testifying for Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>After the testifying for Christ, there is the following of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>REJECTED BY RELIGION AND CULTURE</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Because Matthew is a book that has been written according to doctrinal arrangement, we need to understand this book in such a way.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>After John the Baptist was put into prison, Jesus withdrew into Galilee Matt 4:12 .</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>What does this mean?</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>This simply means that John s testimony of Jesus coming from God was rejected by religion and the political circle.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>John the Baptist was first rejected by the Jewish religion and then martyred by those in the political circle.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Thus, religion and politics rejected the testimony of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>This means that Christ was rejected by religion and human culture on this earth.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Therefore, He withdrew.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>He departed from Jerusalem, the temple, the Jewish religion, and the political center to Galilee of the Gentiles Matt 4:15 .</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Hence, if we would follow Jesus, we need to know where He is.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>We cannot follow Him if we are not in the same place He is.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>He is not in Jerusalem, the temple, or the political circle.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Where is He?</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>He is in Galilee of the Gentiles, a place despised by the Jewish people.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>A GREAT LIGHT</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>When Jesus departed from Jerusalem to Galilee of the Gentiles, the Bible says that He was a great light springing up in darkness.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>At His birth He was a little star, but at the beginning of His ministry He became a great light.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Just as the star did not appear to those in the Jewish religion, neither did the great light.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>He did not appear to those in Jerusalem, He did not appear to those in the temple, but He appeared to those in Galilee of the Gentiles.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>This Jesus whom we should follow does not appear to those in religion or in the cultured world, but He appears to those in a place despised by the people, Galilee of the Gentiles.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>TWO BY TWO</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>While He was appearing as the great light, He came to two brothers, Simon and Andrew, as they were fishing.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Immediately He called them to follow Him.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Follow Me, He said, and I will make you fishers of men Matt 4:19 .</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Again we should remember that this is a book that is arranged in a doctrinal order.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>It does not say that Jesus appeared to one brother, but that He appeared to two.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>First of all, we need to realize that we cannot follow Jesus by ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>We need others to be our companions.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>As I look back on my Christian life, I realize how much I have been under the Lord s mercy.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>I have always been with others.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>According to the principle, we do not follow Jesus by ourselves; we need company.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>After the Lord called Peter and Andrew, He called another two brothers, James and John.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>The principle of the Body is two by two, not one by one.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>To follow Jesus is a matter of the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>It is not an individual matter, but a corporate matter.</S>
