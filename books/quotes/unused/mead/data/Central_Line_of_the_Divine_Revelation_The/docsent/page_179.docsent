   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>C. The Mingling of the Processed</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>and Consummated Triune God</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>with His Redeemed, Regenerated, Transformed,</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Conformed, and Glorified Tripartite People</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The New Jerusalem is the mingling of the processed and consummated Triune God with His redeemed, regenerated, transformed, conformed, and glorified tripartite people.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>This aspect of the New Jerusalem brings us to the central point of the divine dispensing.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>In order to be mingled with us, God had to be processed.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The processed Triune God is the One who has gone through incarnation, human living, an all- inclusive death, and a wonderful resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>These are four steps, four processes.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>For God to be mingled with us, He also needs to be consummated.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>He was perfect in eternity, but He was not complete in what He wanted to be.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>He wanted to be God mingled with man.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>He wanted to be both divine and human.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>In eternity past was He complete?</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>He was divine, but not divine and human.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Thus, He was perfect and without defect, but not complete.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>He needed to be completed, to be consummated.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>He became consummated by being processed.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>He became a man, lived a human life, and entered into death.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>We may think that His entering into death was merely a suffering.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>It was a suffering, but it was also a marvelous process.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The eternal God who is the divine life, the uncreated life, the indestructible life, entered into death.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Would you like to travel through death?</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>God desired to do this, and He did it.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>He traveled through death.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>He took a tour of Hades.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>To God this was wonderful because this was His process.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Then He entered into resurrection and transcended to the heavens in His ascension.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Now He is there as both the perfect and complete God.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Today He is not only perfect but also complete.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>He has been consummated with incarnation, with human living, with a wonderful death, with resurrection, and with ascension.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>He is completed.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>He has been consummated.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Such a God, a processed and consummated God, is absolutely qualified and ready to mingle Himself with His people so that they can be redeemed, regenerated, transformed, conformed, and glorified.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>God today is not so simple and neither are we.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>God is completed, and we are enjoying Him as the consummated One.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>One day we will be consummated.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>That consummation will be the glorification, the redemption, the transfiguration, of our body of humiliation into the body of Christ's glory Phil 3:21 .</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>We will be the same as He is.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>He has passed through all the processes, and we will also pass through all the processes of redemption, regeneration, transformation, conformation, and eventually glorification.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>We have been redeemed and regenerated.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Now we are passing through the "tunnel" of transformation.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Eventually we will pass through the processes of conformation and glorification.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Our God is the processed and consummated Triune God, and we are the redeemed, regenerated, transformed, conformed, glorified tripartite man.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>He mingles with us, and we mingle with Him to be one.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The New Jerusalem is not merely God or merely man.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The New Jerusalem is a God- man in the corporate way.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The New Jerusalem is a mingling of the processed, consummated Triune God with the redeemed, regenerated, transformed, conformed, and glorified tripartite man.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>He is triune, we are tripartite, and we are mingled with Him.</S>
