   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE GOAL OF GOD S GOSPEL</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>What is God s building today?</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>God s building is the church.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>God s economy, salvation, and redemption are to bring us into His building, the church.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>This is not my particular emphasis; it is the emphasis in the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Christ Himself emphasized this.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>He tried to help others to know Him.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>According to Matthew 16, one day He asked His disciples, Who do you say that I am?</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>When Peter confessed that He is the Christ, the Son of the living God, the Lord went on to speak concerning the church: And I also say to you that you are Peter, and on this rock I will build My church, and the gates of Hades shall not prevail against it Matt 16:18 .</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The purpose of knowing Christ is that we may be built into the church.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Furthermore, in the book of Acts we see that thousands were saved for the purpose of the raising up and the building up of churches.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Then in Romans Paul indicates that we sinners have been justified, transferred out of Adam into Christ, and are now walking according to spirit so that we may become full-grown sons to be proper members built up in the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>For this reason, at the end of the book of Romans we have local churches.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>This is the ultimate goal of God s revelation and also the goal of God s gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The entire book of Romans, according to Paul, is the gospel of God.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Entering into the building of God, therefore, is the goal of God s salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>To enter into God s building is to be saved.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>When we were outside the building of God, we were lost.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>But when we repented and believed in the Lord Jesus, we came into God s salvation and also entered into God s building.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>From the very beginning, we should have realized that to enter into the building of God is to bear the Triune God involved with man as a testimony.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>This is what we all should be doing today.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Once again I say that this concept is not deep.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>As part of the twenty-six letters of the spiritual alphabet, it is something we should have learned at the beginning.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>However, we were not taught this, and we did not learn it.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>THE ALPHABET OF GOD S SALVATION</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>More than fifty years ago, I learned some letters of the Greek alphabet, but at that time I did not learn them very well.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>I had trouble, for instance, with the Greek letter gamma</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>, which resembles a lower case y in the English alphabet.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Also, an upper case y Y in the English alphabet looks somewhat like an upper case upsilon</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>in Greek.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Today many believers have learned the alphabet of God s salvation in much the same way I learned part of the Greek alphabet years ago.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>On the one hand, they are like those who do know some Greek letters.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>On the other hand, they are like those who confuse Greek and English letters, perhaps taking a lower case English y for a lower case Greek gamma.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>For example, they may think that certain aspects of our culture are the same as God s salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>This can be compared to saying that an upper case Greek eta</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>is the same as an upper case English h H , or that a lower case English p is the same as a lower case Greek rho</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>. Those who confuse aspects of culture with God s salvation have not learned thoroughly the alphabet of God s salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>They know something about justification, regeneration, and forgiveness.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>But they also know many things of their culture.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>As a result, they unconsciously mix certain aspects of their culture with God s salvation and confuse human culture with the salvation of God.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Furthermore, when someone speaks about a certain aspect of God s salvation, they may be very confident that they understand.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Actually, they do not understand at all and have confused something of God with their natural concept and the cultural elements that have saturated them.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>This can be compared to thinking that a lower case Greek nu</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>is a lower case English v. I use this illustration of Greek and English letters to point out our need to know the complete alphabet of God s salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>What we see signified at the front of the court of the tabernacle is man bearing as a testimony the Triune God involved with man.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Whenever a person repents, believes, and enters into God s salvation, that person should realize that he is entering into God s building and that this building is God s testimony.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The entire realm of the tabernacle, including the tabernacle itself and the outer court, is a constitution of the Triune God with His chosen and redeemed people.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Therefore, it is God s testimony.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>God is the One testified, and we are those testifying Him.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Thus, from God s side, it is a testimony.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>From our side, it is a matter of bearing the testimony.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>This bearing of the Triune God as a testimony is signified by the door, the gate, of the court of the tabernacle.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>The gate or entrance of any building expresses the purpose of that building.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>For example, the entrance of a bank indicates clearly that that building is a bank.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Likewise, the entrance of a stadium has a different kind of appearance, indicating that it is a gateway into a stadium.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>The same is true of the entrance of a school.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>In keeping with this principle, the gate of the court of the tabernacle also has a particular appearance: it signifies man bearing as a testimony the Triune God involved with man.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>If this part of the alphabet of God s salvation can be impressed upon us, this message will have been helpful.</S>
