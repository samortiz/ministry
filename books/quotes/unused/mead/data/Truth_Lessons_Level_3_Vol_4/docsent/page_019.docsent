   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>B. Respectively in the Believers Localities</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The believers are in the church in the locality where they live.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>For example, Acts 8:1 speaks of the church which was in Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>This was the first church established in a locality, within the jurisdiction of a city, the city of Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>It was a local church in its locality, revealed by the Lord in Matthew 18:17.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>It was not the universal church, as revealed by the Lord in Matthew 16:18, but only part of the universal church, which is the Body of Christ Eph 1:22-23 .</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The record concerning the establishing of the church in its locality is consistent throughout the New Testament Acts 13:1; 14:23; Rom 16:1; 1 Cor 1:2; 2 Cor 8:1; Gal 1:2; Rev 1:4, 11 .</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The second time the New Testament mentions the local churches is in Acts 13:1: Now there were in Antioch, in the local church, prophets and teachers.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>In Antioch there was another local church, another local expression of the universal church.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Hence, Acts 8 and 13 reveal that the church had two expressions: one in Jerusalem and the other in Antioch.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>All the local churches are local expressions of the same one universal church.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>In 1 Corinthians 1:2 Paul writes to the church of God which is in Corinth.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>This reveals that the church is not the church of any person or of any practice or doctrine but of God.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The church is the church of God because it is constituted with the universal God; nevertheless, it exists on earth in many localities, one of which was Corinth.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>In God the church is universal in nature, but in practice the church is local and in a definite place.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>This indicates that the church has two aspects: the universal and local aspects.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Without the universal aspect, the church has no content; without the local aspect, the church has no expression and practice.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Hence, the New Testament stresses the local aspect of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The church is of God because the church is constituted of the element of God.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>However, the church which is of God is also local.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Therefore, both the universal and local aspects of the church are seen in 1 Corinthians 1:2.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The universal aspect refers to the constitution, nature, and content of the church, and the local aspect refers to the expression and practicality of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>If we have only the local aspect, without the aspect of the church being of God, we will have only an outward formality; we will lack the inward reality.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Furthermore, if we have only the universal aspect but not the local aspect of the church, we will have the reality but not the practicality.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>On the one hand, the church is constituted of God; on the other hand, the church is expressed in a particular locality.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The universal church is expressed and practiced in particular localities.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The universal church, as the Body of Christ, is expressed through local churches.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Local churches as the expressions of the one Body of Christ are locally one.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The book of Revelation was written to local churches: To the seven churches which are in Asia 1:4 .</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Asia was a province of the ancient Roman Empire, and in that province there were the seven cities spoken of in 1:11.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The seven churches were in seven cities respectively; they were not all in one city.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Revelation 1 through 3 does not deal with the one universal church but with local churches in seven cities.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The church is firstly revealed as being universal in Matthew 16:18 and then as local in 18:17.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>In Acts the church was practiced in the way of local churches.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>In regard to the Epistles, only a few were written to individuals, and all the rest were written to the local churches.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Not one was written to the universal church.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Without the local churches, the universal church has no practicality and actuality.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The universal church is realized in the local churches.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Knowing the church universally must be consummated in knowing the church locally.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Our knowing and practicing the local church are a great advancement.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The church is in the advanced stage in the book of Revelation, because Revelation is written to local churches.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>In Revelation 1:11 we see that sending the book of Revelation to the seven churches equals sending it to seven cities.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>This clearly shows that the practice of the church life in the early days involved having one church in one city, with one city having only one church.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>In no city was there more than one church.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The local church took the city, not a street or area, as the boundary.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>A local church should include the whole city in which the church is located; it should not be larger or smaller than the boundary of the city.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>All the believers within its boundary should constitute the one unique local church within a city.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Hence, one church equals one city, and one city equals one church.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>This is what we call the local churches.</S>
