   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>III.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>THE TEACHING OF MATTHEW 5</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Now let us turn to another portion Matthew 5.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>This chapter is different from Leviticus 6, which speaks of transgressions against man just in terms of material things.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Matthew 5 deals with more than just transgressions in material things.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Matthew 5:23-26 says, "Therefore if you are offering your gift at the altar and there you remember that your brother has something against you, leave your gift there before the altar, and first go and be reconciled to your brother, and then come and offer your gift.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Be well disposed quickly toward your opponent at law, while you are with him on the way, lest the opponent deliver you to the judge, and the judge to the officer, and you be thrown into prison.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Truly I say to you, You shall by no means come out from there until you pay the last quadrans."</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The quadrans spoken of here do not refer to just physical quadrans.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>They refer to the principle of coming up short in something.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The Lord says, "Therefore, if you are offering your gift at the altar and there you remember that your brother has something against you."</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>This specifically refers to disputes among God's children and among the brothers.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>If you are offering a gift at the altar, that is, if you are offering something to God, and suddenly remember that your brother has something against you, this remembering is God's leading.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The Holy Spirit often gives you a necessary thought and reminds you of necessary things.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>When you remember something or are reminded of something, do not put the thought aside and think that it is merely a thought.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>As soon as you remember something, you should carefully deal with it.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>If you remember that your brother has something against you, this means you have transgressed against him.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Your transgression may or may not be in material things.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Perhaps you have offended him by acting unrighteously towards him.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The emphasis is not on material things but on that which sets others against you.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>A new believer should realize that if he offends a person and does not apologize and ask for forgiveness, he is finished as soon as the offended party mentions his name and sighs before God.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Whatever he offers to God will not be accepted.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Whatever he prays will be turned down.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>We should not allow any brother or sister to sigh before God because of us.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Once he or she sighs, we are finished before God.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>If we have done something wrong or if we have offended or hurt someone, the offended party need not accuse us before God.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>All he has to say before God is, "Oh!</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>So-and-so..." or, for that matter, he just needs to utter an "Oh" and whatever we offer to God will be rejected.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>All he has to do is sigh a little because of us before God.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>We must not give any brother or sister the reason or the ground to sigh before God because of us.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>If we give him or her a reason to sigh, we will lose all our spiritual prospects and all our gifts to God will be annulled.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>If you are offering a gift at the altar and remember that your brother has anything against you or has any reason to sigh because of you, do not offer up your gift.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>If you want to offer to God, "First go and be reconciled to your brother, and then come and offer your gift."</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>God wants the gift, but you must first be reconciled to others.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Those who are not reconciled to men will not be able to offer a gift to God.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>You must "leave your gift there before the altar, and first go and be reconciled to your brother, and then come and offer your gift."</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Do you see the proper way?</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>You must first go and be reconciled to your brother.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>What does it mean to be reconciled to one's brother?</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>It means to remove the brother's wrath.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>You may need to either apologize or recompense.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>However, the point is to satisfy your brother.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>It is not a matter of adding one-fifth or one-tenth; it is a matter of reconciliation.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Reconciliation means satisfying the other's demand.</S>
