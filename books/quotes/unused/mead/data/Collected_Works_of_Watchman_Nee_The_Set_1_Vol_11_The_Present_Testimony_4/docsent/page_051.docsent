   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>What is the reason for this?</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The Lord Himself gave an explanation: "And likewise, these are the ones being sown on the rocky places, who, when they hear the word, immediately receive it with joy.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Yet they have no root in themselves, but last only for a time; then when affliction or persecution occurs because of the word, immediately they are stumbled" vv.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>16-17 .</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>According to the Lord, they have met with affliction and persecution and have fallen back.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The persecution spoken of here comes because of the word; it is not the ordinary kind of persecution.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The affliction spoken of here comes also because of the word; it is not an ordinary kind of affliction.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>They received the word but cannot receive the affliction and persecution that come with the word.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>As a result they fall.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>With every word, there is its affliction and persecution.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>When a Gentile, that is, a sinner, receives the Lord, spontaneously he encounters affliction and persecution.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>However, I will not go into that now.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>What I am saying is that when a Christian receives the word, any kind of word, he will surely encounter affliction and persecution.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Therefore, he cannot take the word as his ornament and presume that whatever he heard, he can preach.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>He may be able to do this with other kinds of knowledge, but he cannot be so quick with the word.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>He must pass through genuine dealings, truly be dead and crucified for the word's sake, and truly broken by God for the testimony's sake before he can be a proper testimony.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>It is not a question of putting together a few similar verses, categorizing them a little, and composing a little to come up with a message.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>That is not a message.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>He can find many things like this in a concordance.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>He must be genuinely dealt with before he can have a message.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Therefore, no word can be free from its accompanying affliction and persecution.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Why is this the case?</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>After we have heard a teaching and received it, God will surely create an environment that calls for the need of that word.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>For example, we may hear a word on patience today and receive it.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>God will then create for us an environment that requires patience.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Or we may hear a word on brotherly love and receive it.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>God will create for us an environment that requires love.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>What the ears hear and the mouth says is not reliable.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The only thing that is genuine is being able to practice the word when things occur.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>This is why all the words bring their affliction and persecution.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>They are there to test if you have really received the word.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>There is not one teaching in the Bible that can be acquired without paying a price for it.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Coming behind all His teachings is God's creation of an environment that calls for the need of such teachings.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The purpose of this is to test if the things we have received are genuine or false.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Many times, when the brothers and sisters hear a word on the cross, a word on absolute consecration, or a word on absolute holiness, they become very excited and think that they have it, know it, and understand it.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Brothers, do not rejoice so soon, for shortly thereafter affliction and persecution will come to you.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>They will come to test if you have indeed received this word.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>If you have, the affliction and persecution will prove that you have received it.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>If you have not received it or have only received it in a superficial or shallow way, the coming of the affliction and persecution will overwhelm you.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Please remember that the affliction and persecution are there only to expose your true condition; they will never take away what is real.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>They only prove that you have indeed received the Lord's word; they will not cause you to lose the Lord's word.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>If something is gold, it will never be turned into brass through the testing of fire.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>No matter how hot the fire, it will not change the nature of gold.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>However, if something is only gilded with gold, if it is only covered with a coating of gold but does not have gold within, its nature will be exposed by the fire.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Please remember that you may hear a teaching, but the teaching is not necessarily yours.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>After you hear it, God will immediately give you a test to determine whether or not the word is yours.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Although you have heard a word and have some scriptural knowledge about that particular word, you have not paid the price to join yourself to the word; you have not denied yourself and accepted the cross in your experience.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>You say with your mouth that you will obey.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>You may even pray happily saying, "Lord, I am willing to fully lay aside myself."</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Brothers and sisters, I can tell you that the Lord's sun will soon come.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>If you really have life, if you really have roots, and if you are genuine toward the Lord, the sun will help you to grow; it will help you with your development.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>But if you do not have roots, you will be dried up as soon as the sun comes out.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>All the trials are there to help you grow.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>If what you have is not genuine and not purely for the Lord, the trials will smash all that is not real and deceptive.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>They will show you what you really are within, exposing everything you have within and without to show you if both are the same.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Brothers and sisters, do you know what the sun is?</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Do you know what affliction and persecution are in reality?</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Let me tell you.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>They are the ultimate expression of the Lord's love the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>There is nothing that cultivates our life more than the cross, and there is no better trial than the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>The cross has separated the whole world into two classes.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>On the one side are the overcoming ones, and on the other side are the defeated ones.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>The difference between the two is the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>The cross makes a separation between the two.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>I know of many people who were just like the people in the world in the beginning; they felt happy in the world.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>But once they were enlightened and received God's revelation, they resolved to serve the Lord properly from that time forward.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>They resolved to be disciples, set aside everything else, and follow the Lord properly.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>They felt that they were quite good and that they could probably go on in this way.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>But they were deceived because they did not know their real condition.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>God would not allow them to be forever ignorant of their real condition.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>For this reason, He did something to expose their true self.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>They had a high evaluation of themselves, so God gave them special trials.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>He could not allow them to remain in darkness forever.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>This is why He had to give them the cross, to expose their true self.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>Then one day, they found that they had a problem with God and began to argue with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>I am afraid that many Christians have already had an argument with God and developed a problem with God.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>One day you will find that God has not dealt with you according to your expectation.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>You will find that God has not done what you expected.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>You hope that God will do things one way, but He decides to do them another way.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>You hope that God will not do things that way, but He does them exactly that way.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>You feel unhappy and consider in your heart that God has done the wrong thing.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>When you see that God's speaking is different from yours, that His work is different from yours, and that the places He wants to go are different from the places you want to go, you will be dissatisfied with His arrangements and begin to argue with Him, asking why He is doing these things.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>You will begin to be angry with God and misunderstand Him.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>It may never occur to you that a servant of the Lord will encounter these things.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>But to your surprise, they will take hold of you.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>These things will not be a part of your plan, but they will fill your environment, school, home, and office.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>As a result, you will begin to argue with God and blame Him.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>Brothers and sisters, please remember that this type of argument will keep you back and make you dry.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>Please remember that all of our spiritual dryness begins with arguing with God and being unwilling to yield to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>Every argument is followed by failures.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>If God has failed, and you have won, you will surely become dry.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>Therefore, every time you go to God, the cross is your test; it will determine if your life is rich or dry.</S>
