   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE GREAT HARLOT</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Eventually, Babylon is called "the great harlot" 17:1 and "THE MOTHER OF THE HARLOTS" v. 5 . Out of her, many harlots were produced.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>She is the harlot-mother with her harlot-daughters.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>A harlot is a woman having contact with males without a governing principle.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>A proper wife is one who keeps the governing principle, which is the principle of one wife for one husband.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>One day the Pharisees came to the Lord Jesus and tried to argue with Him about the matter of divorce.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>They told the Lord Jesus that Moses gave them permission to divorce their wives.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>But the Lord Jesus told them that Moses did this because of their hardness of heart, but it was not so in the beginning Matt 19:3-9 .</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>What is the recovery?</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The recovery means to go back to the beginning.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>You have to go back to Genesis 2 where there was only one wife for one husband.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>This is the governing principle without any confusion.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>A woman with many men has no governing principle.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Today she is with this man, and the next day she is with another man.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>This is confusion.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>In a sense, a number of Christians are like this.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>This month they are in a certain denomination.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Two months later they will be in another denomination.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>They travel from denomination to denomination.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>This is confusion.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>There is no governing principle.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Confusion causes division, and division produces confusion.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Division and confusion are very close sisters.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>They always go together.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>This is the character of a harlot!</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>We have to see that there is only one Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>There is only one church.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>There is only one Head.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>There is only one Body!</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Regardless of where we are, we must be in that unique church.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The unique church may be likened to the one moon around the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The moon we see in Chicago is the same moon we see in Los Angeles.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Just as the one moon appears in different localities, the one church appears in different localities, such as the church in Chicago and the church in Los Angeles.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The church is locally and universally one.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>According to the New Testament, there should be only one church for one city and one city with only one church Acts 8:1; 13:1; Rev 1:11 .</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>This is the governing principle of one wife with one husband.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>But the situation today is that of one woman with many men.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>This woman is Babylon, a harlot without a governing principle.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Some people say that we are too narrow.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>But is it too narrow for a wife to have only one husband?</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>We have to reject the principle of the harlot.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>A proper wife should always be narrow; she should have only one husband.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Some of you may say that you are meeting with the church because the church is full of life.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>But later you may decide to leave because you do not like some of the brothers.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>This is the principle of a harlot.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>She stays with one man because she likes him.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Later, she finds someone she likes more and stays with him.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Whether a wife likes her husband or not, he is still her husband.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>It is her destiny to always be with him.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>In the same way, whether you like the local church or not, you have no choice.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>We need to see that Babylon is confusion out of division.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>The principle of Babylon is the principle of a harlot.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>In the eyes of the Lord, today's Christianity is a great harlot.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>This is not my saying.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>This is the vision our brother John saw in the book of Revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>When the Lord Jesus asked the Samaritan woman to call her husband, she said that she had no husband.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Then He said that she spoke the truth, because she had had five husbands and the one she now had was not her husband.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>This describes a woman who is a harlot John 4:16-18 .</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>The Lord has opened our eyes, and we have seen the principle of oneness: one Head, one Body; one husband, one wife; one Christ, one church.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Wherever we go, wherever we are, there is only one church.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>In a small village, there is one church; in the biggest city, there is also one church.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>When we get into the New Jerusalem in the new heaven and new earth, there is still one church!</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>There will be no more confusion, no more division.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>We do admit that there are gold, precious stones, and pearls in Christianity.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>The cup is golden, and there are many vessels from the house of God.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>But these things are utilized by Babylon to make a show in order to appeal to the real Christians.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Today's Christianity appeals to the real Christians by all the outward gilding.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>But our eyes have to be open to see through the outward appearance to the real situation.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>We have to see that within the golden cup are many abominations with confusion, division, and idolatry.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Babylon is a great mixture.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>What shall we do?</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>The Lord's call in the book of Revelation is for His people to come out of her Rev 18:4 !</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>In the eyes of God, Babylon is fallen v. 2 ! The whole Christianity today is the great Babylon in the principle of a harlot.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>We must obey the Lord's call to come out of her.</S>
