   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Not Mending or Improving</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Today men are not natural enough before God; they want to be "improved'' earthen vessels.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>But it does not matter how much an earthen vessel is improved, because improvement produces only one result, that of drawing others' attention to oneself.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The ministry of Paul was quite extraordinary in its manifestation.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Paul himself, however, was quite an ordinary person.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Today men do not have a strong ministry, yet they themselves are strong.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>We need to learn the lessons before God to be smitten and dealt with by Him.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>What we need today is not outward, human endeavor or any work of improvement.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Our problem lies in the fact that we do not know how to differentiate between the outward earthen vessel and the inward treasure.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Miss Barber was a person who truly waited for the Lord's return.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>She waited daily and yearly.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Hymn #377 is a deep hymn written by her.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>It shows the kind of person she was.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Whenever a person came into her presence, he would sense Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>She was a person who earnestly waited for the Lord's return.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>One day I went into her study room and found her wastebasket filled with wastepaper.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>She told me that she was working on a letter that morning and that she had felt something wrong within and had to throw the letter away before she finished.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>After this she wrote a second one, only to find that she still did not have the peace, and she had to throw that one away as well.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>In this way she filled up her wastebasket with wastepaper, and the letter was still not finished.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>This little incident proves that she was a person who lived in the presence of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Outward godliness cannot help a person become a good Christian.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Only the part which the Lord has wrought into us counts, and only that part is worthwhile.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>It is useless to try to be a Christian in an outward way; a person has to drop all such endeavors.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>A Christian is one who learns to live in an inward way, not by any outward means.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Second Corinthians 4 speaks of the death of Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>This death of Jesus is the killing of Jesus v. 10 . This killing is not an outward killing but an inward one.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>We must never lead the brothers and sisters into the wrong way.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>We must not be like the Catholics, who teach people to imitate the conduct of their "saints.''</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>To do this is useless as far as helping anyone to know God is concerned.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Where there is an imitation, reality will not come.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>As long as anything artificial remains, nothing out of God can come in. The imitation things must go away before the real things will come.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The greatest principle today is the principle of the treasure in the earthen vessel.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Never waste time to improve yourself.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>It is wrong to indulge oneself, but it is equally wrong to improve oneself.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>God has no intention for us to improve our earthen vessels.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>His intention is for the treasure to be expressed through the earthen vessel.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Not Pretending or Imitating</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Many people do not realize how much they make pretensions and imitations before men.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>One year during Christmas, Brother T. Austin-Sparks was lying on the lawn playing with his son and dog.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>That was a most unpretending and beautiful picture.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Many people seem to have burned-up earthen vessels; they appear unnatural to others and give others an uneasy feeling.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>No one can remain in their presence for more than three minutes.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Some act in such a way that even their voices change and their speaking becomes different.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>None of these outward pretensions will accomplish anything.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The goal of Christ's salvation is to manifest Christ before men.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>It is to present the Lord within to others.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>We are not drawing others' attention to the earthen vessel.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>If we do this, it will only damage ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>We are drawing others' attention to the Christ within us.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Only He is the treasure.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>When the Son of Man came, He ate and drank Matt 11:19 , but the principle some practice today is not to eat or drink.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Man always thinks that in order to be spiritual, he has to be somewhat extraordinary or mysterious.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>A prophet has no honor in his own country John 4:44 because he is no longer mysterious.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Because men knew the Lord's brothers and sisters, they did not respect Him Matt 13:54-58 .</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>However, the real ministry is inward.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>God can do a deep work in a man, and yet at the same time that person can still be a very approachable person.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Evan Hopkins was a leader in the Keswick movement.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>He specialized in the teaching of sanctification by consecration.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>He had a talent for drawing rabbits' ears.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Often he drew all kinds of rabbits' ears for his children and grandchildren.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Humanly speaking, this was not spiritual at all.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Yet God used him to spread the teaching of sanctification.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>God did not send angels to preach the teaching of sanctification; He used an ordinary man to preach such words.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>In the Gospels, the Lord taught the disciples to turn and become as little children Matt 18:3; Mark 10:15; Luke 18:17 .</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>A child never pretends.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>We should never pretend to be what we are not.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>All pretending Christians are those who cry for help in private.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>They say to themselves, "What a suffering and burden it is to be a Christian!''</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Even bystanders feel sorry for them.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>God does not want us to be this kind of Christian.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>A Christian is not one who forces himself to behave in a certain kind of way.</S>
