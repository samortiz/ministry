<h2 class="head3">3. How to Help Those Who Are<br />
under Satan&rsquo;s Accusation</h2>
<p>We must never add to the burden of the conscience of those under Satan&rsquo;s accusation. First, we should help them to do only what is within their ability to handle. If we ask them to do what is beyond their ability, they will fall easily into condemnation. We must be sure that they have enough strength before the Lord to go on before we give them stronger advice or urge them to move ahead. Second, where there is the clear work of the Holy Spirit, we should raise the standard a little, for with the clear operation of the Spirit of the Lord and the spirit of revival, the Lord&rsquo;s word has the ability to uplift the capacity of a person. If we raise the standard very high when the Spirit of the Lord has not done anything, we are not helping these accused ones to go on; rather, we are giving Satan opportunities to accuse them even more.</p>
<p>We must not be careless in pointing out the failures of others. Suppose a brother has failed in certain areas, yet he can still pray, read the Bible, and attend the meetings. As long as you have the assurance within that you can help him, a little push may be all that is necessary to bring him through his trouble. But if you do not have the assurance within and you do not have the power to uplift him, your exposure of his failures will only quench his prayers, his reading of the Bible, and his meeting life. The smoking flax must be rekindled; it must not be smothered. The bruised reed must be supported; it must not be broken. We should not make ourselves the standard and put the conscience of others under condemnation. We must learn not to do things that would offend the conscience of others.</p>
<p>We must point out Hebrews 10:22 to those who are under Satan&rsquo;s accusation: &ldquo;Having our hearts sprinkled from an evil conscience.&rdquo; With such a sprinkling, our conscience should no longer feel guilty. The principle of the Christian life is a life free from any condemnation in the conscience. When a Christian is condemned in his conscience, he will be weak before God and will be debilitated in all spiritual matters. Satan&rsquo;s goal is to derail us from this principle. This is the reason he accuses us unceasingly. We need to lay hold of this principle by applying the blood. The more Satan tries to make us feel guilty, the more we should apply the blood to all of our sins. The brothers overcame him not by their own strength, but by the blood of the Lamb. We can declare, &ldquo;Satan, I admit that I have sinned. But I have been redeemed by the Lord! I have never denied that I am a debtor. I am in debt, but the Lord has paid my debt!&rdquo; We do not need to deal with Satan&rsquo;s accusation by denying that we are debtors. We can deal with him by declaring that our debt has been paid.</p>
<h2 class="head2">D. Satan&rsquo;s Work in the Environment</h2>
<p>All circumstances are arranged by God. However, there are many things in our environment which, though permitted by God, are the result of Satan&rsquo;s direct and active work.</p>
<p>Take Job&rsquo;s experience as an example. His oxen and don- keys were taken away, his house collapsed, and his children were killed. These were all things in the environment. Though they were permitted by God, Satan was the one directly instigating the attacks.</p>
<p>Peter&rsquo;s failure was another example. The cause of his fall was partly due to himself, but partly due to Satan&rsquo;s attack in the environment. The Lord said, &ldquo;Simon, Simon, behold, Satan has asked to have you all to sift you as wheat&rdquo; (Luke 22:31). Peter&rsquo;s fall was the direct result of Satan&rsquo;s work. Yet it was something permitted by God.</p>
<p>Paul&rsquo;s thorn was clearly the work of Satan. Paul said, &ldquo;There was given to me a thorn in the flesh, a messenger of Satan, that he might buffet me&rdquo; (2 Cor. 12:7). This is the work of Satan. It is Satan who attacks God&rsquo;s children in the environment.</p>
<p>An even clearer example can be seen in Matthew 8, when the Lord Jesus ordered the disciples to depart to the other side of the sea. He knew that powerful demons had to be cast out on the other side of the sea. After He and the disciples stepped into the boat, suddenly a great tempest arose in the sea so that the boat was covered by the waves. The Lord was asleep. The disciples came near and roused Him, saying, &ldquo;Lord, save us; we are perishing!&rdquo; (v. 25). A few of the disciples were fishermen; they were very experienced sailors. However, they realized that the waves were more than they could handle. The Lord Jesus rebuked their little faith; then He rose and rebuked the winds and the sea. The winds and the sea have no personality of their own, yet the Lord rebuked them because the devil was behind them. Satan had stirred up the winds and the waves.</p>
<p>In conclusion, Satan not only attacks our body, our conscience, and our mind, but also attacks us through our environment.</p>
<p>How should we react to Satan&rsquo;s attack in the environment?</p>
<p>First, we must humble ourselves under the mighty hand of God. Both James 4 and 1 Peter 5 tell us to withstand Satan. These two portions also tell us to humble ourselves before God. When Satan attacks us in the environment, our first reaction should be to submit to God. We cannot withstand the devil if we do not submit to God. Our conscience will condemn us if we withstand the devil without submitting to God. Therefore, our first reaction should be to submit to God.</p>
<p>Second, we should withstand the devil. When God&rsquo;s children encounter unreasonable and inexplicable things in the environment and have the clear sense within that these are attacks from Satan, they should withstand him. Once they withstand, the attacks will be behind them. On the one hand, they need to humble themselves under the hand of God. On the other hand, they must withstand Satan&rsquo;s work in the environment. When they humble themselves, and their attitude before God is firm, God will show them that it is not Him but Satan who is doing the work. Thus, they will be able to differentiate God&rsquo;s arrangement from Satan&rsquo;s attack. Once they are clear and once they withstand the devil, the attacks will go away.</p>
<p>Third, we must reject all forms of fear. Satan has to find a lodging ground before he can work on God&rsquo;s children. He cannot work where he has no ground to work. Therefore, his first attack is to gain a beachhead. He then attacks us from this beachhead. We should not give any ground to him. This is the way to victory. There is one area which can become Satan&rsquo;s greatest stronghold&mdash;fear. When Satan tries to put us through trials, the first thing he does is to put fear into us. An experienced sister once said, &ldquo;Fear is Satan&rsquo;s calling card.&rdquo; Once you accept fear, Satan steps in. If you reject fear, he will not be able to come in.</p>
<p>All thoughts of fear are attacks from Satan. Whatever you are afraid of, you will surely experience. Job said, &ldquo;For I dread something, and it comes upon me; / And what I fear comes to me&rdquo; (Job 3:25). Job experienced everything that he feared. Satan&rsquo;s attack in the environment comes mostly in the form of fear. If you withstand the fear, the things that you fear will not come. But if you allow the fear to remain, you will give Satan the opportunity to do the very things that you fear.</p>
<p>Therefore, in order for God&rsquo;s children to withstand the work of Satan, the first thing they have to reject is fear. When Satan puts a fear in you for this or that thing, you must not give in to this fear. You should say, &ldquo;I will never accept what the Lord has not measured to me!&rdquo; Once a person is delivered from fear, he is delivered from Satan&rsquo;s realm. This is what Paul meant when he said, &ldquo;Neither give place to the devil&rdquo; (Eph. 4:27).</p>
<p>Why do we not need to fear? We do not fear &ldquo;because greater is He who is in you than he who is in the world&rdquo; (1John 4:4). If we are fearful, it is because we are ignorant of this fact.</p>
