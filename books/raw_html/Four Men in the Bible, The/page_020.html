<h1 class="title">LIVING IN THE SPIRIT<br />
AND WALKING BY THE SPIRIT</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Date: February 11, 1972</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Phil. 1:19-21a; 4:23; 2 Tim. 1:7; Rom. 1:9; 12:11; 1 Cor. 2:4; 5:3-4; 16:18; 2 Cor. 12:18b; Rev. 1:10; 21:10; Eph. 2:22</h1>
<h2 class="head1">THE GRACE OF THE LORD BEING THE BOUNTIFUL SUPPLY<br />
OF THE SPIRIT OF JESUS CHRIST</h2>
<p>Second Corinthians 3:17 says, &ldquo;The Lord is the Spirit.&rdquo; Our Lord is the God who created all things and who came in the flesh, passed through human living, died, and became the life-giving Spirit in resurrection. All His accomplishments are in this Spirit. In other words, as the all-inclusive Spirit, the Spirit includes God, God becoming flesh, human living, crucifixion, the effectiveness of crucifixion, as well as resurrection, ascension, and glorification. Every positive element is included in this all-inclusive Spirit. The Lord Jesus whom we believe in, follow, love, serve, and enjoy is the Spirit.</p>
<p>As water, He quenches our thirst. As ointment, He anoints His element and essence into us; as the seal, He seals us in His image to be like Him; and as the pledge, He is our enjoyment and the foretaste of our enjoyment of Him in the future. This is the Lord Jesus who lives in us today.</p>
<p>Philippians 1:19 speaks of &ldquo;the bountiful supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ.&rdquo; In Greek the term <em>bountiful supply</em> implies an all-inclusive supply. Among the ancient Greeks, there were musical choruses in which a choragus, a leader or director, was responsible to provide for all the needs of the chorus, whether it was food, clothing, lodging, or transportation. He even supplied the musical instruments for their performances. If someone needed clothing, the choragus would supply him with clothing; if someone needed food, the choragus would supply him with food; if someone needed sleep, the choragus would supply him with a place to sleep. The choragus was responsible for supplying every need of the chorus. The term <em>bountiful supply</em> in Greek refers to the supply of a choragus. Paul used this term to refer to the bountiful supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ in us. Whatever we need, He supplies. If we have sin and need forgiveness, He supplies forgiveness. If we are weak and need power, He supplies power. If we are in darkness and need light, He supplies light. If we are foolish and need wisdom, He supplies wisdom. If we are afflicted and need comfort, He supplies comfort. Whatever we need, He supplies. The supply that He inwardly gives to us is bountiful, all-sufficient, and all-inclusive.</p>
<p>We can magnify Christ in our bodies because we have this supply. Since we have the bountiful supply of the Spirit in us, we can magnify Christ in our bodies in any situation, whether good or bad, life or death, joy or sorrow, rich or poor. If we want to cross over a &ldquo;sea,&rdquo; He is our &ldquo;boat.&rdquo; If we want to ascend to the heights, He is our &ldquo;airplane.&rdquo; We do not need to fear anything, because He is everything, and He supplies everything that we need so that we can magnify Him. Eventually, we will say, &ldquo;To me, to live is Christ&rdquo; (v. 21a). If we have not experienced this all-sufficient and all-inclusive Spirit, we will not be able to say, &ldquo;To me, to live is Christ.&rdquo; We must experience this all-sufficient Spirit and enjoy His bountiful supply. Then we will say, &ldquo;As always, even now Christ will be magnified in my body, whether through life or through death. For to me, to live is Christ&rdquo; (vv. 20-21a).</p>
<p>The last verse of Philippians says, &ldquo;The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit&rdquo; (4:23). <em>The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ</em> in chapter 4 is equal to <em>the bountiful supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ</em> in chapter 1. Philippians begins by speaking of the bountiful supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ and ends by speaking of the grace of the Lord Jesus Christ. This indicates that the grace of the Lord Jesus Christ is the bountiful supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ. The bountiful supply is the grace that has been freely given to us. The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ, which is His bountiful supply, is in our spirit; hence, Paul says, &ldquo;The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit.&rdquo;</p>
<h2 class="head1">NOT BEING TROUBLED BY OUR MIND<br />
BUT TURNING TO THE SPIRIT TO ENJOY THE LORD</h2>
<p>As human beings, we are not simple. Even though we have a spirit, we also have a disagreeable and troublesome soul. This can be illustrated by the Chinese character for <em>soul,</em> which includes the radical for <em>devil.</em> The character is written as a combination of <em>devil</em> and <em>say</em>. Therefore, the character for <em>soul</em> implies the devil speaking, or the devil expressing opinions. Every time we express our opinions, our soul is active, and this activity is of the devil. Opinions come from the mind, and our mind is the most troublesome part of our soul. For example, if we are laboring with a brother and quarrel over a certain matter, our thoughts concerning him will be easily affected. For example, we may criticize his attitude, or we may think that he has been disrespectful toward someone. If these thoughts are not dealt with, there will be no way for us to coordinate.</p>
<p>Conflicts also inevitably arise when sisters take measure of their husbands according to their thoughts. Similarly, those who live in a brothers&rsquo; or sisters&rsquo; house must learn to continuously exercise their spirit, not their mind. Without such an exercise, they will measure one another according to their mind and be continuously displeased with one another. We all need to exercise to live in spirit. The grace of the Lord is not in our mind, not in our emotions, and not in our will. His grace is in our spirit. As long as we live in spirit, we can enjoy the Lord&rsquo;s grace. This is a simple matter. For example, if a lamp in our home is connected to a power plug, we simply need to turn on the switch in order for light to shine. However, if we do not know about the switch, we may try to turn on the light by adjusting the light bulb on the ceiling. This would be useless and even foolish.</p>
<p>Today our Lord, as the all-sufficient Spirit, is the bountiful supply of grace in our spirit. Philippians 4:23 says, &ldquo;The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit.&rdquo; We must always turn to our spirit. When we are weak and turn to our spirit, we become strong. When we are in darkness and turn to our spirit, we become bright. When we are in anguish and turn to our spirit, we are comforted. When we do not know which way to take and turn to our spirit, we become clear. In every situation we need to turn to our spirit. Even when a husband and wife are about to quarrel, they need to turn to their spirit, kneel down, and call upon the name of the Lord. They must turn to their spirit. Consider what would happen if the husband prayed, &ldquo;Lord, I am about to argue with my wife. Give me the proper words to speak when I argue. Give me utterance when I release my temper.&rdquo; If he were honest in this way and touched the grace in his spirit, I truly doubt that he would have any desire to argue with his wife, and instead of releasing his temper, he would release his spirit. We all need to turn to our spirit.</p>
<p>Although it is very easy for a wife to bother her husband, the husband must learn to turn to his spirit, not to his mind, when he is in a bothersome situation. If a husband turns to his mind, his mind will cause problems and arouse his emotions even to the point of anger. Thus, he must turn to his spirit and simply say, &ldquo;O Lord.&rdquo; The more he is bothered, the more he needs to call on the Lord. He should not turn to his mind, because this brings in emotions, including anger. A bothersome situation is the best indication of our need to turn to the spirit. It is like a red light warning us to stop and turn to our spirit. Second Timothy 1:7 says, &ldquo;God has not given us a spirit of cowardice, but of power and of love and of sobermindedness.&rdquo; For power, we need to turn to our spirit. For love, we need to turn to our spirit. For sobermindedness, we need to turn to our spirit. In our spirit there is power, love, and sobermindedness. <em>Of power</em> refers to our will, <em>of love</em> refers to our emotion, and <em>of sobermindedness</em> refers to our mind. Our mind is clear and sober only when we turn to our spirit. Otherwise, our mind is muddled and cloudy. Furthermore, when we turn to our spirit, our emotions are adjusted, and we are able to receive others with a proper love. Furthermore, when we turn to our spirit, our will is steadfast, powerful, and exceedingly strong. In our spirit we have power, love, and sobermindedness.</p>

 	<h2>Noise Words</h2>
 	<p>Common words, such as "and", "is", "but", and "the", also known as noise words, are bypassed in a search. The search string, the Spirit &amp; who, would result in an error since who, which stands by itself, is a noise word. The following is a list of noise words:</p>
	<p>$, a, also, an, and, another, any, are, as, at, be, because, been, being, both, but, by, came, can, did, do, each, for, has, had, he, have, her, here, him, himself, his, how, if, in, into, is, it, like, make, me, might, much, my, of, on, or, our, out, over, said, should, since, some, still, such, take, than, that, the, their, them, then, there, these, they, this, those, to, too, very, was, way, we, well, were, what, where, which, while, who, with, would, you, your</p>

<div id="myModalRanking" class="reveal-modal">
  	<h2>Ranking</h2>
  	<p>Rank is a value from <strong>0</strong> to <strong>1000</strong> indicating how closely a match scored or ranked against the original search string. Rank values are affected by the following factors:</p>
		<ol>
            <li><span>The total number of occurrences of the original search words/phrases in a portion of a book.</span></li>
            <li><span>Content that includes the search words in close proximity to each other are ranked above those that do not. Therefore, a portion of a book that has the search words in close proximity may have a higher ranking than another portion of a book that has a higher hit count but the words are not in close proximity to one another. Therefore, we also include a search word hit count for reference.</span></li>
            <li><span>The rank values are relative to each other. Therefore, it is not possible to interpret the RANK value as a percentage or group the rank values into high/medium/low ranges. Think of rank as a method to order the results for a specific search.</span></li>

 	<h2>Search Scope</h2>
 	<h3>Include All Word Forms</h3>
	<p>This option breaks out the search string into its individual words and generates all conjugations and declensions for each word in the search phrase. A search on the word, dwell, would search for dwell, dwelling, dwelling's, dwells, dwelt, and dwelled.</p>
	<p>There is no need to use ^ (inflectional search) or * (prefix search) when using the Include all word forms search scope.</p> 
	<h3>Specified Word Forms</h3>
	<p>This option searches for exact matches of the specified words or phrases used in the search string. Use of ^ (inflectional search) with a particular word in the search string will broaden the search for that given word in that all conjugations and declensions for that word will be searched. Similarly, use of * (prefix search) with a particular word in the search string will broaden the search for that given word in that all words with that prefix will be searched as well.</p> 
	<h3>Note</h3>
	<p>Common words, such as "and", "is", "but", and "the", also known as noise words, are bypassed in a search. A list of all noise words is as follows:</p>
