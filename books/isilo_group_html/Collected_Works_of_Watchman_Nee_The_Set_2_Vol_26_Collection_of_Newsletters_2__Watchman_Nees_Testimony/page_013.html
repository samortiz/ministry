I have already completed one stage of the work here (please see my letter to the sisters for the details). Tomorrow I will go to Kung Yi Pu (about ten miles from here) because there are more than ten sisters there. On August 6 I will go to Kwangchow. I have made the arrangements for my trip to Hong Kong for August 11. From August 13 to 17, I will have a Bible study with the sisters in Hong Kong.</p><p>This is a good place to work. Transportation is very convenient. If someone wanted to preach the gospel, he would have many opportunities. Brother T'ang is a pure brother. But there is still a question as to whether or not he has really been called to do full-time work. Perhaps he will have to find a job in the future. Perhaps he is still waiting.</p><p>The brothers in the country do not have much knowledge about how to meet. There are two reasons for this: They lack spiritual edification, so they do not understand how to touch and follow the leading of the Holy Spirit in the meeting. There is also no one to train them. They are often wrong even in the matter of applying the hymns in the Little Flock Hymnal. They cannot be blamed for this. Therefore, I hope that something concerning the truth of the church (the gospel also, because it is the foundation) can be published soon. The formal version of the Little Flock Hymnal needs to be published soon with an explanation of what kind of hymn should be sung at what time so that this habit does not become so set that it cannot be changed.</p><p>Many things cannot be clearly understood unless one sees it with his own eyes. Therefore, I hope that the responsible brothers in the work will go to each locality to see for themselves when they have the opportunity. Then they will know the true shortcomings, needs, and strong points of every place and will be able to bear the responsibility to pray and help.</p><p>I feel even more that the gifted brothers and sisters should remember the entire church in the future. Once a meeting has been established for one or two years, the gifted brothers should not just sit in the same old place. If they do not travel, one locality will constantly improve while other places will never receive help or gain sinners for the Lord.</p><p>The publication is only good for some people. Many brothers and sisters need a face-to-face explanation. Therefore, every meeting place should have some who can speak directly to the congregation.</p><p>I really feel that the workers should come from the apprentices and not the schools. Those who were apprentices have assurance when they are working, while the students are prone to become idealistic.</p><p>It is difficult to say when I will return to Shanghai. (I am waiting for a letter from the co-working sisters before I will know.) During this time I have been praying that God would direct me concerning my path in the near future. Perhaps I will not be able to give myself to the publication work this year but will visit more places where there are sisters but which have no one to work among them. Therefore, I can only ask Mr. Witness to continue working on Collection of Newsletters. Thank God! There are more and more brothers in Shanghai now. May God choose more brothers to be co-workers in the literature work. May God bless you.</p><p>From,<br />Ruth Lee<br />July 31 in Kung Ho City, Taishan</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_012.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_014.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Collected Works of Watchman Nee, The (Set 2) Vol. 26: Collection of Newsletters (2) & Watchman Nee's Testimony &nbsp; pg 13</div><br></body></html>
