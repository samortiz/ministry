<h2 class="head2">Ch'eng-tu, Szechuan Province</h2><p>Thank and praise the Lord for answering our prayer and for preparing a suitable meeting place for us. The church meeting was moved from Brother Chao's house and Mrs. Shen's house into the new meeting hall. The house is spacious and the location is central. There are also eight to nine adjacent houses which can be used for hospitality. (They are now filled.) Thank the Lord that He has added more saved ones to the church. We had our fourth and fifth baptism meetings; four brothers and three sisters were added to us. Rev. Tsia Yu-ming recently visited Ch'eng-tu. He has a clear burden for these young brothers and sisters. Soon the winter vacation will begin, and we hope to have a conference lasting a few days. Lately, Brother Chao Rue-tze has been spending his time traveling and inspecting and supervising projects. He is seldom in Ch'eng-tu. Brother Tien Bi-sin's foot disease has been healed. All the brothers and sisters are experiencing the Lord's grace.</p><p>We would like very much to hear your teaching on the reality and practice of the church life. Every time we think of the idea that God is bringing us back to the beginning, our hearts rejoice, and we become stirred up and elated. Yet how fearful and careful we are! May the Lord manifest His glory in weak and unspiritual vessels so that all will see that the exceeding great power is of Him and not of ourselves. The sisters are taking turns having a prayer meeting in their homes on Wednesday afternoon. This began last week. The new address for the meeting hall is [omitted], but the meeting times are the same.</p><p>Brothers Wang Yung-gui, Liu Shi-shun, Ji Tsung-yu<br />January 21, 1939</p><h2 class="head2">Han River, Fukien Province</h2><p>Brother Tien-sin:</p><p>I returned to Han River from Fu-Ching on the twenty- second of this month and am now residing at home. My family is at peace, which is comforting to me. Brother Chen Bi-yin came from Ku-Tien last month and had meetings for a few days. Although it was a brief time, the opportunity was great because many believers were edified and some sinners were saved. Thank the Lord. May all the glory go to His name. Brothers Chen Jai-seng and Cheng Kwang-yu and Sister Weigh Kwang-ying and my niece left for Wu-Tung Village on the sixth of this month. They rented some houses and are engaged in evangelism work. I have heard that over twenty men and women have been saved. Presently, Brother Jai-seng is conducting Bible study meetings in the village to strengthen their faith. Please pray much for the work in Shang-Zi. Greetings to Brother Faithful Luk and his whole family.</p><p>Brother Jia-jeh, October 30, 1938</p><h2 class="head2">An-Hai, South Fukien<br />Sent from Kulangsu to Manila</h2><h2 class="head3">One</h2><p>The church in An-Hai (south Fukien) is under the Lord's blessing. There are now over fifty genuinely saved brothers and sisters breaking bread together. Every Lord's Day we have over a hundred people meeting with us. When an air raid came to An-Hai, all the brothers and sisters were able to stand fast in God's grace. Thank the Lord! Please pray much for us. Yesterday, I came to Kulangsu from Chuenchow, and I intend to go to Manila with Brother Wu Ren-jieh.</p><p>Brother Hsu Ching-en, September 5, 1938</p><h2 class="head3">Two</h2><p>Presently, Brothers Hsu Shi-chuen and Sun Ju-yee are bearing the responsibility of the church before God. Please pray for them so that they will understand God's heart and match His will.</p><p>Brother Chen Ke-san</p>
