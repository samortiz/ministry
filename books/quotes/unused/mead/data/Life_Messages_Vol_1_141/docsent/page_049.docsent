   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER TWELVE CHRIST OUR PORTION AND OUR LIFE</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Christ is the portion of the saints Col 1:12, Gk.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>. God has prepared this eternal, unlimited portion for us to enjoy.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Before we consider how we can partake of Him daily, let us answer some questions.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>How do we get in spirit and stay there?</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Many times we feel we are in our spirit, but a moment later we are out of it.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>To stay in your spirit, you need to learn to abide in the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The Lord today is the life-giving Spirit 1 Cor 15:45; 2 Cor 3:17 .</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>If He were just the Savior 1 John 4:14 and the Lamb of God John 1:29 , how could He get into us?</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>He could only be in the heavens Acts 2:32-35; Phil 3:20 .</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The Scripture says clearly, "Christ in you, the hope of glory" Col 1:27 .</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>He can only be in us as the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>How could we reach Him and abide in Him if He is confined to heaven?</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Even logically speaking, for the Lord to ask us to abide in Him surely indicates that His nature is spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The Greek word for spirit is pneuma, which is also the word for air.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Christ today is the holy air!</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>We have no trouble abiding in the air, and the air is obviously abiding in us!</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Like the air, the pneuma, He is in us and we are in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>If you remain there and let Christ remain in you, you will be abiding in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>According to our experience, however, we find that, in spite of our efforts and good intentions, unconsciously we slip out of Him.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>I may be in Christ while talking at the dining table, then suddenly realize I am out of Him.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>What has been the cause?</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>I talked too much.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Overtalking may get us out of the abiding.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>A hint to help you remain in spirit is found in 1 Thessalonians 5:17: "Pray without ceasing."</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>I used to wonder how anyone could pray twenty-four hours a day.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Gradually I came to realize that to pray in the spiritual life is to breathe.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Whether you are eating, speaking, or sleeping, you keep breathing.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Another kind of prayer is illustrated by drinking.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>This we do not do without ceasing!</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>We may drink with our meals, and perhaps also at mid-morning, mid-afternoon, and in the evening.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Drinking typifies customary prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>David said in Psalm 55:17, "Evening, and morning, and at noon, will I pray," indicating that he had this customary prayer at least three times a day.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Acts 10:30 also hints to us that in olden times people had set times to pray.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>This is a habit we all need to build up.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Spend at least ten minutes for customary prayer every morning.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Sometimes you may find yourself burdened to pray for an hour or more.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>This kind of praying is like drinking.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Unceasing prayer, which can be likened to breathing, is the key to remaining in spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>While I am speaking outwardly, I am praying inwardly.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>While you are operating your machine at work, you can be praying inwardly.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Practice saying "O Lord" whenever you feel you are not in the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>There is no need to pray with composed sentences.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Suppose you are on the verge of losing your temper.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Satan has filled you with anger against your husband.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>If you will pray "O Lord," the anger will be gone.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>If you think this is just a psychological technique, try saying "O Washington" instead.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>It will have no effect.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>"O Lord" is a prayer which brings you back to the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>As long as you keep breathing this way, you will be filled with the pneuma.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>The respiratory process is complicated and hard to understand, but breathing is easy.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Such is the simplicity of abiding in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Pray without ceasing.</S>
