   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Question: If a Christian who claims that he is Elijah, sent by Jehovah to help others, comes to our small group meeting, how should we handle him?</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Answer: We should simply tell him, We are open to all who are saved, but we will not receive such speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Let me escort you to the door.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Question: How can we get to know the actual situation of the people we contact?</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Answer: In order to do anything, we must have the proper knowledge.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>If you gave me an English essay to correct, but I did not know English, I could read it a hundred times and still be unable to correct it, because I do not have the necessary knowledge.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>I would need sufficient knowledge of English grammar in order to correct the essay.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Similarly, our ability to know people depends on two factors: how much we have learned and how much we know the spirit of others.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>We cannot know a person by listening merely to his words; we must touch his spirit with our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>How much we have learned to exercise our spirit determines our ability to know others.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>This cannot be learned in one day; it can only be learned over time.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>A person who handles fabric every day is able to tell whether a fabric is good or not simply by touching it.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Whether we are able to render some help to others depends on how much we know them.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Question: Many of us grew up in the children s meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>We love the Lord and the church, and we desire to serve Him full time.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>How do we conduct ourselves before the older saints who have seen us grow up?</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Answer: This is a difficult point.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>On the one hand, a prophet has no honor in his own country John 4:44; Matt 13:57 , but on the other hand, as your speech and mannerisms change, and you become stable and serious, the older saints will feel different about you.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The most important thing is to always appropriately present yourself before people.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>For this reason, when you return to your locality, you must be aggressive and make progress so that others will respect you.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The attitude of the saints depends on how you present yourself.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>This does not mean that we are pretentious or put on airs but that we are real.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Question: What do we do if a weak and backslidden brother comes to a small group meeting and expresses his negative views concerning the church?</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Answer: Everything depends on the circumstance.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Nevertheless, the brothers and sisters need a broad heart, and they need to be considerate of the weak saints who have not been meeting for a while.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>We should not be offended by what he says.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>However, if he does this every time, we should ask him to stop his negative speaking or to stay home.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Moreover, the saints in the small group should pray, asking for the Lord s leading concerning how to help such saints.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>We should not be quick to address the situation.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>We need a broad and patient heart, and we need to follow the Lord s leading in the situation to render him some help.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Question: Eighty percent of the saints in my small group are older saints who have been in the small group for some time; it is therefore easy for them to practice the group meeting as they have in the past.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>What should we do to turn them to the present practice?</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Answer: You should not be legal in adopting the present practice.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>You should not be reformers and attempt to change everything once you join a small group.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>You should simply meet with the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Gradually, as you gain their trust, you can begin to speak to them.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Even if you make no progress for a year, there is still the next year.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The Lord Jesus is full of patience toward us.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>With Him a thousand years are like one day 2 Pet 3:8 .</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Hence, we should not be anxious.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Our goal is to bring the brothers and sisters to exercise their life function.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Some of them might already have formed habits that are difficult to break; nevertheless, we must not cut them off.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The Lord will operate and raise up some who have the same vision and burden as we do.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>We should believe in the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>As you young people go to serve the Lord, you must avoid rushing into things.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Instead, you should exercise patience.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>This does not mean that you should not do anything, or that you should not be concerned or positive.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>On the contrary, you must be positive, concerned, and burdened but at the same time realize that you must not be hasty in the situation and circumstance.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>The saints may not be able to match your burden; hence, you need to give the Lord some time to raise up the proper atmosphere.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Then the saints will change their view and their attitude, and there will be plenty to do.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>This can be compared to a farmer who plants seeds and tills the ground in December.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>This is foolishness; his effort is in vain.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Instead, he should be actively getting ready and waiting so that he will be able to plant seeds when spring arrives.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>You should not be quick to do anything.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>You should not say, I have participated in the training.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Now I have a heavy burden to change the situation in my church.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>I guarantee that if you do this, you will fail.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>When you return, you should learn to be patient and wise.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>You should allow the Lord to change winter into spring in His timing.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>While you wait, you must pray to prepare yourself and also exercise to make progress.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>You should learn how to converse with the older saints.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>If you do not succeed, you can try another way.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>This is being aggressive, and this is the way to learn to serve the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>You need to learn in all these things.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Question: Since the success of a small group depends on whether the leading ones have a clear burden, should we have a training for the leading ones so that we may all get the help?</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Answer: This training is to charge you full-timers to be aggressive to learn so that when you join a small group meeting, you will function spontaneously.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>If it is needed, you may follow the Lord s leading and share a little concerning His present leading in the church in relation to the small group meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Your purpose is not to promote the small groups or to arrange the saints into small groups.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>That is organization.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Our desire is that you function in the Body and bring a little spark of fire with you.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>The church is not an organization; rather, the church is like an orchard with all kinds of trees.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Some trees may not grow so well for a time, but after a while an opportunity will arise, and the timing will be right.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>We must continue to meet, and the Holy Spirit will lead us.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>We are not an organization; there is no need to have a set of regulations.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>We have the Lord, the Spirit, and the Word.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>Question: Does the church have a plan for nurturing the brothers and sisters?</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>How do we help the brothers and sisters become persons who are faithful and prudent?</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>Answer: The church life is a life of nurturing.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>If we meet regularly, we will be nurtured and nourished.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>At the same time, the church life causes every saint s gift and talent to be manifested.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>Hence, the church life does not suppress the saints; rather, it encourages everyone to manifest his ability so that the gifts and talents are manifested.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>The churches should encourage the brothers and sisters to travel abroad to visit other countries.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>This is beneficial.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>However, we do not wish to make such things into rules, because the church is the Lord s organic Body; everything in the church depends on life.</S>
