   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER TWO HOW TO TAKE CHRIST AS OUR LIFE</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>We have seen that only God Himself as life within us can fulfill His divine purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>God has no intention to ask us to do something for Him.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>God's intention is for us to take Him as life into us.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Then He as our life will work out many things from within us.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>God's intention is that He could be life to us, but we need to see how we can take Him as life.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>THE GOSPEL OF JOHN BEING A BOOK OF LIFE</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The Gospel of John is a book of life.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>It tells us that Christ came that we may have life and have it abundantly 10:10 .</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>John tells us what Christ is and how we can take Christ as life.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Christ is many things to us in the book of John, such as the light 8:12 , the life, the way 14:6a , the door 10:9 , the bread of life 6:35 , the living water 4:10, 14 , etc. But these are just the items of what Christ is, not the substance, the essence.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>John 1:1 says, "In the beginning was the Word...and the Word was God."</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Christ is the Word v. 14 . John also says that this very Christ who is the Word and who is God is Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>John 4:24 says, "God is Spirit."</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>We need to combine John 4:24 with 1:1.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Christ is God, Christ is the Word, and Christ is the Spirit 2 Cor 3:17 .</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Christ is God as the source, Christ is the Word as the element, and Christ is the Spirit as the essence.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>So if we are going to take Christ as life, we have to contact the Spirit and the Word.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Without contacting the Spirit and the Word, there is no way for us to take Christ as life.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Christ is the bread of life, the spiritual food, but you need to contact the Spirit and the Word so that you can get this food.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Without contacting the Spirit and the Word, there is no way for you to take the food.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Christ is also the light.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>If you are going to enjoy the light, you need to contact the Spirit and the Word.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Without contacting the Spirit and the Word, there is no way for you to get the light.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Christ as the all-inclusive One is the Spirit within us and the Word outside of us.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>We have the Spirit within and the Word without.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>These are not two separate things, but two aspects of one thing.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>This one thing is Christ Himself as God.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Within us is the Spirit and outside of us is the Bible, the Word.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>In this substance, this divine element, are all the items of what Christ is: the life, the light, the food, the water, the air, etc. All are items of the same substance, which is the Spirit, the Word, and God.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Christ is God!</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Christ is the Spirit!</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>And Christ is the Word!</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>We have Christ today as God the Spirit within us and as the Word outside of us.</S>
