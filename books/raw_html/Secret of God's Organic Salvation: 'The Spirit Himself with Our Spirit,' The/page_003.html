<p>Prayer: Father, we extol You as the Lord of heaven and earth. It is of Your sovereignty that we can have this blending conference. Your blending is our blessing. Your blending is our growing. Your blending is our increasing. Your blending is our building. Your blending is everything to us. We long to be blended in the Body and to be blended as the chosen people, the heavenly citizens. Father, give us the new utterance, the up-to-date utterance, to utter what You have shown us. We are so weak, but we thank You that the indwelling Spirit joins us in our weakness. We trust in You and we rely upon You. We ask You to defeat Your enemy and to cover us against all his attacks. Amen.</p><p>The burden of these messages can be expressed in the following statements:</p><h2 class="head2">&ldquo;THE SPIRIT WITH OUR SPIRIT&rdquo;<br />The Secret of God&rsquo;s Organic Salvation</h2><p>1) The generating Spirit in our spirit, quickened by Christ, regenerates us, giving us authority to be the children of God, begotten of God.</p><p>2) The nourishing Spirit in our spirit, cherished by Christ, feeds us with the spiritual milk of the Word that we may grow unto salvation.</p><p>3) The sanctifying Spirit from our spirit, captivated by Christ, sanctifies us with the nature of God, making us holy unto God.</p><p>4) The renewing Spirit in our spirit, indwelt by Christ, renews us that we may put on the new man through the breaking of the cross.</p><p>5) The transforming Spirit in our spirit, filled by Christ, transforms us into the glorious image of Christ for His expression.</p><p>6) The building Spirit in our spirit, possessed by Christ, builds us into the house of God and the Body of Christ for Their dwelling.</p><p>7) The maturing Spirit in our spirit, enriched with Christ, conforms us to the image of Christ, the firstborn Son of God&mdash;the model of God&rsquo;s sons.</p><p>8) The sealing Spirit in our spirit, exulting with Christ, saturates us with and brings us into the glory of God for our glorification.</p><h2 class="head2">The Secret of God&rsquo;s Intensified Salvation</h2><h2 class="head2">The intensified Spirit in our spirit, drawn by the Lamb, motivates us to overcome the degradation of the church for the Body of Christ to consummate the New Jerusalem.</h2><p>All these points involve the Spirit with our spirit. Here the term <i>the Spirit</i> does not refer merely to the Spirit of God but to the consummated Spirit&mdash;the Spirit who has passed through the processes of incarnation, human living, crucifixion, and resurrection. This is the Spirit who, in John 7:39, was &ldquo;not yet, because Jesus had not yet been glorified.&rdquo; After Christ was glorified in resurrection, He became the life-giving Spirit (1 Cor. 15:45b). This life-giving Spirit is <i>the Spirit,</i> that is, the consummated Spirit.</p><p>The Spirit of God has passed through a process, and our spirit also has passed through a process. Our spirit was created by God, but through Adam it became fallen and deadened. However, our deadened spirit was redeemed by Christ and, having been redeemed, it has been quickened, enlivened, by the Spirit, who regenerated us. The consummated Spirit is in our regenerated spirit. When we speak of the Spirit with our spirit, we mean that the consummated Spirit is with the believers&rsquo; created and regenerated spirit. Now we need to see that the Spirit with our spirit is the secret of all the experiences of God&rsquo;s organic salvation: regeneration, feeding, sanctification, renewing, transformation, building, conformation, and glorification.</p><p>My burden in these messages is to present the best theology in eight sections concerning God&rsquo;s organic salvation plus one section concerning God&rsquo;s intensified salvation. The eight sections of God&rsquo;s organic salvation are regeneration, feeding, sanctification, renewing, transformation, building, conformation, and glorification. The additional section is intensification. These nine points cover much genuine theology. I believe that if you study these messages, which may be regarded as a theological lesson book, you will learn the best theology.</p><p>The title of this chapter is &ldquo;The Secret of Regeneration.&rdquo; In these messages we are using the word <i>secret</i> as a noun meaning skillfulness in doing things or in making things. Paul used this word in Philippians 4:12: &ldquo;I know also how to be abased, and I know how to abound; in everything and in all things I have learned the secret both to be filled and to hunger, both to abound and to lack.&rdquo; Paul had learned the secret, the skillfulness, of facing every kind of situation. The secret of these eight sections of God&rsquo;s organic salvation is the Spirit with our spirit. These two spirits working together is the skillfulness, the secret, of all spiritual things, especially of all the aspects of God&rsquo;s organic salvation.</p>
