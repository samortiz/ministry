[1]  CONTENTS The Divine Economy and Its Accomplishment The Apostle's Stewardship Dispensing the Riches of Christ
[2]  AND ITS ACCOMPLISHMENT Scripture Reading: Eph 1:9-10; 3:9-11; 1 Tim 1:3-4; Eph 1:23; 3:19b; 1:4-5, 7, 11, 13b; 4:30; 1:19-23 THE ECONOMY AND DISPENSING OF GOD
[3]  God's economy is His household administration to dispense Himself in Christ into His chosen people that He may have a house, a household, to express Himself, which household is the church, the Body of Christ 1 Tim 3:15 .
[4]  THE DIVINE ECONOMY The Arrangement of the Eternal Plan
[5]  God the Father imparts Himself into our being as our holy nature to make us holy and as our divine life to make us His sons so that we may have sonship.
[6]  Ephesians 1 reveals the Father's choosing and predestinating, the Son's redeeming, and the Spirit's sealing v. 13b . The sealing of the Spirit can be likened to a seal with ink being pressed upon a sheet of paper.
[7]  His redemption is not just a matter of redeeming us from sin; it is even more a matter of redeeming us into God Himself, into His very divine element.
[8]  If we would be faithful with our time and dedicate three hours each week for the sake of the gospel, we would at least be genuine apostles during those three hours.
[9]  You may be a salesman for a large company during your normal work hours, but when you go out to preach the gospel for the three hours which have been dedicated to the Lord, you are no longer a salesman, but an apostle fulfilling your stewardship to dispense Christ into people.
[10]  DISPENSING THE RICHES OF CHRIST The Stewardship of the Grace of God
[11]  The revelation of the mystery makes the apostle a minister, with the grace of God dispensed into him, to minister to the nations the unsearchable riches of Christ through the dispensing of the rich Christ vv.
[12]  Through the dispensing of the riches of Christ, Christ is ministered into sinners.
[13]  Christ has been ministered into us, so we now have Christ making His home in our hearts Eph 3:16-17 .
[14]  He is working and moving in the heavens, in the church, and in our environment, but His main work is to work Himself into us, to make home in our hearts, to get Himself settled down within us.
[15]  The glory of God is just the expression of what God is in all of His divine attributes.
[16]  Christ making His home in our hearts enables us to apprehend with all the saints the dimensions of Christ the breadth, length, height, and depth Eph 3:18 .
[17]  As we allow Christ to get settled in our inner parts through the dispensing of His riches into us, gradually we will realize with all the saints that the Christ we enjoy is unsearchable, unlimited, all-inclusive, and all-extensive.
[18]  When Christ is fully settled down within our hearts, we, the saints, are filled with the dispensing of the unsearchable riches of the all-inclusive Christ as the embodiment of the Triune God unto all the fullness of God for the corporate expression of the processed Triune God Eph 3:19b .
[19]  We have seen that the divine dispensing through the Father's choosing and predestinating, through the Son's redeeming, and through the Spirit's sealing causes us to have the Father's holy nature and divine life.
[20]  From my youth, I was told that the subject of the Gospel of John is Christ as the divine person, and that this book presents Christ as the very God.
[21]  According to the Gospel of John, the eternal God who created the heavens and the earth became a man.
[22]  He was the great God who created the heavens and the earth, but He came into a virgin's womb and remained there for nine months until His birth.
[23]  The work of assimilation is a good illustration of dispensing.
[24]  Immediately after eating, the fine work of dispensing begins in order to dispense the food into the cells, fibers, and tissues of our being.
[25]  to the Body as the Spiritual Essence of the Body,
[26]  One God as the Father of All, Who Is
[27]  over All as the Father, through All as the Son,
[28]  The divine dispensing taking place within us is the operating of the all-inclusive, life-giving Spirit, the pneumatic Christ, as the aggregate, totality, and consummation of the Triune God.
[29]  OF THE ORGANIC BODY OF CHRIST By Christ, the Head of the Body,
[30]  The perfecting of the saints by the gifts is for the work of the New Testament ministry, for the building up of the Body of Christ through the dispensing of the riches of Christ v. 12 . This perfecting is so that all the members may arrive at the oneness of the faith and of the full knowledge of the Son of God, at a full-grown man, and at the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ v. 13 . Perfecting is a matter of dispensing.
[31]  By the Members of the Body Holding to Truth
[32]  Ephesians 4:15 says, "But holding to truth in love, we may grow up into Him in all things, who is the Head, Christ."
[33]  Then out from the Head all the Body, joined closely together through every joint of the rich supply and knit together interwoven through the operation of each part in its measure, causes the growth of the Body, through the dispensing of the riches of the processed Triune God, unto the organic building up of the Body itself in love v. 16 .
[34]  The Divine Trinity is God Himself in His divine person, the divine life is the life of God, and the divine dispensing is the Triune God's dispensing of Himself into us as our life.
[35]  It gives us a particular and wonderful picture of how God came to be a man in order to dispense Himself into man that man may receive Him and enjoy Him as his inner life.
[36]  After God created man, He put him in front of the tree of life Gen 2:9, 16-17 , indicating that God wanted man to eat of Him and take Him as his life, causing man to become one with Him.
[37]  John 3:16 says, "For God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son, that everyone who believes in Him should not perish, but have eternal life."
[38]  God gave His Son to us not only that we may be saved through the Son, but even the more that He could dispense Himself into us.
[39]  First Peter 1:3 says, "Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who according to His great mercy has regenerated us unto a living hope through the resurrection of Jesus Christ from among the dead."
[40]  In the incarnation God became a man, but in His resurrection, Christ as the last Adam, a man in the flesh, became a life-giving Spirit 1 Cor 15:45 .
[41]  The breathing of the pneumatic Christ in His resurrection into the disciples dispensed the consummated Spirit as the consummation of the processed Triune God for the divine dispensing John 20:22 .
