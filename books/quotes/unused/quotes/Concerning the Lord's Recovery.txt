In both the Old Testament and the New Testament God's purpose, intention, and goal to have man as His expression is clearly revealed
Both Testaments give a clear record of how Satan, God's enemy, works to corrupt and destroy what God has accomplished
The Bible gives a clear picture not only of God's intention, but also of God's accomplishment according to His intention
Apparently, the Old Testament is simply a history of a number of great men plus a people, the nation of Israel
Actually the history of those great individuals and the nation of Israel is just the history of God's accomplishment
The whole Bible, including the Old Testament and the New Testament is a history book concerning God's accomplishment, God's move
The temple, which was the expression of God, was destroyed, and God's chosen people were carried into captivity
He is a purposeful God, and once He has made up His mind to do something, nothing can change His mind, and nothing can stop Him
God is wise, and in His wisdom He foreknew that what He wanted to accomplish with His creature, man, would not be so simple
Before He came in to do the real thing in the New Testament, He took the time to make a model in the Old Testament
If you have a clear view of the Bible you could see that the model in the Old Testament was the same as the real thing in the New Testament
The first forefather of the children of Israel was Abraham, who was called out of Babel, which later became Babylon
Humanly speaking, we pay attention to the size of something, but God cares, not about the size, but about the quality
By reading Ezra, Nehemiah, Haggai, and Zechariah you could see that the returned people were deeply dealt with by God
Their spiritual morality and character were higher than those of the children of Israel before the temple was built
The model was with the first Adam as a beginning, and the real thing was with the last Adam, the second Man, as a beginning
Within a short time as he had done in the Old Testament, Satan came in among the believers to do a ruining work
In Revelation 17 there is Babylon the Great, which includes Catholicism and all the Protestant denominations as the daughters
In the same principle all the Protestant churches also have gone away from Christ the Lord to things other than Him
In the eyes of God, Catholicism is the Great Harlot, and all the Protestant denominations and divisions are daughters of that Great Harlot
The Lord's recovery is really among us, and, although the scale is quite small, the standard of the character is higher than Christianity
Some have asked, Do you say that there are no genuine Christians in the Catholic Church or in the Protestant denominations?
Daniel had no chance to go back, but don't forget that he opened his window three times a day to pray toward Jerusalem
The Gospel of John was written to recover, his Epistles were written to recover, and Revelation was written to recover
Some of the churches had become corrupted and lost their testimony, so the seven epistles were written to recover them
Although the Lord's recovery existed even before Martin Luther, it was not noticed by the worldly people because it was hidden
The Lord was doing a recovery work there, and the Catholic Church was killing people who would take care of the recovery
Through all those centuries under the Roman Empire and under the Roman Church the recovery was going on strongly and forcefully
Today even some of the denominations use this term reformation in their name, such as the Dutch Reformed Church
Augustine said that the New Testament is concealed in the Old Testament, and the Old Testament is manifested in the New Testament
In the New Testament the Gospel of John begins with the tabernacle , and the last book of the Bible, Revelation ends with the tabernacle
John's Gospel says that in the beginning was the Word and the Word was God, and this Word became flesh and tabernacled among us
God created the heavens and the earth, the lifeless things, the vegetable life and the animal life, and eventually the human life
According to His purpose He made a plan to create the universe and to create man in the universe to express Himself
In the second chapter of the Bible, after man was created in the image of God, God brought him to the tree of life
You realize that you are fallen and sinful and weak and poisoned and corrupted and fragile in doing anything for God
During the night he had a dream in which he saw a ladder reaching into the heavens with the angels descending and ascending upon it
After four hundred years, God brought the children of Israel out of Egypt to Mount Sinai where He revealed the tabernacle to them
One day this tabernacle told the Jews that if they destroyed Him, He would raise up the temple within three days
Of course, they did destroy Him by crucifying Him on the cross, and He did raise Himself up in an enlarged way
On the one hand the church is the dwelling place of God, and on the other hand the church should be the fullness of God
When we come together with the fullness of God, an outsider would realize that this is the manifestation of God in the flesh
God was manifested in glory in His dwelling place, but they were corrupted by Satan in their morality and behavior
As we mentioned previously, the things in the Old Testament were a model, and the real things are in the New Testament
In the New Testament you have first of all an individual, Jesus Christ, who was God becoming a man to tabernacle among men
In the Bible there is such a divine thought that God wants to be man's food and man's drink to enable man to partake of God as life
Right after the creation of man, God brought man to the tree of life, indicating that man should eat of the tree of life
The central recovery of the Lord is to recover the divine life within us that God may have His expression among His people
We are here in the Lord's recovery, in the church life, not for the recovery of certain doctrines or practices
We are here for the central recovery of the divine life which we are possessing and enjoying and living by day and night
We don't have a regulation that says all the sisters in the church life should have their skirts a certain length
We don't have any regulations; we only have the recovery of the divine life within us for the expression of God
In the last message we pointed out that the first time man is mentioned in the Bible it says that he was created in the image of God
Following Adam was the second man, Abel, who was the landmark of man being brought back to God according to the divine way of salvation
In the Old Testament He was called Jehovah and Enosh was the first in human history who called upon this allinclusive One this great To Be
The fifth landmark was Noah who not only walked with God but also had a common interest with God and worked with God
In the father, Abraham, there was the calling by God out of the idolatrous world into the sphere of the full enjoyment of the riches of God
In the son, Isaac, we can see a person who inherited and possessed and enjoyed all the riches of God typified by the good land
The grandson of Abraham Jacob shows a person who was chosen and selected by God to a destiny that is to be transformed into a prince of God
Eventually Joseph as an annex to Jacob or Israel, the prince of God, reigned over the entire world and supplied them with food
After the tabernacle was completely built up, God's glory came down from the heavens in a visible way to dwell with man
On this earth there was a people among whom God had gained a dwelling place to express Himself in His expanded glory
It is good for the vegetable life, the animal life, for the human life and even for the divine life to be expressed through the human life
Eventually in Exodus the divine life came and dwelt in its splendid glory among the human life, even visible to the human eyes
Early in the morning they gathered manna, and they drank of the living water that came out of the rock which followed them
The tabernacle or the temple was the center of the history of these thirty-seven books from Leviticus to Malachi
When the Lord Jesus was the tabernacle traveling on the earth, He only traveled in a small country, the Holy Land
Whenever one section is completed in its rearing up, that section ends with this word, 'As the Lord commanded Moses'
The foundation was laid, not with cement blocks, but with one hundred silver sockets, each of which was made of one talent of silver
The ark was then covered with a lid, which the King James Version translates into mercy seat but which is better rendered propitiation cover
The incense altar was placed in the middle of a triangle formed by the showbread table, the lampstand, and the ark
At the altar there is not only the sin offering and the trespass offering but also the burnt offering and the meal offering
When we got into the outer court and we experienced Christ as our trespass offering and sin offering at the cross, the altar, we got saved
Although you may not have received this kind of teaching in the past, you surely had the experience to some extent
Many Christians, after their conversion at the cross, enjoyed Christ for a time, but then gradually went back to the world
Today very few Christians who have enjoyed the cross of Christ would go on and go forward to enter into God's expression
Once we go forward into the tabernacle we will reach the showbread table which has the heavenly bread, the bread of life
At the altar in the outer court you can enjoy the meal offering, but it is not so enjoyable as eating of the showbread at the table
In John 6 we are told that Christ is the bread of life , the bread from heaven , the bread of God , the living bread , and the true bread
When you enjoy Christ as your life supply you not only get the satisfaction, but also the enlightenment, the light
During the past few months many of us have practiced every morning to take the Lord as our sin offering and trespass offering at the altar
From the shining of this light we go onward to enter through the veil and to the ark, which typifies Christ Himself
At least a few times you have experienced that when you were walking and living under the light you were full of regulations within
In the church life we don't have even one regulation, but when you enter into the veil, you enter into the Ten Commandments
Dont consider that this is too hard because close to the Ten Commandments as the law of life there is a pot with hidden manna to supply you
On the altar there is food, and on the incense altar there is the sweet smell of an incense ascending to God to please Him
The Triune God has been wrought into His redeemed people to make Himself one with His people and to make His people one with Him
Today the Lord is going to recover the real mingling of divinity with humanity so that God might have an expression on this earth
If we would participate in God's expression or be God's expression, we must have the full and adequate experience of Christ
There are some subjective aspects because at the altar we could eat part of the meal offering and part of the peace offering
When we enter into the tabernacle and go to the table, we enjoy Christ altogether inwardly, taking Him as our food and life supply
The manna is not only within the tabernacle but also within the veil, within the golden ark and even within the golden pot
In recent messages on the Gospel of John, we pointed out that John is the fulfillment of the tabernacle and all the offerings
God made us in His own image just as a glove is made in the form of a hand with the intention that one day a hand would get into the glove
God made us in His image with a spirit for us to receive Him so that He might come into us to be our life and our content
Later Noah came on to the scene, not just to walk with God, but also to work with God and to have a common interest with God
John, of course, was writing to the Jewish people, and they all surely understood what he meant by a tabernacle
They knew that a tabernacle was a dwelling place for the God in the heavens to come down to the earth to dwell in for His expression
The Jews, though, being blind due to their traditional religion, hated this One, and tried their best to kill Him
While they were trying to kill Him, this wonderful One told them to destroy the temple, and in three days He would raise it up
God was man's portion, but in the fall man fell away from God and lost God, so man turned to his own invention, human culture
All these things culture, religion, ethics, and tradition are four layers upon your eyes to veil you from seeing Christ as God's expression
They consider that they have the typical religion, a religion founded by Moses according to the Holy Scriptures
When the Lord Jesus was on the earth, for the last three and a half years He was opposed by the Jews mainly due to Judaism
They had their inherited religion which was so typical, so right, and so holy, yet the Lord Jesus indicated that they were blind
Today if you talk to people who are in the Catholic Church you will realize that Catholicism is a thick veil upon their eyes
They lived together, they ate together, they walked together, and they worked together for three and a half years
What they needed was a second Comforter, actually just Himself as the Spirit of reality, to come and enter into them
John 14:16-20 says that the second Comforter who is the Spirit of reality will come to be with them and in them
On the day of resurrection they would know that He was in the Father and that they were in Him, and He was in them
There cannot be Jew nor Greek, there cannot be slave nor free man, there cannot be male and female; for you are all one in Christ Jesus'
Dear saints, this is the expression of God which to some extent has been lost, missed, neglected, and even opposed by today's Christianity
The lover becomes the Son's and the Father's dwelling place, and the Son and the Father become the lover's dwelling place
Just as the Father is in the Son, and the Son is in the Father, so all the believers in the Son may be in both the Son and the Father
Vincent, in his Word Studies in the New Testament, tells us clearly that the preposition 'into' implies a spiritual and mystical union
We were outside of the Triune God, but through baptism, we were baptized into the Triune God, into a spiritual and mystical union with Him
To have Christ formed in us means to have Christ saturate every part of our inner being our mind, our emotion, our will, our thinking
Colossians 1:27 tells us that Christ the Son is in us, and Ephesians 4:6 tells us that the Father also is in us
The Lord is working to recover the Triune God wrought into our being and living in us, with us, and through us for His expression
After those two landmarks, Enosh, Enoch, Noah, Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, and Joseph followed as individuals to express God
The Lord Jesus told His disciples that He was going to die and be raised up that He might be enlarged and increased
He showed His disciples His hands and His side , indicating clearly that after resurrection He still had a body, but not in the natural form
The Apostle Paul in 1 Corinthians 15:35-38 illustrated such a change in form, such a transformation, by a seed
It still has a form, but it changes from a little round yellow or brown ball into the form of a sprout, so tender and green and lovable
Before falling into the earth it is one grain, but after falling into the earth and rising up, it becomes many grains
While they were meeting together in the night with the doors closed for fear of the Jews, the Lord Jesus appeared to them
While they were under the threatening of the Jews and while they were so sorrowful, suddenly He appeared among them
He showed them His hands and His side, and the disciples realized He was not a phantom, but that He was their beloved Lord
He was material because He was touchable, and He was spiritual because He came in without the door being opened
How could He enter into you and take you as His abode, and how could you enter into Him and take Him as your abode?
After speaking this He breathed into them and told them to receive the Holy Pneuma, the Holy Spirit, the Holy Air
The Lord Jesus came to train His disciples to realize His invisible presence because they were used to His visible appearance
It may be that the Lord Jesus did something to keep all the fish away, because they fished the entire night and caught nothing
After taking away the sin of the world as the Lamb of God, He took another step to become the life-giving Spirit
The Redeemer who has become the life-giving Spirit has to enter into you, and then He becomes the very way of life for you to enter into God
From the context of 2 Corinthians chapters two, three, and four you can realize that the Lord here is Jesus Christ
It is the Spirit of life the Spirit of God the Spirit of Christ the Spirit of the One who raised Christ from among the dead and the Spirit
God has put us into Christ that Christ might be our wisdom, our righteousness, our sanctification, and our redemption
How could a person be your wisdom, your righteousness, your sanctification, or your redemption unless that person becomes one with you?
Corinthians 13:14 says, 'The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ, and the love of God, and the fellowship of the Holy Spirit be with you all'
With Christ the Son there is grace, with God the Father there is love, and with God the Spirit there is fellowship
He wants to fill you so that every part of your entire being might be filled unto overflowing with the Triune God
Such a church is one with the Lord through faith in baptism that God the Father may be above them and through them and in them all the time
In the church life there is a kind of life metabolism causing us to drop the old and to replace the old with the new
In Philippians 1:19-21 Paul only cared for the bountiful supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ which would turn out to his salvation
By reading Colossians 2:9 we can realize that the very Christ who is Christifying us is the very embodiment of God
In 34 we have this One as our life and in 310 we are being renewed to be a new man in which there is no race no social rank and no culture
In this book you have two main categories of things: first, you have the church with its consummation, which is the New Jerusalem
You have all the things other than the church in the entire universe, which will be judged, condemned, and burned
If you go back to Genesis 2 you can see that the tree of life is the positive source, and the tree of knowledge is the negative source
The divine life is nothing less than the Triune God the Father, the Son, and the Spirit as our life and our life supply
Because the Gospel of John and the Epistles of John are on the divine life, we should not consider that the Revelation of John is different
If you know what is in Revelation, you could see that nearly all of the signs included in the Old Testament are here
The lampstand was mentioned in Exodus the first time , the second time in 1 Kings , and the third time in Zechariah
If you don't have the book of Revelation you cannot know what is the real issue, the real outcoming, of the lampstand
Between the lampstands in Revelation 1 and the New Jerusalem in Revelation 21 and 22, there are the tree of life and the manna
John mentioned the Lamb of God in chapter one when he said, 'Behold, the Lamb of God Who takes away the sin of the world'!
The consummation of the lamb is in Revelation 22:1, where the river of water of life proceeds out of the throne of God and of the Lamb
Nearly everything in the book of Revelation can be found in the Old Testament because Revelation is a conclusion to the entire Bible
The Bible tells us clearly, not only in Revelation, but also in Zechariah that the seven lamps are the seven Spirits
It is right to say that the Lord's recovery is to recover the local church, but it depends upon your understanding
Suppose an outsider visits a local church and he hears the older sisters gossiping and the younger sisters murmuring
It is, no doubt, a composition of human beings, but all these human beings are saturated with the heavenly gold
The proper local church is simply a church which possesses the Trinity, enjoys the Trinity, realizes the Trinity, and expresses the Trinity
The practicality of God's expression is not only in Revelation chapter one, but also in chapters two and three
Verses 2:7 and 17 are promises of rewards to the overcomers that they may enjoy the tree of life and the hidden manna in the coming kingdom
What the overcomers will enjoy in the full taste in the coming kingdom, they should enjoy in this age as a foretaste
For the practicality of God's expression in the Lord's recovery, the Lord would feed us with all these particular portions of nourishment
Without such enjoyment of Christ, the church life in the Lord's recovery will be just an empty shell which has no value for God's expression
The New Jerusalem is the totality of all the past centuries, including all the positive things that were a part of God's expression
In the Old Testament no other book gives us such a complete revelation of God's economy and dispensation as the book of Exodus
There was the Passover , and there was God's mighty salvation to deliver all the people of Israel out of Egypt
The miracles wrought by God in the wilderness were through him, and he was the mediator for God to give the law to the people
The unity of the Jewish race through the centuries has been mostly due to the things they received through Moses
They have treasured the Ten Commandments, the Pentateuch, the tabernacle, the furniture of the tabernacle, and the priesthood
History tells us that through all these generations they have not known the spiritual significance of these things
They have not known the real significance of the ark which contained the law and the hidden manna and the rod that budded
Of course, they realized that the glory of God was there, but even that to them was a kind of outward appearance
Christ was the reality of the tabernacle and the priesthood, yet those who treasured the tabernacle and the priesthood opposed Him
He had learned all the things concerning the outward appearance, and yet he was taking the lead to oppose the genuine One
In the New Testament first of all the church was set up and the New Testament writings came out to unveil the mysterious allinclusive Christ
Because the Christians have been distracted from Christ, organizations have come in to replace the church practice
He was a genuine and dear brother, but he was used by Satan to make one error that the overseers are above the elders
Today the Lutheran Church strongly holds to the doctrine of justification by faith, but so many of the members are not justified
God's intention at Luther's time was not to recover justification by faith, but to recover His Son Jesus Christ as our righteousness
In the early days even the recovery among us was quite strong in doctrines and practices and not so strong in Christ the Person
All the articles were concerning leaving the denominations, baptism by immersion, head covering, and other outward practices
You may not have the basic understanding that God's intention is to have a recovery purely and wholly of the Person of Christ
When we are seeking to be holy, to be spiritual, to grow, and to do some spiritual thing, it is apparently right
If you look into Paul's and John's writings you can see they did not mainly teach us to seek this or to seek that
Many Christians today, including ourselves, are seeking after different things, but not directly after the living Person
In the same principle we may have the church life, but we have to ask how much we have experienced and enjoyed and gained Christ
They have not seen that through such a practical enjoyment of Christ, the enjoyers become the overcomers who will sit with Him on His throne
By this kind of nourishment we grow and are transformed into a white stone for the building of God's temple to be His expression
Even in eternity, the Father, the Son, and the Spirit the Triune God will be dispensed into His redeemed people continuously
When people ask us about the local churches, it is so easy just to talk about the ground and the one city and the one church
