   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>III.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>THE BOUNDARY OF ONENESS</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>NOT BEING GREATER THAN THE BODY A. The Oneness of the Church Being Limited</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>by the Boundary of the Body</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Many people have a certain concept about oneness.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>They think that as long as a man is a Christian in name, they can be one with him, whether or not he belongs to God, has life, and is a member of the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>But the oneness which the Bible speaks of is a oneness of the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The oneness which many people suggest today has gone beyond the boundary of the Body; it includes corpses and things which are foreign to the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>God s Word does not approve this kind of oneness.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Let me say emphatically that only the oneness of the Body can constitute the oneness of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The oneness of the church has the Body as its boundary; it cannot extend beyond the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Oneness does not mean that we have to be one with whoever bears the resemblance of Christianity or the name of a Christian.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>God s Word does not sanction this or say anything about it.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>B. The Wheat Not Being One with the Tares</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Many people like to quote Matthew 13.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>They say that the Lord likens His departure from the world to a man sleeping in the second parable.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>His enemy came and sowed tares in the midst of the wheat and went away.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>When the blade sprouted and produced fruit, the tares also appeared.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The slaves of the master of the house then came and said to the master, Do you want us then to go and collect them? v. 28 . The master replied, Let both grow together until the harvest, and at the time of the harvest I will say to the reapers, Collect first the tares and bind them into bundles to burn them up, but the wheat gather into my barn v. 30 . Many people have taken oneness to mean a oneness of wheat and tares.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>They think that oneness is not merely a oneness of the wheat but of the tares as well.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>But note that the Lord is not speaking about oneness here.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>He never said that believers and unbelievers should be mixed together.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>He said that believers should not kill unbelievers.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The Roman Catholic Church has done just that; they are ready to uproot all tares, that is, all those whom they consider to be heretics.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>We know that they are wrong not only in principle but also in practice.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>They have uprooted not only the tares but also the wheat.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>They are wrong both in principle and in practice because they consider Protestants to be heretics.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The Lord did not tell us to uproot the tares from this world.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>He said that there should be a proper separation in the church.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>When the Word speaks of letting both grow together until the harvest, it does not mean to let both grow together in the church.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>It means to let both grow together in the field the world.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>In the interpretation of the first parable, the field is the world.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>In other words, it is not necessary to remove all nominal Christians from the world.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>There is no need to kill them as the Roman Catholic Church has tried to do.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>We should leave them alone in this world.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>But this does not mean that oneness among Christians should include tares.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>1.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The Church Not Including Unbelievers</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Within so-called Christian organizations, sects, and denominations, there are many unbelievers.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>They tolerate unbelievers, that is, they allow the tares to remain in the church.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The Lord did not speak of allowing tares to remain in the church.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>He only said to allow them to remain in the world.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The Lord charges us to keep our Christian oneness in the church, not in the world.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Today there are many people who, like the Roman Catholic Church, will not tolerate the tares in the world.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>They try to uproot all the tares from the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>This is one extreme.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Another extreme is to include unbelievers in the church.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>This is what some groups practice.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>In the state churches, as long as one is a citizen of that country or born of that country, he can be baptized and be a member of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Whoever is born in that country can be a Christian in that country.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>These churches have opened their doors to unbelievers.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>This is wrong.</S>
