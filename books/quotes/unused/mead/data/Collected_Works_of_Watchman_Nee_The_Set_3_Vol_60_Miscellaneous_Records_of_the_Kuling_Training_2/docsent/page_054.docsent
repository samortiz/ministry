   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>The Contrast between</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>God's Kingdom and Righteousness</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>and a Man's Daily Necessities</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Matthew 6:32-33 says, "For your heavenly Father knows that you need all these things.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>But seek first His kingdom and His righteousness, and all these things will be added to you."</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Before a person believes in the Lord this is especially true with poor people , the daily thoughts that plague him are for his daily necessities.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Things pertaining to food and clothing are the greatest concerns of the human life.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>No unbeliever is an exception to this.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>But as soon as a person believes in the Lord, he turns to seek first the kingdom of God and His righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>As believers, we have to realize that nothing in this life is more precious than the kingdom of God.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Matthew 13:44 says that the kingdom of the heavens is like a treasure hidden in the field.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>When a man finds it, he hides it and in his joy sells all that he has to buy that field.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>This refers to the Lord's discovering the treasure of the kingdom of the heavens and giving up Himself and all He has to buy the treasure.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The Lord considers the kingdom of the heavens as something precious.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Yet man does not treasure it.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Only a believer with the Lord's view knows the preciousness of the kingdom of the heavens.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Before a man believes in the Lord, he may not find it too hard to take care of his daily physical needs even though he may be poor.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Since his life has nothing to do with the kingdom of God, he can lie or resort to other unrighteous means to meet the needs of his livelihood.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>After he believes in the Lord, he enters a new realm.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>If he still lies to secure his daily needs, he may find his job secured, but he will lose the kingdom of God and His righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>If he refuses to lie, he may gain God's kingdom and righteousness at the expense of his job.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Which way should he choose?</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>An unbeliever has little scruples about lying because clothing and goods are the most important things to him.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>But a believer is different.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>He should first seek the kingdom of God and His righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Under such circumstances the workers should help the new believers in a definite way to make the right choice for that which is truly precious.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>We have to make it clear to them that food and clothing are for the body, but the body exists for the kingdom of God and His righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>As believers, we must first seek God's kingdom and His righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Between the Lord and One's Relatives</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Matthew 10:37-38 says, "He who loves father or mother above Me is not worthy of Me; and he who loves son or daughter above Me is not worthy of Me; and he who does not take his cross and follow after Me is not worthy of Me."</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>A father, mother, wife, and children are the most precious things to a man.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>They are the most important things a man has in this life.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>When these are not compared with the Lord, there is nothing wrong in loving them.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>But when a situation arises where we have to choose between the two, which one will we choose?</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>A man always chooses what is more precious to him, but which of the two is more precious?</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>We have to help the brothers and sisters know the real precious thing.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>We can ask new believers, "Whom will you choose?"</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>If they are not clear about this, they will be lost when they face temptations in the future.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The responsibility of providing proper guidance is on our shoulders.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>We have to tell the new believers, "If, for the Lord's sake, you have to draw a separation line between yourself and your parents, wife, and children, will you choose Him?</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>For His sake, that is, for the sake of the Lord who died for us, we should choose to be His disciples and follow Him."</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Our own kin are precious, but they are no comparison to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Our Lord is more precious than any of our kin.</S>
