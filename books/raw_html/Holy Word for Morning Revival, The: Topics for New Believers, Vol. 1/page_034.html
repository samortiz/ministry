<p class="bold">WEEK 5 — DAY 6</p><h2 class="uhead1">Scripture Reading</h2><p class="bold">Rom. 12:2 &nbsp;And do not be fashioned according to this age, but be transformed by the renewing of the mind that you may prove what the will of God is, that which is good and well pleasing and perfect.</p><p class="bold">1 John 2:15 &nbsp;Do not love the world nor the things in the world.…</p><h2 class="head1">The Scriptural Basis</h2><p>[The following references give the scriptural basis for dealing with the world: James 4:4, Romans 12:2, and 1 John 2:15-17.]</p><h2 class="head1">The Objects of Dealing with the World</h2><p>The world in our daily living consists of people, activities, and things which usurp the place of God in us. Therefore, these objects are the aim of our dealings.</p><p>How do we know what objects are usurping us, and what is the standard of measurement? First, we need to see whether these objects exceed the necessities of our life. We can say that anything that goes beyond our daily necessities is taking the place of God and possessing us; thus, it needs to be dealt with.…For example: clothing as a necessity is not worldly, but if one pays too much attention to apparel and ornaments, or squanders money in order to comply with present-day fashions, he has already exceeded the scope of his daily necessities. Consequently, these excesses have become his world.</p><p>What is the standard that regulates our daily necessities in regard to people, activities, and things? In the Bible there is no uniform or specific standard governing these matters. God has ordained us to be born in different families, to receive different educational training, to have different professions, and to contact different social environments.…These various standards of living are sovereignly permitted.… Therefore, the standard of our living necessities must be determined by ourselves through prayer and seeking the mind of God. We cannot measure our standard according to that of others nor demand that they agree with our views and feelings.…From the divine viewpoint there is a certain measuring rule regarding the world. This rule is God Himself. As we measure sin by the law of God, so we measure the world by God Himself.…All that is unfitting and incompatible with God and all that does not measure up to God is worldly and unholy.</p><h2 class="head1">The Basis of Dealing with the World</h2><p>The basis of our dealing with the world is the same as dealing with sin.…We should deal with the world upon the basis of the inner feeling gained through fellowship. [Moreover, our dealing should be to the extent of life and peace within (Rom. 8:6).] Besides these…principles, there are two factors which greatly influence our inner feeling toward the world: our love for God and our spiritual growth in life.… [First], when our love for God causes us to meet God, who is light, He enlightens and exposes the world. Whenever this light appears, it shines away the world in us. [Second], our inner feeling towards the world also depends upon our spiritual growth. The more we advance in the spiritual life and knowledge of God, the deeper we will be in knowing the world.</p><h2 class="head1">The Practice of Dealing with the World</h2><p>If we wish to practice dealing with the world, we should pay our attention to one point—that is, to close our mind to the world.…Of course, it is very difficult to close our mind toward the thoughts of sin, because sin lives within us. Not until we are raptured will be delivered from this inward difficulty.…The difficulty of the world is something of an outward nature. The Bible states that sin dwells in us, but it never mentions that the world lives in us. Since the nature of the world is outward, it is easy to shut off thoughts of the world.…When we endeavor to deal with the world, we should be determined and violent to shut out any thoughts of the world. Not only should we close the door, but we should also bar it and even make this door into a wall. In this manner we can thoroughly solve the problem of the world.<sup>109</sup></p><p>Enlightenment and inspiration:</p>
