<p>In order for us to be holy, we first need to be separated unto God positionally. With respect to our family, neighbors, colleagues, and friends, we need to be separated. Many Christians, however, are saved, but not separated. Normally, once a person is saved, he should also be separated. This is the reason a believer is called a saint. Consider the majority of Christians today. They are virtually the same as the worldly people. With them, there is no separation. Many of their relatives and friends do not even know that they are Christians. But to be holy is to be separated unto God. This, of course, is a matter of position. (<em>Life-study of Ephesians,</em> p. 28)</p>

<p>As parents, we must do our duty with respect to our children. This means that we should not only teach them, but also set up an example for them to follow. Just as the Lord Jesus sanctified Himself for the sake of His disciples (John 17:19), so parents should sanctify themselves for the sake of their children. Those who do not have children may be free to do certain things, such as sleep late in the morning. But those with children do not have the liberty to do these things. For the sake of their children, they must be restricted. Children always imitate their parents. Therefore, it is the parents&rsquo; responsibility to set up a high standard and a proper pattern and example for their children to follow. (<em>Life-study of Ephesians,</em> p. 521)</p>
<h2 class="head1">ABSTAINING FROM WINE<br />
AND FROM ANYTHING RELATED TO ITS SOURCE</h2>
<p>&lsquo;&lsquo;He shall separate himself from wine and strong drink; he shall drink no vinegar of wine or vinegar of strong drink, nor shall he drink any juice of grapes, nor eat fresh or dried grapes. All the days of his separation he shall eat nothing that is produced by the grape vine, from the seeds even to the skins&rsquo;&rsquo; (Num. 6:3-4). Here we see that a Nazarite had to abstain from wine and anything related to its source. This signifies abstaining from the earthly enjoyment and pleasure (cf. Psa. 104:15; Eccl. 10:19). To abstain from all kinds of wine is to abstain from all kinds of earthly enjoyment and pleasure.</p>
<p>We should be careful of anything earthly that makes us happy. Earthly pleasure leads to lustful conduct and to a lustful intention. Earthly enjoyment and pleasure would defile a Nazarite.</p>
<p>A Nazarite had to abstain from vinegar made from wine, from the juice of grapes, and from grapes fresh or dried. This signifies abstaining from anything that issues in earthly enjoyment or pleasure. Vinegar is classified with wine because the source is the same. Wine, vinegar, and grape juice are all prohibited. From this we see that the one who is absolute for God is altogether separated from anything of earthly pleasures. This shows the absoluteness of the Nazarite. (<em>Life-study of Numbers,</em> pp. 57-58)</p>

<p>The Nazarite&rsquo;s separation was of seven days, signifying a full course of time. Samson was a Nazarite from his mother&rsquo;s womb for the full course of his life (Judg. 16:17). (<em>Life-study of Numbers,</em> p. 76)</p>

<p>[Samson&rsquo;s] birth was a miracle initiated by the appearing of the Angel of Jehovah. When Samson was in the bosom of his mother, he was sanctified to be a Nazarite. As he grew up, he was clean and pure according to God&rsquo;s ordination, and he was empowered by the Spirit of God.</p>
<p>Shortly after I decided to give up my job and serve the Lord, I went to Shanghai to see Brother Nee. He told me that in serving the Lord the brothers must learn the principle of not contacting a female, especially a young one, in private. I was deeply impressed by this, and from that time I have practiced Brother Nee&rsquo;s instructions and have also passed them on to the saints. (<em>Life-study of Judges,</em> pp. 45, 46)</p>

<p>Samuel came out of God&rsquo;s economy. God had His eternal economy, but the carrying out of God&rsquo;s economy had come into question. God had ordained that Aaron&rsquo;s descendants would be the priests for the carrying out of His economy, but that priesthood became stale and waning. God&rsquo;s heart&rsquo;s desire was to gain someone to replace that priesthood.</p>
<p>In order to gain such a person, God brought together in marriage Elkanah and Hannah. Elkanah had two wives. According to God&rsquo;s sovereign arrangement, the second wife, Peninnah, had children, but Hannah had no children. Furthermore, &ldquo;her rival provoked her bitterly to irritate her, because Jehovah had shut up her womb&rdquo; (1 Sam. 1:6). This forced Hannah to pray desperately not mainly for herself but for God. She promised God that if He gave her a male child, she would return the child to Him by the vow of a Nazarite. God was pleased with Hannah&rsquo;s prayer and her promise and He opened her womb. Hannah conceived, bore a child, and named him Samuel. From this we see that actually no human being was the origin of Samuel. God was the real origin, who motivated His people sovereignly and secretly.</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_034.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_036.html">Next</a> </body></html>
