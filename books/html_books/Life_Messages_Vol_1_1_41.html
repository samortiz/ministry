This matter has been neglected by today&#8217;s Christians. Neither fundamental Christians nor Pentecostal Christians care for it. To some degree, certain teachers have been concerned about this. However, their concept of the building is not accurate according to the New Testament. These teachers say that the building of the church is typified by the building of the Old Testament temple. The period of David was for the preparation of the building materials and the period of Solomon was for the actual building of the temple. They go on to point out that Christ is typified by both David and Solomon, David typifying Him in His suffering and Solomon typifying Him in His reigning. According to their application of these points to the church, during the time of Christ&#8217;s suffering, the materials for the building of the church are being prepared. Then when Christ comes again to reign, these materials will be brought together, and the building of the church will be realized.<h2 class=head1>TWO MAJOR MISTAKES</h2><p>If you do not consider the teaching of the New Testament, you may be influenced by this teaching concerning the building. Any interpretation of the Old Testament types, however, must correspond to the New Testament teaching. In this light we see that there are two major mistakes in the understanding held by these teachers. The first mistake is that they say that Solomon represents Christ only after Christ&#8217;s second coming. But according to Matthew 12, Solomon typifies Christ from the time of Christ&#8217;s resurrection. In Matthew 12:42 Christ even said that He was greater than Solomon. Because the greater Solomon was there already, it is not accurate to say that only after His second coming is Christ typified by Solomon. Immediately after His resurrection, Christ entered into His reigning, and today He is the King of kings. Therefore, today is not the time of Christ&#8217;s suffering. His time of suffering is over; it ended with His crucifixion.<p>David typifies Christ up until His crucifixion, and Solomon typifies Christ beginning from His resurrection. The materials for the building of the church were prepared, not before Christ&#8217;s resurrection, but after His resurrection, beginning no later than the day of Pentecost. This means that the materials are prepared after Christ&#8217;s resurrection, not in the period of His suffering.<p>The second major mistake made by these teachers regarding the building of the church is that they say that the building of the church does not take place today. But according to Ephesians 2:22, we are being built into God&#8217;s dwelling place right now. Therefore, it is not accurate to say that we are being prepared today and that we shall be built only after Christ comes again. Ephesians 2:22 says that we are being built, not that we are being prepared. According to the concept of some teachers, the building of the church is not yet; only the preparation of the materials is taking place today. This concept, however, is wrong. Although these teachers did have a concern for the building of the church, their understanding of it was not accurate.<p>In Matthew 16 the Lord Jesus spoke about the building of the church. After Peter received the revelation concerning Christ, the Lord said, &#8220;On this rock I will build My church&#8221; (Matt. 16:18). In saying these words, the Lord certainly did not mean that the building of His church would begin at the time of His second coming. At the latest, the Lord began to build the church on the day of Pentecost. In 1 Peter 2:5 Peter says that we are living stones being built up a spiritual house. This indicates that the building of the church is taking place today, not only in the future.<h2 class=head1>THE BUILDING OF THE CHURCH BEING THE GROWTH IN LIFE</h2><p>We thank the Lord for showing us that the building is taking place now. Moreover, He has shown us the way to have the building. Ephesians 2:21 says that all the building is growing, and the next verse says that we are being built together into God&#8217;s dwelling place. Thus, growing equals being built, and being built equals growing. This indicates that the proper building of the church is the growth in life.<p>In Ephesians chapter four we also have the thought of growth. Verse 13 speaks of a full-grown man (Gk.), and verse 15 says that we should hold the truth in order to grow up in everything into the Head, Christ. Furthermore, verse 16 speaks of the growth of the Body unto the building up of itself in love. Even verse 14 has the thought of growth, for it says that we should no longer be children tossed to and fro. To be no longer children is to have the proper growth. Therefore, in Ephesians 4:13-16 the thought of growth is found in every verse. According to these verses, the building of the Body comes through the growth in life.<p>In 1954 I first began to minister on the building of the church. At that time, however, the light I received was neither clear nor complete. I pointed out that, although hardly any Christians today care for the building or speak about it, the New Testament emphasizes it very strongly. Therefore, we must care for the building. Using the illustration of the construction of a meeting hall, I told the saints that, like the materials in the building, they must have someone above them, below them, in front of them, behind them, and on both sides of them. I told them that they had to know who was next to them in order to be built up with them. I gave the same kind of messages in the United States. However, after 1964 I discovered the awkwardness of speaking of the building in this way. Prior to that time, both in Manila and in Taipei, I could boast that I knew who was above me, under me, and beside me. However, after coming to the United States, I found it awkward to say this, for I found it difficult to say who was beside me. I came to realize that this illustration is not accurate because it applies only to a material building, a building with lifeless materials. Once these materials are put into a building, they do not move. We, on the contrary, are living building materials and are constantly moving.<p>Take the example of Aquila and Priscilla. Both in Rome and in Ephesus the church met in their home. Because Aquila and Priscilla had been built in, there was no problem with them wherever they lived. This type of building is much different from a building with physical materials. We are not a material building; we are a living house, living people who move about from place to place.<h2 class=head1>THE COMPLETION OF THE BUILDING</h2><p>In the entire universe God has just one dwelling place. The building of this dwelling place began, at the latest, on the day of Pentecost, and it is still going on. The process of building will be completed, not at the time of the Lord&#8217;s coming back, but at the end of the millennium.<p>According to the New Testament, from the time of Adam until the time of the millennium there are four ages: the age of Adam, the age of the law, the age of grace, and the age of the kingdom. The building of the church takes place during the age of grace and the age of the kingdom. It began on the day of Pentecost, the beginning of the age of grace, and it will be completed by the end of the age of the kingdom. Then the fullness of time with the New Jerusalem will come. Thus, the completion of God&#8217;s building will be in the new heaven and new earth, which will appear after the millennium. Although the New Jerusalem comes at the beginning of the millennium, its full completion, the completion of God&#8217;s building, will not be until the end of the millennium.<p>Although the building is going on today, the majority of Christians are not concerned about it and have no heart for it. They neither understand it nor speak of it. But God&#8217;s mercy has reached us, our eyes have been opened, and we have a heart for the building. My heart is very burdened for God&#8217;s building. My heart has been on this matter since 1954, and I have written a number of hymns about it. Today many of us have been captured by the vision of the building. We have seen that what the Lord is seeking today is the building. Without the building, there is no way for Him to come back.<h2 class=head1>GROWING IN LIFE THROUGH KEEPING THE ONENESS</h2><p>Now we come to what the building is. The building is simply the growth in life. I would remind you that the title of this message is building by keeping the oneness through growing in life. By considering our experience and by examining the Word, we have found that if we do not keep the oneness, we have no way to grow in life. Breaking the oneness spoils the growth in life. Genuine growth in life is safeguarded by keeping the oneness. In other words, once the oneness is damaged, there is no growth in life. This is not a mere doctrine; it is our experience. Through our experience we have learned that true growth in life is in the keeping of the oneness. We may advance in knowledge or improve our behavior, but we cannot have the genuine growth in life apart from keeping the oneness. The genuine growth in life is regulated by the maintaining of the oneness. Thus, it is crucial that we know how to be one.<h2 class=head1>KEEPING THE ONENESS AND ARRIVING AT THE ONENESS</h2><p>Ephesians 4:3 tells us to keep the oneness of the Spirit (Gk.), and in verse 13 we see that we need to arrive at the oneness of the faith and of the full knowledge of the Son of God (Gk.). In these verses we see the two ends of oneness: keeping the oneness and arriving at the oneness. On the one hand, we have the oneness already. If not, how could we keep it? Keeping it implies having it. The oneness we have already is the oneness of the Spirit, and the oneness of the Spirit is the Spirit Himself. Because we have the Spirit within us, we have the oneness. Now we simply need to keep it. For example, the lamps in the meeting hall have the same electricity. The electricity within them is their oneness. They are one not in themselves, but in the electricity. Likewise, we have the one Spirit in us. This Spirit is our oneness. Hence, the oneness is called the oneness of the Spirit.<p>We need to keep this oneness until we arrive at the oneness of the faith and of the full knowledge of the Son of God. At one end of the oneness is the oneness of the spirit, and at the other end is the oneness of the faith and of the full knowledge of the Son of God. We need to keep the oneness of the Spirit as we go on to arrive at the oneness of the faith and of the full knowledge of the Son of God.<p>The oneness of the faith and of the full knowledge of the Son of God is a full-grown man. Arriving at this oneness means arriving at a full-grown man. This oneness is also the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ. Christ has a fullness, the fullness of Christ has a stature, and the stature has a measure. Thus, Ephesians 4:13 speaks of the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ. As a man, I have a stature, and my stature has a measure. The measure of this stature is my fullness. The oneness of the faith and of the full knowledge of the Son of God is both the full-grown man and the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ.<h2 class=head1>ARRIVING BY GROWING IN LIFE</h2><p>Although we have not yet arrived at a full-grown man, at the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ, our destiny is such an arrival. Today we are on the way. Some of us may be very close to this destination, and others may be quite far from it. The way to arrive is by growing in life. The more we grow, the closer we come to the end. When we are fully grown, we shall arrive at our destination. This means that full growth is our destination. Thus, the process of coming to our destination is the growth in life.<h2 class=head1>DIFFERENCES ACCORDING TO GROWTH</h2><p>In a family there are the grandparents, the parents, and children of various ages. According to Ephesians 2:19, we are God&#8217;s family. In God&#8217;s family, as in a human family, we are at different stages according to our growth. Therefore, there must be differences among us; yet we are all in the same family. The little ones may cry or fight over their toys. This fighting, however, is normal and even somewhat necessary. But as the children grow, they should no longer fight over toys. All the ages are included in the family. The older ones cannot exclude the young people, and the young people cannot exclude the very little ones. If we exclude any, we break the oneness. In such a case, the oneness of the family is damaged.<p>In Ephesians 4 we can see this matter of differences. Do not be concerned whether these differences are right or wrong; they are normal. Although my wife and I are no longer young, we do not exclude any of our naughty grandchildren. If they never visited our home, we would miss them very much. This is the family life. All the churches in the Lord&#8217;s recovery need to be like this.<p>The problem with today&#8217;s Christians is that instead of a family, they have a class as in school. In an elementary school, children are grouped according to age. Nearly every Christian group is a class. But in the church we are not a class; we are a family.<p>The genuine oneness, the oneness of the Spirit, must come first. In order to keep the oneness of the Spirit, we must have the growth in life. Today we are all in the process of growing in life. As we continue in this process, there will be differences among us. If we do not have the growth in life, we cannot keep the proper oneness, for the oneness of the Spirit is maintained by the growth in life.<h2 class=head1>LOWLINESS</h2><p>It is in the growth in life that we have genuine lowliness (Eph. 4:2). Lowliness is not a human virtue. When I was young, the pastor advised us to be lowly. But the more he admonished us to be lowly, the higher we desired to be. Lowliness comes from the growth in life. If we would keep the oneness of the Spirit, we must have lowliness. Never think highly of yourself. The first requirement, the first prerequisite, of maintaining the genuine oneness is lowliness. Instead of considering ourselves so highly, we need to say, &#8220;Lord, I would like to be lowly. I don&#8217;t want to be high.&#8221;<h2 class=head1>MEEKNESS</h2><p>The second requirement is meekness. Meekness means not to resist. If we do not resist whatever happens to us, then we have meekness.<h2 class=head1>LONG-SUFFERING</h2><p>Along with lowliness and meekness, we need long-suffering. No place exhausts our endurance more than the church. The church exhausts everyone&#8217;s endurance. If you think that you are able to endure, the Lord will bring to you those who can exhaust you. We all need to be exhausted. The Lord&#8217;s intention is to exhaust us. The elders may expect the brothers to be nice and lovable and the sisters to be quiet and agreeable. But the more you expect the brothers and sisters to be like this, the more naughty they will be. The elders must be prepared to face the difficulties caused by naughty brothers and sisters. They will exhaust you to the uttermost and then, after exhausting you, will complain that you have no patience or sympathy. Thus, we need long-suffering.<p>In addition to long-suffering, we must bear one another in love. Instead of vindicating ourselves or justifying ourselves, we need to bear everyone. We should not only bear a few according to our preference, but all the saints. We need to bear them in our spirit to the throne of grace and pray for them. This is easy to talk about, but difficult to practice. For this we need the Lord&#8217;s mercy. Apart from His mercy, we cannot bear anyone. Those who have been elders for five years will agree with this, for they have suffered a great deal in the eldership, having been cut into pieces by the brothers and sisters. But this is our destiny, our life, our way. If an elder tries to drop the eldership, he will be through with the church life.<p>As we go on to the oneness of the faith and of the full knowledge of the Son of God, there will be differences among us according to the various stages of life. These differences are unavoidable, and we should not try to eliminate or reduce them. Rather, we need to allow the brothers and sisters to be what they are. This is the way to keep the oneness through lowliness, meekness, long-suffering, and bearing one another in love. There is no other way.<h2 class=head1>NOT UNIFYING THE SAINTS OR THE CHURCHES</h2><p>This is true not only among the saints, but also among the churches. Because all the churches are in different stages, we should not expect them to be the same. In a certain church there may be many young ones playing with toys. Instead of troubling them, we need to say amen to their toys. Today is not a day of unification. We simply cannot unify the saints. If we attempt to unify them today, new ones will come tomorrow. The same is true with the churches. We may have the ability to unify the churches today, but after a period of time some new churches will be raised up that are childish and even babyish. If we attempt to unify them, we shall kill them. Instead of unifying the saints or the churches, we should minister life to them and help them to eat well and grow normally. We need to help them to continue on in the unique oneness no matter what is their stage of growth. If we do this, we shall keep the oneness of the Spirit. We maintain this oneness by allowing the differences to exist.<p>If we practice this, the problems among the churches will disappear. The problems are all caused by our attempts to unify the churches. We want every age to be the same. But this is impossible. We are a very large family, and we are all on the way toward arriving at the oneness of the faith and of the full knowledge of the Son of God.<p>As we continue on in this process, we should be thankful for all the differences. For example, if in a certain locality you find something childish and babyish, do not be disappointed. Instead, you should praise the Lord for the new ones in that place. Sometimes we may visit a church that is full of experience, filled with grandfathers and grandmothers who are all very qualified. After visiting such a church, we may be convinced that it is the best because everything is excellent and there are no problems. However, a church without problems is a poor church. But a church with many problems is a rich church, perhaps even the best church.<p>Suppose my wife and I, two elderly people, have no problems. When you visit our home, you find everything quiet, neat, and in good order. After staying with us a few days, you may think that this is the best home. There are no arguments, but mutual love, sympathy, and serving of one another. But is such a family really the best family? The best family is one in which there are many children of various ages. However, you may find it difficult to tolerate such a family and prefer a family composed of two elderly people where everything is quiet and neat. After visiting the home of such an orderly family, you may be influenced to say that your home is poor because it is so noisy. Attempting to make your home like the home of the elderly ones, you kill it. Sometimes, however, the situation is the opposite. Certain ones may think that my home is too quiet and encourage us to adopt some young ones. The point of this illustration is that we need to make allowances for all. Do not go to a place either to change it or to be influenced to change your locality. Let every church be the way it is. Wherever you go, simply minister life to the saints. Do not change them, correct them, or attempt to improve them. This shows our faith in life; we trust in life. Because we believe in life, we can leave the saints and the churches to life, praying for them and ministering the life supply to them. Leave their condition entirely to life. If we do this, we shall keep the oneness of the Spirit and we shall grow.<h2 class=head1>THE TEST OF OUR GROWTH IN LIFE</h2><p>The extent to which we keep the oneness of the Spirit in this way tests how much growth in life we have. The more we grow in life, the more we shall be able to bear various kinds of differences. However, if you cannot go along with differences, you are still very young. But if you can go along with all kinds of differences, this indicates that you are quite mature. The more we grow in life, the more differences we shall be able to take. We shall not want to reduce the differences, change things, or correct the saints. Rather, we shall minister life to the saints and let them grow. If they give us some difficulty, we shall bear them in love. This is a sign of our health, of our growth, and of our maturity. But if we like to unify, to change, to correct, and to adjust, this is a sign that we are still immature. For the keeping of the genuine oneness, we all need to grow.<h1 class=msg>CHAPTER TWO</h1><h1 class=msg>HOW TO GROW IN LIFE</h1><p>In this message I want to fellowship with you about how to grow in life.<h2 class=head1>GROWTH IN LIFE BEING THE INCREASE OF CHRIST</h2><p>In the last message we saw that the genuine building is the growth in life. In the language of the New Testament, to be built is to grow. Most Christians, however, consider growth as merely a matter of improvement. But it is possible to have a great deal of improvement without any growth. The growth in life is the addition of Christ as life into our being. Not only Christians but even unbelievers may improve as their natural life matures. For example, as a young person grows from a teen-ager to a man in his late twenties, he will improve. But this improvement is not the growth in life. Many Christians have been helped to improve themselves by listening to sermons. Although sermons may help people to improve, they do not help them to grow in life. According to the Bible, to grow is to have more of Christ wrought into our being. The growth in life is simply the increase of Christ in our being.<p>For the building of the church, the growth in life is urgently needed. If we do not have this growth, we cannot have any building. The growth in life is the real building. This building is not a matter of having someone above you, below you, or beside you. Take the example of Aquila and Priscilla, who were one with the other saints wherever they were. Aquila and Priscilla could be one with others because they had considerable growth in life.<h2 class=head1>THE DEGREE OF ONENESS AND BUILDING DEPENDING ON OUR GROWTH</h2><p>The degree to which we can be one with the saints depends upon the growth in life we have. You may be one with certain saints that are close to you. But if you do not have the proper growth in life, you will not be able to be one with the saints in another locality if you move there. This inability to be one with saints in a new locality proves that you do not have the growth in life. If you have the genuine growth in life, you will be one with the saints wherever you may be.<p>The more we grow in life, the more we are built. If you have the real growth in life, you will be able to be built together with others whom you have not met before. When you come together with them, there will be no problems because you all have had the growth in life. To repeat, the real growth in life is the building, and the genuine building is a spiritual matter in life since the building of God&#8217;s house is absolutely not material, but spiritual. I must strongly emphasize the fact that the house of God, the church today, is not a physical entity, but a spiritual entity. How much we have been built into the church depends upon how much we have grown in life. Many have been Christians for years, but do not have any growth. Thus, there are problems whenever they come together.<p>In a family we have brothers and sisters, but no special friends. Likewise, in the church we have only brothers and sisters, not any friends. Nevertheless, some may still want to have friends among the brothers and sisters. In a sense, they are one with their friends because their friends suit their taste, choice, and preference. However, if they move to another place that does not match their taste, they will not be one with anyone. But if you have the growth in life, wherever you may go you will be one with the saints. This oneness is the building.<p>Some brothers always want their own preference. If they cannot get it in one place, they will move to another and to still another. I have seen saints who moved from one church to another trying to find their preference. With them there was no growth in life. Because there was no growth in life, wherever they went there was no oneness. They simply could not be one with others. But suppose you have the genuine growth in life. Even in a church where the situation is the most difficult, you will still be able to be one. If you cannot be one in the place where you are, do not think that by moving elsewhere you will be able to be one. If you should move to another place, you may find it worse than the place you left. This may cause you to go to even a third place. Nevertheless, the situation will be the same. Do not move to a certain place in order to have your choice. Instead, stay in the difficult place, the place where you can have the growth in life. Actually, it is not a matter of the place, but of the growth in life. I say again that if you have the growth in life, you will be able to be one with the saints. This is the building. By this we see that the genuine building is the growth in life.<h2 class=head1>THE NEED FOR A PRIVATE TIME OF PRAYER</h2><p>Because the building is the growth in life, it is important that we know how to grow in life. In this message I have the burden to share about this matter in a very practical way. Throughout the years, we have greatly emphasized, perhaps over-emphasized, the corporate aspect of the Christian life. We have laid great stress upon coming together to meet, to pray, and to read the Word. However, I am concerned that many, especially the young people in corporate living situations, do not have a private time of prayer. They have only the corporate prayer. I admit that no private time of prayer can replace the corporate time. The blessing, help, and life we receive in the meetings cannot be found elsewhere. Nevertheless, we need to remember that in the things pertaining to life there are always two aspects. In the Christian life there is the individual side and the corporate side, and neither can replace the other. We must have both. Furthermore, these two sides should be evenly balanced.<p>Among us there is a shortage in the matter of having a private time to contact the Lord. Many simply do not have a private prayer life. Most of the brothers and sisters who are over forty-five or fifty do have such a private prayer life. But most of the younger brothers and sisters, especially those in corporate living, do not. I am very concerned about this, for it is a matter that affects their growth in life. If you do not go to the Lord directly and privately by yourself, your dealing with the Lord will not be very practical or detailed.<p>Ephesians, a book that presents such a high vision concerning the church, also encourages us to pray. In chapter one Paul gives us the vision concerning God&#8217;s well-speaking that produces the church. But there must be the prayer to follow this vision. Hence, Paul prayed that we would have a spirit of wisdom and revelation. Without prayer, the vision is not adequate. Many of us have seen the vision of God&#8217;s purpose concerning the church. But we also need to pray, both corporately and individually.<p>We all need to have a private time with the Lord. This needs to be built up into a daily habit. The best time for such a private time with the Lord is in the morning. Some who leave for work very early, however, may need to choose another time of the day. Nevertheless, we all need to set aside time for the Lord daily, preferably at least thirty minutes.<p>During this time, you should go to the Lord and pray, not for so many affairs or business matters, but to contact the Lord, asking Him to examine you, to enlighten you, and to expose your situation in His light. As the Lord enlightens you, you will need to confess one item after another. When we do not come to the light, we do not see the uncleanness, especially the offenses on our conscience. But when we are enlightened, we are aware of all the dirt. We need to confess everything exposed by the Lord&#8217;s light. Once I made a confession to the Lord that lasted more than two hours. The more I confessed, the more I needed to confess. After I confessed one thing, I had to confess another, and then another. To confess is the best way to contact the Lord in prayer for the genuine growth in life. The more we are dealt with by the Lord, the more He will be wrought into our being. This is what it means to grow.<p>In order to grow, we must firstly contact the Lord in our time of private prayer. I encourage all the saints, especially the young people, to build up such a habit. Every day you must have a time of prayer. Sometimes you may pray for the church or for the Lord&#8217;s recovery, if you are burdened to do so. You may also pray concerning your affairs. But the primary matter is to pray for the Lord&#8217;s enlightenment, exposing, and examining. Ask the Lord to show you what is within you and ask Him to deal with you. You should say, &#8220;Lord, expose through Your light my real situation and condition.&#8221; If you pray like this, the light will come, and you will be dealt with. Then whatever you pray will not be a performance, but a genuine prayer from your cleansed spirit.<h2 class=head1>READING THE BIBLE AND SPIRITUAL BOOKS</h2><p>During our private time with the Lord, we should also read and study the Bible. I am concerned that many of the young people do not read the Bible or study it. Yes, you may read the Bible in times of corporate fellowship or in the meetings. But you also need to have a private time to read the Word. You need to lay a good foundation in the Word of God by reading through it consecutively from Genesis to Revelation. Read book after book without selection, choice, or preference. Try to read the Bible through once every year or every two years. It is important to build up the habit of reading and studying the Word.<p>Ephesians 6:17 and 18 cover both the matter of prayer and the Word. These verses tell us to take the Word by means of all prayer (Gk.). This refers to pray-reading, or, at least, to reading the Bible prayerfully. We need to pray and to read the Word, putting these things together.<p>Along with prayer and reading the Word, we should also read some spiritual books or life-study messages. It may not be adequate to read the messages just once. I can testify that although I give the messages, I am nourished by reading the printed messages again and again. I do not care who prepared the food, whether I prepared it or someone else did. As long as it is food, I take it and I am nourished by it.<p>In our eating, we need variety. For example, for breakfast it is not sufficient to have toast and milk every morning. My breakfast includes more than twenty items, a real variety of food. This rich nourishment makes me very energetic. The principle is the same in reading spiritual books. Along with reading the Bible, we need to develop the habit of reading some profitable and nourishing spiritual books, doing this in a very balanced way and not eating too much at one time. Rather, it is better to eat several times a day. You may read four pages of a message at one time and then read more later in the day or the next day. In reading spiritual books, do not try to take in too much at once. If you build up the habit of reading the Word and spiritual books, you will be healthy spiritually and you will grow.<h2 class=head1>BEING ENLIGHTENED</h2><p>We also grow by being enlightened by the Lord. Whether through prayer or reading the Word, the most important thing is to be enlightened by the Lord. If you pray, study the Bible, and read spiritual books for several days without receiving any light, you have some problem. In every time of prayer and reading the Word, we should receive light, because the Word of God is light. If you take the Word without receiving light, there must be a problem within. There can be no problem with the Word, for the Word is light. Because you do not receive light, you need to ask the Lord to show you what is wrong, to show you why you have not been receiving light from Him. When you receive light on certain matters, accept the light and confess to the Lord immediately without excusing yourself. Make a thorough confession according to the Lord&#8217;s light.<h2 class=head1>BEING FILLED WITH THE LORD</h2><p>The last item I would mention is being filled with the Lord. In Ephesians 3 Paul prayed that the Father would strengthen us with power by His Spirit in our inner man so that Christ may make His home in our hearts, that we may be filled with all the fullness of God. In Ephesians 5:18 he tells us not to be drunk with wine, but to be filled in our spirit. We need to be filled in spirit with the fullness of God. The way to be filled is the same as the way to grow in life: to pray properly, to take the Word of God, to read some nourishing spiritual books, and to be enlightened. If we pray, read the Word, and are enlightened, we shall spontaneously and immediately be filled with the Lord, and the Lord will be added to us. This is the growth in life.<p>Although we may see the highest vision, the vision presented in the book of Ephesians, without a private time of prayer, reading the Word, being enlightened, and being filled with the Lord, the vision will fade away. It will be something that we enjoy for a moment and then it will disappear. If we want all the visions we have seen to be wrought in our being, we need to have a private time with the Lord to pray, to read the Word, to read some nourishing messages, to be enlightened, and to be filled with the Lord. Then we shall grow in life.<h1 class=msg>CHAPTER THREE</h1><h1 class=msg>THE VINE-GOD&#8217;S ECONOMY</h1><h1 class=msg>(1)</h1><p>The Gospel of John reveals to us even more than the book of Revelation what God&#8217;s economy is. Why did God create the heaven? the earth? the universe? mankind? you? In this Gospel this profound matter is unveiled to us in simple words.<p>What is God&#8217;s heart desire? Christianity has been on this earth for more than twenty centuries, and its influence, works, and activities have spread throughout human society. Yet if you have the vision from the heavenlies, you will wonder what Christian work satisfies the Lord&#8217;s heart.<p>The New Testament tells us clearly that what the Lord wants is a Bride. The Lord likens Himself to a bridegroom (Matt. 25:1-13). Suppose there is a wedding, and you offer the groom many good things, even the whole world. The groom would just say, &#8220;What do I care about all those things? Where is my bride? I only want her.&#8221;<h2 class=head1>THE PROFUNDITY OF JOHN</h2><p>It is the Gospel of John which unveils to us God&#8217;s heart desire. Of the four Gospels, Christians love John&#8217;s Gospel the most. Matthew, you may think, is too complicated, too tough to chew on, and Mark is not all that interesting, but John is as sweet as candy. Do you think John is so easy to understand? How would you explain verse 1? &#8220;In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.&#8221; What beginning is this? When was it? What is the Word? How could the Word be God? This is surely not soft candy! Then verse 4 adds, &#8220;In Him was life.&#8221; In Him, in this wonderful One, was life. What is life?<p>Not too long ago, I heard a strange definition of life. One of the saints said, &#8220;Life is liberty.&#8221; Then do the birds in the air have more life than we do? Do the people yelling and screaming at football games have more life? That is not life. That is looseness. It is the release of the flesh.<p>These two verses show that life is linked with God. The Word was God and in Him was life. Here is another trinity-the Word, God, and life. What is life? Life is something in Him, in the very Word which was God. Life is just God.<p>John 10:10 has another reference to life. &#8220;I came that they may have life and may have it abundantly.&#8221; When Christ came, life came; surely when life came, it became available to all of us, even life abundant.<p>In chapter fourteen this One who is life declared to His disciples that the Spirit of reality would come and abide with them and be in them (vv. 16-17). Who is the Spirit of reality? Is He with you? Is He in you? Then verse 20 says, &#8220;In that day you shall know that I am in My Father, and you in Me, and I in you.&#8221; Do you know practically that He is in the Father? Do you really know that you are in Christ and that Christ is in you?<p>Then we come to chapter fifteen. &#8220;I am the true vine, and My Father is the husbandman....You are the branches&#8221; (vv. 1, 5). He told us that we must abide in Him that He may abide in us (v. 4). What is the meaning of these simple words-vine, husbandman, branches, abide?<p>In chapter seventeen, verses 21 to 23 say, &#8220;That they all may be one; even as You, Father, are in Me and I in You, that they also may be in Us, that the world may believe that You have sent Me. And the glory which You have given Me I have given to them, that they may be one, even as We are one; I in them, and You in Me, that they may be perfected into one, that the world may know that You have sent Me and have loved them even as You have loved Me.&#8221; These verses are hard to follow. Verse 21 mentions being one. What is the difference between being united and being one? Then verse 22 refers to the glory the Lord has given us. Do you have this glory? He has given us the glory that we may be one. What does verse 23 mean when it says &#8220;perfected into one&#8221;?<p>Now consider chapter twenty, when the Lord in resurrection came back to His disciples and breathed upon (or, into) them, and said, &#8220;Receive the Holy Spirit&#8221; (vv. 19-22). What is the meaning of this? And what does it mean in chapter six, verse 63, when it says, &#8220;It is the Spirit Who gives life; the flesh profits nothing; the words which I have spoken unto you are spirit and are life&#8221;? What is the Spirit? What is life?<h2 class=head1>THE HUSBANDMAN AND THE VINE</h2><p>I believe you are persuaded that John is not so simple. This book is on the profound economy of God. It is expressed in these simple words: I am the vine, and My Father is the husbandman. In the universe God is a husbandman, a farmer. Farming is God&#8217;s economy! Just as the farmer&#8217;s economy is farming, growing things, so is God&#8217;s.<p>What does God grow? He grows a vine tree, a vine with many branches. Christ is this vine; Christ is God&#8217;s economy. A vine differs from a tree in that it has virtually no trunk. If you cut off the branches of a vine, there is practically nothing left, only the root. Christ said, &#8220;I am the vine; you are the branches.&#8221; This vine, including the branches, is God&#8217;s economy. This means that His economy includes us, for we are the branches of this vine. Hallelujah!<h2 class=head1>THE BRANCHES OF THE VINE</h2><p>How could we be branches of Christ? If a farmer grows wheat, wheat is his economy, but wheat is not the farmer himself. But this vine which is Christ is the embodiment of God. God as a farmer grows Himself. By cultivating and developing this vine, God develops Himself. How does He do this? It is by the branching out of the vine. The branches are just the spreading of the vine. Whatever is in the vine is in the branches.<p>By your natural life, by yourself, are you a branch of the vine? No! By your fallen nature you are not only a branch of Adam, but even a branch of the Devil. Just as a branch is the branching out of a tree, so when we were born we were just the branching out of Adam. As branches of Adam, we were also branches of Satan; this is what all the people on earth are today. The wonderful thing is that the moment we believe in the Lord Jesus, He branches out into us. This branching out makes us branches, branches of this wonderful Christ.<p>Do not look at yourself. This morning you may have lost your temper, and even now you may feel like a branch of the Devil. The more you look at yourself, the more you will be disappointed. Look at the Word. &#8220;I am the vine, and you are the branches.&#8221; You just say, &#8220;Hallelujah, Lord, You are the vine and I am a branch. The Bible says so.&#8221;<p>To be a branch in the vine means that Christ has become your life. Life is not liberation; it is a Person, a living Person-Christ. As branches we are those filled with Christ. Do not say you do not feel that you are filled with Christ. When the Lord says, &#8220;I am the vine; you are the branches,&#8221; you have to say a strong amen. Just keep saying, &#8220;Hallelujah, I am a branch!&#8221; You will be filled with Him.<h2 class=head1>DISTRACTED FROM CHRIST</h2><p>God wants you to be filled with Christ, to have Christ as your life and as your person. He is not interested in religion, nor in any work or service you would like to do for Him. He wants you to live Christ day by day. If we do not have such a daily life, when we meet together it will be just for a theatrical performance. When we shout to release our spirit, we shall be actors in a theater. This is not what the Lord wants. If you take Christ as your life, you will not say even a word without the assurance that you are speaking with Him.<p>The whole of Christianity is off. Even the saints in the Lord&#8217;s recovery today are somewhat off, distracted, from the center lane of life. If we are concerned about how to meet-in a quiet way or a loud way, with or without guitars-this is a sign that we are off. The Bible has nothing to say about how to meet or what kind of instrument to use for our music. Shouting or silence, guitars or no guitars, mean nothing. But to meet with Christ and in Christ means everything. Do not push the saints to release their spirit. What kind of spirit are they releasing? Perhaps it is a spirit full of self or of the natural life.<h2 class=head1>CONCERNED ABOUT HOW TO MEET</h2><p>There is talk among us about how to meet. Are we for a good meeting? Are we for a piano or a guitar? Are we for a certain style meeting? No! We are for Christ. When you come to the meeting, you must come with Christ and in Christ. You must come into Christ. If you say our meeting is too legal, that there is too much ministry, that you prefer an informal, family-style meeting, you are far from the center lane.<p>I want to say a word here for the whole recovery. We have no particular way to meet. Nearly all our meetings are open to everyone. If you have Christ, you are free to share Christ with the saints. If you say our meetings are too formal, I say I do not know of anything on earth which does not have a form. Without a form nothing can exist. A family-style meeting is a form. In fact, it is more formal, because you insist on it. If we insist on any way to meet, that way is a form. This is not of the Lord. It causes division.<h2 class=head1>TWO ASPECTS OF CHRIST</h2><p>Now let us come back to a further point regarding God&#8217;s economy. We have seen that it is not something religious or ethical, but Christ wrought into our being. Now we need to consider who Christ is. The Gospel of John reveals this One as the Word (1:1) and also as the Spirit (14:17). Hallelujah! God has given us two precious treasures, the Spirit within and the Word without.<p>In one aspect the Lord Jesus is the Word; in the other aspect, He is the Spirit. Why are there these two aspects? It is that God cares about our experience of Him.<h2 class=head1>THE LORD JESUS AS THE SPIRIT</h2><p>Without the Spirit we cannot experience Him. How could we be in Him and He in us? All by the Spirit! Are you not in the air? Is not the air in you? The Lord Jesus today is the life-giving Spirit. The Greek word pneuma means both spirit and air. The Lord Jesus is the heavenly, spiritual air.<p>We are now in this Pneuma and this Pneuma is in us. Because He is the Spirit, I have the full assurance that I am in the Spirit and the Spirit is in me. This is why after His resurrection He came back to His disciples, breathed into them, and told them, &#8220;Receive the Holy Pneuma&#8221; (John 20:22). Today we are all in the Holy Pneuma, and the Holy Pneuma is in all of us.<h2 class=head1>THE LORD JESUS AS THE WORD</h2><p>If God had given us only the Spirit without the Word, we could easily be misled, because the Spirit is not tangible. In contrast, the Word is so solid, so touchable. Whenever we have a particular experience of the Spirit, we must check the Word. This is our safeguard.<h2 class=head1>THE BALANCE BETWEEN THE WORD AND THE SPIRIT</h2><p>If you care only for the Word and disregard the Spirit, you may be accurate in your beliefs, but you will be dead within. The Word is our safeguard, the Spirit our livingness.<p>These two extremes are apparent in Christianity. The fundamentalists stress the written Word; the Pentecostalists, a kind of &#8220;Spirit.&#8221; The Lord&#8217;s desire is to balance us between the Spirit and the Word, the Word and the Spirit.<p>If you regard only the Spirit and neglect the Word, your spiritual life will peter out. After not too long a time you will have the sense that your spirit is extinguished and that you have no way to kindle it again. You may try prayer, but you will find that no words come to your lips. Many of us have experienced this. When you run out in the spirit and have no words on your lips to pray, there is a prayer book you can turn to, the Bible.<p>Just open the Word. Disregard your feeling. Do not try to compose a prayer. Suppose you open to John 1:1. Just read it. Even without any feeling, sometimes as you read, something within is kindled and prayer spontaneously rises, not in your own words, but from the written Word. &#8220;Lord, I thank You. You were in the beginning. You are the Word. O Lord, You are just God. How I thank You that in You is life.&#8221;<p>The Word is spontaneously kindling your spirit. This is how the wonderful Lord who is both the Word and the Spirit will be your experience.<h2 class=head1>HANDLING OUR CHANGING MOOD</h2><p>You may get up in the morning and find that your spirit is on fire. But when you get home from work that evening, you are as cold as a block of ice. There seems no reason. What should you do? Hallelujah, when your spirit is frozen, you have the Word! You may open to John 4:23. Read it. As you do, your reading will become your praying. You may say something like this: &#8220;O Lord, an hour is coming. Hallelujah! Lord, the hour has come and now is.&#8221; With just one hallelujah the ice is melted, and you are filled with the very Christ. The coldness is gone. You do not need to deal with it. It just disappears.<p>The same is true with our temper. In fact, this is the way to take care of your whole Christian life. Do not try to overcome your temper. Just care for Christ. Today He is both the Word and the Spirit. As the Spirit He is in me, and as the Word He is here in this Book. Whether I am hot or cold, the Word remains the same. However I fluctuate during the day, the Word is always the same. It always says the same thing.<p>If you think this is practicing psychology, try picking up a book about Abraham Lincoln or the thoughts of Confucius. Such books do not provoke such a response in you. Why is the Bible the only book that can stir you? It is because &#8220;the words which I have spoken unto you are spirit and are life&#8221; (John 6:63). Neither the words of Abraham Lincoln nor those of Confucius are spirit. It is only the words of the Bible that are spirit, for these are the words spoken by God. Hallelujah for this inheritance of the Spirit within and the Word without!<p>The Spirit may seem to disappear, but the Word always remains. Learn to contact the Lord through the Word. I encourage you to build up a habit of reading the Word daily, preferably in the morning. Make this a legality.<h2 class=head1>KEEPING SOME LEGALITIES</h2><p>To live we have to keep some legalities. We must be legal about four things: eating, drinking, breathing, and sleeping. Do you think it is too legal to eat three meals every day? Without such a legality you will soon be ready for a funeral! In order to live in a healthy way, you must eat, drink, breathe, and sleep. I am careful to practice these four legalities. That is why I am still so energetic even at my age. Without such practices, you will die.<p>Now there are some spiritual legalities you must pay attention to. In order to live and be healthy spiritually, you must practice these daily. Especially you young brothers, you must have at least ten minutes of prayer every day. Then you must also have at least ten minutes for reading the Bible. You can read a chapter in ten minutes. If you insist on keeping these legalities, you will be a strong, healthy Christian. Look to the Lord for His grace to practice them.<h2 class=head1>THE VALUE OF READING THE BIBLE</h2><p>Suppose you have no interest in praying or reading the Bible. You have done it for a while and you seem to get nothing out of it. I know the story. If you will keep these two legalities for half a year, you will see the difference it makes. Then if you are still bored, stop for three months. This will give you a comparison. You will see what a loss it is. If you try to put water into a strainer, the water will flow right out. However many times you try, no water will stay in the strainer. But the strainer nonetheless is getting washed. Every day when you read the Bible, it seems that nothing remains. But your being is washed, your person refreshed. If you neglect your Bible reading for ten days, you will see how dull and dirty you feel. Reading the Bible makes you different, whether you sense you have received something or not.<h2 class=head1>HOW TO APPROACH BIBLE READING</h2><p>Come to the Bible not with the purpose of understanding it. Come not even with the purpose of receiving light or the life supply. Just come to the Bible to read it. Eventually, the Lord knows when, light will come, life support will come, secretly, wonderfully, even mysteriously, but not at your time and not in your way.<p>When I was young, I read a biography that said whenever So-and-so read the Bible, the letters would jump out and the light would shine brightly. I decided to practice that. I opened the Bible, knelt down, and prayed, &#8220;Lord, enlighten Your Word. Make some letters jump out. Make some words stand out to me.&#8221; Day after day I prayed this way, but not one letter jumped out. They just seemed to sink deeper into the page! In time, though, the light came and the life supply came. In some instances it was thirty-five years later. Since coming to the United States, I have had a great deal of light that came through my reading of forty years ago.<p>Just come to the Bible for the sake of reading it and contacting the Lord, not for any other purpose. When the right time comes, the Lord will give you the light or the life supply or the understanding.<h2 class=head1>ANSWERED PRAYER</h2><p>As with reading the Bible, so with prayer. You may expect that if you pray, the Lord will surely answer immediately in your way. Well, after years and years of being a Christian, I can testify that not a single prayer has gone unanswered. Every one has been answered, but not according to my way nor in my time. Sometimes I did not hear of the answers till after three, or five, or even more years. As I look back over the years, I worship the Lord that whatever I have prayed He has answered in His way and at His time.<p>Prayer is not in vain. The answers will come. But the answers are secondary. When you pray, you touch the Lord. This breathing in of the Lord is primary.<h2 class=head1>THE LONG-TERM EFFECT</h2><p>By taking the time, at least ten minutes a day, to read the Bible and pray, you are contacting the Lord in your spirit through the Word day by day, week after week, month after month, and year after year. You will be growing all the time and will be built up with Christ. Eventually you will know that the Christian life is just living by Christ. In thinking, you will think by Him; in speaking, you will speak by Him. You will express your attitude by Him. He will be your life and your person.<p>If we practice this, our coming together will not be with a way to meet. We shall come with Christ, in Christ, and into Christ. Our meetings will not be something theatrical, but a living testimony of Jesus, not a performance but an actual testimony of our daily living.<p>This is what God desires to have. Christianity has been disappointing Him in this for many centuries. Let us receive grace and rise up to say: &#8220;Lord, here we are. We want to satisfy You by living You out as a testimony and by coming together in You, with You, and into You.&#8221; This is the church life.<h1 class=msg>CHAPTER FOUR</h1><h1 class=msg>A PRACTICAL WAY TO ABIDE IN THE VINE</h1><h1 class=msg>(1)</h1><p>Throughout the centuries scholars and philosophers have tried their best to find out the meaning of the universe and the meaning of human life. None of them has ever found the proper answer. But the Lord&#8217;s simple illustration in John 15 of a vine and branches and a husbandman reveals nothing less than this.<p>I was saved as a teen-ager over fifty-six years ago and since then have never fallen away. Yet for many years in the early period of my Christian life, I did not know what God&#8217;s economy was. I tried my best to love Him, to study the Bible, and to testify of Him to others, but I was ignorant of His economy. (This word in Greek as used in the New Testament means a dispensing of something in a kind of administration; a stewardship to dispense something into certain vessels.)<p>One day I saw that God chose and redeemed us with a purpose, a purpose so high that no human mentality can grasp it. It is that the Triune God, the infinite God, wants to dispense Himself into our being. Then I began to understand why God created us tripartite. We have a body outwardly, a spirit within, and in between a soul. Just as a glove is made for a hand, so we were designed for God to get into us.<h2 class=head1>CHRISTIANITY&#8217;S FALSE CONCEPT</h2><p>We have the wrong impression that we must do something for God. Christianity has instilled in us the concept that we should serve God, preach the gospel, win souls, improve our behavior, honor our parents, love our enemies, and be kind and humble. This is the kind of Christian I tried to be for years, without ever realizing that God did not want this.<p>God does not want you to do things by yourself for Him. If He wants something done, He can do it Himself. In creating this universe, He just spoke and it came into existence. When He said, &#8220;Let there be light,&#8221; there was light. God does not need you to work so hard! Mankind, with all his religions, is off from God&#8217;s goal. God would have us take Him as life. This God is embodied in Christ. Outside of Christ you cannot find God. Christ is God, the practical God, not the doctrinal God. This God is to be your life and your person.<h2 class=head1>THE VISION</h2><p>Before I realized this, I hated my sins, my evil deeds, and my bad temper. I tried to love the Lord and to work for Him. But one day the Lord said, &#8220;My little child, I don&#8217;t want you. I want Myself. Even if you were not so ugly, if you were lovely and excellent, I still would not want you. You can never satisfy Me. I want Myself, but it must be Myself in you. Once you take Me and leave your self out, I shall be happy.&#8221;<p>When I saw that vision, I prayed, &#8220;Lord, have mercy on me. From now on I shall never live by my self.&#8221; After that prayer I felt I had wings. I wanted to run into the street and proclaim to everyone that from then on I would live by Christ, that it was no more I but Christ living in me. All this was more than forty years ago.<h2 class=head1>THE EFFECTS OF THE VISION</h2><p>But after such an experience and such resolve, I still did not express much Christ. Mostly I was still expressing myself. Why? Because I was born into this way, I was raised and educated to express myself, and I had been practicing this all my life. In actuality, however, it was not so much that I had grasped the vision; rather, something from heaven had grasped me. It controlled and directed me, again and again reminding me when I was living by my self. I would be about to do something when the vision would come and I would see, &#8220;That is you again! That is your self!&#8221; I would stop in the middle of what I was doing.<p>If you see this vision, it will rescue you from your struggle. God does not want husbands by themselves to love their wives nor sisters to submit to their husbands. God wants you neither to love nor to hate, but to live by Him. It is not a matter of religion or ethics, but of Christ. Paul said (Gal. 2:20) that he had been crucified with Christ, that it was no longer he but Christ living in him. If I hate, I hate by Christ. If I love, I love by Christ.<p>To see this will save you from arguing. When I was a young Christian, I loved the Lord and the Bible. I would fight whatever I thought was wrong doctrine. I was sprinkled when I was young, and one day I realized that was wrong. From then on I fought for immersion. But one day I said, &#8220;Why am I fighting for immersion? Neither sprinkling nor immersion is Christ. He just wants Himself in me.&#8221;<p>In the churches these days there is discussion about whether to meet in homes or in the meeting hall. Some even say they like to go to the beach to enjoy the Lord. We must drop all the talk about ways to meet. No way is wrong; no way is right. As long as we have Christ, every way is right. Without Him, every way is wrong. Let us forget all the arguments and come back to the center lane, Christ Himself.<h2 class=head1>ABIDING</h2><p>&#8220;Abide in Me and I in you. As the branch cannot bear fruit of itself unless it abides in the vine, so neither can you, unless you abide in Me&#8221; (John 15:4). The real Christian life is described in this one verse. It is not to work for Christ, but to abide in Him. When the Lord says, &#8220;Abide in Me and I in you,&#8221; He means that He can only abide in us as we abide in Him. If we do not do our part by abiding in Him, He cannot do His part by abiding in us. If you are quarreling with someone and saying hateful words, can the Lord abide in you? No. For Him to abide in you, you first of all have to abide in Him.<p>The Lord does not say we have to get into Him. He says, &#8220;Abide in Me.&#8221; This means that we the branches are in Christ already. To abide means to remain; some versions render it this way. Just stay where you are. If my arm does not abide in my body, it is detached from all life supply. God has put us in Christ (1 Cor. 1:30). This happened the day we believed in the Lord Jesus.<h2 class=head1>THE HINDRANCE TO ABIDING</h2><p>How can we abide in Christ constantly? Let us use the illustration of a radio. Inside a radio are some complicated mechanisms which must all work properly in order for it to receive the waves from the air. One simple thing can be wrong, and the radio will not work. So it is with us. Inside we are complicated by a conscience, a mind, a will, and emotions. If these are not all properly regulated, the heavenly electric wave cannot come in. If just one is out of order, this radio does not work. Should our conscience have an offense on it, for example, our abiding in Christ is frustrated.<p>As we know, man is composed of body, soul, and spirit. A large part of our spirit is the conscience. If we add to the conscience the three parts of the soul-the mind, emotion, and will-we have the heart. The other two parts of the spirit, intuition and fellowship, are not part of the heart. Only the conscience is part of both the spirit and the heart. See diagram which follows.<h2 class=head1>THE IMPORTANCE OF THE CONSCIENCE</h2><p>Of all God&#8217;s creatures, only human beings have a conscience. This is the part within that either accuses or excuses you (cf. Rom. 2:15). When you deal with your conscience, you are dealing with both your spirit and your heart. If your conscience has never been dealt with, you are of no use to the Lord. A radio has a little receiver, without which it will not work. The paint may be chipped, but the radio will still work as long as the receiver is good. The same is true of our conscience; it must be kept in good working order. When we first received the gospel, the Lord required that we confess our sins. Confessing our sins clears our conscience. Without repenting and confessing your sins, you could not have been saved. The Spirit of God could not have gotten into you. Once you repent and confess, the Spirit enters into you. The more thorough the confession is, the more Spirit you have within.<h2 class=head1>PURIFYING THE CONSCIENCE</h2><p>The Spirit, then, comes into our being through our cleansed conscience. Without this cleansing, He cannot enter. Hebrews 9:14 says that the blood of Christ purifies our conscience from dead works to serve the living God. Do not think that serving the living God means doing something for Him. In the Bible to serve Him means to contact Him, to receive Him, to have Him infused into us. The proper service or worship of God is that we give Him an opening so that He can infuse Himself into our being. This kind of serving requires a purified, or purged, conscience. The blood of Christ purges our conscience that we may serve, not the doctrinal God, but the living God.<p>In Matthew 5:3 the Lord says, &#8220;Blessed are the poor in spirit.&#8221; Without a purified conscience, your spirit cannot be poor. Then in verse 8 He says, &#8220;Blessed are the pure in heart.&#8221; Even more, a pure heart requires a purged conscience.<h2 class=head1>CONFESSION</h2><p>We need to go to the Lord to deal with our conscience. You may feel you have only one little, unimportant thing to confess. If you will just confess that one thing, that initial confession will be a little turn to lead you onto the highway. You may then find you need a long time to complete a thorough confession.<p>As soon as you attempt to deal with the Lord in this way, the phone may ring. Once you take care of that phone call, it will take some effort to get back on the highway of your confession. After you confess two more things, the phone may ring again, this time probably a wrong number. This is the subtle enemy. It is best to get away by yourself, away from the phone and everyone else, or at least take the phone off the hook. If you share a room with someone else, you may need to find another place so no one can disturb you.<p>Once you kneel or sit before the Lord and open up to Him, you will find you have miles of confession to make. You may need hours to confess all your shortcomings, weak points, evil doings, your sinfulness, your flesh. When you start cleaning your house, you may think you can finish in fifteen minutes. But when you get into it, you will find dirt and dust all over, in all the corners. You are like your house. In every corner of your being, in every room, on every shelf, there is dirt. Your eyes have been dirtied by the many sinful things you have looked at day after day. Your ears have been sullied by listening to gossip. Your mouth needs cleansing from the gossip you have spread.<h2 class=head1>THE EFFECT OF A PURIFIED CONSCIENCE</h2><p>After such a confession, you will not want to go back home. You will be afraid you may hear more gossip. It takes a great deal of effort to clean a badly smeared window. Once it is clean, you will try very hard not to let it get dirty again. This is the way to keep a clear entry for Christ to come into you. This entry, your purged conscience, will keep you from gossip.<h2 class=head1>EFFECT ON THE SPIRIT AND THE HEART</h2><p>Thus, to abide in Christ we must first purify our conscience by making a thorough confession. Once your conscience is purged, you can be poor in spirit. You will no longer feel you know so much. You will be humble and hungry for the real experience of the Lord. If you are proud, your spirit is not open to the Lord and He has no way to abide in you. Purging your conscience will issue in an open spirit.<p>A further effect of making confession is the purifying of your heart. Your heart will be pure because your conscience is cleansed. I have traveled this way myself; these are not doctrines I have learned merely through studying the Bible. Rather, they are a map I have drawn for you, based on my travels through all these experiences.<h2 class=head1>EFFECT ON THE MIND, EMOTION, AND WILL</h2><p>If your conscience is not purified and your spirit not open to the Lord, if you are not poor in your spirit and pure in your heart, what kind of mind will you have? It will be sloppy and dull. You may come to the meetings and listen to the messages, but after a time you will conclude all the messages are about the same. To you, a &#8220;b&#8221; is about the same as a &#8220;d,&#8221; an &#8220;m&#8221; is about the same as a &#8220;w.&#8221; You have no discernment.<p>But once your conscience is purged, your mind will be keen and your discernment clear. No one and nothing can deceive you. This is what the Scripture calls a sound, or sober, mind (2 Tim. 1:7). Whenever you hear a message, your mind will be sharp to grasp and confirm what is being said.<p>A purified conscience will also affect your emotion. Before you make a thorough confession of your failures and weak points, your emotion is just lukewarm. (If your emotion were cold, you would be going to places of entertainment rather than coming to meetings.) But once you have confessed, your lukewarm emotion will catch on fire. You will declare, &#8220;Lord Jesus, I love You! I am on fire for You!&#8221;<p>Your will also will be changed from being stubborn to being submissive. You will enjoy obeying (cf. Phil. 2:12). Whatever it is, big or small, you will be willing to obey.<h2 class=head1>THE KEY TO ABIDING</h2><p>With such a purified conscience, open spirit, pure heart, sober mind, loving emotion, and submissive will, there will be a flow of the Lord within your whole being. You will surely be abiding in Him and He in you. This is the way to have the Lord added to your being all day long. The key is the thorough confession. Without it this message is just doctrine.<h2 class=head1>LIVING OUT CHRIST</h2><p>Let us look to the Lord that we may see the unique vision concerning God&#8217;s economy. His only desire is that we take Him as our life and person and live by Him. Branches bring forth fruit by abiding in the vine. In the same way our fruit-bearing is the outflow of life. It is not a work, but our living. The same is true of our meetings and our gospel preaching. Our gospel is the Christ we live. This will also take care of the spreading; it is not something we need to plan. In Christianity nearly everything is a matter of doing. In the Lord&#8217;s recovery everything must be a matter of living, living by Christ and living out Christ.<h1 class=msg>CHAPTER FIVE</h1><h1 class=msg>QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS</h1><h1 class=msg>(1)</h1><p><I>How can I deal with the Lord to get Him to act on my prayers?</I><p>This question opens up a field that covers the whole Christian life. To answer briefly, I would say that most of our efforts to know the Lord&#8217;s will are futile. What we think is His will turns out to be incorrect. The right way is just to contact the Lord in the same way as you breathe. Open to Him. Then, when the time comes, something will come to you. That will be the Lord&#8217;s will.<p><I>Can you recommend some specific materials to use in our times with the Lord?</I><p>The more variety you have, the better. You need at least ten minutes of prayer and at least ten minutes of reading the Bible. If you have an hour&#8217;s time, you can read three chapters from the Old Testament and one from the New; in this way you can finish the Bible in a year. As for spiritual writings, I surely recommend the Life-study Messages and the issues of the Stream magazine, published in the early years. In addition, read the books The Economy of God, The All-inclusive Christ, The Knowledge of Life, and The Experience of Life. This last book would be especially helpful, since some chapters treat in detail how to deal with the conscience, the heart, the flesh, and the natural constitution.<p>Try to build up a habit of praying the whole day long. During your time in the morning, pray. At your break time, pray. Replace your vain talk and gossip with prayer. You will see how much more time you have to pray if you avoid the phone.<p>One year Brother Nee read through the New Testament every week. He did not drop any duties, but just carried a little New Testament with him wherever he went. By squeezing in a minute here and two minutes there, he read it through fifty-two times in that one year.<p>If we can learn to use our time this carefully, there will be plenty of time to pray, read the Bible, and read some spiritual books. I greatly enjoy going back over the Life-study Messages, even though they were given by me. Just as a housewife enjoys her own cooking, so I am refreshed and nourished when I read over the Life-study Messages. I long that the saints in the Lord&#8217;s recovery may be able to digest them more. If you try this for half a year, it will make a big difference in your Christian life.<p><I>My Christian life is like a pendulum swinging back and forth. Is this normal?</I><p>It is normal, but only for a baby. Do not be troubled about feeling that way. Just keep praying daily, reading the Bible daily, and digesting a Life-study Message or one of our spiritual books. Within a half year you will be steadfast. You will be rooted and grounded, and nothing will be able to shake you. Ephesians 4:14 says, &#8220;Be no more children, tossed to and fro, and carried about with every wind of teaching&#8221; (Gk.). Every teaching is a wind blowing people away from the center lane. If you can be carried away by this wind, then you are still a child. You need to grow. Verse 15 mentions this: &#8220;Holding the truth in love, may grow up into him in all things&#8221; (Gk.).<p>Do not be preoccupied with how you feel. Just go on and build some good Christian habits. Your feelings are not trustworthy. Just tell them, &#8220;Little devil, I don&#8217;t believe in you.&#8221; No matter how you feel, just keep these legalities we have mentioned: pray, read the Bible and some spiritual books, and deal with your conscience by confession. Whatever is on your conscience as an offense, confess right away to the Lord, asking Him to cleanse you and keep you constantly with a purged, pure conscience.<p><I>How can I distinguish between a prayer burden and my own desire to pray for something?</I><p>Just go to the Lord and pray. Do not have your mind made up about what you will pray. Simply go to the Lord and be taught by Him to pray. Just as a little child gradually picks up new words and learns to talk, so little by little you will learn to talk to the Lord. This kind of prayer helps you to grow.<p>Do not worry about praying for your family. Whether you pray for them or not, the Lord takes care of them. He says to seek the kingdom and righteousness of the Father first; then whatever you need He will add to you (Matt. 6:33).<p><I>While I am driving, I want to talk to the Lord, but I don&#8217;t know what to say, and it seems as though the Lord is not really there.</I><p>Do not exercise your mind so much. Remember you have an inheritance of the Spirit within and the Bible without. These are the unique means by which to contact the Lord. As you are driving and have the desire to contact the Lord, begin to talk to Him in a spontaneous way. Just follow the Spirit within. If you have a sense to thank the Lord, just say, &#8220;Lord, thank You.&#8221; When you say this, some further feeling will be there. &#8220;Lord, thank You that You are so good to me. Thank You that You are now with me. I enjoy Your presence. Thank You, Lord. You are one with me. I am one with You.&#8221; To your surprise, all these words will come. This is the moving of the indwelling Spirit. Unbelievers have no such living sense within.<p>Whatever you are doing, just address the Lord in a talking way. &#8220;Lord, I am here again with You. What shall I say, Lord? Thank You for this day. It is a day for me to live Christ. Today I can experience Christ.&#8221; Something will come from within because you have the Spirit. Sometimes you may feel dull. Take out your Bible and turn to the portion you have been reading. (It would be helpful for you all to have a pocket version of the Bible at hand all the time.) Do not open it at random. Since the Ephesians training I have been on Philippians, going through it very slowly, perhaps only two or three verses a day. These verses become my prayer. Spontaneously, the verses you are reading through consecutively become your prayer. They will give you prayer for the saints. If you contact the Lord like this, you will have more and more of Him added to your being. This way will cleanse, enlighten, correct, and transform you.<p><I>Sometimes I feel I am dishonoring the Lord if I speak to Him in a normal way, in a conversational tone.</I><p>In all our daily life we should respect the Lord. The whole day we are to be in His presence, even if we are not praying or reading the Bible. Anywhere and at any time we can talk to Him. The best prayer is not a religious prayer but a talk with the Lord. To pray in a talking way does not dishonor the Lord. If we live a life of constantly respecting Him, however we pray honors Him.<p><I>I have gone to the Lord and repented of certain things that happened before I was saved. They still keep coming back. Is this of Satan, or do I need to deal with them further?</I><p>No doubt this is of Satan. The principle is found in 1 John 1:9 and 7. Whatever sin you confess before God is cleansed by the blood of Jesus. God is faithful and righteous to forgive us. This is not only a promise but also a speaking of the fact; whenever we confess a sin, we must believe that it was cleansed by God.<p>Many believers are bothered by sins they have already confessed. Then they confess again. Once you do this, you fall into a snare. If you confess the same sin a second time, it means you do not believe the blood has cleansed you.<p>I remember when I was young I confessed to the Lord that I had offended someone. According to the word of the New Testament surely I was washed by the blood. But Satan came and said, &#8220;No, you did not confess in detail.&#8221; I then went back to the Lord and confessed in detail. Again Satan said, &#8220;No, you have left out some of the details.&#8221; I made a further confession. Then Satan said, &#8220;You have confessed, but you were not sincere.&#8221; So I told the Lord I was sorry I had not confessed sincerely and asked Him to make me sincere. Again Satan said, &#8220;You didn&#8217;t say &#8216;in the name of the Lord Jesus.&#8217; &#8221; Eventually I got clear and told Satan, &#8220;Get behind me. Why should I confess more than once when I was washed the first time? The Bible doesn&#8217;t say that if you confess your sin in detail, sincerely, and in the name of the Lord Jesus, you will be washed. It only says, if you confess your sins God is faithful, and the blood of Jesus cleanses.&#8221; Hallelujah! That shut the door to the enemy.<p>Do not confess a sin you have already confessed. Satan is subtle. Either he will keep you from confessing, or he will push you to keep confessing the same thing over and over.<p><I>Paul said he practiced to have a conscience void of offense toward God and toward men (Acts 24:16). How do we know what to deal with?</I><p>There is a principle in the Bible (Matt. 5:23-24) that if we offend another, we must go to that one and confess. Not only do we confess to the Lord, but also to the offended one. Suppose I have gotten angry with one of the brothers. When I go to contact the Lord, my conscience condemns me, and I must say, &#8220;Lord, forgive me. I was angry with Brother So-and-so.&#8221; I must also go to the brother and ask him to forgive me for getting angry with him on that occasion.<p>By keeping this principle our conscience is clear and void of offense.<p><I>I have been going to the Lord every morning, asking Him to examine me, but I feel I don&#8217;t get any answer. I think I need to think over what should be examined.</I><p>No, you must never think over what to confess. When you need to confess, you will sense a specific offense. That you confess. Do not try to seek out your faults. It is not healthy and can result in an attack from the enemy. Just confess what you sense as an offense that you have not yet confessed.<p><I>What if I don&#8217;t have any sense of anything wrong?</I><p>If you do not have any sense that you are wrong or sinful, praise the Lord. It might be good to tell the Lord, &#8220;Lord, even though I don&#8217;t sense that I am wrong in anything, I do believe I am still in the old creation, in the natural life, in the flesh. Many things must still be dirty, but I do not have the consciousness of them. Lord, cleanse me.&#8221; It is good to pray this way. But if you try to dig out your faults, you will be cheated and attacked by the enemy.<p><I>Something has been bothering my conscience, but I don&#8217;t have any definite feeling.</I><p>We must all learn that if we have no sense about something specific, there is no need to go further. Rather, we must exercise our faith that we have no problem, trusting the Lord to tell us if we do. It may be that after a time the Lord will enlighten you. Have faith in the blood. This is a good principle. It is easy to be deceived by the enemy. Stay under the blood.<p><I>Many times I have gone to the Lord and sensed there was something really wrong within. But I did not have the utterance to say anything specific.</I><p>Just pray according to what you can utter. Tell the Lord, &#8220;Lord, I sense I am wrong in certain things, but I do not know how to express it. Lord, You know; wash me according to Your knowledge.&#8221; Many times when you say, &#8220;Lord, I cannot utter,&#8221; the utterance comes. Then you can tell the Lord what is wrong. The Lord is gracious. If you are not willing to confess your sins, the Lord is legal, but as soon as you are willing, He is not legal. If you will not confess, He will not let you off. Once you are ready to confess, He will say, &#8220;That&#8217;s all right, My child.&#8221;<p><I>Ever since I heard the word about contacting the Lord I have wanted to do it, but because of feeling self-conscious and not knowing how to go about it, I still have not gone to Him and opened up.</I><p>There are many cases like yours. First, you must realize that you are under the covering of the blood. Second, you are willing to confess, but you have no knowledge of any offense. Do not be bothered. Turn your prayer to praise. &#8220;Lord, I praise and thank You. I have no utterance, but You know. I am with You. I am under the blood.&#8221; This is a good lesson to learn. Rest in His faithfulness. Rest under the blood. If you wait till you sense something or try to shed tears, you leave ground for Satan to attack you. Just offer your praises to the Lord; this praise closes the door to Satan.<p>If you are hard, unwilling to confess, unwilling to contact the Lord, that attitude is to be condemned. But when you are soft and willing to talk to the Lord, just lacking the words, you must exercise your faith that you are under the blood and that the Lord is gracious to you; then turn to thanks and praises.<p><I>Shouldn&#8217;t we confess as soon as we do something wrong?</I><p>Whenever your hands are dirty, you wash them. After you confess in the morning, you do not need to confess again until something sinful arises. Then you immediately confess.<p>Some of the saints are applying the Lord&#8217;s blood in a wrong way. They say, &#8220;We apply the blood to our situation,&#8221; without making any confession. The Bible says if we confess, then the blood cleanses. In other words, our confession is a condition to the Lord&#8217;s cleansing. Without our confessing the Lord does not have a way to cleanse us.<p>Once we confess, we get cleansed. As soon as we get dirty again, we again confess and again are cleansed. In this way all day long we keep our conscience clean and pure. Then we can contact the Lord at any time.<p><I>Andrew Murray spoke of having a time to be quiet so the Lord may speak to us. I find it hard to be that quiet.</I><p>This is a matter of terminology and understanding. Of course, I do not know what Andrew Murray meant by a quiet time. No one can be quiet to the extent of stopping his thinking, unless he dies! Even in your sleep you are thinking; that is why you have dreams. Activities you can stop; thinking, never. Probably what Andrew Murray meant is that you need to set aside a time when you are free from taking care of your affairs. Then in this time the best way to keep yourself quiet is to pray, not for your concerns, but however the Lord leads. Just pray, &#8220;Lord, I just love You. I want to walk with You. I want to be one with You.&#8221; Do not pray about your sister in Washington who is sick; that is praying according to your thought. It may be that the Lord will sometimes burden you to pray this way, but to have a quiet time before the Lord you need to be kept from any kind of care.<p>The best way to arrest your thinking is to pray something from within according to the instant leading. Also, read the Bible; spontaneously your reading will become prayer. In such a quiet time, the Lord many times will speak to you and reveal something to you.<p><I>How does the enemy know what is on our conscience, and how do we know that he has put something into our mind?</I><p>You must go according to the fact. An offense is an actual offense on my conscience. If I offend you, that is an offense on my conscience which I need to confess. We confess according to our sin, not according to a thought that comes to us. Suppose you have not committed any sin nor offended anyone. A thought crosses your mind that you need to confess. This is of Satan. There is no sin, no offense, yet you have a thought charging you to confess. Do not confess in this case; it is not a fact, but something of Satan to bother you.<p><I>What is the relationship between the conscience, the anointing, and the law of life?</I><p>In The Knowledge of Life (pp. 142-172) there is a chapter called &#8220;The Inward Knowledge&#8221; which deals with this. In the Old Testament the law of commandments regulated the daily life of God&#8217;s people, telling them to honor their parents, for example, and not to steal. There were also the prophets directing the people what to do, where to go, and what to say. To be right with God under the Old Testament, one had to take care of both the law of commandments and the prophets.<p>In the New Testament the law of life (Rom. 8:2) replaces the law of commandments, and the anointing (1 John 2:27) replaces the prophets. You have been born again, and within you have a new nature. In that new nature is the law of life.<p>The law of life gives you a taste. A three-month-old baby does not have the knowledge of what is sweet and what is bitter. But he will take anything sweet that you put into his mouth and spit out anything bitter. A Christian who goes to a movie has this same rejecting sense. The inner law does not approve of his going there, and he will not be able to pray until he senses and confesses this disobedience to the Lord and to the law of life. This confession is according to the conscience, which is operating according to the law of life, just as in ancient times it operated according to the law of commandments. After the sin is confessed, it is forgiven and the blood cleanses him.<p>The anointing corresponds, not to the law, but to the prophets. While the law was concerned with morality, the prophets had to do with the comings and goings, the daily manner of life, the speaking, of God&#8217;s people. It is the anointing that tells you where you should go and what you should do. While I am speaking, I trust in the anointing for what I should say. If I disobey the anointing, my conscience troubles me. Then I must confess, &#8220;Lord, forgive me. I did not obey the anointing.&#8221; The anointing is just the moving of the Lord Himself within us.<p><I>What about friendships among Christians? And, how does fellowship relate to oneness?</I><p>If I keep having special fellowship with a certain brother day after day, this fellowship will become a friendship. Among the saints friendship is to be avoided. It is like honey, which is prohibited in the meal offering (Lev. 2:11). When fellowship becomes friendship, it has leaven in it, because underneath is a personal, natural preference. Our fellowship is common, unless for a particular reason there is a need for more contact. If there is no reason, there should not be more contact.<p>Oneness and fellowship are the same. Our practical fellowship is just the oneness. Because we Christians are all one, we can have fellowship together. This fellowship is the indwelling Spirit Himself. The electricity that goes through the overhead lights is like oneness and fellowship. Without the electricity the lights are separate and apart from each other. What makes them one is the current of electricity. That current is fellowship, or the Holy Spirit indwelling us. The indwelling Spirit is our oneness and our fellowship. If we add honey or leaven to the fellowship, we change it to friendship. This will bring corruption and rottenness into the church life.<p><I>Sometimes when I share with someone what I have enjoyed of the Lord in the Word or in a message, he adds what he has been reading, and what I wanted to share gets lost. What is the best way to fellowship about our enjoyment of the Lord?</I><p>Even in this kind of sharing, you need to learn to be restricted by the Spirit. As you grow, you will sense that the Lord wants you to share only a certain amount. This is another way we are kept from being corrupted. We would like to tell others what we saw in a message, and they want to say what light they have received. Talking too much about what we have seen is also honey. Many times when I would like to tell the brothers about some light I have received, the Lord says no. Even in spiritual things we need to be restricted. Not to obey this restriction is an offense which sooner or later we shall have to confess to the Lord.<p><I>Are the law of life and the anointing the same thing as the Lord&#8217;s speaking?</I><p>Both could be considered as the Lord&#8217;s speaking, but actually the law of life is rather a principle, giving us a certain taste. The anointing is a speaking. The law of life does not change, but the anointing does. The law of life will always prohibit you, or any child of God, from attending a movie. The anointing, on the other hand, may tell one brother to take a plane and another to go by car. The difference is that the law is related to morality or ethics, while the anointing concerns activities.<p><I>Is this the same speaking we get from the Lord in prayer?</I><p>Yes. Prayer will strengthen your sensitivity to the law of life. If a child has a heavy cold, when you put something into his mouth he may not be able to tell whether it is sweet or bitter. The law of life is not functioning because he is sick. If you do not contact the Lord in prayer and in the Word, your sense of the law of life will be weak. Some Christians can go to a movie without feeling troubled, not because there is no protest from the law of life, but because their sensitivity to it is weak through lack of exercise. If they will go to the Lord to confess, to pray, and to study the Word, the sense will soon return.<p><I>I want to go on with the Lord, but the more I am with Him the more I am fearful of His holiness, because of all the sins I, as a fallen person, have committed.</I><p>There are two kinds of fear of the Lord. One is wholesome; the other is to be rejected. If we contact the Lord through prayer and His Word, we shall have a proper, holy fear lest we offend Him by disobedience. We need such a healthy fear. The other fear is that the Lord may punish or reject or forsake us. This is of Satan, and we must overcome it. We must declare, &#8220;I am a child of God, chosen, redeemed, and cleansed by the precious blood. I have nothing to fear. God will not forsake me nor cast me away.&#8221; This second fear is the enemy&#8217;s threat to rob you of your rest. If you are not at rest, you cannot enjoy the Lord nor grow. You must be at rest from all such unnecessary fears. Challenge the enemy by telling him you are God&#8217;s child and under the blood, that God is your Father and loves you, and that you do not believe He will cast you off. The only fear you need is a holy fear not to offend the Father by grieving Him.<p><I>How can we determine which things need the attention of the elders and which things we should not pass on any further?</I><p>This is a good question. Concerning the saints in the church, the less we know the better. There is a lust in our natural life to know others&#8217; affairs. It is not healthy and damages the church life. But there is another side. We need to know where the saints are spiritually, so that we can get their help or supply some nourishment to them. The church life requires a high standard of exercise, not that we snoop into the saints&#8217; affairs, but that we find out their true situation in order to be helped by them or to help them.<p><I>Is this information about the saints for the elders to know or for all the saints?</I><p>Everybody should be the same. If all the saints would exercise in this way, the church would be healthy, having all its weaknesses taken care of. Even in the churches in the Lord&#8217;s recovery there are far too many phone calls. Spreading unnecessary information has a deadening effect. Do not give out or seek to get any information except what will enable you to supply others or be supplied by them. Then the church will grow, be built up in a healthy way, and be spared the killing that comes from knowing what we do not need to know about others.<h1 class=msg>CHAPTER SIX</h1><h1 class=msg>THE VINE-GOD&#8217;S ECONOMY</h1><h1 class=msg>(2)</h1><p>We all need more personal contact with the Lord Himself. In this message I would like to share with you how to carry this on in a daily way. We shall consider again this familiar chapter, John 15.<p>The Gospel of John is a book on life. Even our physical life, not to mention the divine life, is mysterious. Though what he is dealing with is mysterious, abstract, and profound, John&#8217;s words are very simple: &#8220;In the beginning was the Word...and the Word was God....In Him was life, and the life was the light of men....And the Word became flesh...full of grace and reality&#8221; (1:1, 4, 14). Then in chapter fifteen this One who was the Word, the very God, in whom were life and light, and with whom were grace and reality, declared that He was the true vine, His Father the husbandman, and His disciples the branches.<h2 class=head1>WHAT GOD IS DOING</h2><p>The Bible covers many different topics in its more than one thousand pages, but in this chapter, John 15, is the focus of what God is doing. Here the Father is a husbandman, a farmer, cultivating the true vine, Christ, with its branches, the believers in Christ. To see this is to see God&#8217;s economy, what God is doing in this universe. God is growing Christ, and all of us are branches in this vine. In chapter one we can see how Christ, the true vine, began attracting some of God&#8217;s chosen people to Himself (vv. 35-50). Eventually, in chapter fifteen, there was a group of New Testament believers around Him; to these followers He said that He was the vine and that they were branches.<p>We are here branching out this vine. A vine is mainly made up of its branches. In contrast, the tall pine trees have quite short branches. But if the branches of a vine are cut off, there is very little left of the vine. Do you realize that you are one of the branches of this universal vine cultivated by God the Father? Are you clear that God is doing nothing in this universe except tending this vine?<h2 class=head1>THE WORK OF THE BRANCHES</h2><p>What do the branches of a vine do? They do not do anything! They have no work. They have no activities. Their living is just to live, grow, and produce the vine. We, as the branches of the true vine, must see that the Father, the husbandman, does not want us to do any work. All He wants is that we live, grow, and produce Christ.<p>Just two or three weeks ago the Lord burdened me afresh with this vision. &#8220;Where,&#8221; He asked, &#8220;among all the Christian works, is there a work that satisfies Me? I do not want works. I want Myself, lived out of My people. Has there ever been such a people throughout all these centuries who would live Me out? Where is there such a people on the earth today?&#8221; In spite of the countless good, even prevailing, Christian works, the Lord&#8217;s heart is still not satisfied.<p>I remind you again that in this universe God is a farmer occupied with nothing else but the growth of this vine and its branches. If you see this vision of God&#8217;s heart desire, you will say, &#8220;Lord, rescue me from everything other than this. I have been doing many things. I have been making many plans. But this is not what You are doing. Lord, rescue me.&#8221;<p>Years ago I saw this vision and lived according to it, but in these last six years I have unconsciously and unintentionally left the mountaintop and come downhill. I regret that many of you who have come into the Lord&#8217;s recovery have not been clearly shown what God&#8217;s economy is. We have been distracted by other things. The result has been dissension among us. May this vision bring us all back to what God wants. I do not trust in my words. Human words are vain. But I surely trust in the revealing Spirit that He would impress you that you are nothing but branches of the vine, and that all God wants of you is to live, grow, and produce this vine.<p>In Philippians 2:2 Paul exhorted the Philippians to think the one thing. (This is the proper rendering of the phrase &#8220;of one mind.&#8221;) For us to think the one thing we must see the vision. Otherwise we shall be distracted by talk, works, or meetings. We shall be saved many times from thinking or speaking something other than the one thing if we see that God is only cultivating this vine. We are not workers, not laborers, but branches.<p>God is only growing Christ, but we are busy in many other things. They may be scriptural things, considered good or even spiritual by us, but they are not what God is doing.<h2 class=head1>LIVE CHRIST! GROW CHRIST! PRODUCE CHRIST!</h2><p>By His mercy and grace I would like to share with you how to live Christ, grow Christ, and produce Christ. In verse 7 the Lord says, &#8220;If My words abide in you,&#8221; and in verse 26 He says, &#8220;I will send to you from the Father, the Spirit of reality.&#8221; Right in John 15 are mentioned the two matters of the Word and the Spirit. According to my experience, there is no other way to live, grow, and produce Christ, except by receiving the Word and by touching the Spirit. These are our direct means.<h2 class=head1>THE VALUE OF THE NAME</h2><p>Besides the Word and the Spirit we have two other provisions. One is His name. When you come to touch the Lord and to touch His Word, you should realize that your condition is not what it should be. In yourself you are off; it is only in His name that you are in. If you will say, &#8220;O Lord, I am before You in Your name,&#8221; you will sense right away that you are no longer off. You cannot come in anything you are; you cannot come in anything you do. It is in His name alone that you are accepted.<h2 class=head1>THE VALUE OF THE BLOOD</h2><p>When you come to the Lord with a sincere desire to live Him, grow Him, and produce Him, the light is there. You will sense not only that you are off, but even that you are sinful in many things. You may say to others that everything is all right, but there will be a question within, &#8220;Are you sure you are all right? Your present condition is not all right. It is too loose. You are too light. You are too much in the self and in the natural man. You are too much in your lusts. You are sinful.&#8221; If you think you are all right, then you are in darkness. No one who is in the light would think he is all right.<p>Why is it that whenever anyone comes to God he needs an offering? It is because while we are walking on this earth, we are contaminated with the natural things. Because we are still living in our natural man, in the flesh, whenever we come to God we need the trespass offering or the sin offering (see Lev. 4 and 5). Without the shedding of the blood we could not come into the presence of God. No one who is in the light would dare to say that there is nothing wrong with him. Without the light you may think that you are clean. But when you come under the light, you will see how dirty you are, and that you need a thorough cleansing.<p>We need the blood. This is the other provision God has made for us. In ourselves we cannot come to God. We need both the name and the cleansing blood. When we come, we say, &#8220;Lord, I come to You not in myself but in Your name. I come under the blood and with the blood. I take the cleansing of Your redeeming blood.&#8221; This will clear the way for us to receive the Word and touch the Spirit.<h2 class=head1>HOW TO TAKE IN THE WORD</h2><p>You must spend time in the Word regularly. You can no more neglect the Word than you can your regular meals. Before you leave for work in the morning, you must spare at least ten minutes for reading the Word. Build up this habit in a legal, strict way. You will see what a difference it makes in your life.<p>When you get home from work, again you must get into the Word. First take a short nap, then kneel down, open the Word, and begin to read, pray-read, study, and search for half an hour or so. Do not say you are too busy. You are not too busy to talk on the phone! Leave the yard work for another time. This is your time to be watered and pruned!<h2 class=head1>EFFECTS OF RECEIVING THE WORD</h2><p>If you really touch the Word, you will find life. You will know there is life in the Word because you will be enlightened. Even in small things the light will shine brightly. You will have no place to hide. Whenever you come to the Word, you should experience this light searching and exposing. If you do not, you must pray, &#8220;Lord, have mercy upon me. Why do I not sense the light? Take away the dullness, the numbness, the blindness, and the veils, that I may sense Your light.&#8221;<p>Besides being enlightened, you will experience being nourished and strengthened. The Word first comes as light, then as nourishment and strengthening. Eventually it does a killing work. Once the light exposes and the nourishment strengthens, you will say, &#8220;Lord, I am willing. Take this away. Cut it off.&#8221; In receiving the Word, you will find it does much killing within you. It will kill your natural concepts about your husband or wife, about the brothers and sisters, about the church and the elders. It will kill your carnal desires and fleshly lusts. You will find yourself praying, &#8220;Lord, kill my pride. Kill my natural humility. Kill my performed meekness. Kill my hypocrisy. Kill my politics with the brothers and with my wife.&#8221; If you build up the habit of getting into the Word, you will have this experience daily.<p>Eventually you will find this Christ so close and so precious to you. You will begin to breathe Him and to live Him. By taking the Word in this way, you will live Him, grow Him, and produce Him. You will have the soil of your heart cultivated by the Father to grow Christ. He will cultivate the soil of your conscience, which is the gate. He will cultivate also the soil of your emotion, your will, and your mind. This will make a way for the vine to spread into every part of your soul.<p>If you will all go to the Word in this way over a period of time, the outcome will be a genuine revival in the church life, brought about from within, without any stirring up, promotion, or performance. This is what the Lord&#8217;s recovery needs today.<p>Do not correct or adjust yourself. Just come back to the Word and to abiding in the vine by abiding in His words. When it says in John 15:7, &#8220;My words abide in you,&#8221; in Greek &#8220;words&#8221; is rhema, the present, instant speaking. We digest the logos, and it becomes the rhema to us. Then we get the enlightening, the nourishing, the strengthening, the killing, and the living of Christ.<h2 class=head1>HOW TO TOUCH THE SPIRIT</h2><p>We have the Bible in our hands and the Holy Spirit in our spirit. Whatever our condition-weak, backsliding, or wrong-thank God we do have these two legacies. The Spirit and the Word are inseparable. As you read, the Holy Spirit cooperates with the Word. In contrast, if you try to exercise the spirit in reading the Los Angeles Times, there will be no inward response. But every time you come to the Bible, in the name and under the blood, something inside works in coordination with what you are reading outside. That is the corresponding Spirit.<p>Obedience is the only way to touch the corresponding Spirit. You may be weak, but you cannot deny that the dear Spirit of our God is in you. You may grieve Him, but He will never leave you. This is why, whenever you have a heart to come to the Lord in His name and under His blood, the Spirit within will echo what you read in the Word. Then the more you say amen to this speaking, the more the responding Spirit will work within you. You will be either rebuked to the depths of your being or rejoicing in the heights. You will never be indifferent.<h2 class=head1>THE SPIRIT AND THE WORD WORKING WITHIN</h2><p>With the Word occupying and saturating your mind and the Spirit dwelling in your spirit, you will live, grow, and produce Christ. You will have the fragrance of Christ, which others will sense without any advertising. How does this come about? By receiving the Word into your being time after time, the Spirit has wrought Himself, even Christ, into you. Your mind will be possessed by the Word and your spirit permeated with the Spirit.<p>The Word is a lamp unto our feet and a light unto our path (Psa. 119:105). The Word that occupies your mind will shine before your feet, lighting your way. You will not be walking in darkness because the mind-occupying Word will shine over your steps.<p>At the same time the indwelling Spirit will keep speaking to you, comforting and nourishing you all day. It is like the food we take in; we may finish a meal in thirty minutes, but for several hours afterward that food sustains us.<p>May we take Christ as our food through His Word and drink Him as our water through the Spirit. Thus we shall live, grow, and produce Him, fulfilling the Father&#8217;s desire.<h1 class=msg>CHAPTER SEVEN</h1><h1 class=msg>A PRACTICAL WAY TO ABIDE IN THE VINE</h1><h1 class=msg>(2)</h1><p>The writings of the Apostle John are in three categories- the Gospel, the three Epistles, and the book of Revelation. In his Gospel John tells us about abiding in the vine. In fact, this is the central thought in the Gospel of John. Not till we come to his Epistles, however, do we find how to abide in the vine. Then in Revelation we have the reaping.<p>Before we consider what the Epistles tell us of the way to abide in the vine, I would remind you of the vision shown us in John 15. It is nothing less than the dispensation of the Triune God. The Father is a husbandman cultivating a vine, the Son. What the Father is and does has become embodied in the Son. The Spirit transmits what the Father cultivates and what the Son embodies, into us the branches.<p>What is the secret of the growth and spread of this vine? Life. We the branches have only to live the life of this vine, grow this vine, and produce this vine. This life is simple and ordinary, without the encumbrances of organization, gifts, or doctrine. Life does not mean teachings, natural talents, plans, or activities. John 15 does not refer to teachings, gifts, and organization, though these are what Christianity requires for its existence and spreading. The vine in John 15 grows by life alone.<p>We need this vision to kill all our dependence on arrangements, schemes, and gifts. It is not easy to live such a simple life. We were born and raised in an environment that has encouraged us to teach, organize, use our gifts, and take action. These things are still in our blood. Sooner or later they will crop up, unless our natural man has been put to death. May God have mercy upon us, that our plans and activities may be fully killed, and that we may see that He wants nothing but His Son lived out as our life and as our fruit. If we see this, we shall prostrate ourselves before Him and repent of living by our natural man.<h2 class=head1>THE WORD AND FRUIT-BEARING</h2><p>The Word is the embodiment of the Triune God, and also of His life, light, and economy. The divine life is embodied in the printed page of the Bible. This Word is concrete and substantial. We can all touch and receive it. From the Lord&#8217;s word in 15:7, &#8220;If you abide in Me and My words abide in you,&#8221; we can see that our abiding in Him is a condition for His word abiding in us.<p>The result of this mutual abiding is fruit-bearing. If you were to ask the branches how they are able to bear fruit, they would say they do not plan, nor organize, nor use their gifts; their fruit is just the outflow of their inner life. Let us stop all our doings and just live Christ, grow Him, and reproduce Him. &#8220;Consider your ways. Ye have sown much, and bring in little&#8221; (Hag. 1:5-6). What has been the result of all our labor?<h2 class=head1>ABIDING-FIRST JOHN</h2><p>In 1 John we are given the practical ways to experience abiding in Christ. The first chapter gives us the first way. We shall consider the chapter verse by verse.<h2 class=head1>THE WORD OF LIFE</h2><p>First John 1:1 says, &#8220;That which was from the beginning, which we have heard, which we have seen with our eyes, which we have looked upon, and our hands have handled, concerning the Word of life&#8221; (Gk.). By comparing this verse with the first verse of the Gospel of John, we know that &#8220;That which was from the beginning&#8221; is the Word. The Word is for hearing; it can also be seen and handled. The Word of life is a Person; &#8220;Word&#8221; is capitalized because it is personified. This Person is the Lord Jesus. If we add John 1:4, &#8220;In Him was life,&#8221; to the description of Him in John 1:1 as the Word, we have the term used here, the Word of life.<p>The Word of life cannot be separated from the Word of letters. To do so would be like separating your spirit from your body; the result would be death. The Word of life is one with the Word of letters. We must treasure this book, the Bible, because within its printed pages is the Word of life.<p>Verse 2 says, &#8220;For the life was manifested, and we have seen it, and bear witness, and show unto you that eternal life, which was with the Father, and was manifested unto us.&#8221; Eternal life can be shown. It is not just preached or taught; there is a showing of the eternal life. The words, &#8220;which was with the Father, and was manifested unto us,&#8221; again indicate that eternal life is nothing less than Jesus Christ Himself. He is the very life.<h2 class=head1>FELLOWSHIP</h2><p>Verse 3 says, &#8220;That which we have seen and heard declare we unto you, that ye also may have fellowship with us: and truly our fellowship is with the Father, and with his Son Jesus Christ.&#8221; The word translated &#8220;declare&#8221; means to hand over, not just to show you my hymn book, for example, but also to hand it over to you. When we hand this life over to others, the outcome is fellowship. If we have life, we are in the fellowship. We hand this eternal life over to others that they may have fellowship with us, with the Father, and with His Son Jesus Christ.<h2 class=head1>LIGHT</h2><p>Verses 4 and 5 say, &#8220;And these things write we unto you, that your joy may be full. This then is the message which we have heard of him, and declare unto you, that God is light, and in him is no darkness at all.&#8221; God&#8217;s being light to us is subjective. The context makes clear that God is light when we have life and are in the fellowship of life. In this fellowship of life is light. All these key words-Word, life, light, and God- are also found in John 1. The difference is that in the Gospel they are objective, whereas in the Epistles the reality of these words is within us. The light is in the fellowship; any darkness means that something is wrong.<p>Verse 6 continues, &#8220;If we say that we have fellowship with him, and walk in darkness, we lie, and do not the truth.&#8221; With some of the saints, we can sense a transparency. As we talk and fellowship with them, there is no sense of any darkness or opaqueness. With others this is not so; perhaps only one part is transparent and the rest of their being is in darkness. You may be in darkness, yet say you are not. You may be deceived by the enemy and unintentionally tell a lie. Unconsciously you are deceiving others because of darkness within.<h2 class=head1>CLEANSING BY THE BLOOD</h2><p>&#8220;But if we walk in the light, as he is in the light, we have fellowship one with another, and the blood of Jesus Christ his Son cleanseth us from all sin&#8221; (v. 7). Since light is God Himself, to walk in the light is to walk in God. We may go to a fellowship meeting or to someone&#8217;s home for fellowship and yet not have any true fellowship. Fellowship is not possible if we are in darkness. We may have outward contact, but without the flow of life within there is no true fellowship. But if we walk in the light as He is in the light, we have fellowship one with another, and the blood cleanses us from all sin. If we are walking in God and are in the fellowship, our real situation will be exposed. We shall see that in this matter we were wrong and in that matter mistaken. Surely we shall confess and ask the Lord&#8217;s forgiveness. This confession comes spontaneously from the light in the fellowship. Then the blood cleanses, even without our applying it. Too often we apply the blood in darkness, outside the fellowship and in death. With such a loose, light attitude the blood does not cleanse.<h2 class=head1>WALKING IN THE LIGHT FOR THE BLOOD TO CLEANSE</h2><p>The real abiding in Christ is a fine, sensitive matter. That is why we must go to the Lord day by day to spend time in His presence and to have Him check whether we are in life, in the fellowship, in the exposing light, and fully under the cleansing of the blood. If we are, we shall have the assurance that we are transparent, with nothing between Him and us. This is abiding. To abide in Christ we need the fellowship, the light, the enlightening, the confessing, and the cleansing.<h2 class=head1>CONFESSION</h2><p>Verses 8 and 9 say, &#8220;If we say that we have no sin, we deceive ourselves, and the truth is not in us. If we confess our sins, he is faithful and just to forgive us our sins, and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness.&#8221; Even in the Apostle&#8217;s day, some were saying that once they were saved they no longer sinned. This is a deception. The reality is that we still have sin in us.<p>How do you confess your sins? There is a confession according to knowledge. You realize you have offended people, so you ask the Lord to forgive you. Your conscience is not touched, you have no feeling of regret, and you shed no tears. This is a confession outside life, with your real situation not exposed to the light. Whether God recognizes such a confession which is only according to knowledge I dare not say, but I can tell you it has no effect on your life.<h2 class=head1>CONFESSION IN LIFE</h2><p>There is a confession which changes your life. While you are in the fellowship, the light shines penetratingly through you, exposing your true condition. You are filled with regret, the tears may flow, you confess, and the blood of Jesus cleanses you. True confession comes from the exposure of the inner light.<p>If you confess only according to knowledge, you may pray, &#8220;O Lord, forgive me for gossiping,&#8221; but within a short time you will find your loose talk continuing as before. But if you confess in life, with the light shining on your gossiping, such a confession will seal your lips, and it will be a long time before another vain word crosses them.<p>Notice that both sins and unrighteousness are mentioned in verse 9. When this light exposes, it has no regard for your person. Your actions may not have been sinful, but under this light you will see that you have wronged this brother, you have cheated that sister, in this matter you were unjust, and in that matter you were unrighteous. Your confession will touch the very depths of your being, not just your conscience, and it will transform you.<p>The final verse in 1 John 1 says, &#8220;If we say that we have not sinned, we make him a liar, and his word is not in us.&#8221; We not only &#8220;have sin&#8221; (v. 8), but also &#8220;have sinned.&#8221; If we are in the fellowship, we shall be fearful and trembling in the realization that we not only have sin but that we are also sinning.<h2 class=head1>THE WAY TO ABIDE IN CHRIST (1)</h2><p>What is the way to abide in Christ? First John 1 tells us that we must come to the light and be fully exposed, with no sin or unrighteousness hidden. We must recognize that we both have sin and do sin, that we are guilty of both sin and unrighteousness. We have no escape but to confess and be cleansed. By this way we abide in Christ.<p>If you are abiding in Christ, you will sense a light shining over you and within you. Be faithful to this shining. It will expose, not your wife&#8217;s mistakes, but yours. You may feel you have only a little offense compared to your wife&#8217;s, but if you complain to the Lord that He should deal with her as well, you will be out of the abiding. If it is during the night that the light comes, you can tell the Lord you will make things right with your wife first thing in the morning. By taking care of every matter in such a tender way, you will be kept in the abiding. Keep yourself fully clear under the exposure of the inner light.<h2 class=head1>THE WAY TO ABIDE IN CHRIST (2)</h2><p>In chapter two of 1 John we shall consider only verse 27. &#8220;But the anointing which ye have received of him abideth in you, and ye need not that any man teach you: but as the same anointing teacheth you of all things, and is true, and is no lie, and even as it hath taught you, ye abide in him&#8221; (Gk.). Here we see that we abide in the vine according to the inner anointing. This anointing is a moving within us, the working of the all-inclusive Spirit as the compound ointment (see Exo. 30:23-25).<p>There is a contrast between these two chapters in 1 John. Chapter one deals with sins, failures, and unrighteousness, all of which are negative things. Chapter two is positive, with the anointing directing us what to say, what to do, and where to go.<p>Many times the sense of the anointing is &#8220;no&#8221; to our plans, our thoughts, or our words. How many times do we obey the &#8220;no&#8221;? Very few. This means we are not abiding, for we are not going according to the teaching of the inner anointing.<h2 class=head1>UNDERSTANDING THE ANOINTING</h2><p>Without a thorough knowledge of the Word, you will be unable to understand much of what the anointing teaches. In the Lord&#8217;s recovery, every saint must be built up with the full knowledge of the Bible. Gradually your ability to understand and interpret spiritual things will develop; this will give the anointing the means to speak to you.<p>It grieves me that in the Lord&#8217;s recovery these days there are so many signs of dissension, division, looseness, and lightness. A false liberty has crept in. These are offenses to the Lord. I entreat you to come back to the way of life. Spend time on the Word every day. If you run a race, you will be disqualified unless you stay within the two lines. We must be just as strict. All of us in the Lord&#8217;s recovery must maintain a high standard lest we give the recovery a bad name. Be strict with yourself about getting into the Word. Only in this way can you come to understand what the anointing is teaching you and thus abide in Him.<h2 class=head1>THE WAY TO ABIDE IN CHRIST (3)</h2><p>Now we come to the third way to abide in the vine. &#8220;For if our heart condemn us, God is greater than our heart, and knoweth all things. Beloved, if our heart condemn us not, then have we boldness toward God&#8221; (1 John 3:20-21, Gk.).<h2 class=head1>A HEART FREE OF CONDEMNATION</h2><p>How can we have boldness toward God? It is by a heart without condemnation. This heart has been sprinkled from an evil conscience (Heb. 10:22) and is void of offense toward God and men (Acts 24:16). We must deal with anything our conscience condemns.<p>From these three chapters in 1 John we can see that to abide in Christ we must walk in the light that the blood may cleanse us, obey the teaching of the inner anointing, and keep our heart clean from any condemnation. By taking care of these three things, we are abiding in Him.<h1 class=msg>CHAPTER EIGHT</h1><h1 class=msg>ABIDING-DEATH AND RESURRECTION</h1><p>Before we consider an Old Testament picture of the Spirit and its relationship to our abiding in Christ, we shall answer some questions based on the previous two messages.<h2 class=head1>QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS</h2><p><I>I don&#8217;t understand the difference between growing Christ and producing Christ.</I><p>We stressed that the Father wants us to live Christ, grow Christ, and produce Christ. Living Christ is the beginning and is somewhat general. By living Him we grow Him; this is the second step. Producing Christ comes out of growing Him and is the fruit-bearing. To produce Christ is to bear fruit.<p>While I was growing up, I lived near a vineyard. In the fall the vine would be heavily laden with grapes. When winter came, the branches would be severely cut back. In the springtime those sparse branches would begin living the vine and then growing the vine. Day by day I would see them growing and spreading. Eventually, fall would return and the branches would bear fruit, that is, produce the vine. There was much fruit. This process illustrates the difference between growing Christ and producing Him.<p><I>How can you tell when your heart is condemning you and when Satan condemns you?</I><p>We need to distinguish between God&#8217;s condemnation and the enemy&#8217;s accusation. God condemns, the enemy accuses. When we have something wrong or sinful, both the condemnation and the accusation will be present. In such a case there is no need to distinguish between the two. Just confess and get the matter cleared up. &#8220;Lord, I am wrong in this. How I thank You that You have enlightened me regarding it. Forgive me. I regret it, and I repent and confess, asking You to forgive me.&#8221; Then right away exercise your faith to take the Word, which says that if we confess, the blood of Jesus Christ cleanses (1 John 1:7, 9). Next, turn your confession to praise and thanks. &#8220;Thank You, Lord. Praise You for the cleansing of the blood.&#8221; If something still comes to bother you after such a confession and thanksgiving, that is Satan&#8217;s accusation. To differentiate between it and God&#8217;s condemnation is now easy. Say to the enemy, &#8220;Get behind me, Satan. I refuse to listen to you. The blood has cleansed me.&#8221;<p><I>I do not have the vision of the vine and the branches. Should I pray for this vision, or is it something that will be worked out in time?</I><p>When we use the term vision, we do not mean the strange seeing of something that the Pentecostalists refer to as a vision. Do not expect that while you are studying or praying over John 15, you will see before you a vine with some branches, one of which even has your name on it! If such a vision appears to you, reject it as demonic.<p>The first time I went to a Pentecostal meeting was with Brother Nee, who had been invited to speak. I had been in Christianity for many years, but I had never before seen such shocking behavior. One fell over, another was laughing hysterically, another was in the corner claiming to see a vision, and some older women kept jumping in the air. It was wild. They talked about seeing a vision.<p>A few years later, I was serving the Lord in Tientsin, China&#8217;s largest port, some two and a half hours from Peking, the capital. Among us was an elderly sister, the wife of a medical doctor. She became involved in the Pentecostal movement. Whenever she prayed, she would roll on the floor. In time, she saw a vision of an old man with a white beard. Eventually, every time she prayed, she saw this vision. The old man would come, gaze at her, and then disappear. We warned her to be careful, but Pentecostalists are so subjective they trust implicitly in their experiences. She would not heed us. At first she was happy about her vision, but after some time it began to trouble her. Then she became sick and was bedridden for a long period. During her illness, that old man often appeared to her. She became quite disturbed and again referred her case to us. We told her the old man was a demon, which she must reject. It was hard for her to believe our word and to reject the demon, but we prayed for her. The Lord eventually gained the victory, and the demon left.<p>Such is a Pentecostal vision. In our dictionary, however, &#8220;vision&#8221; does not mean this! Rather, it is a seeing without any Pentecostal vision. As you read John 15, for example, you are so deeply impressed within that you can no longer be the same. Before, you were engaged in making plans and carrying out activities. Now, whenever you turn to what you had been doing so easily before, you have the sense, &#8220;No, this is not life. It is activity.&#8221; You try to keep on making your plans, but the sense comes, &#8220;This is not the branch living the vine, growing the vine, and producing the vine. This is not life.&#8221; If you are getting this kind of reaction within you, you may be assured that you have the vision. Formerly you may have enjoyed your work and even boasted about it. Now the sense of pleasure is gone, and a bothering has come, causing you to reduce, even stop, what you have been doing. Every spiritual seeing has this effect.<p><I>In the matter of confessing, what about things you do repeatedly?</I><p>When you clean a room in a hurry, it does not get very clean. Later, when you come to look it over, you can see it needs a much more thorough job. The same is true with our confessing. If we go to the Lord in a rough, hasty way, we shall not take thorough care of our confessing. The next time we go to Him, not in a rush, we shall find the same matters still need our attention. Do not think this is a repetition of what you have already confessed; it is that you must complete your unfinished confession.<p><I>How can we avoid confessing according to knowledge and be sure that we are confessing by life?</I><p>Sometimes we may confess by knowledge, yet because we do so before Him, the Lord extends His mercy. When you have a little feeling that you have touched the Lord&#8217;s mercy even in confessing by knowledge, go on to the confession by life. The test of genuine confession is whether it results in life. The phrase in Acts 11:18, &#8220;repentance unto life,&#8221; can be translated &#8220;repentance issuing in, or resulting in, life.&#8221; You may think that your confession is by life, but if there is no change in your life, it is not genuine. On the other hand, you may go to the Lord one night and say, &#8220;O Lord, forgive me. I offended the brothers,&#8221; and go to bed feeling you have confessed by knowledge without any inspiration. The next morning, though, when you are about to talk to your wife and say something negative about the brothers, you are stopped by fear. This change in life proves that the previous night&#8217;s confession was genuine. This &#8220;repentance unto life&#8221; produces fruit worthy of repentance (Matt. 3:8). Every time you repent, there must be fruit. Your feeling about your confession is not reliable. Do not go by your feeling; go by the fact, the fruit that results.<p><I>I am not clear about the matter of the blood in our confession.</I><p>There is no need to say, &#8220;Lord, I apply Your blood to my situation.&#8221; First John 1 says that if we confess our sins, God forgives. It also says that if we walk in the light, we have fellowship one with another, and the blood of Jesus cleanses. In these verses confession is implied. If I offend a brother, when I am in the fellowship the light will expose. Then I shall ask the Lord to forgive me for offending Brother So-and-so. Spontaneously I shall also go to that brother and ask him to forgive me. It is at this point that the blood cleanses. If I repent and confess, the blood is effectual for me, without my applying it.<p><I>When you really want to repent but feel that you are just in the area of knowledge, how do you get from knowledge into life?</I><p>Just confess sincerely. Pray, &#8220;Lord, have mercy on me that I may confess to You from a sincere heart.&#8221; Life is just the Lord Himself. Today as the Spirit He is waiting within us. When we turn our heart to Him, we touch Him. In Him we spontaneously confess by life. Alas, sometimes our confession is just a performance for the purpose of deceiving others. How much we need the Lord&#8217;s mercy!<p><I>Could you share a little more about getting into the Word consistently?</I><p>It is profitable for us to cultivate good habits and not to take up bad habits. Doing something that is not wholesome can lead to worse things. This is like walking around a well; you may feel quite safe and certain that you will not fall in, but a naughty boy may come along and give you a push. Beer, for example, is a threshold to wine. Stay away from the one lest you be lured to the other.<p>Not only your own well-being is at stake. We must &#8220;abstain from all appearance of evil&#8221; (1 Thes. 5:22). C. H. Spurgeon was once invited by the manager of a newly built theater to go there for an open house to preach the gospel. After agreeing to go, Spurgeon did not feel peaceful about it. Some circumstance arose which made it impossible for him to keep his commitment. When the manager came to find out why Spurgeon had not fulfilled his promise, Spurgeon apologized. Then the manager told Spurgeon that if he had gone to preach the gospel in the theater, its business would have flourished. Spurgeon realized why God had intervened and prevented his going. To go into a theater, no matter how good the motive, is to give an appearance of evil.<p>After saying so much about Christ in the earlier part of Philippians, Paul admonishes us in 4:8, &#8220;Whatsoever things are true, whatsoever things are honest, whatsoever things are just, whatsoever things are pure, whatsoever things are lovely, whatsoever things are of good report; if there be any virtue, and if there be any praise, think on these things.&#8221; Thinking on these things, most of which are not Christ, still is a good habit. This is the kind of habit we need to build up. Praying, studying the Bible, and contacting the Lord are also good habits we need to cultivate in a legal way. Do not wait till you are moved by the Spirit to contact the Lord. It may be a long time before any inspiration comes; make it a habit to contact Him regardless of how you feel.<p>Building up these good habits will keep you from sin. Do you think that if you spend time in the Bible every day you will want to go to the movies? On the other hand, if you neglect the Bible day after day, you may feel free to go. Do you call that liberation? It is your lusts which are being liberated. Do you feel free to pray and to thank the Lord for His mercy when you walk into a movie? Contrast your feeling on entering a theater with your feeling on entering the meeting hall. There is an atmosphere in the meeting hall that constrains you to pray and praise even as you are walking up the stairs.<p>Be faithful to build up these good habits of touching the Lord through the Word and through prayer. If you do not sense His mercy and grace toward you today, you may tomorrow. Our consciousness fluctuates, but actually His grace and mercy remain the same. His blessing is upon us, whether we sense it or not, every time we come to the Word.<p><I>When is confession enough, and when is restitution also required?</I><p>If only God knows of your wrongdoing, there is no need to tell others; just confess to Him. If others know of it, even if the offense was not against them, it is best to confess to them too, to clear up their poor impression of you and also to be a testimony to them.<h2 class=head1>THE ANOINTING OINTMENT</h2><p>One of the Old Testament pictures that helps us to understand the mysterious abstraction of the Spirit is the anointing ointment, described in Exodus 30:23-25. It is this passage that is referred to in 1 John 2:27, the New Testament verse on the anointing. To understand the anointing we must understand this ointment. Notice that it is compound; that is, it is made up of different elements chemically combined into one unit. This signifies that the Spirit of God is compounded of several elements.<p>Here is a list of the spices which were added to the hin of oil representing the Spirit. The quantity and the meaning are also given.<h2 class=head1>SPICES IN THE ANOINTING OINTMENT</h2><p>The one hin of oil is compounded with these four spices so that it becomes a compound ointment. It is clear in the Bible (Psa. 45:7; Isa. 61:1) that oil represents the Holy Spirit. With what is the Holy Spirit compounded? These spices indicate that it is with the death and resurrection of Christ.<p>If you notice the measure of the spices, you will see that by combining the middle two spices there are three units of five hundred shekels each. All three units are in the one hin of oil. Together they form a picture of the Triune God. Why is the second unit of five hundred shekels divided into two? This reminds us that the second One of the Triune God was split on the cross.<p>When was the Spirit of God compounded with these spices of death and resurrection? In John 7:39 we are told &#8220;the Spirit was not yet, because Jesus was not yet glorified.&#8221; There was surely the Spirit of God before this time, but not the compound Spirit. It was after the death and resurrection of Christ that the Spirit was compounded.<h2 class=head1>THE ANOINTING</h2><p>We abide in Christ according to the teaching of the anointing. This anointing is the moving and working of the compound Spirit. His teaching reflects Himself and is also compounded with Christ&#8217;s death and resurrection.<p>When 1 John 2:27 says the anointing &#8220;teacheth you of all things,&#8221; it implies that the anointing is related to the Bible. Without laying a firm foundation in God&#8217;s Word, you have no way to interpret what the anointing is speaking to you. This Word outside us is always one with the Spirit inside us. And the Spirit within always echoes the Word without. When the Word gets into us, the Word becomes the Spirit. When the Spirit is spoken out from us, He becomes the Word. How can we get the Word that is outside us into us? By praying. The writings of godly men down through the ages all attest to the value of the prayerful reading of the Word. We must stay with the Word till it becomes the Spirit through our spiritual breathing, that is, our prayerful reading, of it.<h2 class=head1>TAKING CHRIST IN THROUGH THE WORD</h2><p>All that the Father is and does is embodied in the Son, who in turn is embodied in the Word. Whenever you touch the Bible in a sincere way, with some exercise of the spirit, you touch Christ, as well as life, light, and the Spirit, for these abstract, mysterious verities are all embodied in the solid Word. Now do you see the importance of having the habit of regularly getting into the Word? Even if you have no consciousness of touching the very Christ and all He is, that is what will be happening. The prayerful, regular reading of the Word will make a tremendous difference in your life. You will never regret being legal about reading the Word, but you will surely regret being loose in your daily living.<h2 class=head1>THE COMPOUNDED NEW TESTAMENT</h2><p>The Spirit, as we have said, is compounded with the death and resurrection of Christ. What is true of the Spirit is also true of the New Testament. The death and resurrection of Christ are both compounded in the Word. Abiding in the Lord is according to the anointing&#8217;s teaching, which is based upon your knowledge of the Word. Since the Word is mainly compounded with death and resurrection, this is the teaching of the anointing. You need knowledge concerning His death and resurrection. Then you will find that the more you abide in Christ, the more you experience His death and participate in His resurrection. This kind of abiding is the real release of the spirit, based upon the termination of everything natural. The spirit we release should not be mixed with our natural ability, our flesh, our self, or anything else of the old creation. Our spirit needs the imprint of the death of all these natural things.<p>Abiding in Christ, then, is according to the working of His death and resurrection in you. All your natural being, all the old creation, must be put on the cross. When you experience this killing, your abiding in Christ will be genuine and deep. On the positive side, you will also experience the resurrection, and your release of the spirit will be without any mixture.<h2 class=head1>A THOROUGH KILLING</h2><p>To experience more of this putting to death of whatever is of your self, your flesh, and the old man, read the Word, pray, and breathe in the compound Spirit. If anything of the old still remains, it becomes an insulation between Christ and you, making your abiding superficial. Abiding in Christ in a thorough way depends upon a thorough killing, carried out by the Word and executed by the Spirit. With this killing comes resurrection. Then whatever comes forth from you will be from a crystal pure spirit.<p>Herein is the way for the living, growing, and producing of Christ. This will make us shining lights individually (Phil. 2:15) and a shining lampstand collectively (Rev. 1:20). The Lord will be expressed and God&#8217;s economy fulfilled.<h1 class=msg>CHAPTER NINE</h1><h1 class=msg>THE WORD OF THE CROSS AND THE WORD OF LIFE</h1><p>If you have only a superficial knowledge of the New Testament, you may think that its pages contain just stories and teachings. Buried beneath its surface, however, are the implications of the death and resurrection of Christ. We shall discuss this further after we answer some questions.<h2 class=head1>QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS</h2><p><I>I believe I have had the experience of dying that you mentioned in the previous message, but I am not clear about resurrection.</I><p>In the Bible death is the threshold of resurrection (2 Cor. 4:11-12). If you have the experience of death, you do not need to understand resurrection; it is the complement of death. They go together, both in the Bible and in the Spirit, and therefore in our experience.<p><I>When we go to the Word, how do we know what portion to read?</I><p>Let me suggest a way that I learned from Watchman Nee. Have two copies of the Bible. One should be plain, just the pure text of the Bible without any notes. This is for your morning reading, not too long a portion, a half chapter at most. For this reading prayerfully select a book, like one of the Gospels or one of the Epistles. (Do not choose Ezekiel for nourishment. Wait till you are full-grown and can handle that kind of food!) Go through this book consecutively verse by verse, praying over every phrase so that you thoroughly digest it. This kind of reading is for your spiritual nourishment.<p>Use the other copy of the Bible to study for knowledge. Make notes on its pages of light you receive or of comments from messages or from reference books. For this reading, go through the whole Bible consecutively, once a year, four chapters a day. Gaining this knowledge will give you a solid foundation for life and will enrich the nourishment you receive from your morning reading.<p>These two ways of getting into the Word, one for nourishment and the other for knowledge, I surely recommend to all of you.<p><I>What is the difference between being legal with oneself to get into the Word whether one feels like it or not, and Christian behavior?</I><p>The routine, daily eating of the Word will surely influence your behavior. Because the Bible is the word of our God, when we come to it we have the sense, even before we read it, that we are coming to God Himself. You will be improved just by this sense. Suppose you were to use your time for the Word on a secular magazine or newspaper instead. Do you not think that giving that time to what the world thinks will have a negative, worldly influence on your behavior?<p>For over fifty years I have been kept by the Lord in His Word, without ever becoming loose. It would grieve me to see any of you become loose by not diligently reading the Word. The time you waste cannot be recovered, and the poison you take in has a lasting effect. Some of you who are ex-hippies can testify how drugs have damaged your mind, even though you have repented. Go the legal way, not the loose way.<p><I>When you talk about being strict and legal, do you mean living like a monk?</I><p>It is not only monks who are legal. Think how strict the Armed Forces are. Even though the United States is so democratic, once you are in the military service, even the length of your hair is regulated. You have a precise time to get up and get your bed made, and you must keep all your belongings in order. This strict treatment has improved the character of many sloppy, young men.<p>I do not want you to become like a monk or a nun; just be a proper person. Do not get to bed too late. Get up and get dressed at an early hour. Make your bed, then pray and read the Word. Keep all your books in order. Keep all your clothes in their right place. Do not leave dirty clothes around. Put your shoes where they belong. Every room in your house must be neat. Even your yard, including the part by the street, should have a well-kept appearance.<p>Our testimony as Christians must be that we are people of the highest caliber. We are the witnesses of the Lord Jesus. Do you think we can be both sloppy and spiritual? In God&#8217;s creation everything is in good order. We do not want to live in the fallen situation of the worldlings. From my observation of over fifty years, I can state that everyone ever used by the Lord has been one who is strict with himself.<p><I>Should we have a specific time to come to the Lord to confess?</I><p>We do not go to the Lord with a certain purpose; we go because we love Him and want to be with Him. Sometimes our grandchildren living nearby stop in to see us. If they behave well, we have learned they are after something. As soon as they get the cookie or piece of gum they have come for, they take off. Such behavior is like our coming to the Lord with a purpose.<p>He wants us to come out of love for Him. It would please us so much if our grandchildren came to visit us just because they loved us, not for any other purpose. So it is with the Lord. Early in the morning He would have us contact Him. In our need and out of love for Him, we go to Him. Then, in His presence, because He is light, we see our faults, spontaneously make confession, and are cleansed by the blood. To go to the Lord with the purpose of confessing, on the other hand, may result in several minutes of frustration.<p><I>Some of us have seen the need for physical exercise and have started jogging, or playing tennis, volleyball, or softball. As you have said, the trend of this age is with sports. Can you help us have the proper attitude toward taking care of our body and yet, on the other hand, be preserved from the world of sports?</I><p>In this crooked, perverse generation, sports and entertainment lead many people into sin and are, in fact, their means of fulfilling their lusts. We need to follow the principle of avoiding the appearance of evil (1 Thes. 5:22).<p>Your question indicates that you love the Lord and are seeking after Him. As Christians we are not under the law, but under the Lord Himself. Thus, when you would go out to participate in some sport, first ask Him, &#8220;Lord, will You go with me?&#8221; The Lord may say, &#8220;I don&#8217;t like that. I won&#8217;t go there with you.&#8221;<p>If that is the case, how are you going to get the needful exercise for your body? You may think that young people will not exercise if they cannot be in games. It all depends on your love for the Lord. As a young man I played on the school team. One day, after I was saved, the ball came to me, but I could not kick it. No one outwardly restrained me, but I could not exercise my foot to kick the ball. That was the end of my participation in that sport. Nonetheless, over the years I have surely gotten plenty of exercise. Even now I spend an hour or so a day in exercise, walking, sweeping the yard, watering the plants, and cleaning. Without exercise I cannot sleep well; I need to be exhausted of my preoccupations through exercise.<p>If you love the Lord, He will lead you as to the kind of exercise you should have.<h2 class=head1>THE CONSTITUENTS OF THE WORD</h2><p>I would like to give you some examples of death and resurrection in the Word. As we said in the previous message, the spices of the compound ointment (Exo. 30:23-25) are the constituents of the Word as well as of the Spirit. What is the difference between the teachings in the Bible and the ethical teachings of Confucius? Both contain corrections and adjustments, but in the Bible those corrections and adjustments contain a killing element. Both this killing factor and the element of resurrection are the main constituents of the Bible.<p>Let us illustrate how this killing factor works. Suppose you come home from work tired out, and as soon as you step into the house, something provokes you to be annoyed with your wife. You do not say anything because you have made a commitment to take a nap before you do anything else. After your short nap you read the Word for thirty minutes or so. When that is over, your annoyance will be gone. Even if you try to stay annoyed, you will fail! What has happened? Whatever you read in the Word has killed your annoyance. You may even find yourself going to your wife to apologize for not greeting her when you got home. The killing has brought in resurrection; that is why you now feel happy. The holy Word includes the Lord&#8217;s presence. It both kills you and supplies you with the Lord Himself. The resulting sense of joy, of the Lord, of the Spirit, of strength, and of nourishment, is resurrection. This illustration shows how the two constituents operate in us when we are faithful to get into the Word.<h2 class=head1>THE WORD OF THE CROSS</h2><p>How did Paul deal with the problems in the church at Corinth? &#8220;The word of the cross is to them that perish, foolishness; but unto us which are saved, it is the power of God&#8221; (1 Cor. 1:18, Gk.). The word of the cross means the word of killing. This was the word that the Corinthians needed to combat their divisiveness, their confidence in knowledge, and their wild exercise of the gifts. The whole book of 1 Corinthians is the word of the cross. Paul applied the cross to kill what was natural.<h2 class=head1>BEHEADING THE PHILOSOPHICAL GREEKS</h2><p>How do you think the Greek mentality at Corinth would receive this word: &#8220;The soulish man receiveth not the things of the Spirit of God: for they are foolishness unto him: neither can he know them, because they are spiritually discerned&#8221; (1 Cor. 2:14, Gk.)? The Greeks were famous in the ancient world for their philosophy. Yet Paul here told them that the man who lives by the soul rejects the things of God as foolishness. Was not this belittling the Greek philosophical mind? More than that, Paul was beheading the Corinthians for their reliance on their clever mind.<p>As we pray over such a word, it will have the same killing effect on us. We may say, &#8220;The soulish man-am I not a soulish man? I surely trust in my shrewd mind. It says here that he receives not the things of the Spirit of God. Could that be why for all these years I have had so little spiritual understanding? The soulish man thinks the things of the Spirit are foolishness; he cannot know them. Oh, the soulish man must be broken.&#8221; This is the killing effect of the word of the cross.<h2 class=head1>LABELING THEM AS BABES</h2><p>How would you like to receive this further word from Paul: &#8220;And I, brethren, could not speak unto you as unto spiritual, but as unto fleshly, even as unto babes in Christ&#8221; (1 Cor. 3:1, Gk.)? Would you not be offended to be told that you are not spiritual, that you are a man of flesh, that you are just an infant in Christ? If you protest such labels, you are proving that that is exactly what you are. The word here again is a killing word. In fact, in every chapter of 1 Corinthians there is a killing of some aspect of your being.<h2 class=head1>THE WORD OF LIFE</h2><p>In Philippians we have another kind of word: &#8220;That ye may be blameless and harmless, the sons of God, without rebuke, in the midst of a crooked and perverse nation, among whom ye shine as lights in the world; holding forth the word of life&#8221; (2:15-16). Here in this book on the experience of Christ is the word of life. In 1 Corinthians is the word of the cross, but in Philippians is the word of resurrection.<p>The Bible is composed of these two kinds of words-the word of the cross which kills and the word of life which brings resurrection.<h2 class=head1>DEATH WORKING</h2><p>Second Corinthians 4:10 through 12 says, &#8220;Always bearing about in the body the dying of the Lord Jesus, that the life also of Jesus might be made manifest in our body. For we which live are alway delivered unto death for Jesus&#8217; sake, that the life also of Jesus might be made manifest in our mortal flesh. So then death worketh in us  but life in you.&#8221; Did you know that death works? This death is typified by myrrh and is one of the spices of the compound Spirit (Exo. 30:23).<p>Although we may not understand how death and life do their work, we get the benefit by daily coming to the Word. The Bible, as the word of the cross, is an &#8220;antibiotic,&#8221; killing all the negative things in us; at the same time, as the word of life, it supplies us with &#8220;vitamins&#8221; to keep us spiritually healthy.<h2 class=head1>LED BY THE SPIRIT</h2><p>Notice the connection between these two verses: &#8220;For if you live according to flesh, you are about to die; but if by the Spirit you put to death the practices of the body, you will live. For as many as are led by the Spirit of God, these are sons of God&#8221; (Rom. 8:13-14). Putting to death the practices of the body is a killing. This killing is in the Word and is executed by the Spirit. When verse 14 mentions being led by the Spirit, it is referring to our being led to put to death the practices of the body.<p>If we are led by the Spirit regarding sports, we may put that practice of the body to death. If we are led by the Spirit regarding attending a movie, we may choose not to go. If we are led by the Spirit when we shop, what the stores have to offer will lose their attraction. The practices of the body are the manifestation of its lusts. As these practices are put to death under the leading of the Spirit, we show to the worldlings that we are the sons of God and do not live like the sons of the Devil.<h2 class=head1>THE CROSS AND THE SPIRIT</h2><p>Here are two more related verses: &#8220;And they that are Christ&#8217;s have crucified the flesh with the passions and lusts. If we live in the Spirit, let us also walk in the Spirit&#8221; (Gal. 5:24-25, Gk.). In verse 24 we have the crucifying of the flesh; this is the killing, seemingly done by ourselves. In verse 25, however, it is plain that this killing is done by the Spirit. The way to walk in the Spirit is by the cross. By experiencing the killing of the flesh, the self, and the natural man, we abide in Christ and enjoy the resurrection also.<h2 class=head1>DIVIDING OF SOUL AND SPIRIT</h2><p>&#8220;For the word of God is living and operative and sharper than any two-edged sword, and piercing even to the dividing of soul and spirit, both of joints and marrow, and able to discern the thoughts and intents of the heart&#8221; (Heb. 4:12). When the Word of God pierces even to the dividing of soul and spirit, it is both a killing and a resurrection. This dividing work is done by the Word of God, which keeps the soul under the killing and the spirit in resurrection.<p>This dividing by the Word is the means by which we abide in Christ in a deep, rich way. May the whole recovery be brought into such an abiding life.<h1 class=msg>CHAPTER TEN</h1><h1 class=msg>THE LIFE WAY TO TAKE THE WORD</h1><p>You may think it is awkward English to title this message &#8220;The Life Way to Take the Word,&#8221; but I want to suggest some ways for you to get more life from your reading of the Word. I do not say &#8220;The Living Way...&#8221; because sometimes &#8220;living&#8221; connotes excitement or loudness rather than life. Before we consider how the Word can bring us into life, we shall answer some questions based on the previous message.<h2 class=head1>QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS</h2><p><I>I have been considering the context of the verse, &#8220;Abstain from all appearance of evil&#8221; (1 Thes. 5:22). From the verse before and the verse after, it seems that if our behavior is proper, God will sanctify us wholly and preserve us blameless. Is this the case, or is it that the sanctifying life within results in a high standard of behavior?</I><p>Sanctification is surely a matter of life, but both sanctification and life will keep us away from all negative things. The young people especially need to be familiar with 1 Thessalonians 5:22. For your own safeguard you need to avoid all appearance of evil. Do not think you are too spiritual to be affected. Run away from anything that bears the appearance of evil. Just a quick glance can stain your thoughts. For the sake of others and for your own sake, you must be careful; behind every appearance of evil, evil is lurking. Even after fifty years of seeking to walk in the Spirit, I still have no confidence in my flesh; it could still do any kind of evil.<p>In north China around 1928 there was a strong Pentecostal movement. Some of those who experienced the filling of the Spirit felt they no longer had any flesh and could not sin; men and women began to live together. The resulting fornication brought such shame to the Lord&#8217;s name that for a long time afterwards the gospel had no entry among the people there. Do you see how the appearance of evil leads to evil?<p>Do not think you are being religious to practice a holy life. Our mentality can so easily be under the subtle usurping of the enemy. For the years I have been in this country I have stressed that Christ is in opposition to religion. Now the enemy has come in and twisted my words. Some are saying it is religious to read the Bible and pray at a regular time every day. Some say that coming into a meeting quietly is religious. Some have stopped meeting regularly on Sundays so as not to be religious.<p>What is religion? It is any kind of worship or service to God without Christ. If in a meeting you are silent with Christ, you are not religious. If in a meeting you are shouting without Christ, you are religious. Neither silence nor shouting is right, and neither is wrong. The question is whether Christ is in what you are doing. Not to have regular church meetings is a deception of the enemy.<p>Do not have confidence in people; truth is our center. Even if the Apostle Paul were to come and contradict his writings in the New Testament, we would have to reject him (see Gal. 1:8-9). If I were to propose that you worship idols, you would have to refuse and cast me out. We must stand for the truth and not regard any man&#8217;s person.<p><I>Is it good to kneel down to pray?</I><p>Ephesians 3:14 says, &#8220;I bow my knees unto the Father,&#8221; indicating that there was something heavy on Paul&#8217;s heart and he was not praying in a light way. If you are heavily burdened and want to kneel down, and your environment allows it, go ahead. If not, there is no need to make kneeling a formal legality.<p><I>If we have to choose between corporate morning watch and a private time with the Lord, how should we decide?</I><p>Corporate morning watch is helpful, but a private time is more crucial to your personal contact with the Lord. How you choose depends upon your need. The elders can also make a decision in this regard, but you are not obliged to follow it.<p><I>I&#8217;d like to know how to deal with inward things like pride.</I><p>You deal with this in the same way as the outward matters. Whenever you sense something sinful, you should repent, confess to the Lord, and get cleansed. Also, by getting into the Word, the killing factor it contains will smite your pride. If you take in the Word, the Word will become the Spirit to show you your pride and then to live out Christ instead of pride.<p><I>What about our failure to obey? You said the only way we could touch the Lord&#8217;s life was by obedience.</I><p>Today the Lord as the Spirit is merciful and gracious. Like air and water, wherever He finds a narrow crack He slips in. Even if you are only slightly obedient, the Spirit comes. Are any of us completely obedient to the Spirit? But we all enjoy Him to some extent. The amount depends upon the degree of our obedience. The more we obey the Spirit, the more we enjoy Him.<p><I>When we come to contact the Lord, how do we empty ourselves of all our busy thoughts?</I><p>The best way to set your mind on the Spirit (Rom. 8:6) is to get into the Word; this will release you from your distracting, disturbing thoughts.<p><I>As a new Christian and the mother of four children, I would like to know how much scriptural teaching I should impose on them and how much I should insist on their behaving properly.</I><p>This is a very practical matter. As human beings, we fell and need the Lord&#8217;s salvation. After the fall, God came in to restrict man. For example, God imposed restrictions on the woman because the fall had come in through her (Gen. 3:16); this restriction was actually a protection. In human society today, chaos would prevail were it not for the restraints of ethical teachings, the police, and the law courts. These have been ordained by God to limit the fallen race. Since our families are part of the fallen race, we as parents must exercise God&#8217;s ordination to restrict our children by ethical teachings, regulations, and discipline. For proper human living in your home, you must teach your children to behave properly by honoring their parents, caring for their brothers and sisters, respecting their neighbors, and not stealing.<p>Do not say that ethical teachings are apart from Christ and therefore worthless. The necessities of our human existence are one thing; the experiences of Christ, another. For our human living we must buy groceries, do laundry, lock our doors to prevent burglaries, be careful about fire, open and close windows, and cook and eat. Besides taking care of these earthly matters, we are also learning to experience Christ. These are two different areas; both are needed.<p><I>Does 1 Thessalonians 5:22 also apply to corporate housing? The neighbors have cause to wonder what is going on in a young couple&#8217;s house, if the husband is at work and there are brothers coming and going while the wife is there by herself.</I><p>It is better for the single brothers to live by themselves in a brothers&#8217; house and for the young single sisters to have a sisters&#8217; house. This is not only for the sake of appearance, but also as a safeguard of morality. One of the reasons for the divorce and fornication that are so prevalent today is that there is not the proper separation between men and women. The first charge I was given when I came out to serve the Lord at the age of twenty-seven was to always have a third party present when talking with a sister for any length of time. Practicing this has been a protection to me.<p>We have the example of the Lord Jesus in this regard. He spoke with Nicodemus privately at night (John 3:1-2), but when he spoke to the Samaritan woman (John 4:6-7), it was under the sun in the open air. Had the situations been reversed, even the disciples might have had a question. (The Lord was about thirty-one or thirty-two at that time.)<p>The flesh is still prevailing, even in us older people. To keep a proper separation between the sexes is a needed protection. In former days young girls would always be chaperoned when they went out; today the intermingling of young men and women, which has become common even in college dormitories, is an invitation to immorality. Nothing defiles you in the presence of God like fornication. I exhort you to protect yourself from this by maintaining a separation. The young sisters should have a third party present when they are out with a young man. We must learn to keep our vessel clean and honorable before the Lord (1 Thes. 4:3-7).<p><I>The appearance of evil is so apparent wherever we turn. Even when I go on the campus, I sense a spiritual leak in myself after a short time there.</I><p>Before you go into such a situation, you must be clear that you go there just for the gospel&#8217;s sake, for no other purpose. Then you must be in prayer for the Lord to cover and safeguard you.<p><I>Sometimes we are not willing to obey what the Lord touches in us; this unwillingness may persist for three or four years. How can we handle this situation?</I><p>In Revelation 3:8 the Lord told the church in Philadelphia that they had a little strength. The Lord does not require too much of us. We just have to be faithful to what we are able to do. There is no room for us to be proud, because none of us is wholly obedient to the Lord. Realizing we are so weak, we keep looking to Him for His mercy and grace.<p>Obedience is a matter of practice. Your obedience will increase by your being obedient. Just obey insofar as you are able, looking to Him for His help.<p><I>What shall I do if my parents invite me to do something which has the appearance of evil?</I><p>Try to get their sympathy. Tell them you are a Christian and that you love the Lord.<p><I>What about praying for others?</I><p>Everyone who contacts the Lord normally and properly will have some burden to pray for others, not in a religious way, but under the living guidance of the Lord. If you love the Lord and live by Him, surely a burden to pray for others will come to you. Pray according to this inner burden.<h2 class=head1>TASTE</h2><p>&#8220;How sweet are thy words unto my taste! yea, sweeter than honey to my mouth&#8221; (Psa. 119:103). Whenever we come to the Word, it would be good to pray, &#8220;Lord, grant me a sweet taste for Your Word. Make it so precious to me.&#8221; When we come to the Word, we come not only with our mind, with our eyes, but also with our heart. Taste is related to the heart. We need a heart which loves and appreciates the Lord&#8217;s precious Word.<p>After I was saved, I found the Bible so sweet. I went to bed reading the Word and left the Bible beside my pillow. Upon awaking in the morning, I would pick up my still open Bible and continue reading where I had left off. If we have this taste for the Word, surely it will bring us life.<h2 class=head1>GOD&#8217;S BREATH</h2><p>&#8220;All Scripture is God-breathed&#8221; (2 Tim. 3:16, Gk.). Just as the nature of a table is wood, so the nature of the Word in the Bible is the divine breath. If you consider the Word as only letters on a page, you will use only your mentality in reading it. But because it is God&#8217;s breath, we must breathe it in. How do we do this? By praying. When we are taking in the Word for nourishment, we need to pray over the words we read. We should use the very words of the Bible to pray; our prayer will turn the printed matter into breath. The verses, in other words, become Spirit to us.<p>But how can we say that 2 Timothy 3:16 tells us the Scripture is for breathing? Does not the rest of the verse say, &#8220;and is profitable for doctrine, for reproof, for correction, for instruction in righteousness&#8221;? Is instruction breathing? Is correction breathing? Is reproof breathing? To argue this way shows blindness. If you use only your mentality when you study the Word, you may read that it is &#8220;profitable for correction&#8221; and feel that you do need to be corrected and reproved for your attitude toward your wife. This is not the life way to take the Word.<p>Rather than exercising your mentality, exercise your praying spirit. Do not bring in your thought. Do not interpret. Do not explain. Do not even pray for the Lord to help you to understand the verse. Just breathe all the words into your being. &#8220;O Lord, profitable for teaching, for reproof, for correction. Lord, for instruction in righteousness.&#8221; Eventually the verse will be wrought into you as a life supply. Because the nature of the Word is divine breath, when you breathe it in, it becomes life to you. &#8220;The words which I have spoken unto you are spirit and are life&#8221; (John 6:63). The words become spirit and life through your prayer, through your breathing.<h2 class=head1>FOOD</h2><p>Matthew 4:4 makes it clear that the Bible is good for food: &#8220;Man shall not live on bread alone, but on every word that proceeds out through the mouth of God.&#8221; So does Jeremiah 15:16: &#8220;Thy words were found, and I did eat them; and thy word was unto me the joy and rejoicing of mine heart: for I am called by thy name, O Lord God of hosts.&#8221; How can we eat God&#8217;s words? To eat is to take food into us and digest it so that it becomes part of us. To eat God&#8217;s words is to take them in by prayer while exercising our whole being to enjoy them. This verse in Jeremiah says that the Word was &#8220;unto me the joy and rejoicing of mine heart.&#8221; We must keep pray-reading the Word till it becomes our enjoyment and rejoicing; then we have eaten it.<h2 class=head1>MILK AND SOLID FOOD</h2><p>In 1 Peter 2:2 the Word is referred to as milk: &#8220;As newborn babes, desire the pure milk of the word, that ye may grow thereby&#8221; (Gk.). The portions of the Bible that are easy for us to take in are milk. They are also called &#8220;the good word&#8221; (Heb. 6:5) and the word of grace (Acts 14:3; 20:32). When we read some parts of the Word, we feel like a child enjoying a refreshing glass of milk. Other portions of the Word, though, have more weight to them; taking them in is like eating a steak. These weightier portions are referred to in Hebrews as solid food (5:12) and as the word of righteousness (5:13). When we can receive them, they give us the weight of maturity.<p>These, then, are the ways to take the Word: taste it, breathe it, eat it, drink it as milk, and take it in as solid food.<h2 class=head1>RAIN AND SNOW</h2><p>Notice how the Word is described in Isaiah 55:10-11: &#8220;For as the rain cometh down, and the snow from heaven, and returneth not thither, but watereth the earth, and maketh it bring forth and bud, that it may give seed to the sower, and bread to the eater: So shall my word be that goeth forth out of my mouth: it shall not return unto me void, but it shall accomplish that which I please, and it shall prosper in the thing whereto I sent it.&#8221; The Word is likened to rain in summer and snow in winter, watering us to produce the seed for fruit-bearing and the bread for our satisfaction. This is a marvelous picture of our experience in taking the Word.<h2 class=head1>THE WORD WITHIN</h2><p>&#8220;I have written unto you, young men, because ye are strong, and the word of God abideth in you, and ye have overcome the wicked one&#8221; (1 John 2:14). This Word that makes us strong and able to overcome the wicked one is no longer only external; it is the Word of God abiding in us. This means we have taken it into us by breathing, by praying, by eating, and by digesting. It is now the Word in our life experience, not just the Word in knowledge.<h2 class=head1>THE WORD SANCTIFYING</h2><p>&#8220;Sanctify them in the truth; Your word is truth&#8221; (John 17:17). How does the Word of God sanctify us? We are sanctified, not by teaching, but by being saturated with the very element conveyed in the Word. That element is the Lord Himself, the essence of the Spirit. As we are daily in the Word, the Word gets into us and saturates us subjectively and dispositionally with the divine essence.<h2 class=head1>MEDICINE</h2><p>The Word of God even brings health to our body. Proverbs 4:20-22 says, &#8220;My son, attend to my words; incline thine ear unto my sayings. Let them not depart from thine eyes; keep them in the midst of thine heart. For they are life unto those that find them, and medicine to all their flesh&#8221; (Heb.). How can God&#8217;s Word make us physically healthy? Illness is often caused by anxiety or anger. If people are made happy, their sickness often disappears. When we get on the Word, joy comes in to heal. The Word kills the bothering things and brings in resurrection. Then we can eat and digest our food well, and our body becomes healthy.<h2 class=head1>ALL PRAYER AND PETITION</h2><p>&#8220;Take the helmet of salvation, and the sword of the Spirit, which is the word of God; by means of all prayer and petition, praying at every time in spirit&#8221; (Eph. 6:17-18, Gk.). How can we take the Word &#8220;by means of all prayer and petition&#8221;? It is by pray-reading the Word according to its content. If we are reading on abiding, our prayer must be on abiding; if the Word is on righteousness, our prayer should be about righteousness. &#8220;All prayer&#8221; means different kinds of prayer according to the portion of the Word we are reading. Whenever we can make time, we should practice this way of taking the Word by praying. Then we shall be fully built up, not only spiritually but also physically.<h2 class=head1>HELPS TO UNDERSTANDING THE WORD</h2><p>It becomes apparent when you read the New Testament that its roots are in the Old Testament. The New is both a continuation and interpretation of the Old. Without Hebrews, for example, how could you understand Leviticus? Galatians also is really a cooked and digested part of the Old Testament!<p>To understand the Bible, then, we need to be thoroughly acquainted with both the Old and New Testaments. In addition, we need the benefit of what so many saints in the past have researched in the Word. When I was young, I spent many hours going from one used book store to another, trying to find helpful, but often rare, books. Reading them was of great help to me.<p>The fruit of all this research is now available to you in simple form-the Life-study Messages. How appreciative I would have been fifty years ago if they had been available to me! This is why I urge you to get into the Life-study Messages. You will be well nourished if you get into the book of Hebrews, for example, using the sixty or more Life-study Messages as a guide to your study and research. Find time every day, maybe a half hour or so, and you can probably cover the whole book of Hebrews in a month. Like a camel about to make a long journey through the desert, you will store a great deal of nourishment within you and so be helped to grow.<h1 class=msg>CHAPTER ELEVEN</h1><h1 class=msg>THE WAY WHICH LEADS TO LIFE</h1><p>&#8220;For the gate is narrow and the way is constricted which leads to life, and few are those who find it&#8221; (Matt. 7:14). Before we consider various aspects of the way which leads to life, we shall answer a few questions.<h2 class=head1>QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS</h2><p><I>Could you clarify the distinction you made between living by Christ and living Christ?</I><p>I realize that to say &#8220;live Christ&#8221; is grammatically odd, but we had to invent this new term to express what is on our heart. If we are living by Christ, we are still doing the living. To live Christ means that Christ is our life (Col. 3:4). When we live, He lives. When He lives, we live.<p><I>Of the four legalities, what does sleeping represent?</I><p>Usually spiritual sleep has a negative sense, but we need to be aware of its positive value also. To sleep means to rest from all activities. It is most healthful to have a time every day of doing nothing. Do not think I mean meditation. Just rest; be free from your thoughts and anxieties. Most of us are too busy, and our minds are too active, worrying about ourselves or the problems in the church. It is hard to make a time to have a spiritual sleep, but if we do, it will make us spiritually healthy. This time is not for praying, not for reading the Word, and not for answering the phone. It is a time set aside just for rest.<p>With all these legalities-eating, breathing, drinking, and sleeping-there is a need for us to exercise a strong will. The will is the only part of our natural being that is useful to the Lord. If we are to keep these legalities and the commandments in the New Testament, we need to ask the Lord to strengthen our will. Gossiping does not take will power, but bringing ourselves to pray and read the Word surely does.<p><I>Sometimes when I am reading the Word or trying to pray, I get bored and fall asleep.</I><p>It is hard for us fallen human beings to stop even for a short while. If we fall asleep, that will stop us. It is good for our health.<p><I>How can we help those who have left the church?</I><p>If the Lord wants us to help some of these dear ones, He will give us a burden, prepare the situation, and afford us the opportunity. There is no need to be distressed. Psalm 127:1 reminds us, &#8220;Except the Lord build the house, they labor in vain that build it: except the Lord keep the city, the watchman waketh but in vain.&#8221; The Lord is the Head. If this is His recovery, His church, nothing can damage it. The Lord told the Jews, &#8220;Destroy this temple, and in three days I will raise it up&#8221; (John 2:19), meaning that when they destroyed His body, He would raise up an even greater one in resurrection.<p><I>Is it all right to submit myself to someone?</I><p>This is a good question. Many great men throughout history submitted themselves to someone or to some idea when they were young. Even if you submit yourself to a wrong person, your submission is still healthy. One who has never submitted himself is raw and of little use. Even materials like iron, copper, and cotton have to be processed before they can be put to use. This is God&#8217;s ordination for us as human beings too. Regrettably, the modern trend is to throw off this principle.<p>As a child, submit to your parents. As a student, submit to your teachers and the other school authorities. If you are working, submit to your employer. To be successful, be successful in your submission! In the church, even if the elders are not so adequate, your position is to submit. This will help your growth. There is more need in the church for submission on the part of the young people.<p><I>What if the submission offends our conscience?</I><p>Submission is surely against your conscience if it leads you to worship an idol or to do something against the truth. Daniel and his three friends are an example of submission at the highest level, yet they did not defile themselves (Dan. 1:8-20).<p>In 1938 there was a sister in Peking whose unsaved husband greatly troubled her. He would go to the theater and then not get home till after midnight. Her way of handling the situation was to lock the door and not let him in till he had been knocking for an hour or so. When she recounted this story to us, we told her she must change her way in order to save her marriage. She asked us for advice, and this is what we suggested: &#8220;You have to submit yourself to your husband. When he wants to go to the theater, offer to accompany him. Ride in the carriage with him right to the theater entrance. Then tell him to go on in and that you will return home and wait for him. When you get back home, cook his favorite snack and have it all ready. As soon as you hear him knock at the door, open it right away and give him a warm welcome. Offer him the snack you have prepared and sit down with him while he eats it. Sister, if you will practice this, before too long your husband will be a brother in the church.&#8221; This is what subsequently happened. That theater-going husband became a brother because of his wife&#8217;s submission.<p>I believe this story illustrates submission according to the Bible. Submit as much as you can without defiling your conscience.<h2 class=head1>LIFE</h2><p>Matters pertaining to life may not be easy to explain, but they are easy to experience. Medical doctors spend years studying the physical body, but they do not know what life is. Even a baby, however, experiences life just by breathing, without any instruction or study. Without understanding it, I enjoy my physical life; it enables me to speak and move. The experience of life is just to breathe. A hundred books cannot explain breathing, but the act of breathing is simple. So is life in our experience.<p>To experience the life of God, we must have the Son (1 John 5:12). Life is a Person, Christ Himself. Do not think that jumping or shouting are indications of this life. Life is not a condition but a Person. Whether I sleep or jump, whether I shout or am quiet, I have life. Sorry to say, it has often seemed to me that the ones who shout in the meetings are the ones who are short of life.<p>Those who are rich in life have no need to shout. When they come into the meeting and sit down, life radiates from them. I remember the meetings in Shanghai in the early &#8217;30&#8217;s. Brother Nee was twenty-nine, two years older than I. He would be in the meetings, perhaps not speaking, not praying, not even singing well, but full of life. If there was a meeting and he was away, how much we missed him! We would try hard to exercise in prayer, but we sensed a lack of life. The life in just one person makes a difference.<h2 class=head1>THE REASON FOR THE UNIVERSE</h2><p>Why did God create the heavens and the earth? To accomplish His purpose, He needed the earth, the air, the sunshine, and the rain. All these things He made as the environment for the vine He wanted to grow (John 15). To our Father God, the earth is a vineyard in which He nurtures and tends the vine, His Son. Yet a vine amounts to very little without its branches. Is it not marvelous that we are those branches (John 15:5)? Why does God have the church? Why has He gathered us together? He intends to cultivate us, but not our natural life, as the outgrowth of this vine. When the branches grow, the vine grows. It is our profession, our calling, our responsibility, to grow and produce this vine. When we live Christ (&#8220;To me to live is Christ,&#8221; Phil. 1:21), we grow Him. When we grow Him, we produce Him.<h2 class=head1>HOW WE MEET</h2><p>Our meetings must be a show window of our Christian life. God&#8217;s economy ordains that we should live, grow, and produce Christ. We live this way, so we meet this way. There is no need to discuss what kind of meeting to have. This matter is resolved in our daily life-in our married life, in our business life, and in our school life. If we do not live Christ in our personal, private lives, how can we release Him in the meetings? Even if the attempt to release our spirit is sincere, the meeting still is only a performance.<h2 class=head1>FRUIT-BEARING</h2><p>The fruit-bearing of the branches is not a labor but the outflow of the inner life. Our preaching of the gospel must be our living. Living this way will attract the best people. We have put forth much effort, yet our fruit-bearing has been meager; this indicates there has not been much living of Christ.<h2 class=head1>A FALSE LIBERTY</h2><p>These past few months I have been deeply concerned about the course of the recovery. The Lord has troubled and burdened me that its nature has been changed from life to activities, concepts, and arrangements.<p>For the sake of the Lord&#8217;s recovery, we must drop our opinions. Do not be distracted by any concept. Do you not realize that you sacrifice the oneness by supporting your concept?<p>You say the meetings are boring. You say that to attend all the meetings is religious. You say that you can enjoy the Lord at the beach. I ask you, is the family not your family whether it is good or bad? Which do you think you will regret in the age to come-attending boring meetings or not attending the meetings? Have you ever received grace by staying away from the meetings, by going to the beach, by watching television, or by engaging in sports?<p>Do drop all such damaging concepts. A number of times when the meetings were low and I had no heart to go, I went anyway because I make it a point to attend the meetings. (In my whole church life there are very few meetings I have missed.) In those low meetings especially, I have often received the Lord&#8217;s grace.<h2 class=head1>TAKING IN THE WORD</h2><p>Nothing honors our Father more than when we take His Word and keep it. The Bible is the Word of our Father. Suppose you receive a letter from your mother. When you come to read it, you have the sense that you are coming to her. In a similar way, when you come to the Bible, you have the sweet consciousness that you are coming to your God, your Father, your Lord. Furthermore, if you take in the Word, you get the reality of the Triune God. Even the Spirit who dwells in you is embodied in the Word.<h2 class=head1>TOUCHING THE SPIRIT</h2><p>Within us there is an inner consciousness. If we take care of this when we are praying over the Word, we are touching the Spirit. For example, if the sense comes that we are wrong or mistaken in a certain matter, we must confess and be cleansed by the blood. Then there may be a consciousness of something else; take care of that. Don&#8217;t argue; just take care of the inner consciousness. To take the Word and to touch the Spirit in this way is to abide in the vine and to enjoy all the riches of the Triune God as your portion.<h2 class=head1>THE GATE OF THE CONSCIENCE</h2><p>The real growth in life is to have Christ added to us. He is the Spirit, mysterious yet real. What is the gate through which He can enter? He is added into our being through the narrow gate of our conscience. The gate of our heart is wider, but He cannot enter there without passing through the conscience. First Timothy 1:19 describes what happens to those who fail to deal with their conscience. &#8220;Holding faith, and a good conscience; which some having put away, concerning faith have made shipwreck.&#8221;<p>Besides legally getting into the Word and legally spending time in prayer, we also need to legally take care of our conscience. If you do not want to be bothered by your conscience, stay away from the Bible! Many times when you are reading the Word, you will be enlightened and your conscience will condemn you. You may be reading Romans 12, for example, and come to verse 5 where it says that we are &#8220;members one of another.&#8221; Your conscience may then accuse you that you have not been a proper member to your brothers. You will have to confess and get forgiveness. Had you not been in the Word, you would not have experienced such an accusation.<p>When you confess, you open the gate for Christ to come in. The more you confess, the more Christ you will gain. This is the way to enrich your abiding in Christ.<p>If you think you are enjoying the Lord but are not dealing with your conscience, you are deceiving yourself. The enjoyment of the Lord comes from abiding; abiding in the Lord is based on dealing with your conscience.<h2 class=head1>A SUITABLE ENVIRONMENT</h2><p>For seeds to grow they must be planted. They will not sprout if they are kept on the table. Against their will we must force them into the earth. This is what I am trying to do with you-force you into the earth so you will grow! For your growth you need the environment of the church meetings and of the Word. To stay away from them is of Satan.<p>When I was vacationing recently on a mountain, I noticed that above a certain level grew tall pine trees. I asked why there were no trees below that level. For the tall pines to grow, I was told, they need cold weather. Below the tree line the weather was too mild. What is true of the pine trees is also true of us. Do we want to be tropical Christians? Children need a winter time from their parents to help them grow tall! The saints also need to experience a winter in the church to help them grow.<p>If you will get into the Word regularly as I have exhorted you, even if you consider such legality like a cold blast of winter, in two months you will see what a difference it makes in your life and in the church life.<h2 class=head1>THE VALUE OF LEGALITY</h2><p>I have encouraged you to get into the Word and to pray every day in a legal way. Do not be afraid of following legalities. I have far more legalities than the four I passed on to you. I am legal about putting my shoes in the same place every night; keeping all the books on my library shelf in a certain sequence; and taking a shower regularly. Such legalities keep me healthy and help me find things when I need them.<p>Most aspects of our life are governed by legalities. Does a mother cook breakfast for her family only when she feels like it? In writing, do you form your letters however you please? In speaking, do you make up your own grammar rules? Little would be accomplished without our being legal.<h2 class=head1>NEW TESTAMENT COMMANDMENTS</h2><p>Do you think there are only ten commandments and that they are all in the Old Testament? The pages of the New Testament contain more commandments than the Old. Here are a few.<p>(1)&#8220;Pray without ceasing&#8221; (1 Thes. 5:17). It doesn&#8217;t say, &#8220;Please pray if you have time&#8221;!<p>(2)&#8220;Be filled with the Spirit&#8221; (Eph. 5:18). Do not say that you are tired or bored, but God is merciful. God is stricter than I am.<p>(3)&#8220;Be transformed&#8221; (Rom. 12:2). You need to spend time praying to be transformed.<p>(4)&#8220;Grow in grace&#8221; (2 Pet. 3:18).<p>(5)&#8220;Be strong in the Lord&#8221; (Eph. 6:10).<p>(6)&#8220;Work out your own salvation with fear and trembling&#8221; (Phil. 2:12). We are not told to work out our salvation in joy or in shouting, but in fear and trembling. How can we do this without being legal?<p>(7)&#8220;Do all things without murmurings and reasonings&#8221; (Phil. 2:14, Gk.). When you are about to murmur, you must remember this commandment and restrain yourself. When you want to reason about church matters or why the elders behave as they do, remember you are forbidden to do so by this commandment.<p>(8)&#8220;Flee also youthful lusts&#8221; (2 Tim. 2:22). Here is a commandment the young people especially need to heed.<p>(9)&#8220;Abstain from all appearance of evil&#8221; (1 Thes. 5:22). The appearance of evil leads to evil.<p>These days I have heard some strange talk. It surely does not sound like the New Testament to me. Some are saying that they do not want any standard. To me this is ridiculous. Everything has a standard. I have also heard that we should be what we are. If you think Christians should stay as they are, why does the Bible say, &#8220;Be transformed&#8221;? Do you want to remain as you are? I want to grow and be transformed. Some have even said that we should not control ourselves but just let some flesh come forth and do whatever it pleases. I would remind you that as fallen human beings we are capable of doing any lustful thing. God came in right after the fall to ordain restrictions. It is only because of such restraints that we are kept from indulgence in lust. Can you trust your flesh? Whatever your age, however long you have been in Christ, if you do not exercise restrictions over your flesh, you are capable of any evil. If you say, &#8220;Don&#8217;t be legal,&#8221; I say, &#8220;Work out your salvation with fear and trembling.&#8221;<h2 class=head1>THE CONSTRICTING WAY</h2><p>The standard in the Bible is the highest. &#8220;Unless your righteousness surpass that of the scribes and Pharisees, you shall by no means enter into the kingdom of the heavens&#8221; (Matt. 5:20). We Christians must be strict. We enter through a narrow gate and walk along a constricting way (Matt. 7:14). &#8220;The gate is wide and the way is broad that leads to destruction, and many are those who enter through it&#8221; (v. 13). To take a pathway of looseness is to choose the wide gate whose end is destruction. May we be those who are led to life by taking the narrow gate and the constricting way.<h1 class=msg>CHAPTER TWELVE</h1><h1 class=msg>CHRIST OUR PORTION AND OUR LIFE</h1><p>Christ is the portion of the saints (Col. 1:12, Gk.). God has prepared this eternal, unlimited portion for us to enjoy. Before we consider how we can partake of Him daily, let us answer some questions.<h2 class=head1>QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS</h2><p><I>How do we get in spirit and stay there? Many times we feel we are in our spirit, but a moment later we are out of it.</I><p>To stay in your spirit, you need to learn to abide in the Lord. The Lord today is the life-giving Spirit (1 Cor. 15:45; 2 Cor. 3:17). If He were just the Savior (1 John 4:14) and the Lamb of God (John 1:29), how could He get into us? He could only be in the heavens (Acts 2:32-35; Phil. 3:20). The Scripture says clearly, &#8220;Christ in you, the hope of glory&#8221; (Col. 1:27). He can only be in us as the Spirit. How could we reach Him and abide in Him if He is confined to heaven? Even logically speaking, for the Lord to ask us to abide in Him surely indicates that His nature is spirit. The Greek word for spirit is pneuma, which is also the word for air. Christ today is the holy air! We have no trouble abiding in the air, and the air is obviously abiding in us!<p>Like the air, the pneuma, He is in us and we are in Him. If you remain there and let Christ remain in you, you will be abiding in Him. According to our experience, however, we find that, in spite of our efforts and good intentions, unconsciously we slip out of Him. I may be in Christ while talking at the dining table, then suddenly realize I am out of Him. What has been the cause? I talked too much. Overtalking may get us out of the abiding.<p>A hint to help you remain in spirit is found in 1 Thessalonians 5:17: &#8220;Pray without ceasing.&#8221; I used to wonder how anyone could pray twenty-four hours a day. Gradually I came to realize that to pray in the spiritual life is to breathe. Whether you are eating, speaking, or sleeping, you keep breathing.<p>Another kind of prayer is illustrated by drinking. This we do not do without ceasing! We may drink with our meals, and perhaps also at mid-morning, mid-afternoon, and in the evening. Drinking typifies customary prayer. David said in Psalm 55:17, &#8220;Evening, and morning, and at noon, will I pray,&#8221; indicating that he had this customary prayer at least three times a day. Acts 10:30 also hints to us that in olden times people had set times to pray. This is a habit we all need to build up. Spend at least ten minutes for customary prayer every morning. Sometimes you may find yourself burdened to pray for an hour or more. This kind of praying is like drinking.<p>Unceasing prayer, which can be likened to breathing, is the key to remaining in spirit. While I am speaking outwardly, I am praying inwardly. While you are operating your machine at work, you can be praying inwardly. Practice saying &#8220;O Lord&#8221; whenever you feel you are not in the spirit. There is no need to pray with composed sentences.<p>Suppose you are on the verge of losing your temper. Satan has filled you with anger against your husband. If you will pray &#8220;O Lord,&#8221; the anger will be gone. If you think this is just a psychological technique, try saying &#8220;O Washington&#8221; instead. It will have no effect. &#8220;O Lord&#8221; is a prayer which brings you back to the spirit. As long as you keep breathing this way, you will be filled with the pneuma. The respiratory process is complicated and hard to understand, but breathing is easy. Such is the simplicity of abiding in Christ. Pray without ceasing.<p><I>Suppose after fifteen minutes in the Word and prayer, you feel you haven&#8217;t gotten anything. Should you persist, or by faith consider you have gotten something?</I><p>Learn to live not according to your feeling. Of course, your normal feelings help, but if you have a high fever, you may feel it is warm when it is not. If you want to be spiritual, do not behave according to your feeling. Do not let circumstances determine how you feel. In the spiritual life learn to drop your feeling and go according to the facts.<p>It is a fact that you need to read the Word. Many young Christians get excited when they first start studying the Bible. They want to prolong the time and come back the next day for more because it is so much fun. Such excitement is short-lived. After a week or so, it fizzles out. If you feel excited when you first start getting into the Word and feel there is light shining, don&#8217;t have regard for that feeling. Prepare for a cold day soon to come! It is your duty to spend time in the Word and in prayer. Your day-to-day feeling about it makes no difference. Just fulfill your duty; go by the fact that you need to do these two things.<p>Don&#8217;t think you are wasting your time. A sister once asked Brother Nee if there was any point in her continuing to read the Bible every day; she could never remember what she had read. Brother Nee reminded her of how they washed the rice there in southern China. They would put the rice into a basket made of willow branches and then repeatedly immerse the whole basket in the water. The water would never stay in the basket, however many times it was immersed. Brother Nee pointed out to her that nonetheless the rice and the basket were both getting washed. By continuing to read the Word, this sister would be getting washed even though she couldn&#8217;t remember what she had read.<p>Another fact is that you need to pray regularly. You may soon find that your time of prayer is dry and lifeless. Don&#8217;t persuade yourself that this legality is killing you and you should drop it. This would be going by your feeling rather than the fact. The truth of the matter is that having wonderful times in prayer can lead to deception. I can give you two examples.<p>One day while a sister was praying, she thought the Lord told her He would come back at a certain time. It made her neglect her daily duties to get ready for His return. A number of times saints have been deceived in this way.<p>Once while a brother was praying, he received a &#8220;revelation&#8221; that he was no more in the flesh. Alas, not only was his flesh still with him; it was stronger than ever. He made many blunders as a result of this wrong feeling and eventually ended up in fornication.<p>Let me warn you to beware of excitement when you contact the Lord. Don&#8217;t go the way of feelings. Whether you feel high or low, just come to contact your Lord for ten minutes every morning. Do not allow yourself to be played upon, directed, and even fooled, by your untrustworthy feelings.<p>Sometimes when children will not drink their milk, the mother puts sugar in it. In like manner, when we are young, the Word is sweet to our taste because God has added some sugar. You may also find singing hymns so sweet. But as time goes on, the sugar will be reduced, and eventually the sweet taste in the Word and in the hymns will be gone. Eventually we shall have no ups and downs; all the days will be the same.<p><I>But it is hard not to go by our feelings. I hear some brothers and sisters pray so strongly and loudly in the meetings. I highly regard them; yet when I touch their daily lives, they disappoint me. Then I cannot stand it. I love the saints, but I cannot control the bitter feeling about the lack of correspondence between their daily life and their meeting life.</I><p>The disparity you mention between how we live and how we behave when we meet has been greatly troubling me. Some of our meetings have become theatrical performances, an offense to God and an offense to the saints. If we feel down at home, we should just come to the meeting that way. That is being real. When we are real, God will come in to heal us. After we have been sitting in the meeting for a short while, the merciful God may visit us, touch our heart, and cause the tears to flow. Then we may say, &#8220;O Lord, forgive me. I am so down. Lord, forgive me.&#8221; This is genuine, because it results from the Lord&#8217;s visiting us. When we thus receive grace, others are helped and we are changed. Such is the genuine Christian life and the genuine Christian meeting. To stir yourself up to perform in the meeting is abominable in the eyes of God.<h2 class=head1>CHRIST IN COLOSSIANS</h2><p>In the Epistle to the Colossians Christ is portrayed as the Head; the book of Ephesians deals with the Body. We shall consider some of the descriptions of this Christ, our divinely allotted portion, as they are given in Colossians, and then go on to discuss how we can daily partake of Him.<h2 class=head1>THE IMAGE OF GOD</h2><p>Christ is &#8220;the image of the invisible God&#8221; (1:15). God is real yet abstract. Like electricity, He cannot be seen. But as light is the expression of electricity, so this invisible God has an expression, Christ. This very Christ is our portion, our heavenly food (cf. John 6:35, 48-58). By daily partaking of Him who is the very image of God, we too become the image of God.<h2 class=head1>THE FIRSTBORN AND THE CREATOR</h2><p>In Colossians 1:15 and 16 Christ is described as both &#8220;the firstborn of every creature&#8221; and as the Creator, the one by whom &#8220;were all things created, that are in heaven, and that are in earth, visible and invisible, whether they be thrones, or dominions, or principalities, or powers: all things were created by him, and for him.&#8221; How Christ could be both the first item of the creation and also its Creator, the One in whom all things were created, we cannot comprehend.<h2 class=head1>THE HUB OF THE UNIVERSE</h2><p>&#8220;He is before all things, and by him all things consist&#8221; (v. 17). That all things consist by Him means that He holds everything together the way the hub of a wheel holds all its spokes together. Without the hub, the spokes would fall away. Scientists say there is some force which keeps the universe in its place. We do not know much science, but we do know who that force is; without Him the planets would fly apart. If such a hub can keep the universe on course, surely He can keep all our inward parts. What is the center of our being? Christ. Whatever happens, we do not fall apart because all our spokes are firmly fixed in this hub.<h2 class=head1>THE PREEMINENT ONE</h2><p>Christ is not only the Firstborn of all creation, but also &#8220;the firstborn from the dead&#8221; (v. 18). Our God is the God of both creation and resurrection. This One, who is also &#8220;the head of the body,&#8221; is in the highest position as the first among all things; this is what it means for Him to &#8220;have the preeminence&#8221; (v. 18). In us also He must have the same preeminence.<h2 class=head1>THE MYSTERY OF GOD</h2><p>God is a mystery, and this mystery is Christ (1:27; 2:2; 4:3).<h2 class=head1>THE REALITY OF ALL POSITIVE THINGS</h2><p>&#8220;Let no man therefore judge you in meat, or in drink, or in respect of a holyday, or of the new moon, or of the sabbath days: Which are a shadow of things to come; but the body is of Christ&#8221; (2:16-17). The food we eat and the drink we take are just a shadow whose reality, body, is Christ. Holidays are days of joy and good times; to have Christ is to have a holiday every day. In a dark night a new moon is like a fresh, new beginning. This is what Christ is to us when we are in a dark night without hope and with no way out. Christ is also the rest pictured by the sabbath. Food, drink, holidays, new moons, sabbaths-all these positive things have Him as their reality.<h2 class=head1>THE EMBODIMENT OF THE FULLNESS OF GOD</h2><p>&#8220;It pleased the Father that in him should all fulness dwell&#8221; (1:19). God is rich, full, and complete; all His fullness dwells bodily in Christ (2:9).<h2 class=head1>OUR LIFE</h2><p>This very Christ portrayed in Colossians is our life (3:4). This all-inclusive, excellent, wonderful One is our life. We have a physical life. If that life were gone, we would not have one to live. Christ is for us to live. We should not live American or Chinese; we should not live old folks or young people; we should all live Christ. Whether you are humble or proud, pleasant or tough, does not matter. Not only when you hate people but even when you love them, you may not be living Christ. The Bible is not a book of ethics, teaching you to love rather than hate; its message is that we should live Christ. We are to be neither moral nor immoral. We are called Christians, which means &#8220;Christ-men.&#8221; Thus we must live Christ.<p>Religion&#8217;s wrong concept is that God wants us to be good. If God wanted good men, He could create billions of them. But He cannot create people who live Christ. God is omnipotent, but He cannot live Christ for you. He needs you to live Christ. The world has many good people, but where are those who live Christ?<p>When you were married, you were a &#8220;raw&#8221; husband, a beginner. But now your crudeness and toughness have worn off, and you seldom offend your wife. Please be assured that God does not want your kindness and gentleness any more than He wanted your crudeness and toughness. He wants you to live Christ.<p>In 1933 I was a young man staying in Shanghai. Two or three times a week I would go to visit Brother Nee and spend the afternoon with him. One afternoon we sat down together, he in a rocking chair and I on the sofa. After a long, long silence he suddenly asked, &#8220;Witness, what is patience?&#8221; Everyone knows what patience is; why would he ask me that? I dared not answer, but he just kept rocking and again asked, &#8220;What is patience?&#8221; I repeated his question, and he did too. Finally the long time of waiting forced me to say, &#8220;Patience is enduring and suffering when one is mistreated.&#8221; In Chinese the character for patience is a knife pierced into a heart. My answer was obviously right, but Brother Nee shook his head. Another long silence ensued. Then he said, &#8220;Patience is Christ.&#8221; I was puzzled. &#8220;What do you mean, Brother Nee?&#8221; I asked. He would not explain further, though I kept begging him to do so. He just went on rocking and repeating, &#8220;Patience is Christ.&#8221; Evening came on, and I had to leave for dinner at my lodging place. So I said, &#8220;Sorry, Brother Nee, I have to leave now.&#8221; He replied, &#8220;Patience is Christ.&#8221; I said good-by, and again his answer was, &#8220;Patience is Christ.&#8221; When I got back to the church guest house, I had no heart to eat. I went to my room, knelt down, and, nearly weeping, prayed, &#8220;Lord, what is this? Patience is Christ. What is this?&#8221; The Lord heard my prayer and that of Brother Nee, who was also praying for me. Within a few days, the light came. I saw that patience is Christ because Christ is my life. Every human virtue is Christ. Because He is my life, He is my everything. I was so exhilarated I felt like a bird soaring in the air. That very day I began to delve into the book of Colossians. &#8220;When Christ, who is our life, shall appear, then shall ye also appear with him in glory&#8221; (3:4).<p>Do you live Christ? Don&#8217;t say this is poor English! Every day we should live Christ. He is &#8220;the hope of glory&#8221; (1:27). Now He is life to us; in the future He is glory to us. That glory is our hope. Our hope is in knowing that glory is coming and that that glory is also Christ. Christ is in me now as my life and before me as my glory. This is the genuine Christ, our portion. Do not take Christianity&#8217;s wrong picture of Him. Do not be put off because this Christ is beyond your understanding. The things of life are hard to explain but easy to experience. I don&#8217;t understand about the vitamins contained in wheat and what good they do me, but it is easy for me to eat bread and get its nutritional value anyway. This Christ too I can partake of without understanding.<h2 class=head1>PARTAKING OF CHRIST</h2><p>Christ is our portion, our life, and our glory. How can we touch Him? Colossians says to &#8220;let the word of Christ dwell in you richly&#8221; (3:16). The word &#8220;dwell&#8221; here is a more solid word in Greek than the word &#8220;abide&#8221;; its root means house. We are to let the word of Christ make its home in us; here is the key to enjoying Him. Christ is abstract, mysterious, and intangible. But the Bible is tangible, solid, and receivable. Christ as the life-giving Spirit is embodied in the word of the Bible as our food.<p>You can see now why it is so important to be in the Word daily. However busy you are, you must begin your day in the Word. Buy an alarm clock if you need one to help you to get up early enough to set aside at least ten minutes for the Word. Then don&#8217;t just read it; pray it with your spirit. Let the word of Christ thus make its home in you. With Christ embodied in the Word and the Word embodied in you, you will live Him. If you have not digested Him through His Word, how can you live Him? When you are saturated with His Word, you will be saturated with Him.<h1 class=msg>CHAPTER THIRTEEN</h1><h1 class=msg>GOD&#8217;S GIFTS-THE WORD AND THE SPIRIT</h1><p>Today many Christians are interested in spiritual gifts. Too often, however, we neglect two of the greatest gifts, the Holy Bible and the Holy Spirit. One is without; the other is within; and the two correspond to each other. In the Bible we find Christ as light and life; in the Spirit we also find Christ as light and life.<p>Suppose on earth today there were no Bible. After two thousand years, what would there be on this earth concerning the Lord? There would be just a mass of confusion. You may say we would have the Spirit. It is right to trust in the Spirit, but just as a physical life cannot exist without a body, so the Spirit and the Word must always be taken together. Your life is like the Spirit, and your body is like the Word. If you take care of your body and keep it in good health, your life will last longer. Similarly, if you are built up through regularly reading the Word and spending time in prayer, your spirit will be healthy, and your family life and the church life will be greatly improved.<p>Let us answer some questions before we continue.<h2 class=head1>QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS</h2><p><I>My day starts very early. Should I still get up extra early to spend time in the Word?</I><p>It is not too hard for anyone to get up ten minutes earlier in order to eat the Word. It is a healthy habit, beneficial not only spiritually but even physically. Our anxieties will be replaced by joy when we read the Word; it is a medicine to heal us of our tensions and worries (see Prov. 4:20-22).<p><I>Is it best to get into the Word before the sun is out?</I><p>That thought comes from the typology of the gathering of manna. The Israelites had to gather manna before the sun rose, or it would melt (Exo. 16:21). If you can get up that early, that is good. But I am not that legal! If you are a nurse, you may have irregular hours. I just ask you to spend ten minutes before you start your day, whether it is at 5:30 or 8:30.<p><I>Should we eat the Word alone or corporately?</I><p>Personal contact with the Lord is basic; corporate contact, helpful. If you have time, do both; if not, take care of your private contact with Him. Personal contact can be likened to textbooks; corporate, to reference books. If you are taking a course in school, you must study the textbook in order to pass; if possible, study the reference books too. In the past few years, some saints have had only a corporate morning watch; when they come to pray-read alone, they don&#8217;t know what to do. It is poor to be able to read the reference books but not be able to study the textbook!<p><I>Suppose we do not sense a speaking during our ten minutes with the Lord. Should we be concerned or expect this to be the case sometimes?</I><p>When you go to breakfast, don&#8217;t be thinking about how it will taste; just sit down and eat. Intending to get a &#8220;good taste&#8221; from your morning reading will just be a frustration to you. Our feelings are complicated and fluctuating, as changeable as the weather. Don&#8217;t trust them. Even if the Word seems not to stay with you, it is doing its cleansing work. I encourage you by saying not to try to get anything from your reading; then you will not be discouraged when you don&#8217;t seem to get anything.<p>Before you start any day, it is a necessity to come to the Lord. To thus put Him first is to pay Him high honor. He will surely reward you, whether it seems so or not.<p><I>Many times in a meeting I sense the anointing to do something. Then the next day when I&#8217;m supposed to do it, the sense is gone. It has happened countless times. Sometimes I think I should go ahead and take care of it on the basis of my previous sense, and other times I decide to let it go.</I><p>The Christian life is a life by faith, not by feeling. We should come to the meetings regularly, for example. Many meetings we may feel we have not received anything, but nonetheless we are getting the benefit every time. If you stop coming, you will see how like the world you will become after a few months.<p>At the beginning of our Christian life, out of sympathy for our weakness, the Lord surely gives us a feeling. But in order to train us to live by faith, after a certain period He removes the feeling. Then we descend into the valley. Knowing we cannot take too much, the Lord for a shorter period restores the feeling. This gives us the sense of being on the mountaintop. Such a cycle is repeated until gradually the dependence on feelings is gone; there is no mountaintop and no valley. Whether we are opposed or welcomed matters little. Whether it is bright or cloudy, we do not care.<p>Before you enter such a stage, do not be troubled. If you feel that the anointing of the evening before is gone, contact the Lord again. If the anointing returns, follow it; if not, don&#8217;t do anything. The Lord does not expect you to live by last night. He just asks us to live today. This is the simple way of faith.<h2 class=head1>THE COMPLEXITY OF LIFE</h2><p>Life is exceedingly complex. How would you define it? There are many kinds of life-vegetable, animal, human, angelic, and divine. When John said, &#8220;In Him was life&#8221; (John 1:4), what kind of life did he mean? And what is the difference between divine life and human life? When a person dies, what life dies and what life still continues?<h2 class=head1>THREE LIVES</h2><p>How many lives do we Christians have? The New Testament, in Greek, uses three different words for life. The first is bios, from which we get the word biology, the study of life. Bios refers to the life in our body that the medical doctors deal with. Another word is psuche, which is the root of our word psychology. Psuche is translated soul; it refers to something other than our physical life. When a man dies, his bios dies but his psuche continues. The third word is zoe, a kind of higher life. This is the word John used when he said, &#8220;In Him was life.&#8221; By natural birth zoe was not in us; we had only bios and psuche. But John 3:16 tells us that when we believe in the Son (i.e., receive Him, take Him in), we have zoe.<p>Perhaps some illustrations will help us to keep these distinctions straight. When you neglect having breakfast, you feel hungry by mid-morning. Which life in you is hungry? Bios is. If you have eaten well, but you still feel hungry for some enjoyment of music or a good time, which life is hungry? In this case it is your psuche. You may come to the church meeting and have a good time singing and enjoying yourself. Afterwards, your psuche may be satisfied, yet within there may still be a sense of emptiness, or hunger. Here it is your zoe that is crying out to be fed. Why do you care only for your bios and psuche and neglect zoe?<p>Surely our experience confirms that we have these three lives in us.<h2 class=head1>CHRIST IN THE GOSPEL OF JOHN</h2><p>Not only was life in this One who was both the Word and God (John 1:1); &#8220;the life was the light of men&#8221; (v. 4). In John 10:10 He further said, &#8220;I came that they may have life and may have it abundantly.&#8221; He called Himself &#8220;the bread of life&#8221; (6:48) and &#8220;the living bread which came down out of heaven&#8221; (6:51). How much He is-the Word, God, life, light, and the bread of life!<p>He is more than this. In John 15 He told His disciples that He was a vine-not a tall tree sweeping the heavens but a low, spreading vine, reaching even to the uttermost part of the earth. He is not too high for us to reach. He is low and spreading. This vine grows horizontally to reach the whole inhabited earth.<h2 class=head1>NOT A PARABLE</h2><p>Some say that the picture given us in John 15 is a parable of our relationship with Christ. It is more accurate to say that this vine with its branches is a divine, spiritual fact. God the Father is a farmer tending this great vine which is growing and spreading throughout the earth. We, as the branches, are here to branch Christ. I hope your coming to the church meetings is not to have a good time; that is too low a reason. We are not here for a good time, but rather to branch Christ.<p>I long for us all to be in the reality of this vision. It is our background which hinders our seeing. From our Christian background, our natural background, and our national background, we have the impression that we must do this and that for God. So we think, plan, schedule, and even move across the country! Branches, though, just stay where they are and live the vine.<h2 class=head1>INVISIBLE YET REAL</h2><p>Christ lives in us, yet we cannot see Him. How can we prove He is real? In the early days of my ministry I did a lot of gospel preaching. Once a professor came to me and said, &#8220;Mr. Lee, your preaching is good, and your doctrine is quite philosophical. What you say is logical, but how can you prove that the Christ you preach is real?&#8221; I replied, &#8220;Do you have a life inside you?&#8221; &#8220;Yes,&#8221; he replied. &#8220;Is it real?&#8221; I further asked. &#8220;If so, show it to me. Otherwise, don&#8217;t say any more.&#8221; He could not show me his life. I went on, &#8220;Mr. So-and-So, you are not as philosophical as you think. You may have a doctorate in some area of science, but you are surely not a doctor of yourself. Tell me, how many hearts do you have?&#8221; &#8220;Mr. Lee,&#8221; he answered, &#8220;What are you talking about? Everybody knows we have only one heart.&#8221; &#8220;Sorry, you are mistaken. You have two hearts,&#8221; I told him. &#8220;Besides a physical heart that pumps your blood, you have a heart that can love. Isn&#8217;t this true?&#8221; He was subdued. He had a life, yet he could not show it to me. I have a real and living Christ, but I could not show Him either.<p>As a person He may be invisible, but He is also the Word. This book called the Bible differs from all other books. When we read it with an open heart, we find something moving within us. This is because it is God&#8217;s Word. In it the mysterious, invisible Christ is embodied. When we take this Word into us, it becomes the Spirit. Then when we speak this Spirit out, it again becomes the Word. The Word and the Spirit, God&#8217;s two gifts to us, are one, Christ Himself. We cannot touch Christ, but we can touch the Word; we cannot sense Christ, but we can sense the Spirit. The Spirit and the Word are the two means by which we abide in Christ.<h2 class=head1>THE ALL-INCLUSIVE SPIRIT</h2><p>In this New Testament age, whenever we touch the Spirit of God, we touch the all-inclusive Spirit of Jesus Christ. This enriched Spirit is pictured for us in the compound anointing ointment described in Exodus 30:23-25. You may remember the meaning of the spices that were added to the hin of oil; we discussed this in Life Message Eight. Myrrh signifies death; cinnamon, the sweetness of the death. Calamus is a plant which grows out of the mud high into the air; it speaks of resurrection. Cassia is an aromatic plant, used in ancient times to repel insects and especially snakes; it represents the sweet fragrance of resurrection. In this ointment, portraying the Spirit, are the death of Christ, His resurrection, His divinity (one, the measure of oil), His humanity (four, the number of spices), the trinity (three units of 500 shekels), and the Godhead. When we have this ointment, we have an all-inclusive dose.<p>Thus every time we touch the Spirit properly, we experience this death and resurrection. In the Holy Spirit there is a killing factor and a resurrecting factor. I may find, for example, that my wife is bothering me too much; I get tired of her tight control over my eating. I want forty dumplings, but she restricts me to thirty, telling me that is all she has made. It is so aggravating. Well, when I get into the Word and truly touch the Spirit, what happens to my precious dumplings? My appetite for them is killed. What happens to all the bad feelings toward my wife? The negative thoughts are all gone. When I touch the Spirit, there is first a killing, and then there is something rising up, bringing me into resurrection. Once I am in resurrection, however much she restricts my eating will not affect me. But, sad to say, the sense of resurrection seems to vanish after a couple of days. I feel low. When I look at my wife, I can see she hasn&#8217;t changed at all. I have changed, but here she is, still the same. (Actually, I am still the same!) Then again I must seek the Spirit, experience the killing, and be brought into resurrection. This is the way to grow in life.<h2 class=head1>THE ALL-INCLUSIVE WORD</h2><p>What is true of the Spirit is also true of the Bible. There is both a killing factor and a nourishing factor in the Word.<p>I was raised in China, where the teachings of Confucius were widespread. His book, The Highest Learning, aims at developing the natural virtues, even the conscience, which he terms &#8220;the bright virtue.&#8221; I remember hearing missionaries say that the teachings of Confucius were just like the teachings of the Bible. As one who had been reared and educated in Christianity, I was troubled; why did we need the Bible if its teachings were already in the writings of Confucius? After some comparative study, I concluded that the ethical teachings were the same: Honor your parents, love your neighbor, be kind, and be humble. At that time I could not distinguish between the virtues advocated by Confucius and those revealed in the Bible.<p>Now I am clear. The Highest Learning is just a cultivation of the natural virtues. The Bible, on the other hand, kills your natural virtues and then brings in the divine virtues of Christ. The more you read the Bible, the more killing you will get. From my experience the killing is first of the negative things, like pride, hatred, and jealousy. Once these are dealt with, the finer killing begins-of your love, humility, patience, and niceness. You may protest that the Lord is killing such desirable qualities, but these must be dealt with until eventually you yourself are also killed. Everything in our natural make-up must be killed.<p>When I saw this, I fell before the Lord and said, &#8220;Lord, forgive me. I will take the killing. I want You to cut this poor self into pieces.&#8221; And He did. By the Word in the Bible I was killed and cut into pieces. But the Bible not only kills; it also resurrects. Here rather than a cultivated bright natural virtue, we have the resurrected Christ living in us.<p>Day by day we must contact the Word and touch the Spirit; both do the same work of killing us and then resurrecting us. We must live this way during the week, then bring this crucified and resurrected life to the meetings. When our meetings are such a show case of the riches of Christ, thirsty ones will be attracted and all the members will grow, be knit together, and be built up.<h2 class=head1>THE VANITY OF &#8220;A GOOD TIME&#8221;</h2><p>In some of the churches an atmosphere has come in encouraging the young people just to have a good time-  singing, shouting, playing guitars. If this is your aim, how can the young people be solidly built up? Within a few years the Lord&#8217;s recovery will vanish. The church should be (1) a home with a family, (2) a school, (3) a hospital, and (4) a camp to train an army. In the Lord&#8217;s recovery we do not want our meetings to be places of entertainment; that is the way of Babylon. If the young people are built up with the Word day after day, week after week, other serious-minded young ones will be attracted, and the future of the recovery will be bright.<h2 class=head1>WHY BE STARVING?</h2><p>Man must not &#8220;live on bread alone, but on every word that proceeds out through the mouth of God&#8221; (Matt. 4:4). The Bible is likened to food. Food is not for you to understand but to eat. If you go to a restaurant, you don&#8217;t just read the menu and then feel you have finished your meal. How much have you been eating of the Word? I am afraid many of you are starving!<p>It is a necessity that you have a &#8220;breakfast&#8221; of the Word daily. Do not say that you are too weak to do this regularly. Do not quote Romans 7:18: &#8220;To will is present with me, but to do the good is not&#8221;! Romans 7 is referring to the overcoming of sin; we are talking about a necessity of life, like breathing or eating. This &#8220;breakfast,&#8221; though you may have no sense of it, will nourish, enlighten, water, and strengthen you.<p>Do not be casual about your Christian life. Paul said, &#8220;I therefore so run, not as uncertainly; so fight I, not as one that beateth the air: But I keep under my body, and bring it into subjection: lest that by any means, when I have preached to others, I myself should be a castaway&#8221; (1 Cor. 9:26-27). If you are a loose Christian, you may become a castaway.<h1 class=msg>CHAPTER FOURTEEN</h1><h1 class=msg>THE RECOVERY</h1><p>&#8220;Where there is no vision, the people run wild&#8221; (Prov. 29:18, Heb.). For us to run a straight course we need a vision. If the vision is clear, we shall not be misled. After answering some questions, I would like us to consider together what the Lord&#8217;s recovery is.<h2 class=head1>QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS</h2><p><I>Romans 16:17 says, &#8220;Keep a watchful eye on those who make divisions.&#8221; How can we keep the oneness yet not open ourselves to a negative element?</I><p>This is a clear principle given us in Romans 16. We surely need to be on the alert regarding divisive ones. Yet I would encourage you to love the saints more than watch for divisiveness. The love should occupy perhaps eighty per cent of us, but the watchfulness only twenty per cent. Otherwise, our attitude toward one another will be one of suspicion rather than care. If we emphasize loving rather than being watchful, we may be able to help a brother who shows signs of being divisive.<p><I>What can we do when language causes a separation?</I><p>This kind of separation is best helped by providing interpretation.<p><I>What should we do if we see that someone is divisive?</I><p>A surgeon&#8217;s decision to operate is not easily made. He hesitates to sacrifice some part of the body unless this is essential to maintain the life. It is not simple for us to handle the sickness of divisiveness in the Body either. As members of the church, we should be keen to sense if there are some brothers who are subtly and secretly divisive. Though we should not be blind or ignorant, we should nonetheless be loving toward such brothers. Because we want to cover and preserve them, we may in a loving tone hint to them that some are aware of their divisive intent. A thief will not steal if he knows everyone has been alerted and is watching for him! By such a loving way we may quench the divisive fire.<p>The elders especially must be wise and loving not to cut off one who is secretly working to cause division. When a member of our body is sick, we must tenderly care for that part, seeking the best medication or even an operation to heal it. We have followed this practice in the past and have seen many divisive ones healed and recovered. Never again did they practice their subtle undermining; they realized they had been healed of a sickness.<p>It is not a simple matter to practice the church life and to keep the oneness. Others may not see through the divisive one&#8217;s subtle ways. If you have the insight and the wisdom, you will keep tabs on him, watching his movements and his contacts with different ones. Then, as the Lord leads, you may have a hidden opportunity to say some &#8220;inoculating&#8221; words to help heal him of his &#8220;illness.&#8221; You will also need to be wise to know when to talk with the elders about his situation. You may need to wait a month before the time will be ripe for exposing the matter to the elders. How much we have to learn about keeping the oneness!<p><I>Should there be different levels in the church? When you come to visit, for example, shouldn&#8217;t everyone be invited to meet with you instead of just the important ones?</I><p>I am sorry to say that this type of question indicates an unhealthy condition. Whatever the state of the church- whether there are two levels or twenty-two levels-you should have no criticism and nothing to say. As long as you talk about levels, you are opinionated and a factor of damage.<p>The truth of the matter-not my opinion!-is that every family has levels. There is a grandparents&#8217; level, a parents&#8217;, an older children&#8217;s, and a younger children&#8217;s. When we invite saints to our house, I don&#8217;t ask my two-year-old granddaughter to come and join our conversation. It would be silly of her to protest that I am keeping levels! The church is a family. Surely the elders are not on the same level as those who were saved just last week. There is also the level of those who serve as deacons and deaconesses. There are some who bear the burden to minister from the Word. Your level depends on your growth in the Lord.<p>In 1 John 2 the Apostle John distinguishes between fathers (vv. 13-14), young men (v. 14), and little children (vv. 13, 18). The fathers have the experience of knowing the Father, so they have become fathers. The young men are strong and have overcome the Devil because of having the Word in them. The little children-even the little children-have the anointing within.<p>Be careful not to allow democracy to creep into the church. We may all be brothers, but we are not the same age. Boys four years old can&#8217;t be trusted to cook a meal; they may make a mess even if you ask them only to empty the trash! Our level in the church is according to our spiritual growth.<p><I>What shall we do about Children&#8217;s Meeting?</I><p>Firstly, go to the elders and pray with them. This is your family; it is not for me to say what to do with your little ones. Have fellowship and prayer with the elders and see what you should do.<h2 class=head1>A CONTRAST</h2><p>For us to appreciate the Lord&#8217;s recovery, it is helpful to know what the background was. Such a contrast will help us to be clear. The background of the Lord&#8217;s recovery is Christianity, whose characteristics are confusion and division. These characteristics first appeared at Babel (Gen. 11:1-9) or Babylon (Gk. for Babel), whose very name means confusion. This is why in the book of Revelation the Lord called today&#8217;s Christendom Babylon the great (17:5; 18:21).<p>First Corinthians 12:12 tells us what the Lord would have instead of the confusion and division. &#8220;As the body is one, and hath many members, and all the members of that one body, being many, are one body: so also is Christ.&#8221; &#8220;One&#8221; stands out here in contrast to division and &#8220;Christ&#8221; in contrast to confusion. This is what the Lord&#8217;s recovery is: an answer to confusion and division.<h2 class=head1>EARLY CHURCH HISTORY</h2><p>By reading the New Testament you can see that even in the time of the Apostle Paul (around A.D. 60-70) confusion had begun to creep in. On the day of Pentecost there was nothing but Christ in the church. But before long, the subtle serpent, Satan, introduced Judaism. Religion stands at the top of human culture, and among the religions none can exceed Judaism. It teaches the worship of God, morality, ethics, proper social relations, and good human living. Only something attractive like this could have gained an entrance into the church, which is on the highest level. If I had some dollar bills and someone wanted to add a counterfeit, he would not add just any piece of paper. The counterfeit would not be taken unless it resembled the dollar bills in every respect; it would need an expert to discern that it was false. It was because Judaism seemed so close to Christianity that it was able to creep in. Even today historians say that Christianity is the offspring of Judaism.<p>Paul also had to contend with Greek philosophy. Philosophy ranks next to religion, and Greek philosophy was the highest. At the end of the first century, then, the so-called church had within it Christ, Judaism, and Greek philosophy. Galatians was written to deal with Judaism; Colossians, to deal with philosophy.<p>The third source of confusion made its appearance in the second century. This was the satanic snare of Christology, the study of Christ&#8217;s person, undertaken by the so-called church fathers. From the studies of these great, fundamental Christian teachers arose various schools regarding Christ. One said that Christ was not God till after His resurrection. Another said that Christ was God but not a man in the flesh. The result of these Christological studies, on such a seemingly good scriptural topic, was actual division, no longer just confusion.<p>There seemed no way to solve the problem till Constantine the Great summoned the Council of Nicaea in A.D. 325. As emperor he utilized Christianity to appease the warring factions within the kingdom. This worldly Constantine presided over that Council which resolved the theological differences and produced the Nicene Creed, accepted by both Catholics and Protestants.<p>Darkness followed. Several centuries were even called the Dark Ages. Then the reformation under Martin Luther brought in the truth of justification by faith. Regrettably, it also brought in the state churches. From this time on, there was the Church of England (Anglican or Episcopalian), the Church of Germany (Lutheran), and a national church in most of the northern European countries. Not too long after these were formed, private churches, like the Baptist, Presbyterian, and Methodist, came into existence.<p>Now here we are in the twentieth century, surrounded, even in this city, by all these divisions. By the Lord&#8217;s mercy we are in His recovery. If we do not clearly see what this means, we may become a continuation or extension of Christianity. If that is all we are, it is meaningless for us to continue to meet; we may as well go back and join them.<h2 class=head1>WHY NOT REJOIN CHRISTIANITY?</h2><p>We cannot go back because of the Lord&#8217;s desire. At the end of the first century, He said, &#8220;Behold, I come quickly&#8221; (Rev. 22:12). Why has He still not come? He does not yet have what He wants. He is after a Body to express Him and a dear Bride to satisfy His heart. Do you think the Body and the Bride can be found among today&#8217;s divisions and confusions? How could the Bride be prepared there? The Lord must have something other than Christianity, apart from its denominations, if He is to have His Body built and His Bride prepared.<p>Do you see that the Lord is out to recover His church from confusion and division, back to Himself and back to oneness? In the early years of the Lord&#8217;s recovery in this country, from 1962 to, say, 1973, those of us who were part of it can testify that among us there was no confusion and no division. Originally, there was only Christ. What life, peace, and enjoyment there were in those years!<h2 class=head1>SIGNS OF CONTAMINATION</h2><p>Have you sensed something amiss in the Lord&#8217;s recovery these last few years? I fear the old history is being repeated. Some other factors besides Christ have come in. It is damaging to accept others&#8217; concepts and opinions. Anything other than Christ, even something as good as Judaism, Greek philosophy, or the study of Christ, is a factor of confusion. If we would preserve the Lord&#8217;s recovery from contamination, we must turn away from our concepts and come back simply to Christ.<p>What is a concept? It is hard not to offend when we deal with this matter, because our concepts are highly regarded by us. Here are two concepts being spread among the saints: attending the meetings regularly is religious; going early to the meetings is legal. Whether such concepts are right or wrong is not at issue. But as long as you hold and preach them, you cause division. You bring in confusion. If the saints want to come to the meetings early, they have the freedom. If some want to come later, let them. Why bother the saints with your concepts? You create barriers and destroy the peace.<p>Consider what has happened to you since you began paying attention to concepts. Is your enjoyment of Christ greater now? If you are quiet before the Lord, I believe you will sense that since being diverted from Him to concern about which meetings to attend and what time to come, your enjoyment of Christ has been less.<h2 class=head1>THE CONTENT OF THE RECOVERY</h2><p>It is not too late to come back and say, &#8220;Lord, for Your sake I drop my concepts, whether they are good or bad, useful or useless. I want only to go along with You, Your church, Your recovery, and all the saints. You are the first and the last; You are everything. Whatever concept I have, I would put it aside.&#8221; Let us all look to Him for grace that we may be brought back. The content of the Lord&#8217;s recovery is only Christ, nothing else.<p>He as our life is the material of which the church is built.<h2 class=head1>THE STANDING OF THE CHURCH</h2><p>Besides the material for a building, you also need ground on which to build.<p>There was a gentleman in China who was having a house constructed. Unbeknownst to him, a portion of it was being erected on his neighbor&#8217;s property. That neighbor bided his time till the house was finished, then went to the gentleman and told him about the house&#8217;s improper location. Here was a house designed and built exactly according to its owner&#8217;s plan, yet he lost it because it was on the wrong ground.<p>The ground or standing of the Lord&#8217;s recovery is the genuine oneness.<p>I have heard of some forming a little group in their locality and meeting by themselves. They decide together, on the basis of some kind of feeling, which church meetings they will attend. The other church meetings they do not attend. Is this keeping the oneness? Is Christ divided? Do you come only to meetings which suit your taste? Can the church be built according to your individual or group preference?<p>The church is built upon oneness. Anything other than Christ, however much we treasure it, we leave outside, because bringing in something besides Him will cause division. There will be no confusion and no division if we have regard for only these two things: Christ as life and the oneness. The church is not built upon a style of meeting nor upon aggressive people.<p>Dear ones, as you love the Lord and His recovery, be willing to drop any concept about how to meet. Some may shout, some may sleep, but you just enjoy the Lord and praise Him no matter how foreign the meeting is to your taste.<p>This is the recovery of Christ upon the oneness. Such a vision will keep us on a straight course.<h1 class=msg>CHAPTER FIFTEEN</h1><h1 class=msg>LEADERSHIP AMONG THE SAINTS</h1><p>In the New Testament economy nothing is more serious than insulting the headship of Christ. In the previous Life Message we pointed out that the church is built with Christ as life and with oneness as its ground. There is one further aspect. For the church to be safeguarded, it must be built according to the truth. Of all the truths related to the church, the most important one is the headship of Christ. Life is crucial, oneness is important, but without the headship of Christ the church is not safeguarded. As some of the questions below illustrate, this matter is related to leadership among the saints.<h2 class=head1>QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS</h2><p><I>Why do we who follow the churches turn first this way and then that way?</I><p>Too often it is true that we sway back and forth. With no sense of direction eventually we are all disappointed. This needless turning first to the right and then to the left is a sickness in the churches. The cause is the failure to practice the truth. We must all come back, not only to life and oneness, but also to the truth. Any movement, any direction, or any speaking that leads to a hierarchy is an insult to the headship of Christ; as such it must be rejected. By practicing the truth in this way, each local church will be safeguarded from fluctuating and be kept to the one goal.<p><I>What is the function of a full-time worker?</I><p>According to the Bible, for one to be a full-time worker, he must have a ministry or burden from the Lord that occupies all his time, and he must also be in an environment that can provide him with his living. You recall that Paul was fully occupied by the Lord&#8217;s work. After a certain time, however, his environment did not supply his material needs, and he resumed his occupation of tentmaker (Acts 18:3).<p><I>How can one serve and even help others to serve in a proper way in spirit and under the headship of Christ?</I><p>With the church service, the less direction there is, the better. There is, however, the practical need to know, for example, where the mops and cleaning supplies are. If you can help by saying where they are, such a direction is not an offense to Christ&#8217;s headship. Be careful, on the other hand, not to issue kingly directives: &#8220;Sisters, you can go clean over there. Then go and help those downstairs to finish.&#8221; This is a matter of the attitude of the spirit. If you help others because they need some help, that is good. If you help others in the spirit of being the service group leader, that is poor.<p>That we should not take the role of head is a far-reaching truth. It governs the elders, the co-workers, the saints, and the churches. It will kill the ambition which is in all of us as fallen human beings.<p><I>Then if you see the need and take the initiative, is that in the same realm as taking the headship?</I><p>It is the Lord&#8217;s place to initiate. To bring to the Lord what we propose and ask His blessing on it, as is the common practice in Christianity, is an insult to His headship. We must respect His lordship by letting Him initiate; unless He does, we refrain from doing anything.<p><I>Suppose when you were in our locality you were not speaking the truth. How would the brothers deal with the situation?</I><p>In order to avoid confusion, the elders would probably not interrupt the meeting. But there would be no second meeting. After that first meeting, the elders would invite me to their home and tell me in a gracious way that I was not speaking according to the truth and that the church could not take it; would I please refrain from going further?<p>It would not be too good for the administration of the church to step in and stop the speaker, but for a single saint to do so is according to the Bible. (&#8220;Let the prophets speak two or three, and let the other judge,&#8221; 1 Cor. 14:29.) A saint may interrupt the speaker by saying, &#8220;Brother So-and-so, I have a question to ask. You have said such-and-such, but it seems to me this is not according to the truth. Please prove it to me.&#8221; If all the churches and all the saints are this alert, think how careful the speaker will be.<p>On the other hand, a church which takes whatever I say just because I say it is not healthy and does not know the truth. If you follow what I tell you, it must be because you have checked that it is according to the truth. It must not be a matter of following a man but of keeping the divine truth. If what is spoken is checked out by every saint and by the church to see that it is according to the truth, we shall be kept from falsehood.<p>Be sure your questioning is done in the Spirit. In the church everything must be genuine and true, but it must also be in spirit. If you challenge a speaker, you must do so in your spirit with love. We are not opposing someone; we are studying the truth. Let us go on, then, by growing in life, by keeping the oneness, and by seeking after the truth.<p><I>When something is bothering us and we want to take that to the Lord, that is not the same as going to the Lord with a purpose, is it?</I><p>The best contact with the Lord is simple. Whatever burdens or problems I have, I come to Him without any. I lay them aside to come to Him with no purpose. The truth of the matter is that the Lord is bearing our burdens. A number of times I have gone to Him with my burdens, and He has said, &#8220;Foolish child, why do you bear the burdens which are on My shoulder? Why don&#8217;t you just enjoy Me?&#8221;<p>This is a basic lesson for our whole Christian life. If we learn to cast our burden on the Lord, we shall grow. Don&#8217;t think that if you don&#8217;t bear the burden, no one will. The Lord will bear it.<h2 class=head1>ORGANIZATION</h2><p>Among any group of people there is a need for organization. Though we say the church has none, there are practical matters to be taken care of and relationships to be worked out. Who will open the doors of the meeting hall? What relationship should there be among the churches in the Bay area? Who should take the lead among the elders in a local church? What is the relationship between the church and the work?<p>All these matters, which apparently concern organization, in the church are related to the headship of Christ. Any relationship that insults or damages the headship of Christ is wrong. We cannot work out these relationships properly without understanding the meaning of His headship.<h2 class=head1>THE UNIQUE HEADSHIP</h2><p>Of all the members of our physical body, only one is the head. Is the shoulder the head of the arm? the arm the head of the hand? the hand of the fingers? the fingers of the nails? No! There is no subhead in the body, as medical doctors will confirm. The head gives orders even to the fingernails directly.<p>God will not allow anyone to share the headship with Christ. The elders should be careful about claiming to express His headship; they do not have even an indirect share in that headship. The Catholic teaching that the popes represent Christ as the successors of Peter is a blasphemy. But the denominations and even the small Christian groups also insult the headship of Christ by having a head.<h2 class=head1>A SHIFTING LEADERSHIP</h2><p>Was not Peter the leader in the early days of the church? Yes, he surely was, but please notice that his leadership was not official, nor permanent, nor organizational. When Peter stood up with the eleven on the day of Pentecost (Acts 2:14), he was the leading one. When his name is mentioned with the other Apostles in the Gospels or in the first part of Acts, it is always first (e.g., Matt. 10:2; Luke 6:13-14; Acts 1:13; 3:1; 5:29). The reason was that during those periods Peter&#8217;s spiritual measure exceeded that of the others.<p>However, notice the order of names in Galatians 2:9: James, Cephas [Peter], and John. Why has James replaced Peter as the first one? Peter, as the rest of the chapter recounts, slipped in his spiritual standing out of fear of the Jews. Though he well knew there was no difference between the Jewish and Gentile believers, he withdrew from eating with the Gentiles when the Jews came down from Jerusalem. Paul, who was younger in the faith, rebuked him to the face for this failure to walk according to the truth of the gospel. At this point the leadership was in the hands of James.<p>In the account given in Acts 15 again James was the leading one. In that conference Peter had something to say and so did Paul, but it was James who gave the final word in verse 19: &#8220;Wherefore I decide that we trouble not them, which from among the Gentiles are turned to God&#8221; (Gk.).<p>Another example of this shifting leadership is the case of Barnabas and Saul. It was Barnabas who brought in Saul (Acts 9:26-27) and whose name was mentioned first when they were called by the Holy Spirit to the work (Acts 13:2). But the sequence of names changed in verse 43, indicating that between the two apostles the leadership depended upon the spiritual measure, not official appointment.<h2 class=head1>ELDERS</h2><p>&#8220;God hath set some in the church, first apostles, secondarily prophets, thirdly teachers, after that miracles, then gifts of healings, helps, governments, diversities of tongues&#8221; (1 Cor. 12:28). &#8220;Helps&#8221; refers to the services of the deacons; &#8220;governments,&#8221; to the functions of the elders. Why did Paul list the services of the deacons ahead of the functions of the elders? (Note that &#8220;diversities of tongues&#8221; is last; that is where tongues-speaking always is!) It may be that at Corinth the elders thought too much in terms of rank. Paul wanted them to know that they were not the head. It is best not to say that the elders represent the headship of Christ; the Scriptures do not say so, and they must not think of themselves as subheads.<p>Peter underscored this in his first Epistle: &#8220;Neither as being lords over God&#8217;s heritage, but being examples to the flock&#8221; (5:3). The elders are not leaders but examples. When I was in Scotland, I saw how the shepherds took care of their flocks. Whenever a sheep went astray, the shepherds would order one of the sheep dogs after it to bring it back into line. This is not the kind of shepherding Peter referred to! If there is some cleaning to be done, for example, the elders should take the lead to do it, not ask others to take care of it.<p>The Lord said, &#8220;Neither be called leaders, because One is your Leader, the Christ&#8221; (Matt. 23:10). &#8220;You are all brothers&#8221; (v. 8). These verses indicate that in the New Testament economy God does not want any permanent, official leadership.<p>In the New Testament the eldership is always plural. Which elder will be number one depends on two matters. As the example of Peter illustrates, it is decided according to the spiritual measure and condition. The elders&#8217; positions may vary from week to week. The one who was up last week may be fighting with his wife this week, and the leadership may pass to another elder. Leadership also depends upon spiritual ability. An elder may have ability in a certain area; he will take the lead in that, while in another area another elder will be responsible.<p>By such a flexible leadership the church is kept from hierarchy. It is also safeguarded from error. If Peter had been an official leader, he might have introduced a wrong concept about Judaism during his time of weakness.<p>Elsewhere in human society there is no such leadership as this. How wise is our God! This leadership is plural, not single; temporary, not fixed; conditional, not organizational; spiritual, not official. It has position but no rank. &#8220;The greater among you shall be your servant&#8221; (Matt. 23:11). If you want to be great among the saints, you must be a slave. For the service of the church you may take the lead to vacuum the carpet, but this &#8220;leadership&#8221; has no rank.<p>Hebrews 13:17 admonishes us to &#8220;Obey the ones leading you and submit to them.&#8221; We are to obey the leading ones in serving, but this does not make the leading ones lords, having rank over the saints. That would make them the head and insult the headship of Christ.<h2 class=head1>THE MINISTRY</h2><p>For over fifteen years the recovery has been in this country. Throughout this period I have made it a point never to give orders to anyone. I am not a leader and I have no rank, though some of you may so regard me. I am a bondslave of Christ to serve His household. Frequently I have been asked to advise various churches. Individuals have often sought my advice. In fact, many have begged me to tell them what to do. In every case I have refused, because for me to give an order is to insult my Lord and slight His headship. You must receive your orders directly from the Head. All I can tell you is to pray and get your directions from Him.<h2 class=head1>THE CHURCHES</h2><p>All the local churches, regardless of their size, are on the same level. Do not think that Anaheim is the lead church. What happened to Jerusalem when the early churches began to look to it for direction? The Lord sent Titus with his army in A.D. 70 to destroy it. There is no ground for any church to be over another.<h2 class=head1>THE WORK</h2><p>According to the Bible the work is regional. Peter worked in the Jewish region, while Paul worked among the Gentile areas. These two works in two regions were on the same level and were not merged into one unit. A hierarchy would have arisen if they had been combined. The regions are not to be merged. Regions of the work exist today in Brazil, Germany, Japan, Korea, Taiwan, the Philippines, Malaysia, and Indonesia. In the United States also there are regions of the work where churches have been raised up: Ohio and Texas are examples. If we organize these regions into one unit, it will lead to hierarchy with an official leadership. This would insult Christ&#8217;s headship.<h2 class=head1>CHRIST THE QUALIFIED HEAD</h2><p>How important it is for us all to learn to go to the Lord and take orders directly from Him! God has ascribed the headship only to Him. This truth is a safeguard to the church life. Once a hierarchy was established in Christianity, all kinds of evil, devilish things were brought in. If we take Christ as the content of the church and the genuine oneness as its ground, and are careful to practice the truth, the church will be steady and kept from evil.<h1 class=msg>CHAPTER SIXTEEN</h1><h1 class=msg>GROWING UP INTO HIM</h1><p>We need to grow spiritually. In Ephesians 4:13-16 the matter of growth is mentioned three times. We must become a full-grown man, no longer children. Then we are to &#8220;grow up into him in all things.&#8221; Lastly, the whole Body must grow (&#8220;maketh growth of the body&#8221;-Gk.). Let us answer some questions before we consider how the Body can grow.<h2 class=head1>QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS</h2><p><I>How can we deny ourselves?</I><p>When we read the Scripture which tells us to deny our self, our natural response is to determine to put our self aside. Such a response is not biblical but ethical. Confucius taught self-denial. When the learned Chinese believers read Matthew 16, their background of ethical teachings leads them to react, &#8220;Lord, from today I am no more for myself. I will deny myself.&#8221; This is the way of self-endeavor.<p>What is the biblical way? &#8220;If anyone desires to come after Me, let him deny himself, and take up his cross, and follow Me&#8221; (Matt. 16:24). Do you see what follows &#8220;deny himself&#8221;? It says to take up the cross. To deny the self is to take up the cross. When Christ was crucified, He included you. Receive and abide in the fact that you were crucified with Him. &#8220;Lord, thank You I do not need to deny myself by my own effort. I just accept and stand on the fact that on the cross I was crucified with You. It is no longer I but Christ that lives in me.&#8221; The real denial of the self is to remain under His crucifixion.<p><I>I think we do need your sharing with us to be more legal about reading the Word, but there is a problem that crops up. We tend to pressure others instead of just taking the word for ourselves.</I><p>It is not helpful to pressure others. If you are faithful to practice contacting the Lord every day in the Word, there will be a change in you that will have an effect on those around you.<p>While my brother and I were studying in college, I got saved (at the age of nineteen) and began to love the Bible. I lost interest in the activities we had been doing together and spent most of that summer at home reading the Bible. My younger brother, who was fifteen at the time and quite naughty, observed the change taking place in me, and on his own he too began to read the Bible. As a result he was saved. His salvation came about not because of anyone&#8217;s exhorting him, but by the transmission of life from me to him.<p>If you will go to the Lord for ten minutes every morning and read the Word, you will be nourished and your life will become shining. This change in you will minister life to others and attract them. Don&#8217;t try to recruit them to study the Word!<p><I>Is it good to practice releasing our spirit in the meetings even if we may be in our emotions and full of self?</I><p>It is better not to be so analytical. The practice is simple. Your spirit is gradually purified by the working of the Word and the Spirit in you. As you are contacting the Lord by these means, the negative things within you-your natural emotion, tendencies, dislikes, and such-are being killed, and the resurrection life is being ministered into you. Little by little you are being unconsciously transformed by the life of Christ. When you come to the meetings, just release your spirit in a genuine and spontaneous way. At first your spirit is not so pure, but as the months go by, and the Word and the Spirit do their killing and resurrecting work, your spirit will be more and more purified.<p><I>How can we have our will strengthened?</I><p>The Lord&#8217;s presence, as you receive the Word and touch the Spirit, will benefit you in every way. This habit of contacting Him will make your mind sober, without your even thinking about it. It will affect your emotions too. You may not ask the Lord to strengthen your will, but contacting Him will strengthen it unconsciously.<p><I>How is it that after so many years of being a Christian, there doesn&#8217;t seem to be any change in me? Why do I still lose my temper? Should we expect to improve?</I><p>I understand your problem. Day after day a mother takes care of her children, but she can see very little change in them. She does not do anything purposely to make them grow, but by feeding them properly and by regulating their behavior, exercise, and sleep, little by little they are changing. The time will come when they will be full-grown.<p>Why is our Christian growth stunted? It is from our failure to take in the Word. Our eating and drinking are deficient. If the main point of our meetings is guitar playing and singing the Psalms, we may enjoy ourselves, but year after year there will be no change in us. Just as our human life requires that we eat, drink, sleep, and breathe, so for our spiritual life we must contact the Lord and take in His Word. Our meetings must also supply us with the solid food. The result will be transformation, not by any outward doing, but by the life supply dispensed into us from within. We shall change.<p><I>What is the proper way to handle saints who would push &#8220;windy teachings&#8221; on you?</I><p>This requires wisdom. Arguing with them is worthless. If you realize they cannot take your word, don&#8217;t say anything. But you must be nourished with the good things of the Word and be faithful to attend all the meetings. Time will show how you have grown, while those who persist in looseness remain degraded.<p><I>A new sister is having a hard time reading the Word. How can I help her?</I><p>Help her to pray-read. All the new ones need such help to open them up.<p><I>How does a young person get started on studying the Word?</I><p>As I have previously mentioned, you must have your morning nourishment and your daily reading of four chapters. For study, you first select a book. To get into it thoroughly, studying every word, you need reference books and some good translations, like Darby&#8217;s and the American Standard Version. A Greek-English interlinear translation is a help, as is Young&#8217;s or Strong&#8217;s Concordance. By these means you will find out the proper meaning of the words. This will help you to interpret and expound the verses. You must do this consecutively and continually, not according to your whim. After you have studied the book in this way, you may come back to study the major topics of that book. Romans, for example, has such topics as justification, reconciliation, sanctification, and glorification. You can study the distinction between sin and sins, between being in Adam and in Christ, etc. By going through a book verse by verse and then studying its major subjects, you will become thoroughly familiar with it and gain the proper knowledge. Then take another book. It would especially benefit you to go through Matthew, John, Romans, Galatians, Ephesians, Philippians, Colossians, Hebrews, 1 John, and Revelation.<p><I>In reading through the Old Testament, sometimes you go through a dry period. How can we get through this?</I><p>If this reading is part of your four chapters, just let it be dry. The genealogy in Matthew 1 may be a frustration to you, but reading it still profits you. The Scripture is God&#8217;s breath; it refreshes you whether you understand it or not. Further, when you come around to read it the next time, or the third time, you will find that it is less and less dry. I have come to cherish those first seventeen verses in Matthew 1; they are rich and solid.<p>When you read the Bible, don&#8217;t try to understand it. You may even need to pray sometimes, &#8220;Lord, help me not to try to understand Your Word&#8221;! Just understand as much as you can; the next time you read it, you will have more understanding.<p><I>How can we gain more knowledge of the Son of God (Eph. 4:13)? Would it be through studying, memorizing, pray-reading, or how?</I><p>I encourage you to read and study as much as you can. This is better than memorizing. From your reading and studying you will spontaneously remember. The study of the Bible requires your whole mentality and much of your time. Whatever we do with the Bible is a benefit, but spending the time to study is more useful, I think, than exercising so much to memorize.<p>Your study of the Scriptures will be helped by referring to other books too, especially the recovery books that we have printed.<p><I>When we come to contact the Lord, is it better to pray first or to read first?</I><p>Usually I find that I contact the Lord before I get to the Bible on my desk. By saying &#8220;O Lord&#8221; I am in the spirit already, before I open my Bible. Please do not think that meditating on Him is helpful. You will no sooner close your eyes to meditate than your thoughts will travel to your nagging mother-in-law, then on to London, to Hong Kong, or elsewhere. The prevailing way to touch the Lord is to be in the spirit and in the Word; then you will fully enjoy Christ.<h2 class=head1>THE SPIRIT AND OUR GROWTH</h2><p>In chapter four of Ephesians I would call your attention first of all to the Spirit: &#8220;Being eager to keep the oneness of the Spirit in the uniting bond of peace&#8221; (v. 3, Gk.). Without the Spirit there is no oneness. He is also the seal and guarantee of our salvation. We know that we are saved because the Spirit is within. We may worry sometimes, the way the unbelievers do, but in the midst of our fretting, the sense comes that there is no need to worry, that we can be at peace. It is this same Spirit within that makes us brothers and sisters. Without Him we are Gentiles, not children of God. It is by His constraint that we gather for meetings rather than seek worldly entertainment and excitement. We are here because we have the same Spirit, flowing in us just as electricity flows to the lights in the ceiling and unites them in shining.<p>The Spirit is mysterious. If you say He is great, I say He is small. If you say He is kind, I say sometimes He would rather trouble you. When you would be at peace, He gives you no peace. Yet when He seems unkind, He is being kind to you. This is the wonderful Spirit by whose working within we grow.<h2 class=head1>TWO KINDS OF ONENESS</h2><p>In verse 13 of Ephesians 4 it says, &#8220;Till we all arrive at the oneness of the faith&#8221; (Gk.). In the third verse it says, &#8220;Being eager to keep the oneness of the Spirit&#8221; (Gk.). We must keep the oneness of the Spirit until we all arrive at the oneness of the faith. We &#8220;drive the car&#8221; of the oneness of the Spirit until we all arrive at the oneness of the faith!<h2 class=head1>THE FAITH</h2><p>The faith referred to in verse 13 does not mean your believing, but rather the object of what you believe. An abstract of our faith would be: Our God, who is triune, became a man by the name of Jesus. He went to the cross and died for us, for our sins. After three days He was resurrected from the dead and ascended to the heavens, where He now is as our Redeemer, Savior, and Lord. At the same time, in His resurrection He became the life-giving Spirit, came into us, and now lives within us as our life, while His blood cleanses all our sins.<p>This is what we all believe. We have the same faith and the same Spirit. These are what make us one. Whatever our age, nationality, or background, we are one because we have the same Spirit and the same faith.<h2 class=head1>WIND OF TEACHING</h2><p>Teaching, as verse 14 says, is a wind which tosses the children to and fro. Sometimes a teaching may bring in a storm or tornado or whirlwind. If you have been carried about with the winds that have blown through the recovery these past two years, it is an indication that you are a child. They may have blown you to the movies, or kept you in bed when you should have been having morning watch, or encouraged you to despise the elders and be loose in your daily living. What will save you from these winds? Your salvation lies in growing up. You are a child playing with toys. That is all right for a while, but you need to grow up. &#8220;Be no more children.&#8221;<h2 class=head1>THE KNOWLEDGE OF THE SON OF GOD</h2><p>We also need to arrive at the oneness &#8220;of the knowledge of the Son of God&#8221; (v. 13). We do not have sufficient knowledge of the Lord Jesus. What, for example, does Colossians reveal concerning Christ? (See Life Message Twelve.) We need to know Him in all these different aspects. Such solid, detailed knowledge of Him will save us from the wind of teaching.<h2 class=head1>THE TRUTH</h2><p>The last matter which affects our growth is found in verse 15, &#8220;Holding the truth in love&#8221; (Gk.). As we hold the truth in love, we shall &#8220;grow up into him in all things.&#8221;<p>There is no way to grow without getting into the Word in a serious way. That is why I have urged you to set aside time for this every day. Some need to study the Word in a thorough way, so that in time to come they may be able to teach and shepherd in the church. Return to the Word. Follow in life and truth. Follow in knowledge and experience, that we may &#8220;grow up into him in all things&#8221; until we arrive at &#8220;a full-grown man.&#8221;<h1 class=msg>CHAPTER SEVENTEEN</h1><h1 class=msg>ONENESS</h1><p>The matter of oneness is a common topic among Christians today. We are one not because we have common concepts, similar interests, and the same goal, nor because we are doing the same kind of work. Though there is a oneness that arises from the factors people have in common, this is not the genuine oneness. Any unity other than the genuine oneness is a oneness in division. For example, there is a oneness to be found among Catholics, or Presbyterians, or those engaged in a Christian work; without some kind of oneness people could not work together.<h2 class=head1>THE ONLY SOURCE OF ONENESS</h2><p>Outside of Christ there is no true oneness. Every true believer has Christ within. Apart from Him no two human beings are truly one. There is no need to say that the Chinese cannot be one with the Americans, nor the French with the Germans; even the Yankees cannot be one with the Texans! To come even closer to home, what husband and wife are one apart from Christ? He is the only real oneness.<h2 class=head1>LIVING IN GOD</h2><p>The Lord prayed, &#8220;That they all may be one; even as You, Father, are in Me and I in You, that they also may be in Us, that the world may believe that You have sent Me&#8221; (John 17:21). The secret for believers to be one is for them to be in the Triune God. Christians do not have the genuine oneness because they are not living in Him, though positionally they are in Him.<h2 class=head1>ONE BY BEING IN HIS GLORY</h2><p>In the next verse, John 17:22, the Lord prayed further about the oneness: &#8220;And the glory which You have given Me I have given to them, that they may be one, even as We are one.&#8221; What glory is referred to here? There is something in the universe that is called the glory of the Triune God. The glory that the Father gave the Son, the Son has given to the believers for the very purpose of their all being one. Whatever glory means, it is surely something just of God. Glory is God expressed. When we are in the expression of God, we are one. Electricity is hidden until we turn the lights on. The shining lights then become one in the glory, the expression, of electricity.<h2 class=head1>IN THE TRIUNE GOD</h2><p>To have the genuine oneness, you must be in the Triune God. Positionally and doctrinally all believers are surely in Him. In experience, however, where are you? Are you in the Triune God in your daily living? in your family life? in your relationship with your mother-in-law? when it&#8217;s your turn to wash the dishes? Most of the time, we must admit, we are in ourselves-in our choice, our preference, our flesh, in jealousy, hatred, or pride. While we may be aware that we need to be in the genuine oneness, we cannot attain this because we do not live in the Triune God.<p>Over these many years I have seen a good many saints who really loved the Lord come into the recovery, stay for a while, and then leave to become part of some division. There were even some dear Christian co-workers on the mainland of China who went out from us to set up a division. The simple reason for such a regrettable departure was that they failed to live in the Triune God. If you are not in fear and trembling to live in Him day after day, the time may come when you too will cause a division.<h2 class=head1>IN HIS EXPRESSION</h2><p>Just to live in the Triune God is not adequate. For the oneness to be doubly secure we must also be in God&#8217;s expression. Our work together here is to express Him. It is not for the accomplishment of our own purpose. We all have our own intention, our own aim, and our own goal. All these are killed in the expression of the Triune God. To whatever extent they are not killed, to that measure we are not secure in the genuine oneness. If our goal is anything other than the expression of the Triune God, sooner or later this other goal will cause division.<p>Why is it that Christians cannot be one? What is the cause of the countless, endless divisions? All the denominations have had splits. Even a small group, after it meets together for just two or three years, will end up divided into perhaps three groups. This divisiveness is because most Christians do not live in Christ and do not care for the expression of God. Their low concern is for their taste and their preference. Their high concern is for the achievement of their goals. Because they care for these things and not for the expression of God, the genuine oneness is not secure with them.<h2 class=head1>THE TRIUNE GOD IN US</h2><p>The Lord&#8217;s prayer about the oneness reached a further stage in John 17:23: &#8220;I in them, and You in Me, that they may be perfected into one.&#8221; Notice that in verse 21 the prayer was that we might be in the Triune God. In this verse the prayer is that the Triune God may be in us. For Him to be in us is more experiential.<p>Is the Triune God in you? Or are you occupied by a girl friend? your wife? a new pair of shoes? your children? your savings account? If these other things are in you, there is no room for God. Christians may blame doctrinal differences, but the real reason they are not one is that the Triune God is not in them, they do not care for His expression, and they do not live in Him.<p>From verse 23 we can see that even if we are in the genuine oneness, we still need to be perfected. The Triune God is in you to work in you until you are perfected. You may say you are one with others, but your oneness is shallow because you are still so natural, so full of the flesh, so selfish. Once the Triune God has worked in you to rid you of the old man, you will be perfected into one.<p>Surely there is a oneness in the church in your locality, but that oneness is not so high and not so secure. We all need the Triune God to be more deeply in us that we may be perfected into one. If Peter and Paul and Mary were here, they would all be thoroughly one. Our oneness may be genuine, but it is fragile because our living in the Triune God is shallow, and we do not care enough about His being expressed.<p>Pray regarding the points on oneness covered in these three verses:<p>(1)Verse 21 stresses our being in the Triune God.<p>(2)Verse 22 says that it is the glory of God that makes us one.<p>(3)Verse 23 emphasizes that the Triune God is in us to perfect us into one.<p>As you pray, you will see the need of grace to keep the oneness. Today your oneness is spontaneous and natural. When the test comes, however, you will find you cannot stand it. If you do not realize the need for the genuine oneness, eventually you will drop out of the church life even if you have been in the recovery for many years.<h2 class=head1>THE NATURE OF THE RECOVERY</h2><p>What differentiates the Lord&#8217;s recovery from Christianity is our nature and standing. The church has Christ Himself as its nature. In contrast to Christianity, it is not an organization built upon certain concepts, but an entity with Christ as its content and nature. Christianity is composed of divisions and has sundry things as its nature. As for our standing, the ground of the church is the genuine oneness. If we miss this, we are no longer the church but rather a continuation of Christianity. To remain in the Lord&#8217;s recovery we must keep Christ as life and the oneness as our standing.<h2 class=head1>KEEPING THE ONENESS</h2><p>Ephesians 4:3 refers to the oneness of the Spirit, while 4:13 refers to the oneness of the faith. When you believed in the Lord Jesus, the Spirit of God entered into you. That Spirit, in you and in so many other believers, is the very oneness. The lights in the ceiling are individual units until the electric current is turned on; then they become one. They are not one in themselves but in the electricity. Believers likewise are one by the current of the Spirit in all of them. How can we keep this oneness of the Spirit which is already ours?<p>The faith in verse 13 means what we believe; we listed some of the items of our faith in the previous message. These beliefs concerning Christ&#8217;s Person and redemptive work comprise our Christian faith. Because we hold these beliefs in common, we have oneness.<h2 class=head1>ADDING OUR CONCEPTS</h2><p>Unfortunately when we are saved and come into the church, we bring some things from our past with us. As time progresses, we also pick up other things and treat them as items of the faith though they are not.<p>Suppose, for example, that there are four students who are saved during a gospel campaign. The Spirit enters into all of them; thus they have the oneness of the Spirit. Further, they all believe the same thing: they have the same faith. One of them, however, a doctoral student, comes into the church with some peculiar concept; eventually his concept becomes a great problem to the church. Another student decides to study theology after being saved. He quits his secular studies and goes to a so-called theological seminary where he is indoctrinated with modernism. The third one starts attending a Baptist church and becomes persuaded that immersion as practiced by the Baptists is the only right kind. The fourth one gets involved in speaking in tongues.<p>On the day the four were saved, they were one. But now, if they come together, surely they will fight. The doctoral student will defend his strange concept; the theological student, his modernistic interpretations; the Baptist, the practice of immersion; and the Pentecostalist, the speaking in tongues. What has happened to the oneness? In addition to the oneness of the Spirit and the oneness of the faith, they have taken on something. Actually what they have picked up as their choice is a toy and reveals that they are just children. Yes, one may be earning a Ph.D. degree, but in the Lord he is a little boy who likes to play with his toy. The other &#8220;children&#8221; need their &#8220;toys&#8221; too, whether modernistic teachings, insistence on immersion, or speaking in tongues.<p>Verses 13 and 14 of Ephesians 4 remind us that when we come to the oneness of the faith, we shall &#8220;henceforth be no more children, tossed to and fro, and carried about with every wind of doctrine.&#8221; All these doctrines are winds blowing us from the real oneness.<p>As you grow, you will lose interest in your toys. After you grow up in the Lord, you will find that the age of toys is over. Then you will have the oneness of the Spirit and the oneness of the faith. No doctrine will blow you away.<p>Remember that the church and its nature are Christ and that the standing of the church is the genuine oneness. Sooner or later you will find the winds blowing around you. Some in the charismatic movement may ask you if you have received the baptism of the Holy Spirit and tell you how good it is to speak in tongues. Will you allow this wind of doctrine to blow you away from the genuine oneness?<h2 class=head1>CHARACTERISTICS OF A SECT</h2><p>Christianity is made up of denominations. To be denominated means to be named. Any group which has a particular name, not common to all believers, is a division or a sect. If you are a Presbyterian, or Methodist, or Episcopalian, such a name is a sign that you are in a division.<p>Some groups may not have a distinctive name, yet they hold to a special doctrine. They may insist that all their members be immersed. They may even require a certain style of immersion before they will receive you as a brother. This is sectarian.<p>Other groups practice a special fellowship. Some Pentecostalists, for example, will not accept you into their circle unless you speak in tongues.<p>To have a name, to have a special teaching, and to have a restricted fellowship are the characteristics of a sect. What is our name? What is the name of the church in your locality? We have no special name. The term church includes all believers, not a select number. If it is in Boston, it is the church in Boston. We could compare it to the moon; no matter what part of the earth the moon is over, it is still the moon. If we were to take a particular name, we would become a sect. Further, we have no particular teaching. We are not a tongues-speaking church, though many of us may have spoken in tongues in the past. Neither our teaching nor our fellowship are particular. We accept as brothers all those who believe in the Lord and are saved.<h2 class=head1>RESPONSIBILITY FOR DIVISION</h2><p>Many Christians choose to hold on to their divisive name, their special doctrine, or their particular fellowship. Some have tried to bring tongues-speaking into the church, but if we become a tongues-speaking church we become a sect. Others may believe in pre-tribulation rapture. It is all right for them to hold this doctrine, but if they try to preach it and make the whole church believe this way, such an attempt would lead to division.<p>For the oneness of the church, we must be common and general. Those Christians who insist on their special teaching or requirement for fellowship must bear the responsibility for the division that exists. When we came into the recovery, many of us dropped our particular teachings in order to share the common oneness with the saints. We are still learning not to be particular but to receive all real Christians and thus keep the oneness.<h1 class=msg>CHAPTER EIGHTEEN</h1><h1 class=msg>HOW TO BEHAVE IN THE HOUSE OF GOD</h1><h1 class=msg>(1)</h1><p>The Apostle Paul wrote to Timothy so that he would know &#8220;how thou oughtest to behave thyself in the house of God, which is the church of the living God, the pillar and base [Gk.] of the truth&#8221; (1 Tim. 3:15). If Timothy needed such instruction, how much more do we! Let us answer some questions before we consider together our behavior in the house of God, which is the church.<h2 class=head1>QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS</h2><p><I>How can I have a proper regard for the headship of Christ in dealing with my husband? I have been in the recovery for only six months and am not clear about the right relationships between brothers and sisters in the church.</I><p>In ordinary times, the wife must follow her husband. However, if a robber breaks into the house, you don&#8217;t have to wait for your husband to phone the police. If your house is on fire, you don&#8217;t have to submit to your husband to the extent of letting him stay asleep. To wake him up and to call the fire department is not overstepping your place. If someone in the church stands up and preaches that we should worship Satan, everyone, even the youngest sister, should rise up to protest.<p><I>Even if we read the Bible over and over, I don&#8217;t think we would ever come up with what you have shared with us regarding leadership among the saints [see Life Message Fifteen]. How can we as young people get into the Word and really get the meat, or the divine concept, out of it?</I><p>As I have said before, we first approach the Word not to understand it, but to get into God&#8217;s presence, to breathe Him in and be washed by Him. As for seeing the light in the Word, this requires much labor. I have been clear for many years that God does not want human leadership in His service, but it is only in these last two years that I have put the various Scripture references together that prove this point (Matt. 23:8, 10; 1 Pet. 5:3; 1 Cor. 12:28; and the cases of Peter and Paul. All this we covered in Life Message Fifteen, &#8220;Leadership among the Saints.&#8221;) It takes time for the understanding to come on these matters. In the house of God we have the prophets and teachers (Eph. 4:11). It is a family with both older and younger ones. Gradually you will have more understanding, not by the mere passage of time, but by accumulating the knowledge of the Bible as you contact the Lord in its pages.<p><I>I have heard it said that when we come into the church life, we are getting into a boat, and that we should all stay in the boat, even if it means going over the cliff together. This has made us feel that even if we sense an objection within us to something, we must not disturb the oneness but all stay together and let the Lord rescue us.</I><p>Such talk, I am sorry to say, is foolish and superstitious. It is true that we do not want to be rebellious and disobedient; we are not out to make trouble or cause turmoil. However, our obedience is based upon the logical truth and the proper knowledge. Suppose I tell you that Satan is God and that you must worship him. Will you stay in such a boat to keep the oneness?<p>I have also heard of the saints&#8217; being told not to try to discern others, that if they discern they are not showing love. Does not the Bible say, &#8220;Let the other discern&#8221; (1 Cor. 14:29, Gk.)? In Philippians 1:9 the Apostle Paul prayed, &#8220;That your love may abound in knowledge and in all judgment.&#8221; Love should not abound in foolishness; we should not love blindly. A love which abounds in knowledge is the proper love.<p>The truth about leadership among the saints has two sides; we must keep the balance. On the one hand, there is no permanent leadership in the New Testament economy. On the other hand, the younger are to submit themselves to the elder (1 Pet. 5:5). While we practice the truth of not recognizing human leadership, we must also practice the subduing of our flesh by learning to submit humbly to others.<p><I>Could you explain more specifically what the truth is that Paul wrote about in 1 Timothy 3?</I><p>The word truth means what is real. In actuality only God is real; thus in the Bible truth refers to God Himself. &#8220;The law was given through Moses; grace and reality came through Jesus Christ&#8221; (John 1:17). When Jesus came, God came to be our enjoyment. When Jesus came, God came to be the reality. All the truths in the Bible refer to God Himself, not to doctrines. In the Bible there are many doctrines which contain the truth. The truth is not mere doctrine. There is a distinction between doctrine and truth, though many Christians confuse them.<h2 class=head1>CHRIST&#8217;S INAUGURATION</h2><p>In order for us to behave properly in the house of God, we must realize that God has made Christ Head over all things to the church (Eph. 1:22). In God&#8217;s administration there was a specific time when this inauguration of Christ into the headship of the universe occurred. It is clear from Peter&#8217;s words on the day of Pentecost that this enthronement took place at the time of Christ&#8217;s ascension (Acts 2:32-36).<h2 class=head1>A MAN TO DEAL WITH GOD&#8217;S ENEMY</h2><p>Why was the headship of Christ not fully established during the time of the Old Testament? Acts 17:31 gives us a hint: &#8220;Because he hath appointed a day, in the which he will judge the world in righteousness by that man whom he hath ordained; whereof he hath given assurance unto all men, in that he hath raised him from the dead.&#8221; God in His administration wanted a man to exercise His judgment; it was not His will to deal with the enemy directly. During the time of the Old Testament Christ had not yet been incarnated; He was Son of God, but not Son of Man. For Christ to be the fully qualified Head He could not be just God; He had to have the human nature as well as the divine. We may think that God Almighty is surely adequate to head up the universe, but in His economy He does not will to exercise His administration in His deity.<p>Why is there a need for a governmental administration in the universe? We all realize that government is mainly to restrain the lawless, like robbers and murderers; if everyone behaved properly, there would not be much need of human government. Similarly, if in the universe there were no Satan with his evil spirits and demons, there would not be so much need for the divine government over the universe. This is the negative reason for God&#8217;s government. Positively speaking, God also has an eternal purpose to carry out. For its fulfillment there is the need of a man.<p>God would not directly deal with Satan, because their relationship is that of Creator and creature. So as not to lower His status as Creator, God must use man, another of His creatures, to defeat the creature Satan, His enemy.<p>By His incarnation Christ, the Son of God, gained the humanity which made Him the Son of Man also. By His death on the cross He accomplished God&#8217;s purpose and defeated His enemy. Now He qualifies to be Head over all things in God&#8217;s government: He has taken on the human element by incarnation, and He has accomplished God&#8217;s purpose and destroyed the enemy by crucifixion. Once this work was finished, He rested in the tomb for three days.<p>Then He was resurrected and ascended into the heavens. At this point He was inaugurated into the full headship of the whole universe. He is not only Head of the church, but also the Head of every man. What we are touching here is not a doctrinal matter but a truth, for the seeing of which we need to have our inner eyes enlightened.<h2 class=head1>A MAN EXALTED</h2><p>&#8220;Let all the house of Israel know assuredly, that God hath made that same Jesus, whom ye have crucified, both Lord and Christ&#8221; (Acts 2:36). When Peter made that declaration in the first gospel message, he was proclaiming that God had inaugurated a little man from Nazareth into the universal headship over all things. Let us exult that a man has been exalted to the throne, a man from a small country village in the despised district of Galilee. This Jesus has been made Head, not of just one country, but over all things.<h2 class=head1>HONORING THE HEAD</h2><p>Proper behavior in the house of God firstly means that above all else we honor the One whom God has exalted. It is God&#8217;s intention that there be no other head among His people. In the Old Testament economy there were kings who acted as head over the people of God. Not so in the New Testament.<p>Do you think that Peter was the leading Apostle? He may have been listed first when the Apostles&#8217; names were given, but a careful reading of the four Gospels will make plain that it was never the intent of the Lord Jesus to make Peter number one. Even though Peter&#8217;s natural disposition was to take the lead, the Lord was always making things hard for him. He may have been the first to jump out of the boat and into the water, but in the end he began to sink and was reproached for his little faith (Matt. 14:28-31). He may have been the first of the disciples to speak out on the mount of transfiguration, but even before he finished he was stopped by the Father&#8217;s voice from the cloud (17:4-5).<p>You have probably noticed that when the women went to the sepulchre after the resurrection, they were told, &#8220;Go your way, tell his disciples and Peter that he goeth before you into Galilee&#8221; (Mark 16:7). Surely you do not think that the little phrase &#8220;and Peter&#8221; means that Peter was first among the Apostles. If Peter was foremost, he was foremost in denying the Lord (14:66-72). No other disciple denied the Lord three times. This phrase &#8220;and Peter&#8221; was the Lord&#8217;s way of telling Peter he was forgiven and would be welcomed back.<p>Peter&#8217;s temporary role as leader in the Acts we have already discussed in Life Message Fifteen.<h2 class=head1>ORGANIZING</h2><p>The relationship among believers in the house of God again touches the headship of Christ. How should the church be &#8220;organized&#8221; (to borrow a word which does not really apply)? Throughout the twenty centuries of church history this problem has never been solved. Myriads of people are involved. On just one day three thousand were saved and brought into the church (Acts 2:41). Soon after, five thousand more were added (4:4). What could be done with so many people? In time there was not only the church in Jerusalem. There was a spread into Samaria, into Antioch, from there to Asia Minor, and then to eastern Europe. In the house of God there were not only believers, but also apostles, prophets, evangelists, and teachers. There were also elders, deacons, and deaconesses. How could all these interrelationships be worked out?<p>Most of you realize that there is no more need to organize the church than there is a need to organize the physical body. Who organized your two eyes? Why are your arms where they are? The church is organic, an entity of life. It is not many pieces, devoid of life, organized into a unit by human hands.<p>From the second century Christianity&#8217;s history has, alas, been one of organization. To impose such a structure on the church is an insult to the headship of Christ. Were your arms voted into place? Has your nose won an election? Could your arm be fired and a replacement hired?<p>Yet we still need to resolve how the thousands upon thousands in the church should be related. With saints scattered in different places and then coming together in their respective localities to be local churches, how could the practical matters be arranged and carried out? I have been told that seminaries offer a course on the way to organize a church. The &#8220;organization of the church&#8221; is surely not a term found in the New Testament.<p>Well, you may ask, what is wrong with organization? It is a basic principle that organization leads to hierarchy, a leadership having one rank subordinate to the next. This insults Christ&#8217;s headship.<p>The Catholic Church demonstrates this in its organizational setup. The papacy began with the recognition of Peter as the unique representative and successor of Christ. Peter was later called the first pope, and the subsequent popes were called the head of the church. What an affront to Christ! Then their local congregations have leaders responsible to a bishop who heads up a district. In the New Testament the word bishop means overseer (cf. 1 Tim. 3:1-2; Acts 20:28) and refers to the office or function of an elder. The Greek word for elder means an older person. The elder&#8217;s function is to oversee. Thus these two words, elder and bishop, refer to the same person. It was Ignatius who brought in the wrong teaching that a bishop is higher than an elder. Once the church accepted this teaching and set bishops over the elders, the hierarchy developed with archbishops over bishops and cardinals over archbishops. The cardinals select one of their number to be pope. This pyramid of rank-elder, bishop, archbishop, cardinal, and pope-is a contradiction and insult to Christ&#8217;s headship.<h2 class=head1>YOU ARE ALL BROTHERS</h2><p>Do you remember the request of the mother of the sons of Zebedee? She came seeking position for her two sons. It was on that occasion that the Lord told His disciples, &#8220;The rulers of the nations lord it over them, and the great exercise authority over them. It is not so among you; but whoever wants to become great among you shall be your servant, and whoever wants to be first among you shall be your slave&#8221; (Matt. 20:25-27). The one who wants to be great must be a slave. The Lord pursued this very subject further in chapter 23, when He said, &#8220;Do not be called Rabbi; for One is your Teacher, and you are all brothers. Neither be called leaders, because One is your Leader, the Christ. And the greater among you shall be your servant&#8221; (vv. 8, 10, 11).<p>The so-called Plymouth Brethren in their early days called themselves &#8220;brethren&#8221; because of this verse 8. They did not consider they had any leader among them. When brother George Muller came to the Lord&#8217;s table, he would always sit at the back.<p>The concept that we must have a leader influences us who are in the Lord&#8217;s recovery too. If even twenty of us come together, is not our first thought, who will be the leader? But the practice in our meetings does indicate some degree of a transformed mentality. When we meet together, one will call for a hymn, some others may pray, and then there may be a testimony or requests for more hymns. This is an indication that we are not waiting for someone to lead the meeting. It is surely an improvement over our days in Christianity, when we came into a church building Sunday morning and quietly took our seat, waiting for the leader to come and conduct the service.<p>For years I have been concerned about the elders&#8217; sitting in the first row. This practice was begun by me in order for the elders to have a way to confer about anything that might come up during the meeting. But I realize it may give a false impression that these are the leaders.<h2 class=head1>NO INTERMEDIARY</h2><p>To behave rightly in the house of God also requires that we receive our orders directly from Christ, without any intermediary. The toenails may be the farthest from the head positionally, yet their orders go directly to them from the head, just as do those of the shoulder, which is closer to the head in position. We may refuse the Catholic blasphemy about a &#8220;holy mother&#8221; between the believers and Jesus, yet in practice we may want another saint to advise us what course to take.<p>Suppose a young believer goes to an elder and asks him if it is all right to go to the movies. In one way it is good that this new believer does not trust himself and would check with another saint, but from another aspect it is wrong to let someone else act as a leader or go-between to make his decision. From the very first time the young believer comes for advice, that elder should instruct him, &#8220;I may be able to help you, but I am not the Lord. You may be young, but the Lord Jesus is within you, just as He is in me. Go and check with Him. Kneel down and pray for Him to guide you.&#8221; To counsel the young one in this way means that both are respecting Christ&#8217;s lordship. How offensive it would be to His headship if that elder should say, &#8220;Brother, because I love you, I want to tell you the truth. Now that you are saved, you should not go to the movies. Christians should never go to the movies. That is a damage to the Lord&#8217;s testimony. Do you understand, brother? You must not go.&#8221; Do you realize that for the elder to speak in this fashion is for him to take the Lord&#8217;s place? We must instruct others to go again and again to the Lord until they are clear. The house of God is the church of the living God. We are living members with the living God inside us. The proper way to behave in His house is to contact Him directly and to help others to do the same.<h2 class=head1>THE PILLAR AND BASE OF THE TRUTH</h2><p>Besides being called the house of the living God, the church is also called the pillar and base of the truth. Here Paul alluded to the Mediterranean architecture of his day. The ancient buildings were designed to be supported by strong pillars or columns, which were placed on a base. The pillars held up the whole structure. The church is both the base and the pillar that bears the truth. It is not the elders but the church-every member-that bears this responsibility. This is why it is important for you young people to be well built up in the church. You must realize that the meetings are not for your entertainment but for your edification, your building up, so that you will have the discernment of the truth and will resist any lie which may be brought in.<p>One reason the United States is so strong is because of the respect given to the Constitution. Even the president must conform to it. What other country could peacefully depose a president for his disregard of the law of the land? As the pillar and base of the truth, the church must exercise the same vigilance to see that no falsehood, no evil, and no hierarchy contradicting the headship of Christ, can be brought in. This is the responsibility of all the members.<p>The Epistle to the Philippians opens with this verse: &#8220;Paul and Timotheus, the servants of Jesus Christ, to all the saints in Christ Jesus which are at Philippi, with the bishops and deacons&#8221; (1:1). Please notice the little word &#8220;with.&#8221; It indicates that the church&#8217;s major component is the saints; the elders and deacons are like attachments. By the choice of word in this verse the Holy Spirit would further impress us that the headship is Christ&#8217;s alone. The responsibility to uphold the truth belongs to the whole church, not just to the elders or deacons.<p>This is a need in the church today. We must learn the truth and how to defend it. Otherwise, the church will have no future. All of us must bear responsibility to know and practice the truth.<p>These are the two main matters concerning our behavior in the house of God: respecting the headship of Christ and knowing, keeping, and defending the truth.<h1 class=msg>CHAPTER NINETEEN</h1><h1 class=msg>HOW TO BEHAVE IN THE HOUSE OF GOD</h1><h1 class=msg>(2)</h1><p>The two Epistles to Timothy were written when the church had become degraded. In such a time of confusion, Timothy needed these two letters on how to behave in the house of God. I would like us to focus our attention on four terms which recur throughout these two books.<p>The first is God&#8217;s economy, mentioned in 1 Timothy 1:4: &#8220;Neither give heed to fables and endless genealogies, which minister questions, rather than God&#8217;s economy [Gk.] which is in faith.&#8221;<h2 class=head1>GOD&#8217;S ECONOMY VS. DIFFERENT TEACHINGS</h2><p>Chapter one of 1 Timothy makes it clear that even while the Apostle Paul was still here on earth, different teachings had come into the church. The main teaching that Paul confronted came from ones &#8220;desiring to be teachers of the law&#8221; (1:7). The law, as we all realize, was scriptural; it had been given by God to Moses and had been taught for centuries during the Old Testament times. Nonetheless, it differs from the teaching of the gospel, God&#8217;s economy. Thus Paul wrote to Timothy in verse 3, &#8220;I besought thee to abide still at Ephesus, when I went into Macedonia, that thou mightest charge some not to teach differently&#8221; (Gk.).<p>The four Gospels present Christ from four different angles; the words and style of writing are different, but the ministry is the same. The Gospels are like four photographs of one person, all taken from a different side. Suppose, on the other hand, Peter had written a record of Moses. We would have to protest that he was speaking differently. He would have been speaking of Moses and the law, whereas Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John were speaking of Jesus Christ.<p>There are those who say that we in the Lord&#8217;s recovery do not accept the ministry of others. It is clear from Ephesians 4:11 and 12 that the gifted persons mentioned all had only one ministry, that of building up the Body of Christ. That there is only one ministry is confirmed in 2 Corinthians 4:1 and 1 Timothy 1:12. The one ministry does not imply that the apostles and prophets repeated each other&#8217;s words. The four Gospels are indeed different from each other, but only in that they present different aspects of the same thing. In this New Testament period God has raised up many gifted persons with varied functions, but all belong to the same ministry, that of ministering Christ for the church.<h2 class=head2>The Law</h2><p>Hebrews 1:1 and 2 tells us that God spoke to the fathers in the prophets in many portions and in many ways. But now &#8220;at the last of these days&#8221; He has &#8220;spoken to us in the Son.&#8221; God in the New Testament age speaks only in one Person. What, then, of Paul, Peter, and the other apostles? All the apostles, and we as well, are parts of the Son, members of His Body. When God spoke in the Old Testament, it was through the prophets in many separate speakings, because Moses, David, Isaiah, and Jeremiah were not in the Son. In this New Testament time the twelve Apostles, Paul and Barnabas, Martin Luther, Watchman Nee, and all of us have been constituted into the Son. Thus, when God speaks in this age through His servants, He is speaking in the Son.<h2 class=head2>Fables and Genealogies</h2><p>First Timothy 1 tells us that besides the teachers of the law, some were speaking &#8220;fables and endless genealogies, which minister questions&#8221; (v. 4). Besides the law, there were these two other categories of speaking differently. Let us say that for several years you have been listening to the word that the Triune God wants to dispense Himself into us, that all His riches are embodied in Christ, and that Christ today is the life-giving Spirit indwelling us. You have become bored with all this teaching. Now along comes a talented young speaker, whose messages are full of fascinating stories, or fables. He seems also to have a deep understanding of the Old Testament genealogies. Would you be attracted? This was the kind of speaking that was being heard in Ephesus.<p>Actually, there are only two categories of teachings. The fables and genealogies are part of the Old Testament things concerning the law; they are either tradition or opinion. The other category is the New Testament economy, Jesus Christ as life for the church.<h2 class=head2>Foot-washing</h2><p>Suppose a brother comes among us and begins to rebuke the churches in the recovery for their failure to practice foot-washing. The Lord Jesus Himself set us an example of this in John 13 and specifically told us that we ought to wash one another&#8217;s feet (v. 14). This is a New Testament teaching. Would you say this is part of God&#8217;s economy or that it is teaching differently? We can be sure that foot-washing, even though it is found in the New Testament, is not part of God&#8217;s economy because it ministers questions. Once we begin to consider foot-washing, we open the door to endless questions. Should brothers and sisters wash each other&#8217;s feet? Should the sisters&#8217; foot-washing be done openly in the hall or in private rooms? How frequently should it be done? The result of these questions which arise is that we are distracted from prayer and from contacting the Lord and begin to discuss all the varied opinions on the merits of foot-washing and how it should be practiced. I trust that you can see that even some New Testament matters are not part of God&#8217;s economy and may in fact damage it.<h2 class=head2>Wine or Grape Juice?</h2><p>Another brother, in his studies of the New Testament, may come to the conclusion that grape juice, not wine, should be used at the Lord&#8217;s table. Suppose, after the breaking of bread, he should give a message exhorting us to use grape juice instead of wine. Wine may encourage a weaker one to drink. Should we heed his exhortation? But he may scarcely finish speaking when another brother may stand up and say that grape juice was unknown in ancient times, that according to the word of the whole Bible, there was only wine. We could further add that the Lord, in Matthew 26:29, did not use the term wine but rather &#8220;the fruit of the vine.&#8221; Do you see the questions that are engendered by such talk? It does not minister life but rather causes disputations. Let us learn to avoid opinions and matters that would stir up others&#8217; opinions. Learn not to speak differently.<p>Avoid anything that might distract God&#8217;s people from His economy. The one ministry dispenses God into the believers that He may be their life, nature, and being. This chosen people form the Body of Christ, the church. Do not add to this central thought of God your concept or opinion. Do not refer to different flows among us; a flow is a concept. Do not think in terms of an old way and a new way. Concentrate on God&#8217;s economy.<h2 class=head1>THE TRUTH</h2><p>In a time of degradation in the church, it is important that all the saints know the truth. Thus this term is used more than ten times in these two Epistles. The church is the pillar and base of the truth (1 Tim. 3:15); as such, all of us must be clear about the truth of the headship of Christ. Is not that headship disregarded by organized Christianity? Several years ago I read a booklet by Dr. A. W. Tozer of the Christian and Missionary Alliance. Entitled &#8220;The Waning Authority of Christ in the Churches,&#8221; it discusses how little Christ and His authority are esteemed by the denominations and other Christian groups, though they pay lip service to the doctrine of His lordship.<p>Among us these past few years there have been indications that we too do not see the significance of Christ&#8217;s headship. An effort was made to organize all the churches in the recovery under an international coordination. It may seem wonderful to have such &#8220;oneness,&#8221; but actually this was a subtlety to gain control of all the churches, thus taking the headship away from Christ and putting it in the hands of the &#8220;coordinator,&#8221; who in essence would be a pope. Such a hierarchical setup robs the saints of their personal contact with God.<h2 class=head2>Distinguishing Truth from Doctrines</h2><p>In the universe God is the one reality. Whatever is related to God is reality or truth. Doctrines, in contrast, are teachings. Consider the Lord&#8217;s table, for example. Who is qualified to participate? Should there be grape juice or wine? one cup or many small cups? leavened or unleavened bread? one loaf or small cut pieces? How often should the Lord&#8217;s table be held? Who should distribute the bread and the cup? All such questions are doctrinal and do not touch the reality. The truth of the Lord&#8217;s table is that it represents the Head and the Body. The blood in separation from the body displays Christ&#8217;s death. The loaf of many grains of fine flour speaks of a body in resurrection. The truth of the Lord&#8217;s table, then, is the reality of the Head, in death and resurrection, and the Body.<p>Baptism provides another illustration of doctrines versus truth. Who should be baptized? Who should baptize? In whose name are we baptized? By immersion or sprinkling? Once or three times? In salt water or fresh? Outdoors or in a baptistry? These questions concern the doctrine. The truth of baptism concerns the death and resurrection of Christ. &#8220;As many as have been baptized into Christ Jesus have been baptized into His death&#8221; (Rom. 6:3). Shallow, shortsighted people do not look beyond the doctrines to see the truths within those doctrines.<p>If we think that a church needs elders because that is the way it is set up in the Scriptures, we are in the realm of doctrine. The truth behind this doctrine is that the plurality of elders indicates that God&#8217;s people have no official, organized, permanent leadership because Christ is the only Head recognized by God.<p>A strong and healthy church depends upon all the saints&#8217; knowing the truth. Doctrines confuse and bring in opinions, but truth consolidates and builds people together. Whether we use wine or grape juice is not crucial, but caring for the truth of the death and resurrection of Christ and seeing that the one loaf signifies one Body are a safeguard against any divisive thought. Arguing about sprinkling or immersion divides us, but being in the reality of the death of Christ unites us. If our concern when we baptize new believers is that we are putting them into the death of Christ, we shall all be in a prayerful spirit that this may be their reality.<h2 class=head1>GODLINESS</h2><p>&#8220;Great is the mystery of godliness&#8221; (1 Tim. 3:16). This is the third term we shall consider. It is clear from this verse that godliness is God manifested in the flesh. When the church is in a time of degradation, we need to pay special heed to godliness.<p>Notice the sequence of the phrases in this verse: &#8220;And without controversy great is the mystery of godliness: God was manifest in the flesh, justified in the Spirit, seen of angels, preached unto the Gentiles, believed on in the world, received up into glory.&#8221; Many Christian teachers have thought this verse referred to Christ, but the sequence of these phrases does not bear this out. Christ was &#8220;received up into glory&#8221; before He was &#8220;preached unto the Gentiles.&#8221; This verse refers more to the church than it does to Christ. &#8220;Received up into glory&#8221; refers to the rapture of the church rather than to Christ&#8217;s ascension. Yes, Christ is the manifestation of God in the flesh, but so is the church. We are the church, but we are still in the flesh. When we meet together in the Spirit, God is manifested among us; this is the manifestation of God in the flesh. Just as Christ the Head is the manifestation of God in the flesh, so also is His Body. If the whole church is gathered together in a proper way and an unbeliever comes in, &#8220;falling down on his face he will worship God, and report that God is in you of a truth&#8221; (1 Cor. 14:23-25). God&#8217;s presence is known whenever the church meets together properly.<p>Paul exhorted Timothy to pray for those &#8220;that are in authority; that we may lead a quiet and peaceable life in all godliness and honesty&#8221; (1 Tim. 2:2). What evidence is there in our lives of godliness? This verse says &#8220;all godliness.&#8221; If we are godly, it will affect the choice of pictures we hang in our bedroom, the kind of clothes we wear, our hair style, and our conversation. It will make us clear about whether to go to the movies. The inward life of godliness has an outward expression; such a manifestation of godliness is a testimony and has an impact on those who meet us. Whatever we say, whatever we do, whatever we wear, there should be an impression of God manifested in us.<p>Another reference to godliness is found in 1 Timothy 4:7-8: &#8220;Exercise thyself rather unto godliness; for bodily exercise profiteth little; but godliness is profitable unto all things, having promise of the life that now is, and of that which is to come.&#8221; There is some profit in physical exercise; this verse does not say it profits nothing. Exercise benefits our health. However, when we consider sports, it is apparent that we are outside the field of health and into the realm of showing off how capable and skillful we are.<p>How can we exercise ourselves unto godliness? One way is to show the proper reverence when we are reading the Bible. Even if no one else is present, it is good to be properly dressed and to sit or kneel in a respectful way when we come to the Word of our heavenly Father.<p>Another way to exercise ourselves unto godliness is to be restricted in our talk. Nothing has more of an impact upon others than our way of talking. Even in the home our talk should be accurate, restrained, and free of gossip. Sometimes shouting in the meeting may be overstepping the line between godliness and looseness. What we say should give an impression of restraint.<p>Shopping is another area in which we can practice godliness. Even window-shopping can lead to indulgence in lust; many times we must turn our eyes away. What we buy shows others the kind of person we are.<p>Letter writing is also a way to exercise ourselves unto godliness. On many occasions I have re-written a letter three, even four, times because when I read it over I would find something not accurate or not helpful. By our restraint in passing on church news, for example, we can show our care for the edification of others.<h2 class=head1>HEALTHY WORDS</h2><p>The last term for us to consider is &#8220;healthy words,&#8221; found in 1 Timothy 6:3, Gk. The term healthy is another word which recurs throughout the two Epistles to Timothy and in Titus as well; it is usually translated &#8220;sound&#8221; (cf. 1 Tim. 1:10; 2 Tim. 1:13; 4:3; Titus 1:9, 13; 2:1, 2, 8). In the church life we must discern the speaking to see whether it is healthy or damaging. We must not be misled by enticing words, however eloquent. Healthy means that the words minister life. We may not know very much, but our taste can distinguish what is sweet, what is bitter, what is poisonous, and what is healthy. We need to examine our own words too to see that they are healthy, ministering life to those who hear us, whether we are speaking on the phone or face-to-face.<p>In a time of degradation, then, we must be centered on God&#8217;s economy and not be distracted by those who teach differently. As the pillar and base of the truth, we must know the truth and not be distracted by doctrines. We must exercise ourselves unto godliness. Finally, our behavior in the house of God includes discerning and receiving, as well as ministering, &#8220;healthy words.&#8221;<h1 class=msg>CHAPTER TWENTY</h1><h1 class=msg>WALK IN CHRIST</h1><p>&#8220;As ye have therefore received Christ Jesus the Lord, so walk ye in him: Rooted and built up in him, and stablished in the faith, as ye have been taught, abounding therein with thanksgiving&#8221; (Col. 2:6-7). Have you received Christ? If so, how did you receive Him? You opened to Him, repented and confessed your sins, and asked Him to come in. He came into your spirit (2 Tim. 4:22), not into your heart, though you may have sung that well-known chorus, &#8220;Into My Heart.&#8221; From your spirit, the center of your being, Christ is spreading into the surrounding parts-mind, emotion, will, and conscience-which make up your heart.<p>For this cause Paul prayed &#8220;That Christ may make His home in your hearts through faith&#8221; (Eph. 3:17). Christ is like a guest invited into your home. When He first comes, He stays in the living room (your spirit). After some time you may invite Him into the bedroom, the inner chamber (your heart), and ask Him to make Himself at home. Have you invited the Lord Jesus into the inner chamber of your heart yet? When Christ has spread into all the inward parts around our spirit, He will then have made His home in our hearts. We shall consider how to walk in Him after answering some questions.<h2 class=head1>QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS</h2><p><I>I feel as if I am living two lives, one at work and the other outside of my job. From the moment I walk into the office I am so busy that I seem to miss the Lord every day. How can I lay hold of Him in the midst of all that I have to do?</I><p>It is the Devil&#8217;s subtlety to take some fact of our living to deceive us. His way is to tell a lie by speaking the truth. What he says is apparently true, but his intention is to lie to us. First, you should declare to him and to the whole universe that you will walk by one life, not by two.<p>Second, every day the first thing you should do is to take five, ten, or fifteen minutes to worship the Lord and to contact Him. Tell Him, &#8220;Lord, here is another day for me to live You. Be with me; sustain and strengthen me. Hold me in Your hand. Even though I neglect You every day, You never forget me. I have no trust in my faithfulness; I put my trust solely in You.&#8221; Even during the day, whenever you have time, pray the same way: &#8220;Lord, be with me. I cannot make it to live You out on my own, but You can live Yourself out of me.&#8221;<p>Don&#8217;t wonder how things will work out. We as Christians have too many considerations, stemming from our background and environment. Deny these considerations; they are just frustrations and distractions. Don&#8217;t believe them. We believe only in the living God. Our trust is in Him. We don&#8217;t make preparations and schedules as to what we should do to overcome some situation. We have no expectations and no plan, only the living Lord.<p>All day, starting from first thing in the morning, contact Him, asking Him to sustain you. Just see what happens. Don&#8217;t worry about tomorrow. Don&#8217;t be preoccupied in the meeting, thinking how wonderful the message is but what will you do when you get to the office tomorrow. Just live today. Don&#8217;t borrow tomorrow; you don&#8217;t have it! Every day is today; tomorrow never comes. The Devil would have us worry about tomorrow. As you hear a message, just rejoice and praise the Lord. He is so simple, so real, and so living. If you ask, What about the next hour? I say there is no next hour. Every hour to us is the present one.<p><I>I&#8217;m new in the church and still very much under the influence of Christianity. When I was studying to be a preacher of the gospel in an organization, it was drilled into me that I had to have a burden for souls. I would feel guilty if I didn&#8217;t say something about the Lord to every one I met on the street, or at least give him a tract. We have to fulfill the Great Commission, &#8220;Go ye and teach all nations&#8221; (Matt. 28:19), but can I go without being sent (Rom. 10:14-15)?</I><p>Drop all these complications, even though they are based upon the Scriptures. Come back to the simplicity of Christ. Enjoy Him day by day. Live Him, grow Him, and produce Him. He will lead us on.<p>Let me give you my personal testimony. I was saved in 1925. I had a heart of love for the Lord and for His Word. After seven and a half years the Lord raised up a church in my home town, mainly through me. I had no plan. The Lord sent people to me. News was spread about the meeting, and people came and were attracted. They realized Christ was there. In less than one year the number went from two to about one hundred.<p>Our leading from the Lord was to be His testimony in China. We had no intention to come to the Western world to spread His recovery throughout the whole world. However, when the time came, the Lord scattered us and I was sent to this country. Is it not ironic that a Chinese from a heathen country should be sent by the Lord to this most advanced country where Christianity has held sway for so many years? This was surely not by my design. Yet the Lord&#8217;s recovery has spread, not only throughout the United States, but also to Europe, South America, Africa, and Australasia.<p>This is a strong testimony that if we love the Lord, contact Him, live Him, and grow Him, He will spread Himself through us. We are branches of the vine, branching out the very Christ, not by our plans or activities, but just by our living. This is the way of life.<p><I>How can I know the Lord&#8217;s leading in the matter of preaching the gospel? I often have the feeling when I&#8217;m alone with someone that I should say something to him about the Lord, but on the other hand I feel ridiculous approaching total strangers.</I><p>Here is another case of one of the Lord&#8217;s seekers having become complicated either by Christianity or by himself. To get out of this entanglement, drop all your consideration. In a simple way contact the Lord and live Him day by day. It may be that, as you spontaneously seek His leading, you will have a burden to say a word to someone concerning the Lord; if so, do it. Another time the Lord may bring someone to you. Then, just speak according to your inner sense. Don&#8217;t analyze. Don&#8217;t make a decision that from now on you will speak to a certain number of people every day. Don&#8217;t decide to speak to someone at work about the Lord. Just abide in Him. The Lord may lead you to someone or may lead someone to you. You can then spontaneously say something. Be delivered from your endeavoring and striving. The Christian life is an easy yoke, a pleasant burden. Consider the clusters of grapes on a vine. Without any decision, schedule, or plan, these clusters come forth, according to the inner life of the branches. As the inner life grows, the clusters spontaneously appear.<p>Be at peace and rest in the Lord. Whatever comes to you as a problem, reject. The Lord does not send complications, but only life, peace, and rest.<h2 class=head1>HOW TO WALK IN CHRIST</h2><p>The verse we quoted (Col. 2:6) exhorts us to walk in Christ in the same way that we received Him. We need to be clear that Christ today is not just far away in the third heaven; He is now also the life-giving Spirit (1 Cor. 15:45, Gk.), residing in our spirit. First Corinthians 6:17 tells us further that &#8220;he that is joined unto the Lord is one spirit.&#8221; These two spirits- Christ, the life-giving Spirit, and our human spirit-are one spirit. To walk in Christ is to walk in this mingled spirit. It is a matter of heeding His life within us, not of receiving instruction on how to pray, how to preach the gospel, how to honor our parents, or how to submit to our husband or love our wife.<p>More than fifty years ago in far-off China the Lord granted us His gracious visitation to see that His real salvation is not a way but a living Person. When He comes into us to be our life, He is everything else we need as well-holiness, righteousness, humility, love, kindness, patience, endurance, and faithfulness. The day we saw the vision that everything we need is in this One marked the end of all our ways. He is God&#8217;s way (cf. John 14:6).<p>There is no need for us to strive or endeavor. Walk in Christ. In Him are both God and man; in Him dwells all the fullness of God. Because this all-inclusive One is in our spirit, we can walk in Him.<h2 class=head1>A DAILY PATTERN</h2><p>Every morning, as soon as we get up, we should turn to the Lord and say, &#8220;Lord, thank You for another day that I may live You. Remind me this whole day to reject myself, not to trust in myself, and not to live by myself. Strengthen me to live by You. Make this a day for me to live You out, taking You as my everything, abiding in You as a branch in the vine.&#8221; All during the day this should be our prayer. Do not spend time praying so much for your job, your children, or your being kept from car accidents. The Lord takes care of all things. Just concern yourself with this one matter of walking in Him.<p>Because it is so easy to slip out of Christ and revert to living in ourselves, doing things by ourselves, saying things in ourselves, or loving others by ourselves, Paul exhorts us to &#8220;work out your own salvation with fear and trembling&#8221; (Phil. 2:12). We need to be saved daily, even hourly, from anything outside of Christ. We must be in fear and trembling to work out our instant salvation, lest we say a word outside of Him, answer a question apart from Him, or react in our feelings rather than in Him.<h2 class=head1>THE WAY TO PREACH THE GOSPEL</h2><p>The way to preach the gospel is to walk in Christ. Such a statement may seem abstract, because we are used to finding ways, or planning activities, to get things accomplished. Some of us may think that the way to preach the gospel is to use musical instruments or to have a quartet sing some gospel songs. There is also the way of eloquence, having a talented speaker give an entertaining message. It has even been said among us that the way to gain people is to go where they are; I have heard of some going to movies, bars, and ballet dances for the purpose of &#8220;catching fish.&#8221; All such proposals are ways. They are devoid of Christ.<p>To preach the gospel you must have Christ as your daily living. This living cannot fail to impress those who know you-your relatives, friends, classmates, colleagues, and others whom you see in the normal course of your day. It may be that during a year&#8217;s time, the Lord will move in the heart of one of them by means of some circumstance, and that one will be constrained to talk with you. With little effort on your part, perhaps just your suggestion that you pray together, that person will be saved. The next year there may be a colleague at the office who gets injured in a car accident; while he is hospitalized, he may recall your manner of life and send for you to come and talk with him. With few words, just a short prayer, he too may be saved. The following year still another may follow.<p>Because we live Christ, He is the way we preach the gospel. Do not have the opinion that this is a slow way to get the increase. If just one is saved per year through each of us, there will be a one hundred per cent increase. Further, those who are saved in this way will become the remaining fruit. Such will not be the case with those who are brought in through the use of gimmicks; most of them will not stay.<p>Surely the Lord was referring to our manner of life when He said, &#8220;Ye shall be witnesses unto Me&#8221; (Acts 1:8). We live as a witness, a testimony, to Him; this testimony will gradually bring others whom we know to know Him also.<p>This is not to say that the church should not have a regular gospel preaching time. Every so often a Saturday night, for example, can be set aside for this. Then we can pray to seek the Lord&#8217;s leading as to whom we should bring. Each of us may then bring in one or two. This is the proper preaching of the gospel with Christ as the way.<h2 class=head1>THE WAY TO PRAY</h2><p>Not only in preaching the gospel but in everything else as well, we have no way but Christ. We may never have learned how to pray, but because we do know how to walk in Christ, we shall find that spontaneously, throughout the day, we are praying. Christ is our way to pray. Because we are one with Him, we walk in Him and find ourselves praying.<h2 class=head1>THE WAY TO BE HUMBLE</h2><p>Learning how to be humble avails nothing. Any humility you learn becomes your pride. You may think you are the most humble one in your family, that all your brothers and sisters are proud and stubborn. This humility that you have developed is pride. The name for the proper humility is Christ. If you walk in Christ day after day, you will be humble without any consciousness of it. By walking in Him, He will become your humility, though you will not be aware of it.<h2 class=head1>THE WAY TO LOVE</h2><p>Just as you should not try to be humble, so there is no point in your trying to love others. All your efforts to love your wife, to be submissive to your husband, to control your temper, and to be kind are in vain. Just walk in Christ, who is the life-giving Spirit dwelling in your spirit. When you arise in the morning, pray-read His Word and talk to Him. This will usher you into a walk with Him. Do not heed your emotions, your decisions, or what others are saying. Just walk in Christ, and you will find that He Himself is the love you need toward others.<h2 class=head1>EFFECT ON THE MEETINGS</h2><p>If we begin our day with contacting the Lord, and continue walking in Him throughout the day, we shall have rich experiences of Him to bring to the meetings. Then when there is a need to share a certain aspect of the experience of Christ, we shall be able to give a testimony along that line. The riches we accumulate benefit the whole church.<p>The normal Christian life is to walk in Christ. By walking in Him we shall be rooted and built up.<h1 class=msg>CHAPTER TWENTY-ONE</h1><h1 class=msg>THE LAW OF LIBERTY</h1><p>&#8220;For you are not under law but under grace&#8221; (Rom. 6:14). Do you believe that grace makes you lawless? Such a teaching comes into the church in a time of degradation, when some will turn &#8220;the grace of our God into lascivious-ness&#8221; (Jude 4). When the Scripture says that we are not under law, it is referring to the law given by Moses; it is plain that we are not under that law. Do you conclude from this that God has no law toward His people today? In the new covenant the Lord says, &#8220;I will put My laws upon their hearts and upon their minds I will inscribe them&#8221; (Heb. 10:16). It may have been possible under the old covenant to disregard the two tablets of stone containing the ten commandments, but with laws that have been written on our hearts we have no way to be rid of them or to neglect them.<p>Which do you think is more strict-the law of Moses or the law of the New Testament? The law written on our hearts is more binding by far. In James 1:25 and 2:12 this subjective law is called &#8220;the law of liberty.&#8221; Let us answer a few questions before we consider this law further.<h2 class=head1>QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS</h2><p><I>In the past the emphasis in the churches has been on Christ, the spirit, life, and the church. You have said that the aspect of truth has been somewhat neglected. Since Christ is the truth, how is it possible that we have neglected the truth?</I><p>We did have some measure of truth concerning Christ, the spirit, life, and the church. However, we did not stress, for example, the headship of Christ nor the constitution of the church. A good many truths in the Word we have not adequately covered; the saints were not sufficiently encouraged to study the Bible and have all these truths infused into them. Now the churches need to help the saints to get into the depths of the Word by studying and pray-reading for the understanding of the truth of all the doctrines.<p><I>In my early history with the Lord, I would sense when I sought His presence that He strengthened me and was abiding in me. In these recent years it&#8217;s been rare that I have had that sense. Should I seek such a feeling?</I><p>When you want to contact the Lord, it is easier not to wait for some sense within. If you wait, you open the door for distracting thoughts to come in and disturb you. Before you kneel to pray, or before you open the Bible, begin right away to speak. You can just say something simple, like &#8220;Lord, I praise You.&#8221; After one or two sentences you will be ushered by your speaking into the presence of God.<p>We Christians must be a speaking people, addressing not only God, but also angels, demons, and even the atmosphere. If we come into the meeting and just sit there without speaking, the atmosphere will be full of death. Speaking something from our spirit repels all the distractions and brings us into touch with the Lord.<p><I>I am finding it hard to turn to the Word during the day. When I remember what you said about the killing element, I don&#8217;t want to pick up the Bible for fear of being killed, so I just go off to lunch. I know if I open to the Word I&#8217;ll also get the nourishment, but I sometimes feel too weak to do so. Maybe it&#8217;s the legality of it that makes me resistant.</I><p>However busy we are, we always find time to eat. Why is this? It is because we recognize that eating is a necessity of life. We need this same realization regarding our spiritual eating. Pray for the Lord to help you read His Word every day, even two or three times a day. Where there is a will, there is a way. We just need the realization that taking in the Word is a life necessity. If we build up this habit, we shall find that our Christian life will be transformed. Coming to the meetings is good; listening to the messages is good; but the reading, studying, and eating of the Bible is a life necessity. Trust the Lord that you may be enabled to do this in a regular way.<p><I>Sometimes when I want to share something in the meeting, I&#8217;m not sure if it is from my spirit or from my soul.</I><p>If you release it in the spirit, it is something in the spirit. If you keep it within you, it may become something in the soul. It is not necessary to analyze that way. It is better to exercise your spirit to release what you want to share than to keep it within.<p><I>Is there any way to share the truth without getting into arguments?</I><p>Arguments lead nowhere. Especially with our relatives, we must avoid arguing about doctrine. If they raise a doctrinal point, we can steer away from it and give instead a testimony of our experience of Christ. Let them know how joyful our life is. Our relatives not only need such a verbal testimony from us; they also need to see such a testimony lived before them. This living has the strongest impact. We need much more experience of Christ daily. This will make our testimony brighter and will influence our relatives, as well as others, to take this way.<p><I>What should we pray for? Last year in college I prayed nearly every day for fifteen people; it was an exhausting labor. The other brothers and sisters were praying for the same people, but none of them has been added.</I><p>The best way to pray is according to John 15:7: &#8220;If you abide in Me and My words abide in you, ask whatever you will, and it shall come to pass to you.&#8221; The way to pray is to abide in the Lord, remain in Him, and be one with Him. Then our praying will not be according to our preference, but according to His Word. When we abide in Him and His Word abides in us, we have His abiding Word to pray about. Then, as we open to Him, He moves within us, and we pray whatever we sense within.<p>It is hard to tell you what to pray. Just contact the Lord and be one with Him. Once you have taken His words into you and are actually one with Him and He with you, there will be a consciousness deep within you. Pray according to that sense.<p>Many times, as we begin to utter the words of prayer, more of a sense will come. The inner sense becomes our prayer uttered in words. If you still have a burden to pray for many things, don&#8217;t adjust yourself. Be simple, not bothered by any way. Go to the Lord, contact Him, and, as He leads you, utter the words according to your inner sense. If, at the same time, you still have a burden to pray for certain people, for certain situations, for the church, or for the Lord&#8217;s recovery, just utter that burden. Don&#8217;t analyze whether your burden was initiated by you or by the Lord. Be simple.<p>Pray until you have an inner restraint, telling you not to pray for a certain matter. If you have no such restraint, feel free to pray according to your burden. Do not pick up something as your burden. Praying is just coming to the Lord and then uttering the prayer according to the sense He gives you.<h2 class=head1>A LAW OF BONDAGE</h2><p>While the New Testament refers to the law of liberty, Mosaic law was really a law of bondage. As soon as we are given a law, we find that we cannot keep it (see Rom. 7:7-9). A missionary in China preached to his cook that we are all sinners. When the cook protested that he was a good man and had never sinned, the missionary began to talk to him about a horse. The cook needed a new horse, and the missionary&#8217;s description of the horse aroused in the cook longings to have such an excellent one. Thoughts about how he could get the horse for himself began to fill the cook&#8217;s mind. On a subsequent occasion the missionary again broached the subject that we are all sinners. Again the cook denied that he had ever done anything sinful. The missionary then asked him what had been occupying his thoughts since their previous conversation. The cook replied, &#8220;Well, I&#8217;ve been thinking about that horse. It sounded like such a good one, I&#8217;ve been wondering how I could get it.&#8221; The missionary then called to his attention what such thoughts indicated, and the cook was forced to admit they were signs of covetousness. This, the missionary then pointed out, was a sin (Exo. 20:17). Who can keep the law of Moses? It is impossible; it is a law of bondage.<h2 class=head1>LAWS UPON OUR HEARTS</h2><p>The New Testament law, written upon our hearts, liberates us. &#8220;For the law of the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus has freed me from the law of sin and of death&#8221; (Rom. 8:2). We are not under the law of bondage but the law of liberty.<p>How does this law liberate us? Suppose you loved to go to the movies. Sometimes you would even lie to your mother, telling her you were going to the library when actually you were sneaking off to the movies. Upon your return home, if she asked you what you had been studying in the library, you would invent a little story for her. Your love for the movies caused you to tell two lies, lies that one day will be judged by God. This may have happened many times. It indicates that you were under the bondage of movies.<p>How does this law of liberty operate to set you free? Before you were saved, you may have felt proud of yourself for getting away with such deceit. But once you are saved, your feelings are different. There will be something within bothering you; you will feel disturbed both for going to the movies and also for deceiving your mother. Even if you do not heed your new inner feelings, this law is patient. Time after time you will feel troubled when you go to the movies or lie to your mother. Eventually you will be subdued by this bothering element within you. The law within thus becomes the law of liberty, freeing you from the bondage of movies.<p>Sometimes we testify to others that we have had peace since we became a Christian. Actually, instead of having peace, many times we are bothered. This bothering One is persistent. He may keep after us for several years until He finally subdues us. We cannot persuade Him to look at things our way. Sooner or later, in His patient, gentle way, He will win.<p>I know many of you have been influenced to go to movies or to drink, under the guise of being liberated. As your testimonies have shown, you may have seemed outwardly liberated, but within there was a protest. Such a feeling shows the functioning of the law written upon your heart. No matter how much you say you are liberated from all bondage, you cannot be liberated from the inner law written upon your heart. Whenever you do something against God and this living law within, you will have the sense that you are not right. It is only by regarding this sense that you are brought into liberty.<h2 class=head1>A STRICTER LAW</h2><p>Before we were saved, we were lawless. But after we are saved, God&#8217;s law is written on our hearts and we are &#8220;not without law to God, but under the law to Christ&#8221; (1 Cor. 9:21). The new law in the New Testament is called the law of liberty or the law of Christ.<p>This law is stricter than Moses&#8217;. It binds us even in minor points. It requires not only telling the truth but also being accurate. It will condemn us for feeling proud even when no one can see any evidence of pride.<p>This new law has far more commandments than ten. Let us mention just a few. Repent! Be baptized! Pray unceasingly! Rejoice! Be burning in spirit! Love one another! Be transformed by the renewing of the mind! Flee youthful lusts! If you will turn the pages of your New Testament, you will find commandment after commandment.<p>We are told to &#8220;be careful [anxious] for nothing&#8221; (Phil. 4:6). How hard it is not to worry! This is especially true of parents in their concern for their children. I recall how my mother worried about her second daughter, my sister, who was teaching in another province, some eight hundred miles away. One morning my mother was nearly weeping. When I asked her what was the matter, she reproached me for not caring for my sister and pointed out that we had not heard from her for four weeks. The previous night she had dreamed that my sister was very ill. Though I tried to encourage her to eat breakfast and not pay any attention to a dream, she kept reproving me that I didn&#8217;t care about my sister. The more I tried to set her mind at rest, the more annoyed she became with me. Finally she said, &#8220;What makes you so dull? Why don&#8217;t you go out and send a telegram for me?&#8221; Of course, I hurried to do her bidding. The return telegram came later that day, saying all was well.<p>You can see how prone we are to worry. But the Bible says, &#8220;Be anxious for nothing.&#8221;<h2 class=head1>LIBERATED BY BEING UNDER LAW</h2><p>Christians are the most lawful people. In eating, drinking, wearing apparel, and lodging we are lawful. In everything we are under the commandments of the New Testament. The more we keep the new law, the law of liberty, the more we shall be truly liberated, not unto lawlessness, but from the bondage of doing sinful things.<h1 class=msg>CHAPTER TWENTY-TWO</h1><h1 class=msg>HOW TO BEHAVE IN THE HOUSE OF GOD</h1><h1 class=msg>(3)</h1><p>There are two descriptions of the church found in 1 Timothy which are not found elsewhere in the Bible. Only in this Epistle is the church called &#8220;the church of the living God&#8221; and &#8220;the pillar and base of the truth&#8221; (3:15).<h2 class=head1>THE LIVING GOD</h2><p>For us to behave properly in the house of God, we need to take note that it is the church of the living God. God is called the living God several times in the Old Testament (Deut. 5:26; Josh. 3:10; 1 Sam. 17:26, 36; 2 Kings 19:4, 16; Psa. 42:2; 84:2; Isa. 37:4, 17; Jer. 10:10; 23:36; Dan. 6:20, 26; Hosea 1:10). He is also referred to by this title in nine books of the New Testament (Matt. 16:16; 26:63; John 6:69; Acts 14:15; Rom. 9:26; 2 Cor. 3:3; 6:16; 1 Thes. 1:9; 1 Tim. 3:15; 4:10; Heb. 3:12; 9:14; 10:31; 12:22; Rev. 7:2). When Peter recognized who Christ was, he called Him &#8220;the Christ, the Son of the living God.&#8221; In Hebrews 3 we are exhorted not to withdraw &#8220;from the living God,&#8221; and in chapter nine we are told that the blood of Christ purifies &#8220;our conscience from dead works to serve the living God.&#8221;<h2 class=head1>THE HOUSE AND THE PILLAR</h2><p>In 1 Timothy 3:15 the church is also referred to as &#8220;the house of God.&#8221; The term house means household or family, as well as the lodging place of the family. Thus in the Bible the house of God means both His family and His dwelling place, because God&#8217;s dwelling place is within His people, not in a physical building. &#8220;House of God&#8221; is also used in 1 Peter 4:17 (&#8220;Judgment must begin at the house of God&#8221;) and in Hebrews 10:21 (&#8220;Having a great Priest over the house of God&#8221;).<p>The church is also called the pillar and base of the truth. The temple in the Old Testament had two pillars in front (1 Kings 7:15-22). Standing on their base, they bore the weight of the building. The Apostle Paul considered that the church was not only a house in which the living God dwelt but also a pillar standing upon its base bearing the truth.<p>Many Christians think of the church as merely a gathering of God&#8217;s called ones. From the names given to the church in 1 Timothy we can see that the church is also a house where the living God dwells and a pillar which supports the truth (reality). Both a house and a pillar need to be built.<p>It will help us to know how to behave in the house of God if we consider these two words, &#8220;living&#8221; and &#8220;truth.&#8221;<h2 class=head1>LIVING</h2><p>For us to match our living God, we too must be living. Suppose you came into a house and found everything in disarray. The tables were turned upside down, dirty socks were scattered around, shoes were in the sink, and the chairs were knocked over. You concluded that the people were either dead or kidnapped, but when you checked in the bedroom, there they were in bed sick. Sickness or death are the only excuse for such a disorderly house.<p>How is the house of a healthy family? Everything is clean, neat, and orderly. If you entered such a house, you would be assured that the members of that household were living and healthy.<p>What signs of life should characterize the church of the living God? Consider how the living God affected the lives of Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego. When the evil power of darkness tried to force them to worship idols, they boldly declared to Nebuchadnezzar, &#8220;Our God whom we serve is able to deliver us from the burning fiery furnace, and he will deliver us out of thine hand, O king. But if not, be it known unto thee, O king, that we will not serve thy gods, nor worship the golden image which thou hast set up&#8221; (Dan. 3:17-18). This same, living behavior also characterized Daniel when he was confronted with a den of lions for praying to his God. That is why the king called him the &#8220;servant of the living God&#8221; and proclaimed that &#8220;the God of Daniel...is the living God&#8221; (6:20, 26).<p>As the Lord&#8217;s recovery spreads throughout this earth, the door is open for all sorts of people to enter. Paul warned the elders of the church in Ephesus, &#8220;After my departing shall grievous wolves enter in among you, not sparing the flock. Also of your own selves shall men arise, speaking perverse things, to draw away disciples after them. Therefore watch&#8221; (Acts 20:29-31). This responsibility for watching to see that the house is kept in order falls upon every one of us, young and old. The Lord is not only adding His life to us, but also making us living. This phrase, &#8220;the church of the living God,&#8221; was used during a time of degradation in the church, just because most Christians were not living, but sleeping. The Lord&#8217;s recovery must not be like sleeping Christianity. Our God is living! We are His living children. In His house we must behave in a living way. We must be on the alert to guard it from all evil.<h2 class=head1>TRUTH</h2><p>Truth is contrasted to law in John 1:17. The law was given by Moses, but truth came through Jesus Christ. The Old Testament is divided into two parts, the law and the prophets (cf. Matt. 7:12; Rom. 3:21). What we find in the Old Testament can be likened to a photograph, or a picture, of the truth. It is as though I were to send you a photograph of myself before I came to visit. In the New Testament the truth, or the reality, came through Jesus Christ, who Himself told us, &#8220;I am the truth&#8221; (John 14:6). The law was a shadow, but He is the reality.<h2 class=head2>Christ the Reality</h2><p>For the church to be the pillar and base of the truth, it must bear Christ as the reality. Man in Genesis 1 is a shadow of the image of God; the reality of His image is Christ (Col. 1:15). All the offerings mentioned in Leviticus are types; the real offering is Christ (Heb. 10:11-12). The same is true of all the other positive things mentioned in the Old Testament; Christ is their reality. This is also the case with qualities like love and humility; their reality is Christ. The human expression of them is just a shadow. The church is the pillar to support Christ alone as the reality.<h2 class=head2>Beyond Doctrine</h2><p>&#8220;God our Saviour...will have all men to be saved, and to come unto the knowledge of the truth&#8221; (1 Tim. 2:3-4). It is not that God wants us acquainted with doctrines. Doctrines are like shells; the truth is the content. Behind the doctrine of foot-washing, for example, there is a truth. The truth is Christ Himself. If I wash my brother&#8217;s feet by myself, in myself, it means nothing. I have been crucified with Christ and no longer live; Christ lives in me. Thus, when I come to wash my brother&#8217;s feet, it is not I but Christ who is doing the washing. I actually had this experience over forty years ago. I found I could not wash another&#8217;s feet; I had to have Christ as my life in order to do it.<p>For us to come to the knowledge of the truth, we cannot stay in doctrine. Even the doctrine of salvation comes short. My mother was baptized as a teen-ager, yet she was not saved even when I became a Christian. She raised all her children in Christianity, teaching us Bible stories and insisting that we attend Southern Baptist Sunday morning services. We were all in Christianity, knowing the doctrine but not being in the truth. One day my second sister lost her fianc&#233;. In her grief she turned to the Lord and got saved. Then she prayed for me, and I too got saved. I began to love and study the Bible. This influenced my younger brother, who was fifteen; he began to read the Bible in English, and he too opened to the Lord. A few years later my mother got saved. We all turned from the doctrine of salvation to its reality.<h2 class=head2>The Need in a Time of Degradation</h2><p>These two Epistles contain eleven references to the truth (1 Tim. 2:4, 7; 3:15; 4:3; 6:5; 2 Tim. 2:15, 18, 25; 3:7, 8; 4:4). Paul exhorted Timothy to cut straight the word of truth. There were in Ephesus those who were destitute of the truth; who erred concerning the truth; who needed to repent and acknowledge the truth; who resisted the truth; and who turned away their ears from the truth. This repeated attention is given to the matter of the truth because, when the Apostle Paul wrote from prison in Rome, the church was degraded from reality to formal doctrines and vain teachings. His purpose in these two Epistles was to bring the church back to the reality.<h2 class=head1>ERRING FROM THE TRUTH</h2><p>Paul uses several descriptive terms which indicate the direction some at Ephesus were taking away from the truth. In 1 Timothy 1:6 he says, &#8220;From which some, missing the aim, have turned aside unto vain jangling&#8221; (Gk.). Vain jangling is just empty talk. Verse 7 continues, &#8220;Desiring to be teachers of the law.&#8221; They turned from God&#8217;s economy to the law, which, as we have said, is only a shadow. Verse 4 tells us, &#8220;Neither give heed to fables and endless genealogies.&#8221; Chapter four verse 7 says, &#8220;Refuse profane [worldly] and old wives&#8217; fables.&#8221; In 5:13 we read, &#8220;They learn to be idle, wandering about from house to house; and not only idle, but tattlers also and busybodies, speaking things which they ought not.&#8221; Instead of caring for the truth, they spent their time gossiping with their neighbors. In 6:3-5 we have a clear contrast between what is healthy teaching and what is not: &#8220;If any man teach differently, and consent not to healthy words, even the words of our Lord Jesus Christ, and to the teaching which is according to godliness; he is proud, knowing nothing, but sick about questions and strifes of words, whereof cometh envy, strife, railings, evil surmisings, perverse disputings of men of corrupt minds, and destitute of the truth, supposing that gain is godliness: from such withdraw thyself&#8221; (Gk.). Notice how the healthy words are opposed by those who are destitute of the truth. Those who promote strifes of words and perverse disputings Paul describes as sick.<p>In the second Epistle Paul continues to warn against these unhealthy words. &#8220;But shun profane and vain babblings; for they will increase unto more ungodliness. And their word will eat as doth a gangrene&#8221; (2:16-17, Gk.). In verse 23 he further admonishes Timothy, &#8220;But foolish and unlearned questions avoid, knowing that they do gender strifes.&#8221;<p>From all these verses we can gather what the state of the church was at the end of the first century. There was empty talk. There were those who had turned back to the law; who were giving heed to fables and endless genealogies; who were tattlers and busybodies. There were questions, strifes of words, perverse disputings, worldly and vain babblings.<h2 class=head1>CORRECTING AN UNHEALTHY CONDITION</h2><p>It was to correct such a deplorable situation that Paul wrote these Epistles, in which he emphasized so strongly the matter of the truth. Here are some of the descriptive terms he used relating to the truth. Besides the healthy words and healthy teachings we discussed in Life Message Nineteen, Paul also spoke of the word of God (1 Tim. 4:5; 2 Tim. 2:9), the words of faith (1 Tim. 4:6), the words of our Lord Jesus Christ (6:3), and the Scripture (2 Tim. 3:16). These positive terms are a reminder to us that, for the church to serve as the pillar and base of the truth, we must take in the Word of God.<h2 class=head2>Breathing Properly</h2><p>Second Timothy 3:16 is the only reference in the whole Bible that tells us that all Scripture is God-breathed (Gk.). This is a strange way of speaking. We do not think of our words as our breath. If we write a letter, we do not consider that we breathed out the words. But Paul here introduces the concept that the divine word is God&#8217;s breathing. The word in the Bible is more than an utterance; it is the breath of God.<p>What is the proper way to take in the Word of God? You may say that we must eat it. Yes, there is such a thought in the Scriptures. The Lord Jesus said, &#8220;Man shall not live on bread alone, but on every word that proceeds out through the mouth of God&#8221; (Matt. 4:4). Jeremiah also expressed that thought: &#8220;Thy words were found, and I did eat them&#8221; (Jer. 15:16).<p>There is, however, an even more prevailing way to take in the Word. Since God breathes His word out, we may breathe it in. How can we do this? It is by prayer. Our spiritual breathing is our unceasing prayer. Eating and sleeping are for a while, but breathing is never ending throughout our life. &#8220;Pray without ceasing&#8221; (1 Thes. 5:17). This verse likens our prayer to breathing. We cannot inhale God&#8217;s breath by exercising our mentality; we must inhale by praying.<h2 class=head2>Reading and Praying</h2><p>This thought of mingling our reading of the Scriptures with prayer we call pray-reading. Though we introduced this term about ten years ago, the prayerful reading of the Word has been practiced by many saints of old. George Muller described his morning watch as a blending of reading the Word and praying over it. He called this way of praying over the Word the soul-nourishing way. (Of course, he was actually nourishing his spirit, but the Brethren did not know the distinction between soul and spirit.)<p>Reading the Word and praying must go hand in hand. The inspiration to pray spontaneously arises when we begin to read the Word. We need to cultivate this inspiration rather than try to interpret what we read.<h2 class=head2>Cleansing by Breathing</h2><p>It is most beneficial to our spiritual health to inhale God&#8217;s breath. Just as deep breathing brings fresh air into our lungs and expels the bad air, so our whole being can be cleansed by deep breathing God&#8217;s breath. This is the highest hygiene. Inhaling the fresh air of God&#8217;s Word will do more for us than memorizing it. Memorizing is an exercise of our mentality; praying over the Word is an exercise of our spirit.<p>By taking in God&#8217;s Word we receive the truth into our being. In this way we are built up as the pillar and base of the truth. By staying in this pure air and deep breathing, we shall be kept from the noxious fumes of fables, vain jangling, and perverse disputings.<h2 class=head1>THE IMPERATIVE WORD</h2><p>In the church of the living God, the Lord expects His children to be living. These two Epistles contain many commands that Paul expected Timothy to act on. When the church is degraded, the satanic lie comes in to whisper, &#8220;You cannot make it; you are too weak.&#8221; The children of the living God must denounce this lie and receive the imperative word. This is the behavior expected of us in the house of God. We shall consider just a few of the commands given here. If you go over these Epistles carefully, you will find many more exhortations, indicating that the Lord requires us to exercise our initiative to &#8220;lay hold on eternal life&#8221; (1 Tim. 6:12) and reject the subtle lie that we are weak.<h2 class=head2>Flee</h2><p>In both of these Epistles Paul told Timothy to flee. &#8220;But thou, O man of God, flee these things; and pursue righteousness, godliness, faith, love, patience, meekness&#8221; (6:11, Gk.). Timothy was to flee from the love of money and its attendant evils. He was to withdraw from those men of corrupt minds who were teaching differently for gain. He was to turn from one direction to another, fleeing evil things and pursuing righteousness and godliness. &#8220;Flee also youthful lusts: but pursue righteousness, faith, love, peace, with them that call on the Lord out of a pure heart&#8221; (2 Tim. 2:22, Gk.). This second exhortation to flee what is evil and pursue what is pure shows what a high standard we must maintain. We must be pure in our thinking, pure in our word, pure in our way of looking at things, pure in our motives, pure in our heart, and even pure in our anger.<h2 class=head2>Be an Example</h2><p>When Timothy received these Epistles from Paul, he was a young man, yet Paul exhorted him, &#8220;Let no man despise thy youth; but be thou an example of the believers, in word, in conduct, in love, in spirit, in faith, in purity&#8221; (1 Tim. 4:12, Gk.). There are many young people in the church life. Do not let anyone despise your youth; rather, be an example to others, not in looseness but in purity. In human society the church must present the highest standard of morality, ethics, and character. The church as a golden lampstand is a tower full of light, expressing the divine nature.<h2 class=head2>Keep the Commandment</h2><p>&#8220;Refuse profane and old wives&#8217; fables, and exercise thyself rather unto godliness&#8221; (4:7). &#8220;Foolish and unlearned questions avoid&#8221; (2 Tim. 2:23). &#8220;Fight the good fight of faith&#8221; (1 Tim. 6:12). &#8220;Keep this commandment without spot, unrebukable, until the appearing of our Lord Jesus Christ&#8221; (v. 14). Because we have the living Lord within, we are able to keep these commandments.<h2 class=head1>EMPOWERING GRACE</h2><p>&#8220;God hath not given us the spirit of cowardice; but of power, and of love, and of a sober mind&#8221; (2 Tim. 1:7, Gk.). God has given us a spirit that empowers our will, strengthens our love, and sobers our mind. There is no excuse for us to be jellyfish!<p>Notice the conclusion of these Epistles. &#8220;The Lord Jesus Christ be with thy spirit. Grace be with you. Amen&#8221; (2 Tim. 4:22). For the Lord Jesus to be with your spirit means that grace is with you. In that grace you are empowered (&#8220;Thou therefore, my son, be empowered in the grace that is in Christ Jesus&#8221;-2 Tim. 2:1, Gk.).<p>This empowering grace will make us living and strong to support the truth. The church has been going through a time when the truth has been undermined and even openly attacked. Perverse teachings have been allowed to spread throughout the recovery. Dear ones, what behavior is required of us in the church of the living God? As His living children, we must rise up to protest and reject these efforts to draw us away from God&#8217;s economy. What a strong testimony we must be for the truth, that all may see that the church is in very fact the pillar and base of the truth!<h1 class=msg>CHAPTER TWENTY-THREE</h1><h1 class=msg>THE LIFE, THE REALITY, AND THE WAY</h1><p>Christ is the focus of God&#8217;s eternal purpose. In John 14:6 Jesus said, &#8220;I am the way, and the reality, and the life; no one comes to the Father except through Me.&#8221;<h2 class=head1>CHRIST OUR LIFE</h2><p>To experience Christ as the way and as the reality, we must first experience Him as our life. If I were to ask you how Christ can be our life, you would perhaps be at a loss for words. I doubt that many Christians know the answer, but this is one of the truths that God has recovered and that He wants us to experience. For Christ to be our life we need to know some aspects of who He is.<h2 class=head2>The Word and the Lamb of God</h2><p>In John 1 Christ is portrayed as the Word who was in the beginning. This Word, who was God Himself, became flesh. Christ, then, is God incarnate. Why did He become a man? Verse 29 says, &#8220;Behold the Lamb of God Who takes away the sin of the world!&#8221; For Christ to be our life, He first had to solve the problem of sin. Sin was separating us from God. This Man as the Lamb of God was our Redeemer whose blood was shed on the cross for our sins. This truth of redemption is the common belief of Christians.<h2 class=head2>The Grain of Wheat</h2><p>&#8220;Truly, truly, I say to you, unless a grain of wheat falls into the ground and dies, it abides alone; but if it dies, it bears much fruit&#8221; (John 12:24). Unlike redemption, the significance of this picture of Christ as a grain of wheat is not understood by most Christians. The grain of wheat does not pertain to redemption, since a seed does not have blood. A seed contains life. The grain of wheat is for the imparting of life. While the shedding of blood was for redemption, the imparting of life is for reproduction. What is the result of the grain of wheat falling into the ground and dying? The seed sprouts and grows to produce many grains. Christ was the single grain of wheat that fell into the ground and died. Then He sprouted in resurrection and became many grains. We are those many grains. What has become of the original grain? Not only is it within us, but it has also become all of us.<p>Dear ones, do you realize how precious is this truth of Christ as the grain of wheat? When I was saved, I repented of my sins, confessed to the Lord, and was cleansed by His blood. After I had been saved for a time, I began to wonder what more there was to the Christian life. Was Christ only the Lamb to take away my sins? The only answer I was given was that now that I was saved, I should try to lead a good Christian life. How far short of God&#8217;s intention such instruction falls! The Lamb for redemption is the grain for reproducing. By death and resurrection this grain has borne much fruit.<h2 class=head2>Another Comforter</h2><p>We need to see further who Christ is in order for us to experience Him as our life. In chapter fourteen John records these words of Christ: &#8220;And I will ask the Father, and He will give you another Comforter, that He may be with you forever; even the Spirit of reality&#8221; (vv. 16-17). Christ Himself is the Comforter. The other Comforter to be sent is the Spirit of reality. This other Comforter is not distinct from Christ Himself. He is simply the reality of Christ, translating Christ from an empty term to a living Person for us. Without &#8220;another Comforter&#8221; Christ would not be real to us.<h2 class=head2>A Life-giving Spirit</h2><p>For Christ to become our life, He had to take two steps. The first step was the incarnation, when &#8220;the Word became flesh.&#8221; The second step is described in 1 Corinthians 15:45, Gk.: &#8220;The last Adam became a life-giving Spirit.&#8221; The first &#8220;became&#8221; was God becoming a man to accomplish redemption; the second &#8220;became&#8221; was Christ becoming the Spirit so that He might reproduce Himself in us.<p>When did this last Adam become a life-giving Spirit? It was when He arose from the dead after spending three days and three nights in the tomb.<h2 class=head2>The Enriched Spirit</h2><p>There is a troublesome verse in John (7:39) about the Spirit: &#8220;But this He said concerning the Spirit, Whom those who believed in Him were about to receive; for the Spirit was not yet, because Jesus was not yet glorified.&#8221; Why does it say &#8220;the Spirit was not yet&#8221;? (The word &#8220;given&#8221; in the King James Version was added by the translators.) Even Genesis 1 says, &#8220;The Spirit of God moved upon the face of the waters&#8221; (v. 2). If the Spirit was there thousands of years ago, why does the Scripture say &#8220;the Spirit was not yet&#8221;? For years this verse puzzled me. I did not find the answer until I read Andrew Murray&#8217;s Spirit of Christ. Chapter five explains that at Pentecost the Spirit of the glorified Jesus came to communicate to us, not the life of God as such, but that life as it had been interwoven into human nature in the Person of Christ Jesus. It was this Spirit with humanity as well as divinity that &#8220;was not&#8221; until the resurrection of Christ.<h2 class=head2>That Spirit</h2><p>In 2 Corinthians 3:17 it says, &#8220;Now the Lord is that Spirit.&#8221; What Spirit is being referred to? If you check J. N. Darby&#8217;s translation, you will see that he puts verses 7 through 16 in parentheses, indicating that the thought in verse 17 directly follows that in verse 6, which says, &#8220;The letter killeth, but the spirit giveth life.&#8221; By putting these two verses together, we can see that the Lord is the Spirit that gives life. Here, then, is a confirmation that the Lord Jesus today is the life-giving Spirit.<h2 class=head2>One Spirit</h2><p>&#8220;He that is joined unto the Lord is one spirit&#8221; (1 Cor. 6:17). Sinners like us can be one spirit with the Lord! Do you have the liberty to participate in worldly entertainments when you are one spirit with Him? When I am speaking for the Lord, this assurance that I am one spirit with Him is the source of my authority. Our being one spirit with the Lord affects everything we do.<p>&#8220;By one Spirit are we all baptized into one body, whether we be Jews or Gentiles, whether we be bond or free; and have been all made to drink of one Spirit&#8221; (1 Cor. 12:13, Gk.). By having been immersed into Christ we are positioned to drink of Him as the one Spirit. Nothing less than this inward and outward mingling of ourselves and Christ as the wonderful, all-inclusive Spirit constitutes the church life.<p>Christ can be our life because he has passed through death and resurrection and become the Spirit.<h2 class=head1>CHRIST OUR REALITY</h2><p>Now that we have considered how Christ is life to us, we shall refer to 1 Corinthians to show how Christ can be the reality to us. In this one Epistle Christ is presented to the church as eighteen items.<h2 class=head2>Wisdom and Power</h2><p>&#8220;For the Jews require a sign, and the Greeks seek after wisdom: but we preach Christ crucified, unto the Jews a stumblingblock, and unto the Greeks foolishness; but unto them which are called, both Jews and Greeks, Christ the power of God, and the wisdom of God&#8221; (1:22-24). The Jews, as a religious people, sought signs or miracles. The Greeks, as lovers of philosophy, sought wisdom. For signs power is needed, and for philosophy wisdom is necessary. Paul says here that to us who are called Christ is both power and wisdom.<p>If you want to run a corporation, you need money and sound judgment. The capital or money is the power, and the sound judgment is the wisdom. Have you ever realized that your life is like a corporation, and that Christ is both your capital and your wisdom? If you take your mentality as your capital, your firm will end up in bankruptcy. If you take your cleverness as your wisdom, you will come out short of what you need. Cleverness comes mainly from our human mentality, but wisdom is from the divine Spirit.<p>More is said about wisdom in verse 30: &#8220;But of him are ye in Christ Jesus, who of God is made unto us wisdom, and righteousness, and sanctification, and redemption.&#8221; We were put into Christ by being baptized (Rom. 6:3; Gal. 3:27). The water of baptism signifies not only the death of Christ but also Christ Himself as the realm in which we have been placed. The very Christ into whom we were baptized has been made by God wisdom to us.<h2 class=head2>Righteousness, Sanctification, and Redemption</h2><p>Christ is wisdom to us in righteousness, sanctification, and redemption. Righteousness refers to God&#8217;s doings. To be righteous is to be right with God and with man. No human being can meet this standard. Consider how loose, rough, and lawless we were before we were saved. It is because we have Christ as wisdom that we have the way to be right with both God and man. The change that has taken place in our conduct before God and man is evidence that Christ is the reality of righteousness in our life.<p>Sanctification is holiness; it is God&#8217;s nature. When this objective holiness becomes our subjective experience, it is sanctification. We are sanctified when we are separated unto God from everything that is not of Him.<p>We can use our attitude toward shopping as an illustration of the distinction between righteousness and sanctification. Before we were saved, if we could take something from the store without paying for it, we were pleased with ourselves for not getting caught. Such behavior is unrighteous. After we were saved, not only would we not steal, but even if we were given too much change we would return it. This is an example of righteousness and means that we are experiencing Christ as the power and wisdom of God.<p>In the experience of sanctification, you may find when you go shopping that you have a sense of bothering within about the purchase you would like to make. There is no question about your paying for it, but you have a sense that it is worldly. You may drop it and consider another article. Still there is a restraining within. By the time you turn to consider the third possible purchase, you have had enough restraint and decide this is what you are going to buy, that this is less worldly than either of the other two you considered. The Lord within stops talking, not because He approves, but in order not to press you too far when you are so young. When you come to wear your new purchase, sometimes you are happy to put it on, but other times you wonder why you thought it was so attractive in the store. Then you wear it to a meeting and feel condemned the whole time. Eventually you discard it. The next time you go shopping, you find that the appeal of those things has faded. In time you have no inclination to purchase worldly things. By experiences such as these Christ becomes the power and wisdom to us in sanctification.<p>How is Christ made unto us redemption? When we believed in the Lord Jesus, we were redeemed. We were God&#8217;s possession, God&#8217;s inheritance, but in the fall we were lost. In redemption Christ bought us back for God. Although this redemption has been accomplished, it still needs to be applied. Our mind needs to be redeemed; so do our will and our emotion. We need to be redeemed from our natural, fallen ability, our eloquence, or our way of treating our neighbors.<p>It would be good to pray, &#8220;Lord, I need You as my power and wisdom to be righteous, holy, and redeemed. I don&#8217;t want to remain in my natural, fallen state. I want to be fully in You, not in Adam. God has transferred me to You, and I would like to abide there, redeemed from my way of thinking, my way of loving others, and my way of making a decision. Lord, I want to express You; redeem me from my expression and from my natural attitude.&#8221;<p>First Corinthians 1:30 also refers to the three stages of a Christian life. In the past, when we were sinful, Christ became our righteousness. Our present living is now sanctified through Christ. In the future, when Christ returns, our body will be redeemed. Christ, then, has taken care of these three stages of our Christian life, as well as these three aspects of our daily experience. Day by day He is the power and wisdom for us to be righteous, sanctified, and redeemed.<h2 class=head2>The Deep Things of God</h2><p>&#8220;As it is written, Eye hath not seen, nor ear heard, neither have entered into the heart of man, the things which God hath prepared for them that love him. But God hath revealed them unto us by his Spirit: for the Spirit searcheth all things, yea, the deep things of God&#8221; (1 Cor. 2:9-10). All the matters pertaining to human society are superficial. Worldlings may be familiar with material wealth, education, or science, but there is something deeper which we experience, something beyond the concept of man. Others can even sense that the joy and the strength which we experience are deeper than what they know. We are a mystery to the world. In suffering we have a joy; in loss we have a gain. &#8220;The deep things of God&#8221; which He prepared for them that love Him are Christ Himself.<h2 class=head2>The Foundation</h2><p>&#8220;For other foundation can no man lay than that is laid, which is Jesus Christ&#8221; (3:11). If you do not have Christ, your life has no foundation. He is not only the foundation of the church; without Him, you have no foundation for your personal life. Our daily living must be founded on a Person. Christ is the reality of our life because He is our foundation.<h2 class=head2>Our Passover</h2><p>&#8220;Even Christ our passover is sacrificed for us&#8221; (1 Cor. 5:7). The Passover reminds us that formerly we were under God&#8217;s condemnation but that God has forgiven us, passed over us, through Christ (see Exo. 12:1-14). Christ as our Passover becomes our salvation and our forgiveness.<h2 class=head2>The Unleavened Bread</h2><p>&#8220;Therefore let us keep the feast, not with old leaven, neither with the leaven of malice and wickedness; but with the unleavened bread of sincerity and truth&#8221; (1 Cor. 5:8). In the Old Testament seven feasts were kept by the children of Israel (Lev. 23). The first was the Passover and the next was the feast of unleavened bread. In that feast nothing leavened could be eaten. In Christ we enjoy a lifelong feast of unleavened bread. If we do not sense that we are feasting, it is because we have not gotten rid of the leaven. Leaven represents what is sinful and condemned by God. Once this is gone, our Christian life becomes a happy enjoyment.<p>The Lord&#8217;s table signifies the Passover and also reminds us of the feast of unleavened bread. Sin and condemnation are over. We are at the feast, enjoying Christ and hating sin.<h2 class=head2>Spiritual Food, Drink, and Rock</h2><p>&#8220;Our fathers...were all baptized unto Moses in the cloud and in the sea; and did all eat the same spiritual meat; and did all drink the same spiritual drink; for they drank of that spiritual Rock that followed them: and that Rock was Christ&#8221; (1 Cor. 10:1-4). Day by day our food is Christ; He is the manna. He is also the living water that flows out of the cleft rock. The rock symbolizes the source of our supply. Both the supply and the source of the supply are Christ. He is our dependable rock, always following us to be our supply. In Him we have food, drink, and an unfailing source of supply.<h2 class=head2>The Head</h2><p>&#8220;But I would have you know, that the head of every man is Christ; and the head of the woman is the man; and the head of Christ is God&#8221; (11:3). All too often the self is the head. But Christ is not only our life; He is also to be our Head. Unless we take Christ as our Head, we cannot properly take Him as our life. This affects our personal life, our family life, and the church life. His headship is a serious matter.<p>If we are asked for advice by a younger one, our fellowship must be under the headship of Christ. To tell the younger one what to do is to disregard the fact that Christ is his Head, not we. For him to know what to do is secondary; for him to realize that Christ is his Head is primary.<p>Our Head is the Lord Jesus. We are not our own head; neither is anyone else. Once we realize this, we are ready to know His will because we have given Him the right position. The sisters cannot take their husband as their head without first positioning themselves to take Christ as the Head. Only when He is the Head are we properly positioned in the presence of God. We lack the experience of Christ because we do not esteem Him as our Head. Before we decide to go somewhere or to buy a pair of shoes, we must check with Him. By coming under His headship we shall experience Him as our reality.<h2 class=head2>The Body</h2><p>&#8220;For as the body is one, and hath many members, and all the members of that one body, being many, are one body: so also is Christ&#8221; (12:12). From this verse we can see that Christ is not only the Head but also the Body. In the new man there is no room for you nor me; Christ is all in all (Col. 3:10-11).<h2 class=head2>The Firstfruit, the Second Man, the Last Adam, the Life-giving Spirit</h2><p>&#8220;But now is Christ risen from the dead, and become the firstfruit of them that slept&#8221; (1 Cor. 15:20, Gk.). Christ is the first. &#8220;The second man is the Lord from heaven&#8221; (15:47). Here He is second! &#8220;The last Adam became a life-giving Spirit&#8221; (15:45, Gk.). Here He is last! If He is A and B, He is also Z. Christ is everything.<p>How could this marvelous One, represented by all these items, be the reality of them to us? It is because He is this final one we have mentioned, the life-giving Spirit. By turning away from our mind, emotion, and will, we can encounter Him in our spirit. As He spreads into our inner being and makes His home there, He becomes our reality as well as our life, and we are no longer empty.<h2 class=head1>CHRIST OUR WAY</h2><p>After we have experienced Christ as our life and enjoyed Him as our reality, this reality becomes our way. God&#8217;s way with us is always a Person. For us to contact God, the way is a Person. The same is true of fellow-shipping with the saints, serving God, living in the church life, preaching the gospel, shepherding the saints, becoming holy, or being redeemed. In our Christian life the way to do everything is a Person.<p>The One who is the power and wisdom of God to us is Christ crucified (1: 23-24). Paul refers to Him again as the crucified One in the second chapter: &#8220;And I, brethren, when I came to you, came not with excellency of speech or of wisdom, declaring unto you the testimony of God. For I determined not to know any thing among you, save Jesus Christ, and him crucified. And I was with you in weakness, and in fear, and in much trembling. And my speech and my preaching was not with enticing words of man&#8217;s wisdom, but in demonstration of spirit [Gk.] and of power&#8221; (vv. 1-4).<p>In preaching this crucified One, Paul held the attitude of being also crucified. Rather than demonstrating a clever mind or eloquent words, he was with the Corinthians in weakness, fear, and much trembling. The way to preach is in demonstration of spirit, not in the exaltation of the natural man. The crucified Jesus is the way of all ministry.<h2 class=head2>Fulfilling All Righteousness</h2><p>When the Lord Jesus began His ministry around the age of thirty, His first public act was to be baptized by John (Matt. 3:13-17). His ministry began with His being buried. He was holy, pure, and sinless, yet before he could touch God&#8217;s ministry, (in figure) He had to die. John the Baptist did not realize this. He could see how sinners like the Pharisees and Sadducees needed to be baptized, but how could this One born of the Holy Spirit need baptism? &#8220;But Jesus answering said to him, Permit it now, for in this way it is fitting for us to fulfill all righteousness.&#8221; Dear ones, the highest righteousness is to be buried. After Christ had been buried and come up from the water, he entered into the enjoyment of the presence of God. Such is the meaning of the opened heavens, the descent of the Spirit like a dove, and the Father&#8217;s voice. For the true enjoyment of God&#8217;s presence, we must die and be buried.<h2 class=head2>A Life under the Shadow of the Cross</h2><p>A careful study of the Gospels will reveal that the whole earthly life of the Lord Jesus was under the death of the cross. His baptism was the first step in a life of dying. Eventually He went to the cross and physically died.<h2 class=head2>How to Die</h2><p>In resurrection this One became the life-giving Spirit. The effectiveness of His death is in this very Spirit who now indwells us (see Life Message Eight.) We do not die by committing suicide but by experiencing the dying One within. Hebrews 10:20 tells us that a new and living way has been dedicated for us through the veil, that is, His flesh. When Jesus was crucified, the veil that separated man from God was rent from top to bottom. His being crucified opened the way and made Him the way. Whatever we seek to do or be in our Christian life, the way is to die with Christ.<p>I trust that through this message we have become clear that the One who is &#8220;the way, and the reality, and the life&#8221; is experienced by us firstly as our life, then as our reality, and lastly as our way. Such experiences are possible because in resurrection He became the life-giving Spirit, and as such He indwells us. Because we are one Spirit with Him, whatever He is becomes ours and our reality. This reality then becomes our way to live in the presence of God.<h1 class=msg>CHAPTER TWENTY-FOUR</h1><h1 class=msg>GOD AND HIS WORD</h1><p>In the very first page of the Bible God is revealed in creation. How was His creative work carried out? There is no mention of the strength of His arm nor the skill of His hand. Rather, &#8220;he spake, and it was done; he commanded, and it stood fast&#8221; (Psa. 33:9). Nine times in Genesis 1 we have the words, &#8220;And God said.&#8221; That is why the Psalmist said, &#8220;By the word of the Lord were the heavens made; and all the host of them by the breath of his mouth&#8221; (33:6). God&#8217;s work is accomplished and His power made manifest by His mouth.<p>The Lord Jesus exemplified this same principle in the Gospels. He healed people by His word, not by working. In the case of the centurion&#8217;s servant, the Lord&#8217;s word healed him even when he was in another place (Matt. 8:5-13). He also said, &#8220;He who hears My word...has eternal life&#8221; (John 5:24). We are saved, not by the Lord&#8217;s working, but by His speaking, by His word.<p>It is not easy to distinguish His word from God Himself. In fact, John 1:1 says, &#8220;And the Word was God.&#8221; We may think that the language of John 1:1 is awkward. When I was young, I used to think John 1:1 should read, &#8220;In the beginning was God, and God was manifested as the Word&#8221;! But by saying, as John does, &#8220;In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God,&#8221; he is exalting the Word as the One who was there first before identifying that Word as God Himself.<p>In the Gospel of John, this book of life, the first vital point concerning life is the Word. When John describes the incarnation in 1:14, he does not say that God became flesh. &#8220;And the Word became flesh and tabernacled among us.&#8221; That God is called the Word is not a small thing. We cannot separate the Word from God.<p>Nor can we separate the Word from the Spirit. The Lord said (6:63), &#8220;The words which I have spoken unto you are spirit and are life.&#8221; If His word is spirit, and the Word is God, these three are one.<h2 class=head1>THE BIBLE</h2><p>The whole Bible is the Word of God (2 Tim. 3:16). Do not take any word other than the Bible as the Word of God; otherwise, you can be led into heresy. Apart from the Bible, you have no sure word of God. Whatever is in the Bible, you may rest assured, is the Word of God.<p>You cannot say from this that the Bible is God, even though the Bible is God&#8217;s Word and the Word is God Himself. It would be superstitious to worship the Bible. Pointing your finger at a random verse and taking that verse as your guidance is superstitious. You need to exercise your spirit and your sober mind when you come to the Word, not your finger! In 1923 a brother who lived in the same county as Brother Nee tried to find the Lord&#8217;s will by pointing to a verse on a page he opened to at random. The verse was Matthew 27:5, where Judas &#8220;went away and hanged himself&#8221;! This is not the way to honor the Word. Do not consider that the Bible is God in any material sense; this is a heresy.<p>But the Bible is more than a secular book. Your sense when you come to this book differs from what you feel when you handle a secular magazine. I have tried to pick up my Bible after having a disagreement with my wife. The sense was there right away that I should not touch that book, should not come to the Lord&#8217;s presence, till I had first gone back to put matters right with my wife. Have you ever had such an experience? If you are stubborn and insist on opening the Word anyway, you get nothing from your reading. This book compels you to make restitution to your wife.<h2 class=head1>ITS RICHES</h2><p>How rich is this book in which God has spoken! In it is Christ Himself. If you are asked by a learned professor where Christ is, do not reply that He is in the heavens; that is too far away. Do not say that He is in your spirit; that is too mysterious. The answer is that Christ is in the Bible. If the inquirer truly wants to meet Him, let him read John 1:1-29 over and over. He will surely find Him.<p>The Life-study Messages are rich, but not one of them is as rich as the Bible. The writings of Confucius are of a high quality, with profound philosophical and ethical teachings, but they cannot compare with the Bible. I studied some of those writings when I was young and I did appreciate them, but once I became familiar with them, there seemed to be not much more to them when I went back to consider them further. The Bible, in contrast, is inexhaustible. We have put out over sixty-five messages on the Gospel of John, yet we could easily have another sixty-five messages without the well running dry! The more we read the Bible, the more riches we discover. After fifty-five years of loving this book, I am still plumbing its depths and enjoying its riches.<h2 class=head1>ITS CENTRAL THOUGHT</h2><p>It is best if we come to this Word knowing what its main thought is. Whatever part of the Bible we are reading, we should be aware that the basic concept of this holy book is that God desires to work Himself into us. Nothing pleases God as much as being one with us. He wants to be us, and us to be Him. He would like to be our life. Yes, we already have life, but our life is not the real life. It is just a vessel, an empty vessel, to contain God as our real life. God&#8217;s desire is that we should be His vessel, containing Him, expressing Him, and living Him out.<p>Day by day I have the deep conviction within me that I should not live myself out. I am just a vessel with God as my life. In my speaking, if I do not contain, express, and convey Him to you, my words are just vanity. Before I speak, I pray, &#8220;Lord, I don&#8217;t want to speak anything from myself. I want to speak only You. If You are not my speaking, whatever I speak is in vain.&#8221; I do believe that in my speaking the Lord&#8217;s word is spoken.<p>When we come to the Bible then, we must not think we are coming just to the printed page. We need to realize that the Word, God, the Spirit, and the Bible are one. In coming to His Word, we come to Him. His intention is not to teach nor correct us; it is rather to work Himself into us.<h2 class=head1>HOW REALIZED</h2><h2 class=head2>As Nourishment</h2><p>By what way does God work Himself into us? It is in the same way that we take food into us. By eating different forms of the animal and vegetable life, we get the essential elements we need to sustain our physical life. What we eat may be in the form of apples or cherries, beef or chicken. But it becomes part of us in the form of nutrients that our bodies can assimilate to keep us alive and healthy. What we eat does not stay in the form of an apple or a chicken; it is digested as vitamins, minerals, protein, and other substances our bodies need.<p>God Himself is the nourishment we need. Both the animal and vegetable life are used in the Bible to illustrate the riches of His nourishment. Jesus said to His disciples, &#8220;I am the bread of life; he who comes to Me shall by no means hunger, and he who believes in Me shall by no means ever thirst&#8221; (John 6:35). Here Christ likens Himself to barley and wheat. He is symbolized by the vegetable life.<p>In this same chapter (John 6) He is also described as being of the animal life. &#8220;The bread which I will give is My flesh, which I will give for the life of the world....Unless you eat the flesh of the Son of Man and drink His blood, you have no life in yourselves. He who eats My flesh and drinks My blood has eternal life, and I will raise him up in the last day. For My flesh is true food, and My blood is true drink&#8221; (vv. 51-55).<p>From such verses we can see that God would impart Himself into us as nourishment, that our spiritual being might be constituted. Mere instruction in the Christian life is not sufficient; we must have the genuine food.<h2 class=head2>By His Speaking</h2><p>In addition to taking Him in as our nourishment, there is another way by which God becomes our constituent. It is by His speaking. In His speaking He breathes out whatever He is. He said, &#8220;I am the light of the world; he who follows Me shall by no means walk in darkness, but shall have the light of life&#8221; (8:12). Christ is wrought into us as light when He speaks. In His speaking light is conveyed to us. When He said, &#8220;I am the life&#8221; (14:6), life was wrapped up with His word. When His word comes and is received, the healing life comes into the receiver. Whenever we receive God&#8217;s word, we receive God Himself as well.<p>The opening words of Hebrews remind us that God has spoken. &#8220;In many portions and in many ways, God, having spoken of old to the fathers in the prophets, has at the last of these days spoken to us in the Son&#8221; (1:1-2). In Old Testament times, God spoke to the fathers in various ways and at different times, but now in this New Testament age God has spoken in the Son. How we thank Him that He is a speaking God, and that His speaking is on this earth, among men!<p>Just as the apostles spoke in the Son, so our speaking today is the Son&#8217;s speaking because we are one with Him and members of His Body. We need to learn to differentiate between the ministry that speaks God into us and one that does not. Whenever we come to a meeting and listen to a proper speaking, God Himself is conveyed to us in that speaking. We may, on the other hand, listen to an eloquent sermon which stirs us up, but once it is over, we have the feeling that nothing remains with us and that we are still the same. A real ministry of God&#8217;s speaking results in something of God getting into us. We may disagree with what is said or even reject it, but nonetheless the living God has been spoken into us.<h2 class=head1>SALVATION IN THE WORD</h2><p>The gospel through which we were saved came from the Bible. It is by this same book that we are saved day by day. If we neglect this book, however wonderful our initial experience of salvation was, we shall find that we are not properly saved.<p>The saints of old have given abundant testimony of how they were saved by the Word. Psalm 119:147 reads, &#8220;I prevented the dawning of the morning, and cried: I hoped in thy word.&#8221; The psalmist is saying here that he arose before dawn and cried. All his future, all his living, was bound up with God&#8217;s word. Without it, he had no hope.<p>Consider how much better off we are than the Old Testament saints. Moses did not have even the first five books of the Bible. David&#8217;s Bible did not include the prophets. He had neither the sweet book of Isaiah, nor the mysterious Zechariah, nor the marvelous book of Daniel, nor the unveiling book of Ezekiel. We not only have all these; we have the Gospels, the Acts, the Epistles, and Revelation as well.<p>Do you realize what a precious heritage this is? I remember when I was newly saved how much I treasured the Bible. For me, nothing in the world could compare with it.<h2 class=head1>GOD ADDED TO US</h2><p>Reading this Word will save you. Even if you take just ten minutes in the morning, you will find a supply there. If you lack patience, patience will be your portion. If you are short of love, those ten minutes will supply you with love. As you pray-read the Word, you will be cleansed. Because you are still on this earth living in your flesh, in your natural life, you become contaminated. Without realizing it, you will be cleansed by reading this Word, and God, the very essence of the Word, will be imparted to you. You will become a different person.<p>This nourishment will sustain us. While I speak, the food that I have eaten is upholding me. I may not have noticed what I was eating, and I may be unaware of the nutrients in the food I ate, but nonetheless that food is going into my bloodstream and supplying me with physical strength and energy. We may not understand the Word that we pray-read, but eventually we shall find that it has been light, life, and even the anointing to us.<p>If we summarize how this Word benefits us as it nourishes, waters, and sustains us, we can say that it adds God into us. We must not be distracted by teachings about healing or power. In this Word faith is ours, power and authority are ours, and healing is ours.<h2 class=head1>RICHES IN THE MEETINGS</h2><p>The outcome of getting into the Word regularly will be a proper Christian life. Then as you come together with the saints, your meetings will display your daily walk. You are not coming together for a performance nor to be entertained. You live Christ and feast on His Word day by day. Then as you meet with the saints, if you have a hymn, you call for it. If you have a prayer, you offer it. If you have a word, you utter it. If you have a message, you give it. The result will be the genuine church life, with the meetings enriched by prayers so full of life, by words so full of light, and by testimonies so full of help. How you meet does not depend on a form but on how you live. Surely you need more in your meetings than the candy of excitement and entertainment. Do not take any extraordinary way. Come back to the Bible and to the simplicity of cleaving to the tree of life. If you live according to His Word, when you meet together you will experience His blessing.<h1 class=msg>CHAPTER TWENTY-FIVE</h1><h1 class=msg>LIVING BY ANOTHER&#8217;S LIFE</h1><p>From the time that I received the Lord, I realized that His life was in me. John 3:16 states clearly, &#8220;For God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son, that every one who believes in Him should not perish, but have eternal life.&#8221; I knew that by believing in Him I had received eternal life. Yet I wondered how such a life could affect my daily living.<h2 class=head1>A BIRD OR A DOG?</h2><p>Perhaps some of you have this same concern. You may have a wonderful time in the Word in the morning, yet throughout the day you may often feel condemned because of your loose talking on the phone or your irritability toward your family. In some ways you experience a bird&#8217;s life, soaring in the open heavens, but in other ways you lead a dog&#8217;s life, barking at your mother or at your children. One moment you are praying to the Lord, and the next moment you are venting your wrath on your family. Which are you, a bird or a dog?<p>For many years I longed to know how my living could correspond with the life I had received. I was saved in China, a land of idols and Confucius&#8217; philosophy. Many young college students, including Watchman Nee, were saved around that same time, in the 1920s. I do believe that the Lord granted us His gracious visitation as a result of the prayers of many saints, mostly in England. In 1900 the Boxer Rebellion had caused the martyrdom of many missionaries, mostly English; this episode constrained many to pray for China. Our salvation, no doubt, was one result of those prayers.<p>From our study of the Bible and our seeking of the Lord, we came to realize that our living should be different. We gathered scores of Christian books, seeking to find the way to live such a life. Not one book helped us. In fact, a number of years went by before we found the secret.<p>We noticed from the Gospel of John that our relationship with the Lord begins by believing in Him. &#8220;As many as received Him, to them He gave authority to become the children of God, to those who believe in His name&#8221; (1:12). This first chapter shows that to believe in Him is to receive Him.<p>The last chapter, however, indicates that our relationship to Him is a matter of love. &#8220;Simon, son of John, do you love Me more than these?&#8221; (21:15). But loving Him is not the way by which we live this life we have received.<h2 class=head1>TWO PERSONS BUT ONE LIFE</h2><p>The key is found in chapters five, six, and seven. It is that the life we have received is Another&#8217;s, yet it is not lived by Him, but by us. The Lord Jesus demonstrated this way of living by taking the life of the Father. In 6:57 the Lord said, &#8220;As the living Father sent Me, and I live because of the Father, so he who eats Me shall also live because of Me.&#8221; By comparing this verse with 5:26, &#8220;For even as the Father has life in Himself, so He gave to the Son also to have life in Himself,&#8221; we can see that though the life was the Father&#8217;s, the Father was not the one who lived it. His desire was that His life be lived out by the Son. This life involved two Persons: it was the life of the first Person, but it had to be lived by the second Person. The Father was the Giver of this life and the Son the Receiver. There were two Persons but one life to be lived.<h2 class=head1>AN ILLUSTRATION</h2><p>Married life is somewhat like this. Two people are involved, the husband and the wife, but for a happy marriage, there can be only one life lived. If the wife lives her own life instead of living by her husband&#8217;s, their marriage will be miserable. This comparison of marriage with our relationship to the Lord is not superficial. Ephesians 5:23-32 tells us that Christ is the Husband and the church is the wife. Should the church have a living separate from the living of Christ?<p>Married life actually is a faulty illustration because there are two lives involved. The husband&#8217;s life cannot literally be his wife&#8217;s life; they each have a life of their own. But in the case of the Father and the Son, the Two of them truly had only one life. In the case of Christ and the church, also, there is only one life; what Christ has as life is what the church has as life.<p>However earnestly the wives try to be subject &#8220;to their husbands in everything,&#8221; and however sincerely the husbands try to love their wives &#8220;even as Christ also loved the church,&#8221; their efforts will be in vain. This will be the case even if the wife follows the principle of taking her husband&#8217;s life as her own. The exhortations in Ephesians can only be carried out by both husband and wife taking the life of Another. The love and the submission are from the Lord. When they take Christ as their life, in the wife submission will come forth, and in the husband love will arise.<h2 class=head1>EXPRESSING SOMEONE CONCEALED</h2><p>When we were saved, we were joined to Christ as one Spirit (1 Cor. 6:17). We are one with Him. Today Christ cannot be seen. He is concealed from the eyes of men, firstly in the heavens (Acts 3:20-21) and secondly in us (2 Cor. 13:5). While He was on earth, He followed the principle of living by a concealed life. John says, &#8220;No one has ever seen God; the only begotten Son, Who is in the bosom of the Father, He has declared Him&#8221; (1:18). As the Son expressed that hidden life, so today we His disciples are charged to take His life as our living, thus making manifest His concealed life.<h2 class=head1>NOT A MATTER OF IMPROVING BEHAVIOR</h2><p>When the disciples of Confucius try to follow their master&#8217;s teachings, all their efforts are directed at trying to improve their behavior so that it will conform to what Confucius said. This is our natural concept also, when we come to the Bible. Christians think that they must behave in an ethical, morally upright way. They study the Bible in order to find out what constitutes the proper Christian life. Then they strive to meet that standard.<p>All such efforts are nothing but a frustration to the way Christians should live. The proper Christian life is not related to ethics but to a Person. No doubt Christian morality and ethics are the highest, but it is because they are Christ Himself. It is He who is love or humility or kindness. These traits are expressed when we live Him.<p>It is all too common to think that we should improve our behavior after we get saved, that we must try to act like the children of God rather than like the children of the Devil. Better conduct is not God&#8217;s intention for us. Do you think the Son lived by the Father because His own life was not good enough? By no means! The Son simply wanted to fulfill the Father&#8217;s desire to be lived out by the Son. &#8220;I do not seek My own will, but the will of Him Who sent Me&#8221; (John 5:30). The Son&#8217;s commission was to express the Father, not to do anything else. &#8220;The living Father sent Me, and I live because of the Father&#8221; (6:57). The Son took the Father&#8217;s life not because of any sin or weakness or inadequacy on the Son&#8217;s part, but just to accomplish the Father&#8217;s desire. He was sent not to establish an empire nor to perform a great work. Even to say that Christ came to save sinners is only partly true. He came to live the Father. If the cross had not been the Father&#8217;s will, if saving sinners had not been the Father&#8217;s will, Christ would not have submitted to the cross. You remember His prayer in Gethsemane, &#8220;Not as I will, but as You will&#8221; (Matt. 26:39).<h2 class=head1>HIS LIFE BUT YOUR LIVING</h2><p>As you go through the day, you need to realize that Christ and you have only one life, not yours but His. For this to be your experience, your own life has to be put aside. Then you two will have only one living, not His but yours, because His is concealed.<p>This is not easy to understand. Ask the Lord to make you clear. &#8220;Lord, thank You that You and I have one life. Show me how to take this life; show me how to put aside my life. Thank You, Lord, that the two of us have only one living; this is my living, not Yours. I thank You that the life is Yours. You should thank me that the living is mine!&#8221; If you keep praying this way, you will become clear that in the Christian life the Lord and you have only one life. In yourself you have your life; in Himself, He has His. But in Him, in His life, you are both one. This one life is your living.<p>If we pray this way, we may sense that the Lord is pleased -pleased that He has a life for us and that we have a living for Him.<h2 class=head1>HOW TO PUT ASIDE OUR OWN LIFE</h2><p>For us to experience the one life, our own life must be put aside. In specific terms, we must put aside both our will and our glory. The Lord said, &#8220;I do not seek My own will, but the will of Him Who sent Me&#8221; (John 5:30). In 7:17-18 He said, &#8220;If anyone wills to do His will, he shall know concerning the teaching, whether it is of God, or whether I speak from Myself. He who speaks from himself seeks his own glory, but He who seeks the glory of Him Who sent Him, this One is true, and unrighteousness is not in Him.&#8221; The Lord sought both the will and the glory of the One who had sent Him. To put our will and glory aside is to deny the self.<p>All human beings are for their own will and their own glory. Why do we prefer to live by our own life? It is because within us we have a will concerning ourselves. The direction of this will is to promote our name, our popularity, our position. Our will within seeks to advance our glory without.<p>Self-promotion characterizes human society. Everyone wants to be somebody. Even in the church there are these aspirations to be someone. But the church annuls every one of us. I have heard the church people criticized as being a &#8220;bunch of dummies,&#8221; lacking any self-assertiveness. Is not this a testimony that the Lord is making us different from the world?<p>When we put down the will and the glory of the natural life, that life is finished.<h2 class=head1>HOW TO BE HELPED BY THE WORD</h2><p>To get the most help from the Word, do not seek your own will and glory. If you are after a position for yourself, when you come to the Word the help you receive will be fragmentary at best. Be content to be nobody. As long as you are somebody, you are taking yourself as life. The Lord Jesus&#8217; baptism at the beginning of His ministry was a declaration that He was terminated, that His natural life was under the cross, and that He would live the Father. It is when you choose such a life that the Word nourishes you. The Word is not for the sustaining of your natural life. The intent of the Word is not to instruct you. Do not try to do what is taught in the Bible. Just open to Him as you open His Word and receive Him through the Word as your supply.<h2 class=head1>THE HIGHEST COMMISSION</h2><p>Are you satisfied to be a nobody? You can try the educational world if you would like to be somebody. Or there may be openings for you in the world of politics. But once you step through the door of the church, you are a nobody. Are you willing?<p>But I would rather phrase the question in a positive way: Are you satisfied with the highest commission? The Lord Jesus turned from His own will and His own glory in order to take the Father&#8217;s life and live Him. This same high commission is yours: to take Christ as your life and to live Him. It is no more I but Christ that lives in me. This is both the Christian life and the church life. How far it surpasses the will and the glory of the self!<p>Let nothing distract you from this commission. Do not be concerned about worldliness. Do not think about weakness. Do not be burdened by your sins. The more you try to overcome worldliness, weakness, and sin, the more you will be victimized by them. If you take Christ as your life and live Him out, these and all the other negative things will flee away.<h2 class=head1>PRACTICING</h2><p>In the everyday affairs of life, do not be pushed into doing things quickly. Do not reply, or even utter anything, in haste. Whatever the provocation, be steady. If a difficult situation arises with your wife, for example, do not be troubled. Just confer with the Lord within: &#8220;Lord, I do not do anything. I am one with You. You act in me. You answer my wife. I would not do anything apart from You.&#8221;<p>Having this attitude of taking the Lord as our life saves us from trying to obey the letter of the Bible. By constantly turning to Him and declaring that we are one with Him, we provide Him the opportunity to change us by metabolically carrying away the old and replacing it with the new. Such will be the effect of the nourishing Word we take in-not outward correction but inward change.<p>How privileged you are to have this other life! As you practice living by Christ, you will see how different you are from those in the world, who have only their own life. God has imparted His life to you. Now He wants you to live Him out as your living.<p>As the Son lived the Father by the Father&#8217;s life, so today we live the Son by the Son&#8217;s life. Let us thank Him that we two have one life and one living; the life is His, and the living is ours. This is the proper Christian life.<h1 class=msg>CHAPTER TWENTY-SIX</h1><h1 class=msg>THE TREE OF LIFE</h1><p>In the opening chapters of the Bible the tree of life is presented to us. When we come to its closing chapters, again there is this tree. Why does it still prevail after so many pages, so much history, and so many centuries?<h2 class=head1>MAN IN THE GARDEN OF EDEN</h2><p>God had an eternal plan. For this purpose He created the heavens and the earth and countless other things. Then He formed a creature that differed from the animals, the plants, and the hosts of heaven. If you looked at him, there would be something about him that reminded you of God.<p>This man was placed in a garden planted especially for him. Of all the trees growing there, only two are mentioned by name. For many, many years this picture of man and two trees in a garden puzzled me. Why did the Lord God&#8217;s first recorded word to His creature concern the matter of eating from these trees? &#8220;Of every tree of the garden, thou mayest freely eat: but of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, thou shalt not eat of it: for in the day that thou eatest thereof thou shalt surely die&#8221; (Gen. 2:16-17).<p>If I had been God, I would surely have talked to Adam about my purpose. I would have told him that since I was his creator, he should worship me morning, noon, and evening. I would have taught him some melodies with which to praise me. Then I would have told him about the wife I would make for him, his counterpart. He would need to love her, and she would need to submit to him, in order that they might be a good example to all the future human couples. I would have told him about the generations to be born and the communities that would be raised up. For all these relationships he would need to develop a good character and show kindness, humility, and patience. But these opening chapters of Genesis are void of any such explanations and exhortations.<h2 class=head1>MAN A DEPENDENT CREATURE</h2><p>Very gradually over these past fifty years I have come to understand the meaning of this simple picture of man and two trees in a garden. The first crucial point is that man was not created independent. Because he had to eat, he was dependent upon others. If God had created Adam with a self-sustaining, unending life, he would not have needed to eat. But man could not live by himself in an isolated way, because he was designed to need food. He was destined to be dependent.<h2 class=head1>TWO SOURCES OF SUPPLY</h2><p>The two trees represent two ways for man to turn to have his need met. The tree of life represents God. The other tree signifies Satan. God&#8217;s supply is simple-life. Satan&#8217;s supply is complicated-the knowledge of good and evil.<p>Notice that good does not belong to the category of life. Good pertains to knowledge, just as evil does. Both belong to Satan and issue in death. If you do not depend upon God, you are depending upon that second source. Do not think that you can depend upon knowledge or upon what is good. If you are not depending upon God, your trust is in something that has Satan as its source. However much you struggle to be independent, you are waging a losing battle against your destiny.<p>If you depend upon God, the issue is life; if Satan, it is death. The second crucial point, then, is that we have only God and Satan to choose between for the source of our supply.<h2 class=head1>EATING NOT DOING</h2><p>I have already commented on how different God&#8217;s approach to Adam was from what mine would have been. God showed no interest in telling him what to do or how to behave. It is the human concept of religion that promotes doing-worship, good behavior, proper relationships with others. Religion presents man with a long list of do&#8217;s and don&#8217;ts.<p>God&#8217;s concern for man was that he choose the right food. All would go well as long as he ate properly. Death would result if he chose the wrong food. This concern implied that man could take God in as his life. Man was not given the divine life when he was created; rather, he was given a free will to choose that life, symbolized by the tree of life.<h2 class=head1>THE IDENTITY OF THE TREE OF LIFE</h2><p>I used to wonder what the tree of life was. Peach and apple trees I knew, and pear trees I was familiar with, but what was the life tree? Eventually I found some clues in the writings of John. At the end of Revelation the tree of life reappears. &#8220;And on this side and on that side of the river was the tree of life, producing twelve fruits, yielding its fruit each month, and the leaves of the tree are for the healing of the nations&#8221; (22:2). Does it puzzle you that a tree could grow on both banks of a river? Surely this tree is a vine, spreading along the banks.<p>And we know who the true vine is from John 15:1. This is the very One who said, &#8220;I am the life&#8221; (14:6) and &#8220;I came that they may have life and may have it abundantly&#8221; (10:10). The Lord Jesus Himself is surely the tree of life.<h2 class=head1>THE LORD JESUS AS LIFE</h2><p>The tree of life declares that God offers Himself to man in an edible form. The Lord Jesus brought this same message to man about Himself.<h2 class=head2>Bread, Not a King</h2><p>&#8220;I am the bread of life. This is the bread which comes down out of heaven, that anyone may eat of it and not die&#8221; (John 6:48, 50). Earlier in this chapter the Lord had miraculously fed the five thousand. The crowd then decided they would forcibly make Him their king. He slipped away and the next day came back and talked with them, not about reigning and lording it over them, but about being a loaf of bread for them to eat and thus receive eternal life. Rather than externally control them, He wanted to be received into them and to become part of them.<h2 class=head2>The Prince of Life</h2><p>When Peter was preaching, he told the Israelites that they had killed the &#8220;Prince of life&#8221; (Acts 3:15). The word translated prince could also be rendered inaugurator, author, or pioneer. However it is translated, we can surely infer that life has its source in Him.<h2 class=head2>Life Itself</h2><p>John 1:4 tells us that &#8220;in Him was life.&#8221; Not only was this the case; He Himself was life (14:6) and came to bring us life (10:10). Further than this, Paul describes Him as &#8220;Christ, who is our life&#8221; (Col. 3:4). Life, then, is this Person.<h2 class=head1>THE TREE OF LIFE IN REVELATION</h2><p>Here is the first promise given to the overcomers: &#8220;To him who overcomes, to him I will give to eat of the tree of life, which is in the paradise of God&#8221; (Rev. 2:7). The tree of life is here again offered to man. Due to the fall the tree of life was closed to him. Throughout the redemption of Christ, the way to touch the tree of life has been reopened (Heb. 10:19-20).<p>In the last chapter there is the description of the tree of life growing on the two sides of the river (22:2). Because this tree grows in the river of water of life, the tree is no doubt included in the final invitation to man, &#8220;Let him who is thirsty also come; he who wills, let him take the water of life freely&#8221; (v. 17). By taking the water of life, surely you will get the tree of life growing in it.<p>From verse 14 we can see that the believers who wash their robes have the right to enjoy the tree of life as their eternal portion in the holy city.<p>Finally, in verse 19 a solemn warning is given that anyone who takes away from the prophecy will lose his part in the tree of life and in the holy city. From these verses we may infer that the tree of life is one of the outstanding features of the eternal blessing.<h2 class=head1>GOD&#8217;S THOUGHT FOR MAN</h2><p>Do not lose sight of God&#8217;s intention for man as represented by this tree: God wants you to take Him as your life. By eating of this tree, man would have the divine life. What you eat is taken into you and becomes part of you. The tree of life signifies the Prince, the Originator, the Author, of life- Jesus Christ, God Himself, as our life.<h2 class=head1>AN EDIBLE, DRINKABLE LIFE</h2><p>The symbolism in Genesis of the tree of life finds its explanation and fulfillment in the Gospel of John. As Adam was offered the divine life if he would eat of the tree of life, so, when Christ came, man was for the second time presented with God&#8217;s life and told that it could be received by eating. It was to make this point that the Lord Jesus in chapter six talked so much about Himself as &#8220;the true bread out of heaven&#8221; (v. 32). He said, &#8220;I am the bread of life; he who comes to Me shall by no means hunger, and he who believes in Me shall by no means ever thirst....For this is the will of My Father, that every one who sees the Son and believes in Him shall have eternal life....I am the living bread which came down out of heaven; if anyone eats of this bread, he shall live forever....He who eats Me shall also live because of Me&#8221; (vv. 35, 40, 51, 57). It is so clear that the way the Lord is to be received is by eating.<p>In the very next chapter He speaks further of Himself as the One who is drinkable as well as edible. &#8220;If anyone thirst, let him come to Me and drink. He who believes in Me, as the Scripture said, out of his innermost being shall flow rivers of living water&#8221; (7:37-38).<h2 class=head1>THE WAY TO EAT AND DRINK HIM</h2><p>When I was still a child, I heard that Christ is the bread of life. I recall wondering even back then how to eat Him, but no one gave me even a hint. Then when I was about twenty, a renowned traveling preacher came to town. I still remember the message he gave on John 10:10 about the more abundant life. But he left me with no impression of how I could have such a life.<p>Christ is invisible, abstract, and mysterious. Even our physical life is mysterious and invisible. There is ample evidence that we are alive, but the life itself cannot be seen. Christ may be present with us and be in us, but we cannot see Him or touch Him in a physical way.<p>We need to be clear, furthermore, that this mysterious One is nothing other than God Himself. Do not think that besides Christ, there is God. Christ is God. Romans 9:5 describes Him as &#8220;the Christ, Who is over all, God blessed forever.&#8221; Christ is also the Spirit (2 Cor. 3:17) and the Word (John 1:14).<p>The many terms used to describe Christ help us to understand how we can take Him as our life. He is the tree of life, the bread of life, the water of life, the Spirit of life (Rom. 8:2), and the Word of life (Phil. 2:16). The tree of life indicates the source. The bread of life indicates that this life is edible, and the water of life that it is drinkable. The Spirit of life refers to the Spirit of God, while the Word of life reminds us that this life can be found in the Bible, the Word of God.<p>Surely we can all testify that when we touch the word of the Bible in spirit, we find Christ. Wherever we turn in the Bible, Christ is there. This Christ in the Word is our food. &#8220;Man shall not live on bread alone, but on every word that proceeds out through the mouth of God&#8221; (Matt. 4:4). To live on the words that proceed from God&#8217;s mouth is to live by Christ, for He is the living Word out of the mouth of God.<p>Be sure you have a good spiritual breakfast every morning by prayerfully reading this book. You must put this ahead of every other duty or demand on your time. The way to eat Christ is to open to receive Him in His Word. Do this several times a day. You will be nourished, strengthened, comforted, and built up. The Bible is an inexhaustible mine of riches. The more you read it, the more you will value it.<p>How do we enjoy Christ as the water of life? He is not only the Word for us to eat, but also the Spirit for us to drink. Spiritual drinking or breathing is praying. Mingle your reading of the Bible with prayer. Instead of making up prayers, repeat the words of the Scripture you read as your prayer. As you make pray-reading the Word your habit, you will be full of both food and water.<h2 class=head1>DOING EVERYTHING WITH CHRIST</h2><p>In times past you may have tried to find out the Lord&#8217;s will for your life. You may have been concerned to distinguish between right and wrong. You may have spent time praying about what you should do and should not do. Dear ones, drop this kind of attitude. It is in the realm of the Old Testament commandments.<p>Turn from that way to pay your full attention to Christ. If you are going to speak, don&#8217;t ask, &#8220;Lord, is it Your will that I speak? Lord, what should I say?&#8221; Rather pray in a simple way, &#8220;Lord, are You going to speak? I do not care for right and wrong, for speaking or not speaking. I only care that it is You that is speaking.&#8221; If you are at an end regarding your wife, pray, &#8220;Lord, I&#8217;m getting mad at my wife. Are You mad at her too?&#8221; He will not be; thus the door will be closed on your anger.<p>Learn not to do anything without the Lord. Do everything with Him. In God&#8217;s economy it is not a question of what to do and what not to do. The vital question is, who does it-you or He? Even love, if it springs from you, is not acceptable to God. Whether it is love or hate, it must be Christ who is loving or hating.<h2 class=head1>THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE TREE OF LIFE</h2><p>Why does the tree of life still appear in the closing book of the Bible? God wants to remind us that His intention for man will surely be realized. Man&#8217;s disobedience caused only a temporary interruption. God&#8217;s unchanging desire is to be received into His creature as food that the two may be one. His thought was not that man might behave decently and honor Him as the Creator with suitable worship. No! The tree was there declaring, &#8220;Here is God&#8217;s life. Take this life into you and live by it.&#8221;<p>When Christ came, once again God was presenting Himself to man in an edible form. &#8220;He who eats Me shall also live because of Me&#8221; (John 6:57). What we eat is assimilated by our bodies and becomes part of us. In a similar way, by receiving God&#8217;s life into us, He becomes us and we become His expression.<p>We partake of the tree of life when we open to receive Christ in His Word. He is our food and drink even in the New Jerusalem.<h1 class=msg>CHAPTER TWENTY-SEVEN</h1><h1 class=msg>EATING IN EXODUS</h1><p>The marvelous picture of the man created in God&#8217;s image was soon marred. Man fell, and by the end of Genesis he was &#8220;in a coffin in Egypt&#8221; (50:26). Instead of enjoying the tree of life, he was dead and in the world.<p>How grateful we are for Exodus! Exodus means departure, and in this second book of the Bible we find the way to get out of the coffin and out of Egypt.<h2 class=head1>UNDER CONDEMNATION AND TYRANNY</h2><p>How was man to escape from his sorry plight? In Egypt he was under God&#8217;s condemnation and Pharaoh&#8217;s tyranny. He had disobeyed God, and he had been enslaved by the Egyptians. What would be the means of his deliverance?<h2 class=head1>THE PASSOVER</h2><p>To be released from God&#8217;s condemnation and to be strengthened to leave Egypt, we need the Passover. First Corinthians 5:7 says that &#8220;Christ our passover is sacrificed for us.&#8221; The Passover was a feast in which the children of Israel ate roast lamb, unleavened bread, and bitter herbs. All three of these picture Christ for us.<h2 class=head2>The Lamb</h2><h2 class=head3>The Blood</h2><p>The lamb was first killed, and then its blood was put on the two side posts and on the upper doorpost of the houses in which it was to be eaten (Exo. 12:6-7). God said, &#8220;When I see the blood, I will pass over you&#8221; (v. 13). The Israelites were sheltered by entering the blood-sprinkled house. Today we too have a free entry into the shelter through the redeeming blood of Christ and are under the covering of His blood. How we praise the Lord for the blood, which releases us from God&#8217;s condemnation!<p>To be strengthened to leave Egypt the Israelites had to do more than sprinkle the blood over their door entrance. The house needed to be protected so that they could eat the lamb.<p>Notice the three parts of the lamb to be eaten. &#8220;Eat not of it raw, nor sodden at all with water, but roast with fire; his head with his legs, and with the purtenance thereof&#8221; (v. 9). Too many Christians have an oversimplified Passover, consisting only of the blood. We surely appreciate the blood, which keeps us from God&#8217;s judgment when His smiting hand strikes Egypt. But once we have the blood, we must eat the lamb under this shelter. The Israelites were to &#8220;eat the flesh in that night, roast with fire, and unleavened bread; and with bitter herbs they shall eat it&#8221; (v. 8). Once they were full of this rich meal of lamb, unleavened bread, and bitter herbs, they would be energized to march out of Egypt. This nourishing meal strengthens us to walk out from under the tyranny of Satan.<h2 class=head3>The Head</h2><p>The first part of the lamb mentioned for eating was the head. This signifies that we need to eat Christ as our wisdom. When we eat the wise Christ, we can see the way out of Satan&#8217;s maze. The world is a maze, deceiving us with its false hopes and allurements. We are trapped in it until we receive Christ and eat Him as the wise head. Then we can see the way to slip out of its clutches and be delivered from its temptations. To walk out of the world, we need the wisdom of Christ; He has to be our wise nourishment.<h2 class=head3>The Legs</h2><p>Eating the legs of the lamb is a reminder to us that we need to eat Christ in His walk on this earth. Eating the legs strengthens us to walk out of Egypt. Leaving Egypt required strong legs. The children of Israel did not pursue a direct route. They curved around before reaching the shores of the Red Sea. Then, when they looked behind, they found the Egyptians in hot pursuit. On either side of them were mountains. Any way of escape seemed completely cut off. How they needed the wisdom from eating the head of the lamb and the walking strength from eating its legs! This was the source of their strength for walking on dry land through the Red Sea, with its waters a wall to them on their right hand and on their left.<h2 class=head3>The Inward Parts</h2><p>The last part of the lamb the children of Israel were told to eat was its inward parts (translated purtenance). The inward parts of Christ are His emotion, mind, will, and heart. We need to learn to read the four Gospels with a view to eating Christ in His wisdom, walk, and inward parts.<p>By eating Him in this way, He will be to us not only wisdom and strength to escape the snare of the world but also the patience, the long-suffering, and the strong will to sustain us.<h2 class=head2>Unleavened Bread</h2><p>Lamb was not the only food eaten at the Passover. Unleavened bread was one of the accompaniments. First Corinthians 5:8 says, &#8220;Therefore let us keep the feast, not with old leaven, neither with the leaven of malice and wickedness; but with the unleavened bread of sincerity and truth.&#8221; Eating Christ as the unleavened bread keeps away all the sinful things, making us also unleavened, with nothing about us unclean in the eyes of God.<h2 class=head2>Bitter Herbs</h2><p>&#8220;With bitter herbs shall they eat it&#8221; (Exo. 12:8). This was the other accompaniment to the lamb, all together making a well-rounded meal. The effect of eating Christ as the bitter herbs is the bitter sense you have whenever you touch something sinful. If you go to a movie, or criticize your mother-in-law, or even think negatively about her, you will sense the bitter herbs working within you.<p>I believe that by now we are all clear that the way to get out of the coffin and out of Egypt is by eating. This the provision of the Passover makes apparent.<p>Even the manner of eating the Passover shows how closely it was related to their imminent departure. &#8220;And thus shall ye eat it; with your loins girded, your shoes on your feet, and your staff in your hand; and ye shall eat it in haste: it is the Lord&#8217;s passover&#8221; (12:11). It was not a leisurely, relaxing meal. They were on the alert, one hand grasping their staff and the other the pieces of roast lamb to be eaten. Thus they partook of the Passover, ready at a moment&#8217;s notice to make their exodus.<h2 class=head1>CELEBRATING</h2><p>Once the children of Israel were out of Egypt and across the Red Sea, they praised the Lord by singing and even dancing. &#8220;Then sang Moses and the children of Israel this song unto the Lord, and spake, saying, I will sing unto the Lord, for he hath triumphed gloriously....And Miriam the prophetess, the sister of Aaron, took a timbrel in her hand; and all the women went out after her with timbrels and with dances&#8221; (Exo. 15:1, 20). How was this glorious triumph accomplished? By the blood there was a complete redemption, and by the eating of the lamb, the unleavened bread, and the bitter herbs there was a perfect exodus. Thus have we too been redeemed from God&#8217;s condemnation and released from Satan&#8217;s tyranny.<p>Hallelujah for what the eating accomplishes!<h2 class=head1>EATING IN THE WILDERNESS</h2><p>After the Israelites left Egypt, they were sustained in the wilderness for forty years. As the Jews many years later told the Lord, &#8220;Our fathers ate the manna in the wilderness, as it is written, He gave them bread out of heaven to eat&#8221; (John 6:31; cf. Exo. 16:4, 15).<h2 class=head2>Bored with Manna</h2><p>Manna was their only food day after day. Not surprisingly, they soon wearied of such a monotonous diet. Their thoughts went back to Egypt, and they complained to Moses, &#8220;We remember the fish, which we did eat in Egypt freely; the cucumbers, and the melons, and the leeks, and the onions, and the garlic: But now our soul is dried away: there is nothing at all, besides this manna, before our eyes&#8221; (Num. 11:5-6).<p>These varied foods that came out of the water or out of the soil of Egypt were enjoyed not only by the Israelites and the Egyptians. Even you may have wearied of a constant diet of messages week after week and turned to the foods that Egypt had to offer. Rather than hearing about Christ and the church in message after message, some have promoted more entertaining meetings. Guitar playing, special singing, joking, and emotional stirrings are like leeks, onions, and garlic from Egypt&#8217;s soil. You may have enjoyed those meetings, but you must admit there was no manna.<h2 class=head2>Refreshed and Enlightened</h2><p>Now we have come back to the manna. Do not think Christ is boring! We must learn how to cook Him in appetizing ways.<p>&#8220;And when the dew that lay was gone up, behold, upon the face of the wilderness there lay a small round thing, as small as the hoar frost on the ground&#8221; (Exo. 16:14). With Christ there is the freshness of the dew. He is also as refreshing as the frost. In warm climates we miss the refreshing air that comes with frost. Such is Christ to us.<p>In verse 31 the manna is said to be &#8220;like coriander seed, white; and the taste of it was like wafers made with honey.&#8221; Numbers 11:7 adds, &#8220;And the color thereof was as the color of bdellium.&#8221; The color means appearance or, literally, eye. By eating Christ as the manna, you have eyes to see clearly. Consider how much light you have received since you came into the church and began receiving Christ as the manna. The eyes on the manna have given you a clear view. The bdellium mentioned here is a pearl of wood resin. It is transparent. If you have kept enjoying this manna, you have had a clear sky, with no opaqueness or blindness. But if you have found in the meetings a lack of direction, the aimlessness may have come from eating the onions, leeks, and garlic of Egypt; the effect of that diet is to blind you.<p>&#8220;And the people went about, and gathered it, and ground it in mills, or beat it in a mortar, and baked it in pans, and made cakes of it: and the taste of it was as the taste of fresh oil&#8221; (Num. 11:8). There are different ways of preparing the manna. We all have to experience Christ and then learn to serve the saints delicious courses of Him. In this way we eat the rich supply of manna.<h2 class=head2>Quails</h2><p>&#8220;And the children of Israel did eat manna forty years, until they came to a land inhabited: they did eat manna, until they came unto the borders of the land of Canaan&#8221; (Exo. 16:35). Manna was the food with which God supplied His people throughout their wilderness wanderings.<p>You probably remember the occasion when, because of their complaining, God sent quails for them to eat. In response to their cry, &#8220;Who shall give us flesh to eat?&#8221; (Num. 11:4) &#8220;there went forth a wind from the Lord, and brought quails from the sea, and let them fall by the camp, as it were a day&#8217;s journey on this side, and as it were a day&#8217;s journey on the other side, round about the camp, and as it were two cubits high upon the face of the earth&#8221; (v. 31). The quails were eaten in rebellion and provoked God&#8217;s judgment. &#8220;While the flesh was yet between their teeth, ere it was chewed, the wrath of the Lord was kindled against the people, and the Lord smote the people with a very great plague&#8221; (v. 33).<p>This incident has reminded me of these recent years in the recovery. After hearing so much about the need to have Christ wrought into us, some turned away from that, claiming it was too hard to listen to, and encouraged the young people to be themselves rather than be transformed. To replace the manna with quails from the sea is rebellion. God&#8217;s ordination is that we eat manna day after day.<h2 class=head1>THE TASK IN THE WILDERNESS</h2><p>What occupied the children of Israel during those forty years? There was no industry. How did they spend their time when they were not traveling? They began their day before sunrise, gathering the manna. In addition to preparing and eating it, they first built the tabernacle and then carried it all during their journey.<p>Here is a clear picture of what we should eat, what we should be, and what we should do. Our diet is Christ. We should be those who eat Him. We should build up the church to be the dwelling place of God and then carry it as His testimony wherever we go.<p>The worldly-wise might have thought the Israelites were lazy and purposeless. Why didn&#8217;t they settle in one place and farm? Then they could grow onions, leeks, and garlic, instead of having only manna to eat. Why did they do nothing but build a tabernacle and then carry it around with them?<p>In our day we may be criticized for not going to the mission field, for not engaging in this or that Christian work, or for not caring about the gospel. Why is it we keep meeting together and pay little attention to anything other than Christ and the church?<p>We do not want to follow the pattern set by Christianity. Rather, we would be like the Israelites of old, eating manna and caring for the tabernacle. If we have such a testimony, souls will be won. Lovers of the Lord Jesus will be attracted.<p>Young people, are you satisfied with such a life? Your living is to eat Christ. Your work is to build the church with Christ. Your testimony is to carry the church with Christ. This is God&#8217;s economy.<h2 class=head1>THE EXODUS ACCOMPLISHED</h2><p>In the previous message on the tree of life, we pointed out that God&#8217;s intention from the beginning was to be taken into man as food. In this message we have traced man&#8217;s failure and the steps God took to recover man from death and the world. This triumphant exodus from condemnation and tyranny was brought about by the eating of the Passover. Then for forty years in the wilderness God gave His people manna. By this nourishment the tabernacle was built and His testimony set up. The book of Exodus, then, again reminds us that God&#8217;s intention for man is to be his life, received in the form of food. When man thus partakes of Him, God&#8217;s habitation is built and His purpose realized.<h1 class=msg>CHAPTER TWENTY-EIGHT</h1><h1 class=msg>EATING IN THE GOOD LAND</h1><p>&#8220;And the manna ceased on the morrow after they had eaten of the old corn of the land; neither had the children of Israel manna any more; but they did eat of the fruit of the land of Canaan that year&#8221; (Josh. 5:12). Here is the third stage of eating in the life of God&#8217;s people.<p>The Christ we eat is first for our full salvation, as is depicted for us by the eating of the Passover. Not only does the blood provide us with redemption and release from God&#8217;s condemnation, but also, by eating of the lamb, the unleavened bread, and the bitter herbs, we are energized to walk out of Satan&#8217;s territory and cross the Red Sea. Full salvation includes redemption, regeneration with the life and nature of God, and deliverance from the world. Are you enjoying this full salvation, or are you still lingering in Egypt?<p>In the second stage we have Christ to sustain us on our wilderness journey. The eating of the manna is not for our salvation but for the building of God&#8217;s dwelling place and the carrying on of God&#8217;s testimony. Here in the church life we are eating Christ for the building up of the house of God.<p>In the previous message we covered these two stages.<h2 class=head1>THE THIRD STAGE</h2><p>In the Bible two is the number of testimony, not of completion. Our eating is not complete with just two stages. As 1 Thessalonians 5:23 says, for our whole sanctification we must be preserved in spirit and soul and body. While the eating in Egypt was good in that it strengthened us to make our exodus, the eating in the wilderness was better because the tabernacle resulted. Not until its erection did God&#8217;s glory descend from the heavens to fill the house for Him on earth.<p>To be in the third stage required that God&#8217;s people leave the wilderness, by crossing the Jordan River, and enter into Canaan, the land promised to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob as an inheritance for their children. It represented the promised goal of God.<p>What then is this third stage? It is eating for the house of God to be settled on a solid foundation. Instead of a movable, portable tabernacle, there was a temple constructed on a firm, settled base. This construction could not be done in the wilderness. The temple was built in the good land, and it meant that the kingdom of God was established, expressing God and His authority.<p>These are the three stages of eating, and they form a history of our Christian experience. Just as God is triune and man is tripartite, so our spiritual eating has only these three stages. Our spiritual growth depends upon our eating. Are you still eating lamb and bitter herbs? Is manna your daily food? Manna is the food for wanderers, those still in the wilderness of the soul. Are you in the good land, enjoying the produce of Canaan in your spirit?<p>You may find it hard to be sure which stage you are in. You may feel that even in one day your experience can shift back and forth from the good land to Egypt or to the wilderness. However, if you have ever tasted the experience of being in the good land, declare by faith that that is where you are. Do not believe Satan&#8217;s lie that you have slipped back.<h2 class=head1>A VARIETY</h2><p>While manna was the only food provided for the children of Israel in the wilderness, the produce of the good land was varied. It was &#8220;a land of wheat, and barley, and vines, and fig trees, and pomegranates; a land of oil olive, and honey; a land wherein thou shalt eat bread without scarceness&#8221; (Deut. 8:8-9). Not only was there this assortment of vegetables and fruits, but they had herds and flocks as well (12:6). It reminds me of what is offered in an American supermarket-the great variety of fruits, vegetables, and meats.<h2 class=head1>THE EATING OF THE COMMON PRODUCE</h2><p>From chapters twelve, fourteen, and sixteen of Deuteronomy it is clear that there were two kinds of eating in the good land. All the increase, whether from the field or from their flocks and herds, had to be divided into two parts. Ninety percent of it was the portion which belonged to the Israelites and could be eaten within their gates (Deut. 12:15). This we may call the common eating.<h2 class=head1>THE TOP PORTION</h2><p>The other ten percent, the tithe, had restrictions upon where it could be eaten. &#8220;Thou mayest not eat within thy gates the tithe of thy corn, or of thy wine, or of thy oil, or the firstlings of thy herds or of thy flock....But thou must eat them before the Lord thy God in the place which the Lord thy God shall choose&#8221; (12:17-18).<p>Suppose, for example, I am an Israelite with a herd of cows. When one of them has its first calf, I am not free to kill it and make a feast for my family, even though the herd belongs to me. I must save it until the time of the feast of tabernacles, the fifteenth day of the seventh month. If this same cow has a second calf, though, we are free to fatten it up, kill it, and make a feast for all our relatives.<p>The firstborn calf, along with the firstlings of all my flocks and herds and the tithe of my produce, I must take to the place &#8220;which the Lord your God shall choose to cause his name to dwell there; thither shall ye bring all that I command you; your burnt offerings, and your sacrifices, your tithes, and the heave offering of your hand&#8221; (Deut. 12:11). &#8220;In the fifteenth day of the seventh month, when ye have gathered in the fruit of the land, ye shall keep a feast unto the Lord seven days&#8221; (Lev. 23:39).<h2 class=head1>COMMON VS. SPECIAL ENJOYMENT</h2><p>The common eating within the gates is a type of the common enjoyment of Christ. We can feast on Him at home alone, or on the campus, or even meeting with a few others. This enjoyment of Christ may be precious, but, as many of you can testify, our highest enjoyment of Christ occurs in the church meetings. It is only here that we enjoy the top portion of Christ. This is the place where He has chosen to set His name and build His habitation. However good your home meeting or little fellowship group may be, it is not where God dwells. The habitation of God today is the church, and Mount Zion is today&#8217;s church meeting, where the tithes and offerings are to be presented.<h2 class=head1>NOT IN EVERY PLACE</h2><p>Eating Christ in the third stage involves not only His riches but also the matter of the oneness of God&#8217;s people. Once the children of Israel occupied the good land, it would have been easy for them to be separate from each other. What kept them in oneness was this requirement: &#8220;Take heed to thyself that thou offer not thy burnt offerings in every place that thou seest: But in the place which the Lord shall choose in one of thy tribes, there thou shalt offer thy burnt offerings, and there thou shalt do all that I command thee&#8221; (Deut. 12:13-14). All the males had to appear before the Lord three times a year in the place of His choosing (16:16) to celebrate the feasts with the rich produce of the land.<p>Suppose two neighbors had a disagreement and were no longer on speaking terms. Though most of the time they avoided each other, the day would come when they would both have to make the journey back to Jerusalem. By coming together on the highway to Zion they could settle their differences and join the others in declaring, &#8220;Behold, how good and how pleasant it is for brethren to dwell together in unity!&#8221; (Psa. 133:1). This was one of the songs of degrees that the Israelites chanted as they came together and ascended Mount Zion to present their offerings and to keep the feasts.<p>As we eat Christ, we shall find that we are brought into oneness with all the saints. We may be unhappy with certain brothers or sisters and decide to discontinue attending the church meetings. We may say that God&#8217;s presence is everywhere and that we can enjoy Christ at home. But the extra portion of the enjoyment of Christ cannot be ours apart from the church meetings. If we try to have both the common and the particular portions of Christ in the place where we choose, the oneness is damaged. However disgruntled we may feel about things in the church, we must meet with the saints. The habitation of God is the church, not our little fellowship group. We must all meet in the place where God has chosen to cause His name to dwell.<h2 class=head1>LABOR</h2><p>The produce of the good land did not rain down from heaven as the manna had done. The children of Israel had to till the soil, sow the seed, keep the ground watered, and get rid of damaging insects. Then when harvest time came, they had to reap the crop.<p>Christ is our good land. Day by day we must labor on Him. We begin with morning watch, tilling the ground and sowing Him as the seed. Sometimes we just water the crops and kill some snails. During the day we keep laboring on Him by experiencing, enjoying, and partaking of Him. We also snatch a few minutes now and then throughout the day to read a chapter in the Word.<p>By such faithful laboring, we gradually accumulate the rich experiences of Christ. Then we bring our surplus to the meetings. The Israelites had only three feasts yearly. We do not have to wait that long! We have at least three meetings a week, every one of them a feast, to which we may come, not empty-handed, but laden with the experience of Christ. &#8220;They shall not appear before the Lord empty: Every man shall give as he is able, according to the blessing of the Lord thy God which he hath given thee&#8221; (Deut. 16:16-17).<h2 class=head1>WORSHIP</h2><p>Of the five books of Moses, only Genesis gives no instruction on the way to worship. The other four deal at considerable length on the worship and service of God. The natural concept is that to worship God we must bow down, kneel, or prostrate ourselves. This was the custom of the nations surrounding Israel (Exo. 23:24). But the instruction given to the children of Israel was to bring their rich produce, offer it to God, and then eat it with one another in His presence and with Him. What they offered was both their food and God&#8217;s. The eating in God&#8217;s presence is worship.<p>The more we come together with our hands full of Christ, the more we offer Him to God and enjoy Him in the presence of God, the more we are worshipping Him. Our Father God desires the worship which is our eating of the Son. God is happy when we are in His presence enjoying His Son.<p>In John 4 the Lord Jesus linked worship to God with drinking of Him. After the Lord told the Samaritan woman, &#8220;Whoever drinks of the water that I shall give him shall by no means thirst forever&#8221; (v. 14), she turned the subject to the matter of worship. The Lord&#8217;s reply was, &#8220;An hour is coming when neither in this mountain nor in Jerusalem shall you worship the Father. An hour is coming, and now is, when the true worshippers shall worship the Father in spirit and reality; for the Father seeks such to worship Him&#8221; (vv. 21, 23). Our spirit is Jerusalem, God&#8217;s habitation (Eph. 2:22), and it is here that we worship God, not by prostrating ourselves before Him, but by enjoying Christ as the reality. This drinking of Him is the real worship to God.<h2 class=head1>THE MEETINGS</h2><p>We offer the Christ we have experienced in our daily walk whenever we come to the meetings. Do not think musical instruments are a necessary part of our worship. Music is not the reality. The reality is found in our spirit, in the very Christ whom we have experienced. These experiences are the rich produce of the good land. It may be that sometimes our meetings will have no singing or even praying, but only rich testimonies from our daily life. The bountiful produce will be heaped up before the Lord. The testimonies may be quite short, yet because they come from the riches in the spirit, they may be more than a testimony. What we say as a testimony may be in the form of a prayer or may be an offering of praise.<p>What form the meeting will take cannot be predicted. Each one may be different. Surely some meetings during the first century were like what we have described. We do not try to arrange different styles of meeting. How the meetings are comes out of how we are. We live a certain way, and we meet this same way. We do not come together to perform but to bring an overflow of the rich Christ we have been enjoying. It is thus that we eat Christ together in the presence of God.<p>How good it will be when all the churches are like this! Today we are still under the influence of degraded Christianity, with the singing of hymns and praying as part of our form of meeting. The Bible does not give us a ritual way to meet. No formal way is prescribed for our coming together. We should be like the children of Israel coming together in ancient times to the unique place, Jerusalem, with all the rich produce of the good land; that is to say, we come to the spirit, offering our rich experiences of Christ. Whether we sing is not at issue. We may spend a whole meeting only singing, if the Lord so leads. What concerns us is only that we meet in spirit and with the riches of Christ.<p>When we share our experiences, we should not do so in a scattered way. Because we all have such bountiful and varied experiences, what we say should follow the line of the one who preceded us. We cannot have a feast with an odd assortment of groceries that don&#8217;t fit together!<p>If our meetings are full of such an attractive Christ, those who come will be convinced, subdued, and captured. It is not exciting meetings which gain others. Christ Himself is the attracting factor-not a Christ in doctrine but One whom we experience.<h2 class=head1>THE GOAL OF THE LORD&#8217;S RECOVERY</h2><p>The third stage of eating is complicated. There is the common way of eating together within our gates of the riches of the good land. There is also the particular way of bringing our tithes to the chosen place to eat before the Lord in order to keep the oneness of God&#8217;s people. Further, this stage of eating requires that we labor, not just gather what has fallen from heaven. Finally, we must worship the Father by bringing all the rich variety of the experiences of Christ to the meetings and presenting them to God and to His people.<p>This third stage is the one which accomplishes God&#8217;s purpose. This is our goal, toward which we must aim, in the Lord&#8217;s recovery. Thus the church life will be produced, God&#8217;s kingdom established, and His temple solidly built up.<h1 class=msg>CHAPTER TWENTY-NINE</h1><h1 class=msg>EATING IN THE GOSPELS</h1><p>One of the complaints brought against the Lord Jesus was, &#8220;This man receiveth sinners, and eateth with them&#8221; (Luke 15:2). This criticism of His eating with sinners drew forth the three parables in Luke 15. The publicans and sinners were the lowest class in Jewish society. The publicans were Jews who collected taxes from their countrymen for the Roman Empire. They were much despised for their disloyalty and dishonesty. Yet Jesus chose to feast with them and with those who were commonly called sinners. This eating declared that the Savior would not only save them but also spread a feast for them. Such behavior offended the Pharisees and scribes, who were part of high society in Jewish culture.<p>Who is eligible for God&#8217;s salvation? What standing do you take when you come for salvation? God does not offer salvation to Pharisees, nor kings, nor presidents, nor even gentlemen. Salvation is only for those who come down and take the position of sinners.<h2 class=head1>THREE PARABLES</h2><p>These three parables give us a threefold picture of God&#8217;s seeking of man, with the last one the consummate one. The parable of the lost sheep tells how the shepherd leaves his ninety-nine sheep and goes in search of the one missing. This is a picture of the Son as the good Shepherd, accomplishing redemption for us. In the second parable the woman lights a candle and sweeps her house in order to find her lost coin. We sinners, chosen by God, are the coin. We were God&#8217;s possession, but we got lost. The woman is the Holy Spirit, sent to enlighten the house, our inner chamber, in order to find us. The last parable, that of the prodigal son, brings in the Father, who received the returned sinner.<p>The Spirit&#8217;s enlightening work is based on the foundation of the Son&#8217;s redemption, just as the Father&#8217;s receiving of the repentant sinner is the fruit of the Spirit&#8217;s seeking.<p>As we pointed out in the previous message, it was not until the third stage of eating that the promised goal of God came into view. The two earlier stages were not complete without it. With these three parables, the same principle applies. Not until we come to the third parable do we see a complete salvation.<h2 class=head1>A REPENTANT SINNER</h2><p>A son left his father, squandered his inheritance, and eventually found himself in the fields feeding pigs while he himself was starving. He returned to his father in repentance, saying, &#8220;Father, I have sinned against heaven, and in thy sight, and am no more worthy to be called thy son&#8221; (Luke 15:21).<p>The father&#8217;s reception of his son illustrates the full salvation which is ours in Christ.<h2 class=head1>THE BEST ROBE</h2><p>The prodigal son came home as a beggar, with bare feet and pathetic in every respect. Yet &#8220;when he was yet a great way off, his father saw him, and had compassion, and ran, and fell on his neck, and kissed him&#8221; (v. 20). Interrupting the son&#8217;s confession that he had sinned and was no more worthy to be called a son, &#8220;the father said to his servants, Bring forth the best robe [lit., a robe, the first], and put it on him; and put a ring on his hand, and shoes on his feet&#8221; (v. 22).<p>The way the father referred to this robe makes it seem likely that he had especially prepared it beforehand for the son to wear whenever he might return. By being covered with this robe, he was qualified to enter the father&#8217;s splendid home, no more a beggar but a justified son, matching his father in an outward way.<p>The best robe signifies Christ as our righteousness, covering us and justifying us in the eyes of God. But notice that the robe only takes care of the outward cover. It represents an objective righteousness; Christ is not within us at this point.<h2 class=head1>THE RING</h2><p>The servants were also told to put a ring on the son&#8217;s hand. This is a picture of our being sealed with the Holy Spirit (Eph. 1:13; 4:30). The ring is like the Holy Spirit, given to us as a guarantee that we are the Father&#8217;s possession.<h2 class=head1>THE SHOES</h2><p>The shoes put on the returning son&#8217;s feet are not the same as those referred to in Ephesians 6:15. In Ephesians the shoes are for standing and withstanding in battle, but in Luke 15 the shoes are for walking, for protecting the feet from the dust, dirt, and mud that come from contact with this earth.<h2 class=head1>THE FATTED CALF</h2><p>Do you think the son was satisfied with the best robe, the ring, and the shoes? Surely he appreciated looking so fine, but he had not returned home to replace his shabby clothes. Rather, it was because of his desperate hunger that his thoughts had turned homeward, and he had said, &#8220;How many hired servants of my father&#8217;s have bread enough and to spare, and I perish with hunger! I will arise and go to my father&#8221; (Luke 15:17-18). No outward apparel could fill his empty stomach. How glad he must have been to hear his father add, &#8220;And bring hither the fatted calf, and kill it; and let us eat, and be merry&#8221; (v. 23)! The father was not content either, until they could eat together and rejoice.<p>God&#8217;s salvation is not only a matter of wearing but also of eating. Whatever kind of raiment we put on and however many times we wash ourselves, our inner being is not changed.<p>The fatted calf was not for wearing but for eating! Eating is the taking of something which is outside of you into you and then digesting it so that it becomes organically part of you. If you swallow a pearl, you cannot claim to have eaten it, because it cannot be digested by your body. The fatted calf, in contrast, can be eaten. It can be taken into your being and then assimilated by the body. The result is a metabolic change in you. What you eat changes you organically and metabolically. The terms transformation, renewing, and sanctification refer to this change, which comes about not by improving your outward appearance but by taking in the food the Father has provided.<h2 class=head1>A PICTURE OF GOD&#8217;S ECONOMY</h2><p>Too many Christians do not realize how important their spiritual food is. Some seek the Lord for salvation or help in trouble. Their concept is to pray day and night until suddenly a miraculous experience befalls them. Then they expect a marvelous change. To hold such a thought is to be ignorant of God&#8217;s economy, which is pictured for us so vividly in this parable.<p>Christ&#8217;s death on the cross accomplished a threefold objective: the forgiveness of sins, the termination of the old man, and the release of the divine life. In resurrection He became the life-giving Spirit. When we heard the gospel, repented, and believed in Him, He, based upon His redemption and through the cleansing of His blood, entered into us as the life-giving Spirit. His righteousness covered us, qualifying us to be justified by God. The Spirit sealed us as God&#8217;s possession. The gospel separated us from the world. But, besides the robe, the ring, and the shoes, there is a fatted calf for us to enjoy!<h2 class=head2>Salvation</h2><p>Romans 10:6-10 reminds us that we can find Christ, not in heaven or in the abyss, but nearby, in our mouth and in our heart. By confessing with our mouth, &#8220;Lord Jesus,&#8221; we are saved. To open our mouth and pray in this way is to eat and be saved.<h2 class=head2>Joy</h2><p>&#8220;Let us eat, and be merry.&#8221; The joy came in the feasting on the fatted calf. Our salvation is one of eating. Christ is our fatted calf, our bread of life, to supply us and to bring us joy. In contrast to the robe, the ring, and the shoes, which are visible, the calf is eaten and disappears from sight. It is digested and assimilated to become part of the fibers of our being. Its effect on us is to strengthen, empower, sustain, support, comfort, and satisfy. Such is our subjective Savior to us. That is why eating brings joy.<h2 class=head2>Growth</h2><p>You are not changed by power or magic. Your present height is probably over five feet and your weight more than a hundred pounds. Were you born that size? Did you become that big by fasting for three days and then instantly change from infant to adult? By no means. Your growth came about gradually by regular eating. You could not have grown by eating pearls or diamonds, because they are not food and your body could not have digested them. The fatted calf is not an empty term. It is a picture that Christ satisfies us by being taken into us as food.<p>Day by day we cooperate with Him by opening to take Him in as we pray-read His Word. This is the way Christ is formed in us, makes His home in our hearts, and transforms us into His image from glory to glory. As you read the word for nourishment, take only a small portion at a time. Don&#8217;t try to swallow the fatted calf in one gulp! Four or five small meals a day is best for your gradual and steady spiritual growth.<p>Though the eating of Jesus is the focal point of the New Testament, it has been neglected by Christians. In 1958 the Lord began to recover this. In 1965 we had a series of messages in Los Angeles on the matter of eating. Right after that the Lord gave us pray-reading. How rich the pray-reading of the Word was in 1968 and 1969! I hope the saints will come back to this nourishing way of taking in the Word and will thus eat of Jesus as the fatted calf.<h2 class=head1>THE PROTEST</h2><p>The story of the prodigal son ends with the conversation between the father and the elder son. What made the elder son angry in the father&#8217;s treatment of the returned prodigal? Notice that the complaint was not about the robe, the ring, or the shoes, but &#8220;Thou hast killed for him the fatted calf&#8221; (Luke 15:30). The outward gifts of the father did not cause the elder son&#8217;s resentment. It was the killing of the fatted calf that enraged him.<p>Just as the Pharisees and scribes murmured that the Lord was eating with sinners, so in our day religious people are offended when they hear of eating Jesus. The objective teachings they do not oppose, but the subjective experience of Christ as our food they reject.<h2 class=head1>INVITED TO A FEAST</h2><p>There are other parables in the Gospels which also refer to eating. In Luke 14:16-24 there is the parable of the great supper, where those who were invited made excuses. Eventually the house was filled, not with them, but with the poor, the crippled, and even some who were compelled to attend. What a picture this is of how the chosen ones spurned the Lord&#8217;s offer of Himself as a feast!<p>Matthew 22:1-14 recounts that a king made a marriage feast for his son. When everything was ready-the oxen and the fatted beasts killed-the invited ones again would not attend, and others were found in the thoroughfares and invited instead. One of the guests at the table was found not to have on a marriage garment and was cast into outer darkness. The oxen and the fatted beasts refer to Christ, who was killed that God&#8217;s chosen people might enjoy Him as a feast. The Gentiles were sought in the thoroughfares after the Jews&#8217; rejection of Him. To enjoy the marriage feast requires not only the &#8220;best robe&#8221; but the marriage garment as well, a picture of Christ experienced as our subjective righteousness.<p>Notice how Christ portrays His coming, in both its first and second aspects, as a king&#8217;s marriage feast for his son. Christ came that His people might have their hunger satisfied by taking Him as their feast. That feast was opened to all when &#8220;those who were His own did not receive Him&#8221; (John 1:11). This feast in fullness will be enjoyed by the overcoming believers in the next age.<h2 class=head1>IN REMEMBRANCE OF HIM</h2><p>When the Lord was about to leave His disciples and return to the Father, He gave them a way to remember Him. &#8220;And he took bread, and gave thanks, and brake it, and gave unto them, saying, This is my body which is given for you: this do in remembrance of me. Likewise also the cup after supper, saying, This cup is the new testament in my blood, which is shed for you&#8221; (Luke 22:19-20). To remember the Lord, as we do from week to week at His table, is not a ritual, but a partaking of Him. The proper remembrance of Him is not to recall what He is and what He has done, but rather to take Him in. The Lord&#8217;s table is a testimony of our daily living. We come together on the first day of the week to break bread and thus declare to the universe that we live by eating and drinking Christ.<p>Day by day we eat the heavenly food, the fatted calf, Jesus Christ, the Son of the living God. It was He who said, &#8220;He who eats Me shall also live because of Me&#8221; (John 6:57). We live by what we eat, and eventually we become what we eat.<p>How regrettable it is that in Christianity the meaning of the Lord&#8217;s table has been lost. It is referred to as the Holy Communion, and there is no understanding of the meaning of the bread and the cup. The table signifies that the worship of God is by eating and drinking Him, not by bowing before Him. When we eat and drink Him, He will have the worship.<h2 class=head1>GOD&#8217;S PROVISION</h2><p>God&#8217;s economy is that His people should be an eating people. This was first symbolized by the tree of life, set in the garden for man to partake of. When man disobeyed and fell under Satan&#8217;s tyranny, God stepped in to redeem him by providing the Passover for him to eat of and thus be strengthened to make his exodus from Satan&#8217;s domain. In the good land God&#8217;s people labored to bring forth the rich produce, one tenth of which they reserved, along with the top portion, to eat before the Lord in their feasts. They were thus kept in oneness and sustained to build the temple for the expression of God&#8217;s authority.<p>In the Gospels eating again plays a prominent role. There is a fatted calf for the returning prodigal. There is a feast spread for God&#8217;s chosen people, who reject it and thus open the door for the Gentiles to partake of it. By these parables and also in His explicit word (John 6:35, 48-58), the Lord presented Himself as the true food given for the life of the world. This eating of Him is the true worship, symbolized by the remembrance of Him at His table.<p>I hope we are all persuaded that God&#8217;s primary concern for us is that we enjoy His Son as our food. This is the message of the Gospels.<h1 class=msg>CHAPTER THIRTY</h1><h1 class=msg>EATING IN THE EPISTLES AND REVELATION</h1><p>God is not interested in giving you instruction. He is not out to develop your personality. He does not care about your self-improvement program. He is not trying to make a better person out of you. Rather, He wants you to come to the dining table and feast! The dining table is the Bible. You need to come to it at least three times a day. By pray-reading this book you will be nourished by the rich Christ, and God will have a way to fulfill His purpose.<p>The matter of eating is alluded to many times in the Epistles and in Revelation. In these final books of the Bible we find the outcome of eating. From the previous messages I believe you have seen that God would have us take Christ Himself as our life supply into our being. Now we shall consider what happens to us when we thus receive Him.<h2 class=head1>THE RESULT OF FEEDING ON CHRIST</h2><h2 class=head2>God Expressed</h2><p>The Apostle Paul prayed, &#8220;That Christ may make His home in your hearts through faith...that you may be filled unto all the fullness of God&#8221; (Eph. 3:17, 19). The issue of our enjoying the riches of Christ is that we become His expression. When this unlimited One has been wrought into us so that He can make His home in our heart, fully possessing our mind, emotion, will, and conscience, we shall be filled. To be filled means to have something added into us. When we are filled with the riches of Christ, the result is the expression of God.<p>God is not expressed by our good behavior, nor by our doctrinal knowledge, nor by our self-improvement. His expression is solely the result of our receiving the riches of His Son by eating. This organic, subjective receiving results in Christ&#8217;s becoming part of us, similar to the way our digested and assimilated food becomes part of us.<p>When Paul said, &#8220;To me to live is Christ,&#8221; He was describing the outcome of his day-by-day eating of Jesus. The result, then, of feeding on Christ is that God is expressed.<h2 class=head2>Renewed and Transformed</h2><p>&#8220;And do not be conformed to this age, but be transformed by the renewing of the mind, that you may prove by testing what the will of God is&#8221; (Rom. 12:2). This verse gives us another result of our taking Christ into us as food: we are transformed. I like the word transformed. There is no religion which aims at transforming us. At best, religion&#8217;s goal is to develop or improve what we are. This is not the case with God&#8217;s salvation. He has no interest in helping us to be better behaved. His desire is to add something into us which formerly was not there. We were born with only a human life; when the divine life is added into our being, transformation can be accomplished.<p>The renewing and transforming can be likened to grafting. Paul used grafting as an illustration of God&#8217;s salvation in Romans 11:17-24. We were the wild olive tree, grafted into the cultivated olive tree.<p>Grafting is an organic mingling. This is what our Christian life is. Bible teachers have called it an exchanged life, but this is the wrong way to describe it. We do not hand our poor life over to Christ for Him to discard and have Him give us His life to treasure. No transformation would be involved if that were what happened. Rather, we have been grafted into Christ, and Christ has been grafted into us. We are being transformed, not only by Christ, but also with Him.<h2 class=head1>&#8220;I HAVE FED YOU&#8221;</h2><p>When Paul wrote of how he had cared for the Corinthian believers, he said, &#8220;I have fed you with milk, and not with meat&#8221; (1 Cor. 3:2). The way Paul took care of the Corinthians was not to teach them but to feed them. Yes, there are verses which mention teaching and learning, but there is this concept here that the believers need to be fed.<p>In verse 6, Paul said, &#8220;I have planted, Apollos watered; but God gave the growth&#8221; (Gk.). Our need is for growth, not for an improvement in behavior. Where do the gold, silver, and precious stones, mentioned in verse 12, come from? Our nature by birth is wood, hay, and stubble; that we are now in the nature and form of gold, silver, and precious stones indicates that we have been transformed.<p>We may feel like wood, hay, and stubble most of the time, but be strong in faith. We are in the process of transformation. Declare to Satan, &#8220;I am in the process of being transformed into gold, silver, and precious stones. Even if it takes a long time, my God is not worried about time. To Him a thousand years are as one day.&#8221; In the Lord&#8217;s recovery, we have the planting and the watering. Be assured that the growth is coming. Be ready to welcome it.<h2 class=head1>BEHOLDING AND REFLECTING</h2><p>Second Corinthians 3:18 gives us another picture of how this transformation comes about. &#8220;But we all, with unveiled face beholding and reflecting as a mirror the glory of the Lord, are being transformed into the same image, from glory to glory, as from the Lord Spirit&#8221; (2 Cor. 3:18, Gk.). How are we all being transformed into the same image? We must first ask the Lord to remove any veils from us that we may behold Him openly. The thought in this verse is that we are a mirror, facing Christ. As we behold and reflect Him, we are transformed into His image. The more we behold and reflect Him, the more He comes into us and changes us, from one degree of glory to another. In this beholding, His element is being added to us, just as the grafted branch receives the life juices from the better tree to which it has been grafted.<p>Stay in the church life to be part of the beholding and reflecting mirror, and to be the grafted branch, absorbing the life supply which flows from the better tree! Over the years I have seen the saints being transformed from one degree of glory to another as from the Lord Spirit. Day by day the Lord has been adding Himself to us, and we are being transformed.<h2 class=head1>WHOLLY SANCTIFIED</h2><p>&#8220;And the very God of peace sanctify you wholly; and I pray God your whole spirit and soul and body be preserved blameless unto the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ&#8221; (1 Thes. 5:23). God as the life-giving Spirit comes into the center of your being, your spirit, and begins to saturate you. This saturating sanctifies you. This twofold process gradually spreads outward into the surrounding soul, and from there it encompasses even your body. When your body is sanctified, you are mature and ready to be raptured.<p>To be raptured is to be reaped. Christ, the heavenly Farmer, is coming to reap us. But first we must grow, so that we are no longer so green and tender. To grow is to be saturated with the element of God. When we are fully sanctified, from the spirit through the soul and out to the body, we are ready to be reaped, for we shall then be completely transformed into His image. The sanctifying and saturating are even now going on within us.<h2 class=head1>MILK AND SOLID FOOD</h2><p>The thought in Hebrews 5:12-14 is similar to that in 1 Corinthians 3:2. The believers could only take milk, though it was time that they were ready for solid food.<p>In 1 Peter 2:2 the believers were told to long for the Word the way an infant does for milk, &#8220;that ye may grow thereby unto salvation&#8221; (Gk.). For them to grow up unto salvation was for them to be transformed from clay to living stones. The result of their getting the nourishing milk would be not only transformation but also building. &#8220;Ye also, as living stones, are being built up a spiritual house&#8221; (v. 5, Gk.). The result of our eating is that the church is built.<h2 class=head1>THE CULMINATION</h2><h2 class=head2>Food for Overcomers</h2><p>At the end of the Bible, the food that is offered to God&#8217;s people is the very food presented to man at the beginning. &#8220;To him who overcomes, to him I will give to eat of the tree of life, which is in the paradise of God&#8221; (Rev. 2:7). Overcoming in these epistles to the churches at the end of the first century means allowing nothing in the frustrating, degraded environment of Christianity to keep us from eating. The reward to the overcomers is to eat of the Lord as the tree of life in the paradise of God. This is an incentive for us to leave the knowledge and teachings of religion and return to enjoying Him.<p>In the epistle to the church in Pergamos the Lord promises the overcomers to eat of &#8220;the hidden manna&#8221; (2:17). A portion of the manna, the food of the children of Israel in the wilderness, was preserved in a golden pot concealed in the ark (Exo. 16:32-34; Heb. 9:4). The hidden manna, signifying the hidden Christ, is a special portion reserved for those of His seekers who overcome the degradation of the worldly church. While the church goes the way of the world, these overcomers come forward to abide in the presence of God in the Holy of Holies, where they enjoy the hidden Christ as a special portion for their daily supply. May we all be among those who seek the Lord, overcome the degradation of the worldly church, and enjoy Him as a special portion today. Then in the coming kingdom He as the hidden manna will be a reward to us.<p>A further promise to the overcomers in Pergamos is: &#8220;And I will give him a white stone, and on the stone a new name written, which no one knows but he who receives it&#8221; (Rev. 2:17). By eating of the hidden manna we are transformed into a white stone for God&#8217;s building. Here again eating is linked to transformation and building.<p>The call to the overcomers in Laodicea is: &#8220;Behold, I stand at the door and knock; if anyone hears My voice and opens the door, I will come in to him and dine with him and he with Me&#8221; (3:20). To dine is to eat a full meal, not just a snack. This promise suggests the eating of the rich produce of the land of Canaan by the children of Israel. Christ is a rich meal to us.<p>The Lord in these closing epistles steps into the degraded situation of the churches and seeks to recover the proper eating of Himself as our food supply. His people have been distracted from taking Him in as their food to the teaching of doctrines for knowledge. Thus He turns their focus to eating.<h2 class=head2>In Eternity</h2><p>In the last chapter of the Bible the tree of life appears again. &#8220;And on this side and on that side of the river was the tree of life, producing twelve fruits, yielding its fruit each month, and the leaves of the tree are for the healing of the nations&#8221; (Rev. 22:2). Even the final promise in the Bible concerns eating. &#8220;Blessed are those who wash their robes, that they may have right to the tree of life, and may enter by the gates into the city&#8221; (v. 14). The right to the tree of life means the enjoyment of Christ for eternity. It is the portion of those who keep their conduct clean through the cleansing of the blood of the Lamb.<h2 class=head1>EATING THROUGHOUT THE BIBLE</h2><p>In these five messages we have surveyed the subject of eating from Genesis to Revelation. In every stage of God&#8217;s relationship with man-in the garden of Eden, in Egyptian bondage, in the wilderness wanderings, in the good land, when Christ was on earth, when the churches were being established, in the millennial kingdom, and in the New Jerusalem-He made provision for His people&#8217;s eating.<p>This same concern about what we eat should mark us as Christians. Day by day we need to come to the Word and, by praying over what we read, take in the very Christ as our food. He Himself is our tree of life, our Passover, our manna, our good land, our fatted calf, our heavenly food.<p>Only by taking Him into us can God&#8217;s purpose be accomplished. God is expressed, not by our good behavior, but as an outcome of our assimilating the riches of His Son. It is by the intake of this food that we are transformed into His very image. He thus saturates and sanctifies us, cleansing us &#8220;by the washing of the water in the word, that He might present the church to Himself glorious, not having spot or wrinkle or any such things, but that she should be holy and without blemish&#8221; (Eph. 5:26-27).<p>In the writings of Paul, Peter, and John the thought keeps recurring that God&#8217;s people must be fed rather than given doctrinal knowledge. They first must desire milk and then go on to solid food. At the end, eating of the tree of life again comes into view, firstly as a reward for the overcoming believers during the millennium and then for the enjoyment of all God&#8217;s people for eternity.<h2 class=head1>EATING THROUGHOUT THE DAY</h2><p>May we be those who faithfully eat of this feast which God has so richly spread for us. The Bible is the means by which we feed on Christ. By our coming to this Word in a regular way and opening to Him, He will spread throughout our being until eventually our body too will be sanctified and we shall be raptured to His presence.<p>Eating is the way by which we are &#8220;filled unto all the fullness of God.&#8221; We must not let anything distract us from routinely coming to the dining table of the Word several times a day to take in its rich nourishment. Then we shall be transformed from vessels of clay to precious stones and be built up into His habitation. &#8220;I commend you to God, and to the word of his grace, which is able to build you up&#8221; (Acts 20:32).<h1 class=msg>CHAPTER THIRTY-ONE</h1><h1 class=msg>THE HEAVENLY VISION</h1><p>&#8220;Who art thou, Lord?&#8221; (Acts 9:5). This question was asked by Saul of Tarsus when his journey to Damascus was interrupted by a light &#8220;above the brightness of the sun&#8221; (26:13) and by a voice &#8220;saying in the Hebrew tongue, Saul, Saul, why persecutest thou me?&#8221; (v. 14). At the time of this encounter Saul was no heathen, but rather a zealous, religious Jew. He was earnestly following the traditions of his forefathers, who had for generations worshipped God according to the Old Testament. As he later described himself, he was &#8220;above many my equals in mine own nation, being more exceedingly zealous of the traditions of my fathers&#8221; (Gal. 1:14).<h2 class=head1>&#8220;THE SECT OF THE NAZARENES&#8221;</h2><p>In Saul&#8217;s time, something new arose in addition to the Jewish religion. Those who believed in this new way were referred to by their opposers as &#8220;the sect of the Nazarenes&#8221; (Acts 24:5), because of Jesus of Nazareth. Saul was enraged at the claims of this &#8220;sect&#8221; and alarmed at the number of Jews who were being converted to it. He was determined to stamp it out. Both men and women who held such beliefs were arrested and dragged into prison.<h2 class=head1>A CONFRONTATION</h2><p>Saul was en route to Damascus, authorized by the high priest to bring back to Jerusalem any he found who were &#8220;of this way,&#8221; so that they might be punished. While he was carrying out this self-assumed commission, he was suddenly confronted by that very Nazarene, calling to him by name from heaven. Saul&#8217;s reply was, &#8220;Who art Thou, Lord?&#8221; Someone who knew his name but whose name Saul did not know visited him from heaven, causing him to fall to the earth, trembling and astonished.<h2 class=head1>A CHANGE OF VIEW</h2><p>To Saul the sky was opened. Heaven was opened. The heart of God was opened. From that time on, Saul began to see something not of or from the earth but from the heavens. He referred to this seeing as &#8220;the heavenly vision&#8221; (Acts 26:19).<p>What a sharp contrast this was to Saul&#8217;s previous view of things! All his zealous concern for the Jews&#8217; religion came from beneath, not from above. He had been brought up &#8220;at the feet of Gamaliel, and taught according to the perfect manner of the law of the fathers, and was zealous toward God&#8221; (Acts 22:3). Yet those teachings and traditions were earthly. Never before had he heard a voice from heaven.<h2 class=head1>IN PURSUIT</h2><p>Saul was a seeker of Christ. Before the journey to Damascus, his pursuit of Christ was negative. The heavenly voice asked, &#8220;Why persecutest thou me?&#8221; The Greek word for persecute is the same as that translated &#8220;follow after&#8221; and &#8220;press&#8221; in Philippians 3:12 and 14. It means &#8220;pursue.&#8221; Before his heavenly encounter, Saul pursued Christ in hatred, with the intention of wiping Him out by destroying His followers. Afterwards, though, he said, &#8220;I pursue toward the mark for the prize of the high calling of God in Christ Jesus&#8221; (Phil. 3:14, Gk.). His pursuit of Christ became one of love.<h2 class=head1>REPENTING</h2><p>At what point in Saul&#8217;s journey to Damascus did he repent? It was when he changed his direction. His whole mentality was focused in one direction, but when the light shined upon him and he fell to the ground, his course was turned around. He repented.<p>While he still lay on the ground, he called on the name of the Lord. Why did he call this One Lord when he did not know who He was? He realized that One calling him from the heavens must surely be the Lord. Saul, then, firstly repented and then was saved by calling on the name of the Lord.<p>The Lord has a way to make us change our direction. Saul of Tarsus was bold and aggressive, but he fell before the One whom he was pursuing in hatred. Suppose he had simply gotten up again, determined to continue on his way and disregard the voice from the heavens. If he had kept his eyes toward Damascus and refused to look heavenward, surely the Lord would have intervened in an even stronger way to compel him to desist. However determined we may be to press on in our own conviction, we cannot prevail against this One who speaks from the heavens. Deep in my spirit is the prayer that the Lord will keep me from heading toward Damascus against His will.<h2 class=head1>WITHOUT SIGHT, YET SEEING</h2><p>When Saul fell to the ground, his eyes were opened. He thought he had clear vision before that. It was he who was leading others toward Damascus, but after he was smitten by the light from heaven, &#8220;they led him by the hand, and brought him into Damascus&#8221; (Acts 9:8). When he could no longer see where he was going, the heavenly seeing came to him.<p>It is a mercy if such blindness can come upon all of us. We are too clear about what we are doing and where we are going. We continue on our way, unaware that we are blind, smug in the assurance that we know everything.<p>&#8220;Where there is no vision, the people run wild&#8221; (Prov. 29:18, Heb.). For all his self-assurance, Saul of Tarsus had no vision and was running wild. It took the voice from heaven to rescue him. What he called the heavenly vision is the central point of the divine revelation. Though Saul was so well versed in the Old Testament with its commandments and outward ordinances, he did not see its central point.<p>The same is true of many Christians. They may be familiar with the Bible, but they miss its central point, the heavenly vision. If we mean business with the Lord, such a vision will assuredly come to us. Until this happens, like Saul of Tarsus we are blind, though our physical eyes have sight.<h2 class=head1>A HEART FOR GOD&#8217;S DESIRE</h2><p>Saul in his blindness was persecuting Christ, yet we must admit that he did have a heart for God.<p>Are we seeking after what is on God&#8217;s heart? The heart is the focus of the body. We may have an arm cut off or our eyes snatched out, but we can still live. Once our heart is taken out, though, we are finished. We can easily touch someone&#8217;s shoulder or nose or hand, but it is not easy to touch someone&#8217;s heart. The same is true of the Bible. We may have seen a good many of its teachings, but the focus of the divine revelation, like our heart, is not easily seen. It requires a heavenly vision.<p>It is all too common for Christians to be burdened with what is good and scriptural-like going to the mission field to convert the heathen, for example-yet miss God&#8217;s deepest desire.<p>As you are going on your journey, look to Him to make you fall to the ground and say, &#8220;Who art Thou, Lord?&#8221;<h2 class=head1>WHO HE IS</h2><p>Who is this little man from Nazareth? From that day on the road to Damascus Saul began to see who He is. As the years went by, Paul (no longer Saul) wrote a good number of Epistles to unfold the significance of this One. &#8220;Jesus of Nazareth, whom thou persecutest,&#8221; is God incarnate. He is the Redeemer who took away our sins. In His death He terminated the old creation. He resurrected to be Head of the new creation. Today in ascension He is Christ the Lord, Head over all things to the church. Those who believe in Him He makes members of His Body.<h2 class=head1>THE CENTRAL POINT OF THE BIBLE</h2><p>The central point in the Bible concerns the Triune God and His relationship with man. As Paul tells us, it pleased the Father that all His fullness dwell in the Son (Col. 2:9). The Son, then, is the embodiment of the Father&#8217;s fullness. If we receive the Son, we have the Father, who is embodied in the Son. Why is the Father in the Son? It is so that the Son may enter into us, and with Him the Father. In this way the Father will have a Body to be the fullness of the Son.<p>That Body is the church, which becomes the fullness of Christ by taking in His riches. As we eat of Christ and experience Him, we become the embodiment of His riches. To be His fullness is to be His expression.<p>Seeing this central point of the Bible will keep us from running wild. Too many Christians are running wild in their preoccupation with doctrinal matters or in their zeal to do things for God. The vision that we are part of His Body and that He is the Head will safeguard us from all such distractions.<p>Do not turn your eyes away to consider the way chairs should be arranged in the meetings, whether guitars should accompany your singing, or whether your meetings should be loud or quiet. If I propose that you should have more guitars in your meetings, how will you answer me? Your reply must not be about guitars; you must answer me with Christ, or you lose the case. You must answer me with the heavenly vision.<h2 class=head1>CHRIST IN US</h2><h2 class=head2>Formed</h2><p>One aspect of this heavenly vision seen by Paul is that Christ has to be wrought into our being. Galatians 4:19 says, &#8220;My little children, of whom I travail in birth again until Christ be formed in you.&#8221; It became the apostle&#8217;s deep longing that the believers might have Christ take shape in them.<h2 class=head2>Settling Down</h2><p>The apostle prayed in Ephesians 3:17 &#8220;that Christ may make His home in your hearts through faith.&#8221; Have you ever thought that Christ needs you to provide a home for him? He wants to settle down in your heart. You may think heaven is a wonderful place to be, but Christ does not appreciate being there. He is homeless without you. He longs to make His home in your heart. The theologians may think such a thought is too subjective, that your heart is too small to contain the great Christ, and that He is far off in the third heaven. Nevertheless, Paul prayed that Christ may make His home in your heart. This is the intimate relationship that should exist between Christ and you.<h2 class=head2>Magnified</h2><p>&#8220;According to my earnest expectation and my hope, that in nothing I shall be ashamed, but that with all boldness, as always, so now also Christ shall be magnified in my body, whether it be by life, or by death&#8221; (Phil. 1:20). To be magnified is to be expressed in an enlarged way. It was the longing and expectation of Paul that Christ be so expressed in him.<p>For Him to be magnified in you is for Him to be shown without limitation. Your love or your humility is superficial and of short duration. According to Ephesians 3:18-19, Christ is the universal breadth, length, height, and depth. He is the dimension of the whole universe. There is no limit to His love. Your family can quickly exhaust all your virtues. Let this One with His unsearchable, inexhaustible riches make His home in your heart. He is magnified by His riches being made known to all.<h2 class=head1>&#8220;TO LIVE IS CHRIST&#8221;</h2><p>In Colossians 2:6-7 Paul tells us to walk in Christ, rooted and built up in Him. He becomes the country in which we walk, the sphere in which we live, the soil in which we are rooted, and the foundation on which we are built up.<p>The heavenly vision is that this Christ must be wrought into us. When Paul said, &#8220;I was not disobedient unto the heavenly vision&#8221; (Acts 26:19), he implied that he no longer had any regard for tradition or religious teachings. His only concern was the living, present Christ. That is why he could later say, &#8220;To me to live is Christ&#8221; (Phil. 1:21).<h2 class=head1>REPENTING OF GOOD BEHAVIOR</h2><p>Once you see this, you will repent of many good things. Suppose, for example, you talk to a brother in a harsh way. Later, when you go to the Lord, you confess, &#8220;Lord, I&#8217;m sorry I was so mean to my brother. Forgive me. From now on, help me to treat all the brothers right. Help me not to be so harsh.&#8221; Do you think that is the right way to pray? If you do, you have not seen the heavenly vision that Christ must live. It is not a matter of your being nice to others, but of Christ being your life. Such a prayer itself needs to be repented of.<p>We want to live a good Christian life-studying the Bible, preaching the gospel, honoring our parents, being a good neighbor, not losing our temper, and being kind to everyone. I beg you, discard all these concepts! The vision we need to see is that Christ must be our life.<p>Have you ever repented of your good behavior? of your love? of your kindness? You must have, if you have seen the vision. God does not want you to be full of love, but to be full of Christ. In our early Christian experience, our repentance is for bad things, but later we shall find that our repentance is mostly for good things. &#8220;Lord, forgive me for my kindness. Forgive me for all my virtues, void of Christ.&#8221; A Christian who is full of humility without Christ is a rebel. He is rebelling against the heavenly vision that Christ must be everything to him. Your thinking, your emotion, your intention, your motive, your quickness or your slowness-all these must be Christ.<h2 class=head1>FULFILLING THE VISION</h2><p>How far-reaching was the vision Paul was granted in answer to his question, &#8220;Who art Thou, Lord?&#8221; The revelation that came to him filled his writings; through them, under the heavenly enlightening, the same vision can be ours. This Jesus of Nazareth embodies the fullness of the Father. The church, the embodiment of the Son, takes in His riches and thus becomes His fullness. Christ Himself must be wrought into us and become our life.<p>We obey this vision by taking Him as our life, not allowing ourselves to be distracted by doctrines nor striving after good behavior. All day long, throughout all our activities, we must maintain contact with this Christ. As we constantly talk to Him in prayer (1 Thes. 5:17), we shall be spontaneously taking Him as our person and thus living according to the heavenly vision.<h1 class=msg>CHAPTER THIRTY-TWO</h1><h1 class=msg>QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS</h1><h1 class=msg>(2)</h1><p><I>When I open to the Lord in the morning and turn to the Word, I usually find it easy to pray and tell Him I love Him. But then doubts and extraneous thoughts will sometimes come in, and I don&#8217;t seem to be able to go back and get into the Word with an open spirit. What should I do when this happens?</I><p>Don&#8217;t do anything. The psalmist tells us to &#8220;be still&#8221; (Psa. 4:4; 46:10). Strength lies in being still and restful. Human beings, even the most slothful, are active, busily engaged in this or that. Even lazy people are busy being lazy. Before we were saved, we were busily engaged in worldly pursuits and entertainments. Afterwards, we became busy in another way. Then we may have backslid and been busy in that realm. After being restored, we became busy in seeking holiness, victory or spirituality.<p>All such busyness cuts off the way for the Lord to come in to work Himself into us. Consider how busy Saul of Tarsus was as he traveled that day toward Damascus. Out of his desire to serve the God of his fathers and to protect the law of Moses, he was scheming to wipe out those devilish followers of Jesus of Nazareth. As he was busily pursuing his concept of a godly life, the Lord came in and called a halt. Later he spent a period of time in Arabia. By such seasons of enforced quiet the Lord reminded him to cease from his activities and just pray, leaving the work in the Lord&#8217;s hands.<p>Every seeking Christian needs such a balance. The Lord would put a stop sign on your busy street. The heavenly vision arrests you in whatever you are doing. You are left with nothing to do, because you realize that what you do in yourself is rebellion, even if it is seeking the Lord. God&#8217;s intention is to have Christ thoroughly worked into your being, but in your spiritual seeking you have no concern about this. Your spiritual seeking is going in the opposite direction, only considering your intention.<p>I have spoken much about this matter of God&#8217;s intention in recent months, because I am burdened that most of the saints in the Lord&#8217;s recovery do not see it. If they did, the recovery could not have gotten off the track the way it did these past few years. The saints were deceived because the heavenly vision was not strong and clear. The vision not only extricates us from the world; it stops our spiritual seeking as well. When the children of Israel were in the wilderness, they were cut off from everything Egyptian and restricted to what was heavenly. After the leeks, garlic, and onions of Egypt, they now had nothing to eat but manna from the heavens. We must be on this same restricted diet today. Our one food is Christ; our one work, to build the tabernacle and carry it day by day.<p>Please do not feel I have given you too profound an answer to a simple question! We all need to be stopped, even from our spiritual seeking, by this heavenly vision.<p><I>Sometimes I find myself striving after some aspect of Christ I&#8217;ve heard about in a message, instead of being content to keep feeding on the manna.</I><p>We need the church to sustain us. To keep enjoying and experiencing Christ, we need encouragement. If some among the children of Israel had proposed other ways to eat and live, that would have been rebellion. Is not this the state of Christianity today? In the eyes of man it may be doing many good works, but those very works, in God&#8217;s eyes, are rebellion. Where can God find a people feeding on Christ and building up His dwelling place? He must have such a people, for His purpose to be fulfilled and for Him to have the ground to come back. Otherwise, He has nothing to come back to.<p><I>How can we know if what we are doing to please God is from ourselves?</I><p>First of all we must see that God wants only Christ, not our good works nor our good behavior nor even our spirituality. All the veils of our concepts must be taken away. Then we must pray unceasingly, breathing Christ in as the air, the pneuma. However well we eat, if we do not breathe the proper air into every part of our being, we shall not have good health. Christ is likened to the water we drink, the food we eat, and the air we breathe. As we receive Him into us in all these ways, we are living by Him and He is constituted into our being. What we do then pleases God, because it comes from His life in us.<p><I>In our daily living some of us have jobs which keep our minds occupied the whole day; others have work which doesn&#8217;t require concentration. If our minds are free, should we exercise to memorize verses and pray?</I><p>By exercise and by practice we must learn to abide in the Lord. If we think in terms of turning back to the Lord, we are indicating that we do not abide in Him. However busy we are in our work, however concentrated we must be, we should still be abiding. This is not easy, for we were not born this way. But we have been reborn as branches of the vine. The vine today is the life-giving Spirit. Even while we keep using our mentality to do our work, we still can remain in the life-giving Spirit. Don&#8217;t think that after you do your work you will come back to abide. There should be no need to return. Practice abiding. Begin in the morning by opening the Word. Memorizing Bible verses is good, but it is better to have that happen in a spontaneous way, while you are praying over them. As you pray-read, some sentences or verses will be impressed upon your mind, and these will be your daily nourishment, helping you to keep abiding. Coming to the Word throughout the day is like recharging your battery so it doesn&#8217;t run out of electricity. Do this at specific times during the day, besides constantly opening to the Lord in unceasing prayer, whether you are away at work or home tending to household duties.<p>It is not easy to explain how to enjoy Christ and how to take Him as our life. Mankind has been on the earth for thousands of years, yet the matter of diet is still being investigated. Some of the substances in our food are still unknown or not understood. I often consider how I can best help the saints in the matter of enjoying Christ. It is only since 1958 that we have been using this term. Now, &#8220;enjoying Christ&#8221; and &#8220;practicing the church life&#8221;-another term we introduced-have come into common usage. I believe other Christians have also begun using these terms.<p><I>How can we know what kind of testimonies are suitable for the meetings?</I><p>In the denominations the terms worship or service are used instead of meetings. They have a Sunday morning worship service and an evening service. It is in the recovery that the word meeting is used. The whole concept of Christian meetings, in denominational thinking, is off. If we want to know what the proper meetings should be, we can consider the Old Testament type.<p>The Israelites gathered together seasonally, seven times a year. The main gatherings were three times a year: for the Passover, for the feast of weeks, and for the feast of tabernacles. Three times a year all the males had to appear before the Lord in the place of His choosing (Deut. 16:16). That place was Mount Zion, where the city of Jerusalem was built.<p>How did they gather? They first labored on the land until the harvest time arrived. Then they came together with the rich produce, not to kneel down, nor prostrate themselves, nor sing a hymn, nor offer a prayer. Rather, they offered the top ten percent of their increase to God and then ate together what they had offered to God in His presence. What then was the nature of their coming together? They met to feast on the produce of the good land. Their eating together in the presence of God was their worship and their service.<p>For us today it is the same. We come together at certain times appointed by God. Before that we must labor on Christ, our good land, so that we have a harvest of experiences of Him. Daily we experience Him. These experiences become the surplus of His riches, which we bring to the meetings. No one is to appear before the Lord empty-handed (Deut. 16:16). We must be full of the rich experience of Christ. This Christ we then offer to God and enjoy Him together.<p>The testimonies are part of our enjoyment of Christ. We offer these experiences to God as food to satisfy Him and one another as well. The testimonies must come out of our daily walk. Our living is what determines how rich a meeting we shall have.<p><I>I experience Christ and I do like to be in the meetings, but sometimes I get tired of having so much preaching.</I><p>Let me say something further regarding the Old Testament type. In addition to the eating of the offering, there was always the teaching of the law. The feasts lasted seven days, and part of the time was spent hearing the teaching of the law, which corresponds to today&#8217;s ministry.<p>If we met together only for praying, praising, and testifying the year round, with no ministry, we would be without the proper knowledge of God&#8217;s regulation and intention. The males of the children of Israel had to appear before God three times a year, not only to feast, but also to be educated and infused with the knowledge of God.<p>If we have five meetings a week, at least two should be for the ministry. This gives three meetings for all the saints to share. For the ministry, when the church is strong, there should be some local teachers, just as there were in Antioch (cf. Acts 13:1). If the church here had no one who could teach, how poor the church would be. Our meetings need the balance between the eating in fellowship by the offering of our experiences and the teaching. These two go together like husband and wife. Without the sharing, the church is a widower; without the teaching, a widow! It is the balance of these two that makes the church life normal.<p>Suppose these past five years the church had had no ministry. You just came together, sang some hymns, and had some sharing. I wonder if the church would still be here! If you say you have had enough of the life messages and enough of the ministry, that they are all stored within you and that you have reached your capacity like a camel, then I would propose that we suspend the life supply for four years or so. What do you think would become of the church?<p>For an adequate balanced church we must have the eating as the wife and the ministry as the husband. This is included in the heavenly vision.<p><I>I&#8217;ve been separated from my husband for two years, and when he comes to visit our two boys, I don&#8217;t know how to handle the situation. Sometimes his worldly ways and plans harden my heart. Other times I feel sorrowful and want to pray for him, because he is really good with the boys.</I><p>It is very sorrowful to be separated and have two children, but I trust you can learn to take your environment from the Lord. I have never been in a situation like yours, but still I do have my problems. Possibly mine are deeper and heavier than yours. Don&#8217;t think that my situation is so excellent and that everyone appreciates my ministry! If my sufferings are not greater than yours, at least they equal them. The Lord has a measure for all of us. According to the Bible, sufferings are not as bad as they seem; rather, they are a great blessing under a poor cloak. A favorable environment can be a good cloak to cheat us. The sufferings are the real dealings. Romans 8:28 reminds us that, for those who love God, all things work together for good. Whatever our environment may be, it is under the Lord&#8217;s sovereignty. I believe that the good is that we may gain more of Christ. Our circumstances open the way. Instead of thinking that you are suffering, change your concept and thank the Lord for your environment. It is a good opportunity for you to receive more of Him.<p>As to the outcome of your married life, just trust in the Lord. He knows. Give up your expectations. Be content with whatever the Lord has given you and rest assured that He has your situation in His hand. The Lord may after a while recover your marriage. I don&#8217;t know, but He knows what you really need.<p>We all need to understand these principles. Take every circumstance from the Lord&#8217;s hand, believing that it was ordered by Him. Day by day receive grace and be satisfied with whatever the day brings forth. Don&#8217;t expect your situation to improve. With us no circumstance is bad; even the worst environment is good, because God causes all things to work together for our good. Take every occasion to experience the Lord, and you will gain more Christ.<p><I>How can we be kept from repeating the mistakes of the past two years?</I><p>The primary safeguard is that you have no particular fellowship with certain ones. In your body every part is common to every other part. The blood circulates throughout the whole body, supplying every cell, not a special few. The sisters&#8217; fellowship must be in common with all the sisters. The brothers too must be common in their fellowship with one another. To have preferences for certain ones damages the Body. Be careful that your fellowship does not become friendship. You must regard all the brothers and sisters as equally lovable. This is what Paul meant when he wrote to the Philippians, &#8220;Fulfill ye my joy, that ye be like-minded, having the same love&#8221; (Phil. 2:2). Having the same love means that your love for everyone is on the same level. You have no particular love for a few. You don&#8217;t contact certain ones for the purpose of having special fellowship with them. Try to have just one level of fellowship, including all the saints equally.<p><I>Since you encouraged us to eat the manna by regularly spending time in the morning with the Lord and His Word, I have been doing this, and it has had a real effect on my relationship with the Lord, though I haven&#8217;t sensed anything special. But how can I, practically speaking, keep this up during the day?</I><p>Just continue in the Word. In addition to your ten minutes in the morning, read a chapter at noontime and three chapters in the evening. Also, keep praying throughout the day, &#8220;Lord, take away any veils. Keep my whole being open to You.&#8221; Don&#8217;t try to analyze your situation. If you will eat the Word faithfully three times a day and keep opening to the Lord by praying unceasingly, coming to Him just as you are, you will find that your life will be changed and that when you come to the meetings you will not be empty-handed.<h1 class=msg>CHAPTER THIRTY-THREE</h1><h1 class=msg>GOD&#8217;S GOOD PLEASURE</h1><p>What is the delight of God&#8217;s heart? Or, to use the language of Ephesians, what is His &#8220;good pleasure&#8221; (Eph. 1:5, 9)?<h2 class=head1>A GOD OF LIFE</h2><p>Did you know that our God is emotional? A number of times we are told that He was pleased (1 Sam. 12:22; 1 Kings 3:10; Isa. 42:21; Heb. 13:16) or that He was angry (Deut. 1:37; 9:20; 1 Kings 11:9; 2 Kings 17:18). Emotion is a sign of life. A stone does not get angry. If you are living, your face will express emotion, for example, when you come to the meetings.<p>The Lord Jesus illustrated how emotional the Father is in the parable of the prodigal son in Luke 15. In fact, it is more accurate to call this the parable of the happy father! The son left his father for the far country, but one day his hunger caused his thoughts to turn homeward, not so much toward his father as toward the riches in the father&#8217;s house. &#8220;He arose, and came to his father&#8221; (v. 20), prepared to say that he was no longer worthy to be called a son. Before he caught sight of his father, however, &#8220;when he was yet a great way off, his father saw him.&#8221; The father must have been watching for his errant son to return. Verse 20 is the only verse in the Bible that says God ran. He &#8220;had compassion, and ran, and fell on his neck, and kissed him.&#8221; How emotional! I am sorry to say I have never so embraced any of my three sons. This indicates I am short of life, not like God! Praise God that He is so emotional toward us all!<p>The father cut short the son&#8217;s confession of unworthiness by telling the servants to bring forth the robe, the ring, and the sandals for him to wear. Qualified by these outward things, the son was ready to feast on the fatted calf. The father said, &#8220;Let us eat, and be merry&#8221; (v. 23). &#8220;And they began to be merry&#8221; (v. 24). Here is the merriment of God. Because He is full of life, God can be extremely happy or, by the same token, furiously angry.<h2 class=head1>A GOD OF PURPOSE</h2><p>Our emotions come not only because we have life but also because we are purposeful. If we have no plans, we have no reason to feel joy or anger; we are indifferent about what happens. But if we have a strong purpose, we shall be excited and delighted to see it realized. For the same reason, we shall be angry if its fulfillment is frustrated.<p>Our God is a God of life and a God of purpose. He &#8220;predestinated us unto sonship through Jesus Christ to Himself, according to the good pleasure of His will&#8221; (Eph. 1:5). He has &#8220;made known to us the mystery of His will, according to His good pleasure which He purposed in Himself unto a dispensation of the fullness of the times, to head up all things in Christ&#8221; (vv. 9-10). We were &#8220;predestinated according to the purpose of the One Who operates all things according to the counsel of His will&#8221; (v. 11).<p>From these verses we can see that the good pleasure of God is related to such great matters as His will, His purpose (used here in both the verbal and noun forms), a dispensation (or administration, or economy), and His counsel. All these great matters have God&#8217;s good pleasure as their source. It was because of His good pleasure that He had a will. According to that will, He made a plan (or purposed something). For this plan He took counsel with Himself. Then His economy emerged for an administration.<p>We have no way of knowing when this good pleasure began, but since our God is eternal, without beginning or ending, His good pleasure must also be eternal. It lies at the heart of the origin of the universe.<h2 class=head1>GOD HAPPY WITH THE EARTH</h2><p>God&#8217;s good pleasure was expressed firstly in the creation of the earth. &#8220;Where wast thou when I laid the foundations of the earth?...When the morning stars sang together, and all the sons of God shouted for joy?&#8221; (Job 38:4, 7). I can find no hint in the Bible of a similar delight on the part of the angels and the morning stars when the heavens were created. Why was there this singing and shouting for joy when the foundations of the earth were laid?<p>To the scientists the earth is a small planet, not particularly outstanding in relation to the other heavenly bodies. To God, however, the earth is the most pleasant planet. Of course, it is also the one which gives Him the most trouble, but nonetheless His heart is for the earth. Do you love the earth? I surely do not encourage you to love the world, for that belongs to Satan; but the earth is the Lord&#8217;s and we should love it.<h2 class=head2>A Misconception about Heaven</h2><p>There is a common belief among Christians that the earth is a place of suffering, but that some day we shall go to a happy place called heaven. This concept came from Buddhism, which calls this happy place the western heaven. It was Catholicism which introduced this pagan idea into Christianity.<p>God loves the earth. All His attention is focused on the earth, not on the heavens.<h2 class=head2>Ruling on Earth</h2><p>God&#8217;s kingdom will be set up on earth, not on any other planet (Matt. 6:10; Rev. 11:15). The eternal universe will be called the new heaven and the new earth (Rev. 21:1). God&#8217;s eternal kingdom will not be on the moon, nor on Mars. The earth is where His pleasure lies, even unto eternity.<h2 class=head1>GOD HAPPY WITH MAN</h2><p>If you read the first chapter of Genesis a few times, you will notice how often it says, &#8220;And God saw that it was good&#8221; (e.g., vv. 10, 12, 18, 21, 25). As He was restoring the creation those first five days, God found that it was good. However, on the sixth day, the day that man was created, &#8220;God saw every thing that he had made, and, behold, it was very good&#8221; (v. 31). If the earth is pleasant to God, man is more pleasant. God was so happy with the man He had created that He said &#8220;very good.&#8221;<p>God does not say &#8220;very good&#8221; lightly. If He says only &#8220;good&#8221; on the day that I meet Him, I shall be satisfied! For Him to say &#8220;very good&#8221; indicates He felt emotional. There were plants and trees, fish and birds, beasts and cattle. As God saw man in the midst of the rest of His creation, His love toward man prompted Him to say &#8220;very good.&#8221; Man is the delight of God&#8217;s heart. God loves the earth because it was prepared for this man in whom He delights.<h2 class=head1>GOD HAPPY WITH THE INCARNATION</h2><p>As happened when the foundations of the earth were laid, the heavenly hosts rejoiced also at the incarnation. The angel of the Lord brought &#8220;good tidings of great joy&#8221; to the shepherds. &#8220;And suddenly there was with the angel a multitude of the heavenly host praising God, and saying, Glory to God in the highest, and on earth peace, good will toward men&#8221; (Luke 2:9-14).<p>What made God so pleased with the advent of the &#8220;Savior, which is Christ the Lord&#8221; (v. 11)? Before the incarnation, the earth was the earth, man was man, and God was God. But at this point God made Himself one with man. Jesus is the mingling of God and man. &#8220;They shall call His name Emmanuel, which being interpreted is, God with us&#8221; (Matt. 1:23).<p>How regrettable it is that the glorious fact of the incarnation has been corrupted into the Christmas celebration. Christians, for the most part, have only the understanding that a Savior was born to them. That God has been brought into man and made one with man escapes them. When Jesus was living on this earth, He was a wonder. He was the great God mingled with His creature.<p>The Bible is silent, except for one occasion, concerning the first thirty years of the life of Jesus. He was called a carpenter (Mark 6:3). In those thirty years He did not do any great work. The lesson in this is that God has no interest in our works. If God wants anything done, He speaks, and it is done (Psa. 33:9). He does not need us to work for Him.<h2 class=head1>GOD HAPPY WITH CHRIST&#8217;S BAPTISM</h2><p>Christ began His public ministry by being baptized. On this occasion &#8220;the heavens were opened to Him...and behold, a voice out of the heavens, saying, This is My beloved Son, in Whom I delight&#8221; (Matt. 3:16-17). The word delight here is from the same root as good pleasure in Ephesians 1:5 and 9. The Father took pleasure in this One who turned Himself over to John the Baptist to be baptized. By receiving baptism He was symbolically receiving the cross. This is apparent from his questions to the sons of Zebedee much later: &#8220;Can ye drink of the cup that I drink of? and be baptized with the baptism that I am baptized with?&#8221; (Mark 10:38). By baptism He meant His crucifixion.<p>In the eyes of God, then, the death of Christ was pleasant. God delights in the crucified Christ. From week to week as we have the Lord&#8217;s table, we display this pleasant death to the universe (1 Cor. 11:26).<h2 class=head1>GOD HAPPY WITH THE RESURRECTED CHRIST</h2><p>When Christ was transfigured, &#8220;behold, a voice out of the cloud, saying, This is My beloved Son, in Whom I delight; hear Him!&#8221; (Matt. 17:5). The transfiguration was a foreshadowing of the resurrection. The changing of His form also typified His glorification. He asked the two on the road to Emmaus, &#8220;Ought not Christ to have suffered these things, and to enter into his glory?&#8221; (Luke 24:26). We can see from this verse that entering into His glory was the same as His being resurrected. God took pleasure in the resurrection and glorification of His Son.<h2 class=head1>GOD HAPPY WITH HIS SON REVEALED IN US</h2><p>&#8220;It pleased God...to reveal his Son in me&#8221; (Gal. 1:15-16). God&#8217;s good pleasure is wrapped up with us. There was joy in heaven the day we were saved because the Son of God was then revealed in us. This pleasure of God relates to all the other things that made God happy. If there had been no earth, how could Jesus have lived in Nazareth? Without the creation of man, how could there be Emmanuel, God with us? Without the earth and man, there could not have been the incarnation, crucifixion, and resurrection of the Son of God. It was by His mingling with man that He became the Son of Man, instead of remaining as only the Son of God.<p>When He came into us, the meaning of the earth, of man, of the incarnation, of the crucifixion, and of the resurrection all became our portion. Where is Christ today? He is universal. He is both God and man. He is in the heavens and on the earth. We are one with Him. At one time we were ordinary people, insignificant sinners. But now there is something wonderful about us. It is hard for us to explain to others what we are, who we are, and even where we are! The Son revealed in us has brought us into the meaning of the earth, of man, and of the incarnate, crucified, and resurrected Lord.<h2 class=head1>GOD HAPPY TO WORK IN US</h2><p>&#8220;For it is God which worketh in you both to will and to do of his good pleasure&#8221; (Phil. 2:13). Our life, the Christian life and the church life, is according to God&#8217;s good pleasure. The Christian life is a happy life. Many times the New Testament exhorts us to be happy. &#8220;Rejoice in the Lord always: and again I say, Rejoice&#8221; (4:4). We should be rejoicing day after day, not in ourselves but in the Lord. We are a people &#8220;singing and psalming with your heart to the Lord, giving thanks at all times for all things in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ to God and the Father&#8221; (Eph. 5:19-20). Rather than having Thanksgiving Day once a year, we daily give thanks to God for everything, singing hymns to Him and even stirring up others by our sense of excitement.<p>We as Christians should be an emotional people. When we are with others, they should sense something exciting about us. In those years at Elden Hall in Los Angeles our neighbors called us the &#8220;hallelujah people.&#8221; We were excited enough to be singing and praising the Lord even while we walked on the streets.<p>What makes us so happy? It is because we have the very God working within us both to will and to do of His good pleasure. How do we know that we are living a life according to God&#8217;s good pleasure? It is because of our sense of happiness. When we are happy, we are registering God&#8217;s happiness within us. Our inward joy is an indication that we are living and walking according to His good pleasure.<h2 class=head1>GOD HAPPY WITH OUR GLORIFICATION</h2><p>The day will come when we shall all be glorified. We shall be with Christ on the mount of transfiguration. In that day God will be beside Himself with excitement and will call us to Satan&#8217;s attention: &#8220;Satan, look at My children! My children are glorified!&#8221; Surely this thought is hinted at in Romans 8: &#8220;The sufferings of this present time are not worthy to be compared with the coming glory to be revealed to us. For the anxious watching of the creation eagerly expects the revelation of the sons of God....The creation itself will also be freed from the slavery of corruption into the freedom of the glory of the children of God. For we know that the whole creation groans together and travails in pain together until now. And not only so, but we ourselves also, having the firstfruit of the Spirit, even we ourselves groan in ourselves, eagerly expecting sonship, the redemption of our body&#8221; (Rom. 8:18-19, 21-23).<h2 class=head1>A PEOPLE TODAY FOR GOD&#8217;S GOOD PLEASURE</h2><p>The recovery is that God may regain His good pleasure. Surely today&#8217;s Christianity is no source of joy to Him. We must be a people among whom God may have His good pleasure. It was for this that the earth was created. It was for this that man was created. It was for this that God became incarnated. It was for this that Jesus was crucified and resurrected. This was also the very purpose of our new birth.<p>We are now living and walking according to the pleasure of God. That pleasure will reach its climax on the day that we are glorified.<h1 class=msg>CHAPTER THIRTY-FOUR</h1><h1 class=msg>LIVING A DIVINE LIFE-GOD&#8217;S GOOD PLEASURE</h1><p>God has predestinated us human beings to be His sons (Eph. 1:5). This is according to His good pleasure. It is most pleasant to God that a group of human beings can be men of God.<h2 class=head1>A MAN OF GOD</h2><p>To be called a man of God does not mean merely that one belongs to God, but rather that he lives God. This term is used even in the Old Testament. It is applied to Moses several times (e.g., Psa. 90, title). Of course, he was not a man of God for the first forty years of his life, when he lived as the son of Pharaoh&#8217;s daughter and became &#8220;learned in all the wisdom of the Egyptians&#8221; (Acts 7:22). Nor was he a man of God in the second forty years of his life, which he spent in the wilderness. By the time God called him at the age of eighty, he was just a country shepherd, all his might &#8220;in words and in deeds&#8221; (v. 22) far behind him. He had already passed &#8220;threescore years and ten&#8221; (Psa. 90:10); by his own evaluation his life was as good as finished.<p>It was during the last forty years of his life that Moses was a man of God. Because he was already at an end, he could live in resurrection, having God as the fuel to burn upon him. During those years of his ministry, Moses lived God. That is why Caleb could later refer to him as the man of God (Josh. 14:6). Deuteronomy 33 gives the &#8220;blessing, wherewith Moses the man of God blessed the children of Israel before his death&#8221; (v. 1). Later on, in the time of Ezra, mention is again made &#8220;of Moses the man of God&#8221; (Ezra 3:2).<p>The most pleasant thing to God is to have some people on this earth who are living Him. This is His heart&#8217;s desire. Even if you are young, God wants you to live Him before your family. Even if you live in a palatial home and have Pharaoh for your father, God still wants you to live Him there. Living Him means being one with Him. This is what makes you a man of God. It is not merely that you represent Him. God wants to be lived out of you. In your speaking, He would speak. He would like the work you do to be what He is doing. You are only a human being, but you can have a divine living.<h2 class=head1>THE SCRIPTURE AND THE MAN OF GOD</h2><p>In the Epistles to Timothy the phrase man of God is used again. Paul wrote these Epistles when the church was in a state of degradation. In such a time &#8220;the man of God may be perfect, thoroughly furnished unto all good works&#8221; (2 Tim. 3:17). Would you like to be a man of God? The preceding verse tells us the way. &#8220;All Scripture is God-breathed&#8221; (v. 16, Gk.). By breathing in God&#8217;s Word, spontaneously you will live God. Take ten minutes every morning to pray-read the Word. By breathing in His Word and eating of Him you will become a man of God. Even if you are quite young, you can still live God. I do not mean that you will improve your behavior. I am talking about God Himself being expressed through you.<h2 class=head1>THE STANDARD PATTERN</h2><p>The standard pattern of a man of God is not Moses, but Jesus of Nazareth. He was surely a man: He had a mother, and He lived in a small town for thirty years. Then He came forth to minister for three and a half years. If you read through the four Gospels, you will see there is not much mention of works that He did. Mostly He just lived and walked among His disciples.<p>But He did not live out Himself. He explained His relation to the Father in this way: &#8220;As the living Father hath sent me, and I live by the Father; so he that eateth me, even he shall live by me&#8221; (John 6:57, KJV). He also told the Jews, &#8220;Truly, truly, I say to you, the Son can do nothing from Himself except what He sees the Father doing; for whatever the Father does, this also the Son does in like manner&#8221; (5:19). He could say, &#8220;I can do nothing from Myself&#8221; (v. 30). In John 10:30 He went on to say, &#8220;I and the Father are one.&#8221;<p>Here was a Man who lived out God. This is why the Father delighted in Him. However much you try to do for God, He will not be impressed. Simply live Him, and you will touch His heart.<h2 class=head1>LIVE HIM</h2><p>I have stayed in many homes. Sometimes I have observed wives very busily doing one thing after another with the intention of serving their husbands. It was plain to me that the husbands were not pleased. I would have liked to say, &#8220;Wife, stop your doing. Just go and sit by your husband. Say whatever he says. Live him; don&#8217;t do things for him.&#8221;<p>Consider how many Christians are busily doing things for God. Do you not realize that God is disgusted with your doing? He wants you to spend some time with Him, looking at Him and living Him out. &#8220;It is God who is operating in you both to will and to do of his good pleasure&#8221; (Phil. 2:13, Gk.). Stop your foolish work. Be quiet and let God operate in you. Let Him work. This is what it means to live God.<p>If we want God to rejoice that He created the earth and that He created man, live Him. Then He will see His purpose being fulfilled. James 1:18 says, &#8220;Of his own will begat he us with the word of truth, that we should be a kind of firstfruits of his creatures.&#8221; We have been begotten by God. We may say that the incarnation is repeated with our regeneration. God initially became incarnate in Christ. Now whenever one is regenerated, the incarnation is repeated.<p>Peter tells us that we are &#8220;partakers of the divine nature&#8221; (2 Pet. 1:4). By our first birth we partake of human nature. Now that we have been begotten of God by the new birth, we partake of the divine nature. Our status is both human and divine. We are not merely sons of man, but sons of God as well. Two thousand years ago in the holy land there was only one Man like this. Now there are thousands. God the Father is operating or energizing in us both to will and to do of His good pleasure. In eternity past He predestinated us unto sonship. Now He is working within us that we may live Him.<h2 class=head1>TAKING CHRIST AS OUR HEAD</h2><p>Since we have within us our own life as well as the divine life, how are we to live out the divine life? We can see from the life of Jesus that there must be a setting aside of our own life. He said, &#8220;For I have come down from heaven, not to do My own will, but the will of Him Who sent Me&#8221; (John 6:38). This verse clearly indicates that the Lord Jesus had a will of His own, but that He laid it aside.<p>In the marriage relationship there can be only one head. That is the origin of the universal custom for the bride to have her head covered at her wedding. The head covering is a declaration that the bride from then on is taking the husband as her head. If the wife refuses to keep her head covered in her married life, the result may well be separation or divorce.<p>Our Christian life is a married life. The Lord is our Head. Our own head must be kept covered. This means we are to deny our own life. We are those with both a human life and a divine life. Since only one life can be lived, our natural life must be denied. The way to deny the self is to deny our will and our glory. The Lord Jesus said that He was not seeking His own glory, but that of the One who had sent Him (John 7:18).<h2 class=head1>PEACE IN DENYING OUR WILL AND OUR GLORY</h2><p>The key to a happy married life is for the wife to deny her own will and glory. If she will turn from her wishes and care only for her husband&#8217;s will, if she will disregard her own glory and let all the glory go to him, the problems in the family will disappear. Do not think that I am introducing some concept to bring you sisters into bondage! Even the Lord Jesus set aside His own will and His own glory. Because of this, He brought peace.<p>This same principle applies in the church life. Problems arise when we seek our own will and glory. These two terms comprise the essence of our human life. Because we feel insignificant, whenever we get a little job, we want to be king over it. We get annoyed if anyone interferes with the way we do it. But there will be peace in the family and peace in the church if we have the grace to put aside our will and our glory. &#8220;Lord, make me willing to lay aside my will, as You did when You were on this earth. Grant me the grace to live on earth not seeking my own glory. Lord, be the grace within me that I may put aside my will and my glory.&#8221;<h2 class=head1>NOT WILLING</h2><p>To practice putting aside your will and your glory is not easy. You may feel that you are willing or at least willing to be made willing. But very soon a situation will arise, and you will see that you are not. Why is it that you have been seeking the Lord and meeting with the saints for so many years and yet have so little growth in life? It is because of your will and glory.<p>It would be helpful to pray-read these verses over and over: &#8220;Truly, truly, I say to you, the Son can do nothing from Himself except what He sees the Father doing; for whatever the Father does, this also the Son does in like manner....I can do nothing from Myself; as I hear, I judge; and My judgment is just, because I do not seek My own will, but the will of Him Who sent Me....For I have come down from heaven, not to do My own will, but the will of Him Who sent Me....He who speaks from himself seeks his own glory, but He Who seeks the glory of Him Who sent Him, this One is true, and unrighteousness is not in Him&#8221; (John 5:19, 30; 6:38; 7:18).<p>To overcome sin, self, and the world is not a problem. The reason you are defeated and have become so worldly and sinful is that you are so much in your will and your glory.<h2 class=head1>THE WAY</h2><p>It is beyond our ability to lay aside our will and our glory, however willing we may think we are. Such a life can be lived only in resurrection. The Lord Himself is the resurrection (John 11:25). Only in Him can we have a life under the cross. As A. B. Simpson&#8217;s hymn says,<p class=hbody>&#8217;Tis not hard to die with Christ When His risen life we know.<p>Hymns, #481<p>This hymn came out of the author&#8217;s experience of Philippians 3:10: &#8220;That I may know him, and the power of his resurrection, and the fellowship of his sufferings, being conformed unto his death&#8221; (Gk.). A. B. Simpson learned how to experience the death of Christ in the resurrection power. In ourselves we do not have such a power.<h2 class=head1>A CRUCIFIED LIFE IN RESURRECTION</h2><p>Compare a stone with a grain of wheat. There is no life inside the stone. The seed, however, has something concealed in it. There is life inside. When the seed falls into the earth and dies, this very death stirs up the life power within. This illustration, which the Lord gave in John 12:24, is of a crucified life in resurrection.<p>The Father&#8217;s pleasure is that we fall into the earth and die, i.e., that we have a crucified life. When we die, the inner power of life will be energized. Death ushers in the resurrection power. &#8220;Lord, open my eyes to see that my will and my glory have to be put aside. Then show me that You are the resurrection power within me. I praise You that I am not a lifeless stone. I&#8217;m a grain of wheat. Within me You are the resurrection power. Lord, give me the vision that if I die You live. I am here before You.&#8221; The Lord will work in us the willingness. It does not come from ourselves.<p>In Luke 12:50 He said, &#8220;I have a baptism to be baptized with; and how am I straitened till it be accomplished!&#8221; He was saying that until He entered into death, He was pressed or restricted. Death released Him. In us the Lord Jesus again has a baptism to be baptized with. Our humanity is a restriction, just as the resurrection life in the Lord Jesus was restrained when He was in the flesh. The death of the cross broke the shell of the grain of wheat and released the inner resurrection life.<p>We need to be conformed to the death of Christ. This breaks the shell of our humanity so that the resurrection life may come forth. From this life comes &#8220;much fruit&#8221; (John 12:24). The saints will be edified, the church built up, and God&#8217;s eternal purpose accomplished.<p>What is the good pleasure of God? He wants you to live a crucified life in resurrection. He wants you to enter into the death of Christ and remain there to be conformed to it. This will shatter every part of your humanity. &#8220;We have this treasure in earthen vessels, that the excellency of the power may be of God, and not of us&#8221; (2 Cor. 4:7). The treasure is released when the earthen vessel is shattered.<p>&#8220;We which live are alway delivered unto death for Jesus&#8217; sake, that the life also of Jesus might be made manifest in our mortal flesh. So then death worketh in us, but life in you&#8221; (vv. 11-12). As this death works upon us, the life within goes to others. If you are a sinner, this life will save you. If you are a believer, this life will edify you.<p>What the Lord is seeking to recover is a crucified life in resurrection. May we all see that the resurrection power is waiting within us for a chance to be released. We must remain in the death of Christ and be conformed to it. This death will stir up and usher in the resurrection power. The result will be nourishment, building up, and the fulfillment of God&#8217;s eternal purpose. This is the life that pleases God.<p>The life which He imparted to us at our new birth He longs to see expressed. Where can God find on this earth those who are men of God? Who will lay aside the human life to express the divine life? It can only be those who deny their own will and their own glory, as the pattern of the Lord Jesus reveals. In ourselves there is no possibility of realizing this. That is why we must pray for Him to make us willing. He is working in us &#8220;to will and to do of his good pleasure&#8221; (Phil. 2:13). We were marked out to be His sons even before we were created. As we live this crucified life in resurrection, day by day this eternal purpose of His is being brought to pass. We are among those human beings who are learning to live a divine life.<h1 class=msg>CHAPTER THIRTY-FIVE</h1><h1 class=msg>THE RESURRECTION OF CHRIST- GOD&#8217;S GOOD PLEASURE</h1><p>The Lord Jesus told us that He is the resurrection and the life (John 11:25). The life that was in Him, contrary to the life that we were born with, is a life that cannot be terminated. The Jews foolishly sought to kill Him in order to be rid of Him (John 5:16, 18; 7:1), not realizing that death only released His life in multiplication. Satan&#8217;s strategy, in instigating the Jews to kill Jesus, backfired. Rather than terminating His life, death afforded it the opportunity to reproduce. Consider how many millions of people died from the time of Adam to the time of Christ. Though for them death meant the end, for Christ it meant the release and multiplication of His life (see Luke 12:50; John 12:24).<p>Before we consider how far-reaching the resurrection is, let us answer some questions.<h2 class=head1>QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS</h2><p><I>May I ask about the Lord&#8217;s table? It seems that we partake of it in a bold way, yet 1 Corinthians 11 says to examine ourselves lest we partake unworthily, not discerning the Lord&#8217;s body. What is the proper way to come to the Lord&#8217;s table?</I><p>Whenever we come to the Lord&#8217;s table, we first have to be clear that it really is the Lord&#8217;s table. If it does not signify the oneness of believers, it is rather a table of division. Some denominations will not allow you to partake of their &#8220;communion&#8221; unless you have been immersed by them. Since such a table does not comprise all believers, it is not the Lord&#8217;s table. To partake of it is to eat to your own condemnation.<p>For you yourself also, you must examine whether you are sectarian. If you have a problem with any of the saints, you should not partake of the Lord&#8217;s table until you thoroughly deal with it. The context of those verses shows that we must beware of any divisiveness. If the table is divisive in its testimony, or if you yourself are divisive in your relationship to the saints, you must not partake. When there is no division-that is, when the table is the table of oneness and when you have no problem with any member of the Body-you are free to partake.<p><I>You have sometimes said that we should avoid friendship. What is the difference between a friend and one we are built with? How do we know whom to open up to when we need to fellowship about a matter?</I><p>Fellowship is a matter of the whole Body. Friendship is a matter of personal affection. Affection easily arises among human beings when we are together for a short time. This is typified by honey, which was forbidden in the meal offering (Lev. 2:11); what is needed is salt (v. 13), which kills personal affection. Salt typifies the killing of the cross of Christ. Do not allow affection to spring up and lead to friendship. Affection sooner or later leads to corruption. Friendship has its seat in our emotions; fellowship is in the spirit (Phil. 2:1, Gk.).<p>For all these years I have been in the Lord&#8217;s recovery, I have had no friends. However intimate the fellowship may be between a brother and me, it does not become a friendship; no personal affection is involved.<p>Learn to turn from your friendship in the emotion to the fellowship in your spirit.<p>As for the matter of being built up, the real building is based upon growth, not upon physical or emotional nearness. A physical building stays put because it is lifeless, but we often move from place to place. If we are built in, wherever we go we shall have no problem with the saints, up to the measure of our growth. The building is related to our growth. Reject any thought that it involves some &#8220;flow,&#8221; attaching you to this one or that one.<p><I>Why do some saints get baptized more than once?</I><p>How we are baptized is not a problem in the church life. As long as we believe in the Lord Jesus, we are saved and members of the Body. This qualifies us to be members of the church. Of course, the Word clearly says that after we believe, we are to be baptized. There is no profit in getting involved in further discussion than this.<p><I>How do we deal with our vain, loose talk? If we repent of it, do we still have to give account of it on the judgment day?</I><p>If we see the vision that the Christian life is in our spirit, all vain talk will be over. When we turn to our spirit, there will be no gossip or other loose talk.<p>Whatever sin we commit, if we repent from our heart and ask for forgiveness, the blood cleanses, and we are not called to account for it at the judgment.<h2 class=head1>RESURRECTION LIFE AND ITS PRECIOUSNESS</h2><p>You are probably aware that three Greek words are translated life in the New Testament. Bios denotes the life of our physical body; psuche, the soul or the soulish life; and zoe, the uncreated, eternal life, which we did not have until we received the Lord Jesus. The zoe life is in our spirit. The presence of these three kinds of life within us makes us complicated and is the source of conflicts. Bios may feel tired, but psuche may want to go to a concert to listen to music. Each expects the other to go along with its feeling. Zoe proposes that they cease their disagreement and go to the meeting instead; then bios will rest, and psuche will have satisfaction, not with music but with the Lord Jesus.<p>Zoe is not a condition nor a thing but a Person, Jesus Christ Himself. &#8220;He that hath the Son hath life [Gk., zoe]&#8221; (1 John 5:12). This life is the resurrection life.<p>Resurrection, symbolized by frankincense (Lev. 2:15), is precious in the eyes of God. It is sweeter even than the cross, which ushers it in. It is dearer than the incarnation, which was such a pleasure to God because He thus became one with man. Resurrection gives God more pleasure than did the creation of man and of the earth, even though these were a delight to Him and are the object of His love.<p>In resurrection Christ is revealed to us. In resurrection God is now energizing us both to will and to do of His good pleasure. In resurrection we shall all be glorified and be the sons of God in manifestation. The ultimate consummation of resurrection will be the New Jerusalem in the new heaven and the new earth in eternity.<h2 class=head1>FROM FLESH TO SPIRIT</h2><p>Let us see how the Gospel of John leads into resurrection.<p>The Gospel opens by referring to God as the Word which was in the beginning. Then verse 14 tells us that &#8220;the Word became flesh.&#8221; John ushers us out of eternity, where the Word was, and into time, where the Word became flesh. This One, who dwelt among us, &#8220;full of grace and reality,&#8221; was the supreme attraction to His disciples for the three and a half years He was with them. Then He told them that He was going away (John 13:33; 14:2). What He really meant was that He would become something further. As the Word, He had become flesh. Now He was to become the Spirit (1 Cor. 15:45).<h2 class=head2>John 3</h2><p>Even as early as the third chapter in John, the thought begins to change from the flesh to the spirit. When Nicodemus came to converse with Him, the Lord&#8217;s reply was, &#8220;Unless a man is born of water and the Spirit, he cannot enter into the kingdom of God. That which is born of the flesh is flesh, and that which is born of the Spirit is spirit&#8221; (3:5-6). Nicodemus could interpret the need to be born again only in a physical way, but the Lord said that the one born of the Spirit was like the wind, making a sound but not visible. Notice this turn here from the physical to the spiritual.<h2 class=head2>John 6</h2><p>Chapter six of John further points us to the Spirit. The Lord said that He was the living bread. &#8220;If anyone eats of this bread, he shall live forever; and the bread which I will give is My flesh, which I will give for the life of the world&#8221; (6:51). The Jews, like Nicodemus, took His words literally, in a physical sense, and could not figure out how this Man could give them His flesh to eat. The Lord&#8217;s further &#8220;hard word&#8221; to His disciples about eating His flesh and drinking His blood He explained in verse 63, by again turning them to the Spirit. &#8220;It is the Spirit Who gives life; the flesh profits nothing; the words which I have spoken unto you are spirit and are life.&#8221; He meant that what He would give them to eat was not the meat of His physical body; that meat, &#8220;the flesh,&#8221; was of no avail. What was in store for them was Himself as the Spirit.<h2 class=head2>John 14</h2><p>John 14 continues directing the disciples away from the flesh and toward the Spirit. &#8220;I will ask the Father, and He will give you another Comforter, that He may be with you forever; even the Spirit of reality...you know Him, because He abides with you and shall be in you....I will not leave you orphans; I am coming to you. Yet a little while and the world beholds Me no longer, but you behold Me; because I live, you shall live also. In that day you shall know that I am in My Father, and you in Me, and I in you&#8221; (vv. 16-20). If you study these verses carefully, you will see that &#8220;another Comforter&#8221; is simply the Lord Himself coming back as the Spirit of reality. He said, &#8220;I go to the Father&#8221; (v. 12) and then &#8220;I am coming to you&#8221; (v. 18). The One who was coming was the very One who was going away! Not only the Spirit of reality &#8220;shall be in you&#8221; (v. 17); in that day the disciples would know &#8220;that I am...in you&#8221; (v. 20). &#8220;The Spirit of reality&#8221; and &#8220;I&#8221; clearly refer to the same Person.<p>Do you realize that the Spirit is the reality of Christ? When you have the Spirit, you have Christ. When you call on the name of the Lord Jesus, the Spirit comes. By calling &#8220;Lord Jesus,&#8221; you have the Person of Jesus, who is the Spirit.<p>The Lord&#8217;s earthly life lasted thirty-three and a half years. After that period of time, He was ready, by undergoing death and resurrection, to become the Spirit. The last Adam, the One who was the Word become flesh, in resurrection became a life-giving Spirit (1 Cor. 15:45, Gk.).<h2 class=head2>John 20</h2><p>On the evening of the very day He was resurrected, He came back to the disciples as the Spirit. Though the disciples had the doors shut for fear of the Jews, Jesus somehow appeared in their midst. In this new form He did not need to come in through the door. After talking with them and showing them His hands and His side, &#8220;He breathed into them and said to them, Receive the Holy Spirit&#8221; (see John 20:19-23). Here is the last Adam in resurrection, as the life-giving Spirit being breathed into the disciples.<h2 class=head1>ALL-INCLUSIVE</h2><p>The resurrection mentioned in the New Testament is this very resurrected One. He is both God and man. While He was on this earth, He lived in humanity by God. Then He entered into death. With Him man and all creation passed through death. His death was all-inclusive. Likewise, He brought us all with Him into resurrection.<p>Noah and the ark typify this all-inclusive death and resurrection. Noah, his family, and all the creatures entered the ark, which represents Christ. The ark and all those who were inside then passed through the death waters. When the ark landed on the mountains of Ararat (Gen. 8:4), all those who were within also came to rest there. In typology this is Christ in resurrection. Not only did Christ enter into resurrection; all those included in Him-mankind and all of creation-did also.<p>The resurrection into which Christ entered through death is the all-inclusive Spirit. These words may seem strange, but some verses may help to make the meaning clear. When the Lord spoke of &#8220;rivers of living water&#8221; flowing out of those who came to Him and drank, &#8220;this He said concerning the Spirit, Whom those who believed in Him were about to receive; for the Spirit was not yet, because Jesus was not yet glorified&#8221; (John 7:37-39). We know that Jesus was glorified when He was resurrected. What Spirit is this that &#8220;was not yet&#8221; before the resurrection?<p>The anointing ointment described in Exodus 30:23-25 (see also Life Message Eight, pp. 75-76) is a picture of this very Spirit. Before the death and resurrection of Christ, the Spirit of God was in type only the olive oil. But now the olive oil has four spices added to it, making it a compound ointment. What are these four spices which have been compounded into the Spirit of God? They represent the humanity, death, and resurrection of Christ. This enriched Spirit is the resurrection, the endless and indestructible life. Our life has an end, but the resurrection is an endless life. This indestructible life is the all-inclusive Spirit, the Spirit of God compounded with the death, resurrection, and humanity of Christ. This compounded Spirit is the Lord Jesus today.<h2 class=head1>IN OUR SPIRIT</h2><p>Where is this One who is the resurrection and the all-inclusive Spirit? Jesus Christ today is in our spirit (2 Tim. 4:22). Romans 8:16 says &#8220;The Spirit...with our spirit.&#8221; The Spirit is not with our mind nor with our heart but with our spirit. This very One, who is endless, indestructible life, is in our spirit.<p>How can you identify your spirit? It is the part of you that is still there after you deduct your mind, your emotions, and your will. Suppose, for example, you are deciding whether to go to the meeting. Your mind says no; it is tired of meetings. Your emotions are not in favor of going either; they choose to go along with the mind. Your will is also in agreement with the mind and emotions that you should not go. Even your heart declares that it wants to rest and joins the others in voting to stay home. Now, if you deduct the feelings in your mind, emotions, will, and heart, you will sense that there is yet another part of you, welling up to say that it would like to go and asking you to disregard the opinions of your mind, emotions, will, and heart. This is your spirit!<p>Here is another illustration. Suppose there is a brother whose ways do not appeal to you. Your emotions say, &#8220;I can&#8217;t stand him.&#8221; Your will says, &#8220;His manner is obnoxious.&#8221; Your mind says, &#8220;I have no use for such an illogical person.&#8221; Your heart says, &#8220;The less I see of him, the better.&#8221; But after you subtract all these negative reactions, there is still a part within which says, &#8220;There is something about him I like. I cannot despise and disregard him.&#8221; Do you see how your spirit is distinct from your emotions, will, mind, and heart?<p>The Spirit with our spirit! Here is the Christian life- victory, sanctification, the Lord&#8217;s presence, and all that He is. Romans 8:4 tells us that we are not to walk according to flesh, but according to spirit. The mind set on the spirit is life and peace (v. 6). When we walk according to this Spirit with our spirit, God is pleased.<h1 class=msg>CHAPTER THIRTY-SIX</h1><h1 class=msg>IN OUR SPIRIT-GOD&#8217;S GOOD PLEASURE</h1><p>Nothing is so neglected by Christians as our spirit. In fact, most Christians are unaware that they have one. How many know that this is where regeneration transpires?<p>Regeneration means having another life added to our natural life. It is not merely having our behavior changed or our being renewed; even Confucius taught the need for that. Regeneration is a new birth, bringing the eternal, uncreated life of God into us. It is accomplished by the Spirit of God in our spirit.<p>Our first birth is a marvel, but the second birth far exceeds it in wonder. Who designed the intricate structure of the eye? Who formed our two ears? We cannot fathom how God forms all our parts in just nine months&#8217; time, so detailed and so well suited to their function. Yet as wonderful as our natural birth is, our second birth is much more wonderful.<p>Let us answer some questions before we continue the message.<h2 class=head1>QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS</h2><p><I>I come from a small locality and feel that I should have the habit of functioning in the meetings. But since we have been hearing how the meeting life must come out of our private life, I have had a problem about sharing because my private life is not that glorious. Sometimes I spend my time with the Lord sleeping on my Bible. Then when I check in the meeting how my time with the Lord was, I feel as though if I say something, it will be empty.</I><p>Your habit of functioning in the meetings should be dropped. We should not function out of habit. The proper church life surely depends upon our proper daily living. Day by day we need to live and walk in our spirit. This will result in some experiences of Christ. Come to the meetings with the riches you have experienced of Christ. In the meeting stay in your spirit. Don&#8217;t decide to function or not to function. Don&#8217;t think you have to function according to your habit. As you stay in your spirit, when the time comes, the Spirit may impress you to function. Then you share in the spirit the riches you have experienced in your daily life. Our Christian life must be a walk in the spirit. The riches in the meetings are the outflow of this daily walk.<p><I>In a certain meeting I was trying to sing a hymn with the saints, but the brother sitting next to me kept talking with me about the Lord. I found it very frustrating, because I was trying hard to be in the spirit and to get something out of the hymn. I struggled to will myself to stay in my spirit and to love this brother, but I could not keep it up. How do our mind, emotion, and will interact to get us into the spirit?</I><p>As long as you are endeavoring and thinking how to handle your situation, you are outside the spirit. If you are in your spirit, you will not be bothered by the interrupting brother. You will not even pay that much attention to the singing of the hymn. All your consideration of how to handle this brother is apart from the spirit. When you remain in your spirit, you become the most simple person. Neither the singing nor the bothering brother affect you. In spirit you just join what you should join. This is not to say that problems do not exist. But being in spirit is like being in heaven. The problems do not upset you. I know it is not easy in the beginning to exercise this way, but we need to keep practicing.<p><I>How can we stay on the pathway of life when we come to the Word? I have been trying to do this and praying that the Lord will help me to experience life in His Word. But for so many years I came to the Bible for knowledge that even when I am in the midst of seeking the Lord, I find I have turned back to knowledge.</I><p>The most crucial matter is that you need a change in your concept. Yes, we formerly came to the Bible for knowledge, but now you must realize your need of the life supply. When you come to the Bible, don&#8217;t analyze whether you are coming for knowledge or for life. If you analyze, you are for knowledge. Just come to the Bible for the life supply. Many times this supply comes through the proper knowledge. But don&#8217;t begin to wonder what the proper knowledge is and how you can get it! Just have a change in your view of the Bible. You are coming for the supply of life. Then whether you read, pray-read, or study, the result will be that life is supplied to you.<p><I>Is it accurate to say that the blood cleanses our soul? One of the hymns we sing refers to the &#8220;soul-cleansing blood.&#8221;</I><p>The redeeming blood cleanses us from any sin or defilement. It is probably better to avoid using this term in ordinary talk, though I would not say that it is wrong. The soul means the self. The blood does cleanse us from our sins, but we do not need to call it the &#8220;soul-cleansing&#8221; blood. In our writings we try to stay away from any questionable terminology. We don&#8217;t condemn what others use, but we don&#8217;t necessarily adopt their terms either.<p><I>Could you give us a practical way to deal with our mind when we find we are distracted? I often find my mind is somewhere else, particularly when I&#8217;m in the meetings! How can I turn it back and be in my spirit?</I><p>Do not be discouraged that your efforts to stay in your spirit are a failure many times. When you first begin exercising to deduct the feelings in your mind, your will, and your emotions, you will find you are &#8220;adding&#8221; instead! Keep working on it. At first, you must exercise legally; this practice in the early stage is actually an &#8220;addition.&#8221; Eventually, however, when your &#8220;subtracting&#8221; becomes a habit, it will be spontaneous. Then you will have the real &#8220;subtraction.&#8221;<h2 class=head1>A SEED IN OUR SPIRIT</h2><p>Once we are saved, we sense that something has happened deep within us. We are not the same as we were. Nonetheless, questions begin to arise: Why have we changed so little? Why is our mentality still so dark? How come our emotions are still impure? How is it that our heart is not really honest?<p>Regeneration means that a seed has been planted in our spirit. The divine, uncreated, eternal, unlimited life has been sown into our spirit. At first it does not occupy very much even of our spirit. For this reason we may go on in the same way as we did in the past. Even so, because of this seed we can never be the same.<h2 class=head1>PAYING ATTENTION TO OUR SPIRIT</h2><p>Even those of us in the Lord&#8217;s recovery pay very little attention to our spirit. The best exercise in our Christian life is to call our being back to our spirit. Thinking is a distraction; rather than heed your mentality, be tuned in to your spirit. Whenever Christians seek holiness or victory, they invariably fall short. Their morality may improve somewhat, but until they realize that the Christian life is a matter in our spirit, where the life of God is realized and enjoyed, they will not succeed in living victoriously.<p>On a recent trip to the Northwest I was staying in a couple&#8217;s home. They put me in the best room. Everything was fine, except that when it got dark I could not find the switch to turn on the light. I groped about here and there, but my efforts to locate the switch were all in vain. Finally I had to ask. The switch turned out to be hidden behind the mirror on the dresser. It never would have occurred to me to look there!<p>Is not this a picture of Christians, striving to be victorious but groping in the dark because they do not know where the switch is?<h2 class=head1>DISREGARDING OUR MIND</h2><p>We may realize that the spirit is the switch, but throughout our daily life we use our mind, not our spirit. Even while we are sitting in the meeting, our mind may be on other things. Or we may be listening to the message with our mind, checking out the Scripture references and trying to determine if what is being said is right. The outcome of exercising our mind is that invariably questions arise.<p>Without the exercise of our spirit our experience of Christ will be meager. We are off, even though we are not back in the world nor into sin. We may be near but off, even as a lamp may be quite near the plug but not receive any electric current because it is not plugged in.<p>God would have us turn away from the considerations in our mind and exercise to touch Him, to taste Him, and to find out His will. For us to have such exercise is well pleasing to Him. It is by this very means that we pray without ceasing.<h2 class=head1>WISDOM AND REVELATION IN OUR SPIRIT</h2><p>There are riches in our spirit for us to tap. Paul prayed that we might have &#8220;a spirit of wisdom and revelation in the full knowledge of Him&#8221; (Eph. 1:17). We should ask the Lord to make our regenerated spirit a spirit of wisdom. If we do, before too long we shall find that in our relationship with our parents and others, we are speaking and behaving wisely rather than in our former foolish way. Even others will notice our wisdom. There will not be trickery or cunning wiles but a spirit of wisdom.<p>We need a spirit of both wisdom and revelation. With revelation the whole universe, both physical and spiritual, is clear to us. When we were unsaved, we were in a dark cell, enclosed by thick walls. But now that we are saved, we should be in a transparent, glass room. Our vision should be as clear as when we are in a car; no matter which direction we look, the see-through glass gives us an unobscured view.<p>The living creatures in Revelation 4:6 are &#8220;full of eyes in front and behind.&#8221; Our eyes let the light into us. We need to be full of eyes, so that we have a clear view. This clear view is the spirit of revelation.<p>To understand the view, we need, besides the spirit of revelation, the spirit of wisdom. With our eyes we may be able to see the words on the printed page, but without understanding we shall not grasp their meaning.<p>This may be the case when we read the Bible. We read the words, but the meaning is hidden from us. If we keep praying for a spirit of wisdom and revelation, we shall find that the words of the Bible open up to us, and that whenever we read its pages, we have some measure of understanding.<h2 class=head1>PRAYING</h2><p>God&#8217;s good pleasure is that we walk in this mingled spirit. But this is not our habit. To accustom ourselves to doing this, we need to keep turning to the Lord in prayer during the day. &#8220;Lord, make my regenerated spirit one of wisdom and transparency. When I look at the church or at the saints, make everything transparent. When I read the Bible, make every page clear.&#8221;<p>Do not trust in your cleverness. However sharp your mind is, it is too low and small for you to put your confidence in it. If you are involved in a car accident, your cleverness may tell you to drive away quickly, but this is not the voice of wisdom in your spirit.<p>Pray for this wisdom. Pray that God may give you a spirit of wisdom and revelation.<h2 class=head1>REVELATION ON THE CHURCH</h2><p>Paul tells us that God has revealed the mystery of Christ to us in spirit (Eph. 3:4-5). In Ephesians it is the church that is referred to as the mystery of Christ. Christ is the mystery of God (Col. 2:2), since God is embodied in Him. Because Christ is realized in the church, the church is the mystery of Christ. Without a revelation in our spirit, we cannot know the church. There are countless Christians to whom the church remains a mystery; they do not know how to look to the Lord through their spirit. The mystery is revealed only in spirit.<h2 class=head1>A PURE HEART AND SINGLE MOTIVE</h2><p>Our heart is like an envelope, containing the spirit (1 Pet. 3:4). To have a transparent spirit to see God&#8217;s revelation, we must have our heart thoroughly dealt with. &#8220;Lord, purify my heart. Not only cleanse it, but purify it from any covering. Make my motive single, that my only concern may be to see You, to see Your recovery, and to see the mystery.&#8221;<p>Without a pure heart and a single motive, our view of things is foggy. Our vision of the church may be like a rainbow, disappearing from sight after a while! The problem with seeing is not in our spirit. The problem has to do with the &#8220;envelope&#8221; in which our spirit is wrapped. Our heart may not be pure; we may be motivated by hidden desires for rank or status.<p>Pray that the Lord may do this purifying work in you. Then you will be steady in seeing the revelation. The mystery of Christ, which is the church, will be revealed to your spirit.<h2 class=head1>SUBTRACTING</h2><p>Christians are not secular, worldly people. As children of God and members of Christ, we must learn to &#8220;subtract&#8221; how we feel in our mind, emotion, will, and heart and take care of our spirit. When we are all set to quarrel with a brother, do these four subtractions! The wish to quarrel will be gone, and the spirit will come out. We should not be people in our mind, emotion, or will. Our mind may be shrewd, but subtract it! Our emotions may be strong, but do not live in them! Our will may be set, but turn from it!<p>Whatever confronts us-things great or small, good or bad, right or wrong-we need to be in our spirit. Remain there. &#8220;Abide in Me&#8221; (John 15:4). This wonderful &#8220;Me&#8221; is right in our spirit. To abide in Him that is where we must be. Stay there. If you have moved out, move back in.<h2 class=head1>GOD PLEASED</h2><p>God is happy when He sees that we remain in our spirit. Our spirit is our hope. It is our home. It is our country. There is no place else we should be. Hallelujah for this wonderful home in which we can stay! If we want to please the Lord, we must be sure He always finds us here.<h1 class=msg>CHAPTER THIRTY-SEVEN</h1><h1 class=msg>STRENGTHENED INTO THE INNER MAN- GOD&#8217;S GOOD PLEASURE</h1><p>As human beings, made up of body, soul, and spirit, we need to understand more about our person. The body is not our person, but a vessel containing it. The spirit is not our person either, but an organ through which God may be contacted. It is the soul which is our person. In order for us to adequately know our spirit, we must first distinguish these different parts of which we are comprised.<h2 class=head1>THE SOUL</h2><p>In referring to people, the Bible calls them souls. &#8220;All the souls that came out of the loins of Jacob were seventy souls&#8221; (Exo. 1:5) means that there were seventy people. &#8220;There were added unto them about three thousand souls&#8221; (Acts 2:41) means there were three thousand more persons with them. Every person is a soul. From this we may infer that the soul is the person. When the rich man in Luke 16 died, his body was buried, but his person still existed in Hades (vv. 22-31).<p>Our human life, the self, is in the soul. The body is the seat of bios, the physical life. Psuche, our person, is in our soul.<h2 class=head1>A CHANGE AT REGENERATION</h2><p>When we are regenerated, this picture of the soul as our person and the spirit as the organ by which we contact God, changes. With the divine life coming into our spirit, another Person is within us. Our existence becomes complicated, because the natural person in our soul is not in agreement with the Person in our spirit. In a way regeneration is like getting married. When you are single, you make all the decisions according to your preference. But once you have a husband, he may want the window open when you want it shut, or he may want you to go out with him when you want to stay home. This same complication, of two persons with conflicting ways, arises in us as Christians.<p>Our soul is the natural man. Our spirit, regenerated and indwelt by the Holy Spirit, is the inner man. It is this second Person, the inner man, that is the object of God&#8217;s good pleasure. In actuality, this Person is Jesus Christ, mingled with you. He is God&#8217;s delight. The person in your soul is offensive and displeasing to God, but the One in your spirit is a sweet fragrance to Him.<p>This mingling of the Holy Spirit with the human spirit is a mingling of divinity with humanity. The life that has come into us is divine and eternal.<h2 class=head1>COPING WITH TWO PERSONS</h2><p>How shall we take care of these two lives? Is the person in the soul to be nourished and beautified? The Bible calls him our old man and says that he has been crucified with Christ (Rom. 6:6). What we must do with this first person is to disregard him. In the words of the Lord Jesus, &#8220;If anyone desires to come after Me, let him deny himself, and take up his cross, and follow Me&#8221; (Matt. 16:24). To take up the cross means to stay there, where Christ has put us. Declare to the old man in the soul that he is on the cross. Then deny him by disregarding him.<p>Does this mean that the soul is nullified? The natural life in our soul has been crucified, but the functions of the soul still remain and are still useful. Our soul still thinks and decides, loves and hates. It is not our mind, emotion, and will which have been crucified, but rather the old man in the soul. What has happened is that the soul is no longer the person, but an organ. Now the spirit is the person, no longer only an organ.<p>In our daily experience we find that part of the time we are persons in the soul and other times our person is in the spirit. While we are attending the meeting, we may be a person in the spirit, listening to God&#8217;s Word, praying, and worshipping. But after we get home, something our spouse does may annoy us, and again we become persons in our soul. Our irritation may last most of the night, making us sleepless. When we get up the next morning, we say to the Lord, &#8220;Forgive me, Lord, for my failure last night. Cleanse me by Your blood.&#8221; Once again we enjoy the Lord&#8217;s presence and become a person in the spirit.<h2 class=head1>TRAVELING</h2><p>God wants us to be persons in the spirit. The soul&#8217;s use is as an organ; it is not to be our person. Many, many times in the course of the day, however, we travel back and forth from spirit to soul and from soul to spirit. Our soul needs to be exhorted, &#8220;Soul, formerly you were my person, but now you are simply an organ. I do not regard you as my person. My real person is the inner man, my spirit indwelt by the Holy Spirit with the Lord Jesus.&#8221;<p>Ask the Lord to help you practice. &#8220;Lord, thank You that I have a new person. I am not that old man. My regenerated spirit, indwelt by You, is my new person. Help me to walk, live, act, and speak in the spirit, no longer in the soul. I want to live by the inner man.&#8221;<p>This kind of prayer may be new to us. It is far more common to pray for the Lord to help us submit to our husband or to love our wife, that we might obey His Word. But praying in an ethical way like this results in even less submission and love than before.<p>Rejoice in this new Person within you. He submits to the headship. In Him is the love for your wife. This Person is the very Lord Himself mingling with your spirit.<p>What we have said thus far is a preparation for us to understand Ephesians 3:16: &#8220;That He would grant you, according to the riches of His glory, to be strengthened with power through His Spirit into the inner man.&#8221; For many years I have been considering this verse. It is not easy to understand.<h2 class=head1>&#8220;STRENGTHENED&#8221;</h2><p>When the apostle prayed that God the Father would grant us to be strengthened, he was praying for our precise need. We are weak. Our need is to be made strong.<h2 class=head1>&#8220;ACCORDING TO THE RICHES OF HIS GLORY&#8221;</h2><p>This phrase, though we can easily read the words, is hard to understand. We are to be strengthened according to a standard. That standard is the extent of the riches of God&#8217;s glory. The strengthening is not only according to the degree of God&#8217;s glory, but even to the riches of His glory. What do these profound words mean?<p>Glory is God manifested. If we pray that we may be strengthened into our inner man, the result will be that we are full of God&#8217;s expression. When God is expressed, there is glory. The riches of His glory are the divine virtues; namely, love, life, light, holiness, and righteousness. These riches of God&#8217;s expression will be seen in us. Others will sense the glory of God upon us. This is the meaning of God&#8217;s strengthening us according to the riches of His glory.<h2 class=head1>&#8220;WITH POWER&#8221;</h2><p>The Greek word for power here is related to the English words dynamo and dynamic. The power referred to is like a generator; it means a tremendous force. This is the very power that sufficed to raise Christ from the dead, uplift Him to the third heaven, and seat Him there far above all (Eph. 1:19-21). It is with this same power that God the Father would strengthen us. What a mighty power there is within our spirit!<h2 class=head1>&#8220;THROUGH HIS SPIRIT&#8221;</h2><p>It is through the Spirit of God that we are strengthened with power.<h2 class=head1>&#8220;INTO THE INNER MAN&#8221;</h2><p>This phrase, especially the word into, troubled me for years. Why did Paul use the word into rather than in? No doubt he chose the word into intentionally. Gradually through experience I began to understand the thought behind the words.<p>When we are weak, we are outside the inner man. We are in our mind, or emotion, or will, or heart. If we are considering how inadequate the elders are or how insubordinate the sisters are, we may be assured that we are in the mind. Whatever we are thinking will lead to trouble. Flee from the mind! Escape to the spirit! We are weak when we are in our mind.<p>The mind is the highway on which the brothers drive. Most sisters, in contrast, are in their emotions. They consider why this or that sister does not pay any attention to them, or why the elders respect another sister more than them. There are also a few brothers and sisters who stay in their will. Their aspiration is to be better than all the others in the church. They resolve not to criticize the elders, even though they feel the elders are not doing a good job.<p>These descriptions give us a picture of the general condition of a local church: most brothers in their mind, most sisters in their emotion, and a few brothers and sisters in their will. What a weak condition! That is why Paul prayed that God the Father might grant us to be strengthened into the inner man.<h2 class=head1>THE WAY TO BE STRENGTHENED</h2><p>Exhorting or admonishing the saints does not help to bring them into the inner man. Telling the brothers and sisters not to gossip, for example, seems to lead to more gossip. The best way to be drawn into your inner man is to pray. Forget your situation. Do not consider your condition. Do not be concerned about your gossiping tongue. Pray! &#8220;Lord, I need You. I want to breathe You in. Impart Yourself into the depths of my being. I long to see You. Meet me as I pray-read Your Word. Add more and more of Yourself to me.&#8221;<p>If you spend some time praying this way, you will find that you are transferred from your mind, or emotion, or will, or even your heart, and into your spirit. The interest in gossiping will be gone. You will be strengthened by the Spirit of God with power.<p>The Father longs to see us live this way. His good pleasure is that we be strengthened into the inner man according to the riches of His glory. Morality and ethical virtue cannot compare with the expression of the divine life through us. It is not a matter of staying away from department stores or from places of worldly entertainment because we do not love the world any more. That attitude is too shallow. What we do is the outcome of our being strengthened with power through His Spirit into the inner man.<h2 class=head1>FILLED</h2><p>When we are thus strengthened, Christ will make His home in our hearts and we shall be filled unto all the fullness of God (Eph. 3:17, 19). This is the church life. By being filled with God&#8217;s riches, we become the expression of those riches. We are strengthened into our inner man, Christ makes His home in our heart, and we are filled even to the extent of the full expression of God.<p>Do not think such a living is beyond us. If this were not possible, it would not be mentioned in the Word. This is the normal church life, fully expressing the Triune God. The Lord&#8217;s recovery is not for doctrines nor for outward practices. It is that we may experience this very strengthening into our inner man, that Christ may occupy our whole being until eventually we are filled with God unto His full expression. Do not be discouraged about the elders. Do not worry about the condition of the church. Do not talk about this brother or that sister. Pray, &#8220;Lord, thank You for my regenerated spirit where Christ dwells. Do strengthen me according to the riches of Your glory, by Your powerful Spirit, into my inner man. Spread out from my spirit and settle also in my heart. Make Your home in my whole inward being, that I may be filled with God, unto His full expression.&#8221;<h2 class=head1>BUILT TOGETHER</h2><p>When the Lord wholly occupies us, we are one with all believers. This oneness is the meaning of being built together. &#8220;Being built upon the foundation of the apostles and prophets, Christ Jesus Himself being the cornerstone, in Whom all the building, being fitted together, is growing into a holy temple in the Lord, in Whom you also are being built together into a dwelling place of God in spirit&#8221; (Eph. 2:20-22). Being close to certain saints is not what is meant by being built together. It is when we are fully one with the Lord and saturated with Him that we are also one with all other believers.<h2 class=head1>DISPOSITIONAL HINDRANCES</h2><p>The building comes as the element of Christ increases in us. Suppose you go to Japan and meet a Japanese brother there. You will sense a kinship with him, because you both have the life-giving Spirit, even if only in an initial way, connecting you. But if you spend some length of time together, you will begin to feel uneasy. He does not express his feelings, and you cannot tell if he is happy or annoyed. You speak so openly, but he is inscrutable. The American disposition differs from the Japanese.<p>But the same problem of disposition arises in a brothers&#8217; house where all are Americans. They have the initial relationship through the life-giving Spirit, but friction arises even in the matter of washing dishes because each brother has his own disposition. Even though they are growing as they attend the meetings week by week, their disposition does not change.<p>Your disposition will faithfully cling to you year after year! God&#8217;s economy is not to change your disposition but to fill you with Christ. As He increases in you, you will gradually change. Little by little you will be saturated with Him and your own dis position will be swallowed up.<h2 class=head1>THE INCREASE OF CHRIST</h2><p>This organic, inward change, which is called sanctification and transformation, makes us one with other saints wherever we go. When this is the case, we are built up. Please be clear that building among the saints is not intimacy, friendship, or affection. It is purely the increase of Christ in all of us.<p>You must grow. For Christ to increase you must remain in, or return to, your spirit, where He is. Do not try to improve yourself. Practice staying in your spirit. If you walk out, come back quickly. Especially work on this at home. It is easy to be in spirit in the meetings or when you are with more spiritual ones. The test comes when you are alone with your spouse. This is the easiest time to indulge your self.<p>May the Father strengthen us all into the inner man, that Christ may make His home in our hearts, and that we may be built together into a dwelling place of God in spirit. This is His good pleasure.<h1 class=msg>CHAPTER THIRTY-EIGHT</h1><h1 class=msg>WORSHIPPING IN SPIRIT-GOD&#8217;S GOOD PLEASURE</h1><p>The New Testament reveals that when we were regenerated a great change took place in our constitution. The main part of a natural man by birth is the soul. The soul not only has the parts of mind, emotion, and will, but also is the person. At regeneration the person shifts from the soul to the spirit.<p>Strictly speaking, we should no longer be a soul. We should only use its parts. I would not say that we should be a spirit, but at least we can say that we must consider our spirit as our person. This is not to say that our spirit is no longer an organ.<h2 class=head1>THE SPIRIT AS AN ORGAN</h2><p>In John 4:23 and 24 we are told that God is to be worshipped in spirit. The word in may be considered as an instrumental preposition and can therefore be translated with. We worship with our spirit. This indicates that our spirit serves as an organ. We see with our eyes, hear with our ears, and worship with our spirit. When we say we worship in spirit, we mean that we worship in the realm of the spirit. When we say we worship with our spirit, we mean that the spirit is the part of our being by which we worship. The spirit then has become not only the new person, the inner man, but also the new organ with which we worship God.<h2 class=head1>SERVICE AND WORSHIP</h2><p>The word worship in Greek implies also the thought of service. Romans 1:9 reads, &#8220;For God is my witness, Whom I serve in my spirit in the gospel of His Son.&#8221; The word serve in this verse is translated worship in some other versions. Whether we say worship or serve, the meaning is the same. Our worship is our service to God; our service to Him is also our worship. When we worship Him, we serve Him; when we serve Him, we worship Him.<h2 class=head1>THE HUMAN SPIRIT, NOT THE HOLY SPIRIT</h2><p>The human spirit, as the organ by which we worship or serve God, is largely unknown among Christians. When they come across the word spirit, they understand it as the Holy Spirit.<p>Brother Nee wrote a book called The Release of the Spirit. Christians who read this title may think that what is meant is the release of the Holy Spirit. If you read the book, however, you will see how Brother Nee stresses that he is referring to the human spirit, not to the Holy Spirit.<p>Many Christians have a very light regard for the human spirit. In Christian theology there is a school of dichotomy, which teaches that man has two parts, not three. They consider that soul and spirit are synonyms.<p>This kind of belief affects the way the Bible has been translated. The Chinese version, though it is a good translation, in many verses renders the word spirit as heart-spirit. Such a rendering shows that the scholars lacked a clear vision concerning the human spirit. What is heart-spirit? This is an odd term! Though the scholars knew the language, they did not know the spirit so well. They realized that the word pneuma in John 4:24 does not refer to the Holy Spirit, but to some organ of our being. Thinking that the Chinese mentality would misunderstand spirit, they added another word, making it heart-spirit. They thought that the heart and the human spirit are the same.<h2 class=head1>THE FOCUS OF GOD&#8217;S ECONOMY</h2><p>God&#8217;s New Testament economy is focused on our human spirit and is carried out by the divine Spirit and the human spirit being mingled together. First Corinthians 6:17 states, &#8220;He that is joined unto the Lord is one spirit.&#8221;<p>Paul says, &#8220;To me to live is Christ&#8221; (Phil. 1:21). Who is Christ? Is He not God? Who is &#8220;me&#8221;? It is Saul of Tarsus, a mere man. How could a man live God? We do not understand very well, but we can enjoy what the Word says by eating it. When the Word says we are joined to Him in one spirit, we reply, &#8220;Hallelujah! I am a man, but I have a spirit! I am one spirit with the Lord!&#8221;<p>Does this mean we are lowering God down to man&#8217;s level? Are we lifting up man to God&#8217;s level? The answer to both questions is yes! God has become incarnate. &#8220;The Word became flesh&#8221; (John 1:14). Flesh is a negative term for man. It was not until after the fall that man was called the flesh (see Genesis 6:3). Since the incarnation was after the fall, the Word became flesh, that is, became a man under the fall. God was lowered to the level of fallen man. His being lowered lifts us to the level of God. This traffic of coming down and going up results in a mingling. Whether the mingling occurs on the low level or on the high level, I do not know, but I do know that there is a mingling! More than this I do not need to know.<h2 class=head1>THE EFFECTS OF DISREGARDING OUR SPIRIT</h2><p>In this mingled spirit God&#8217;s economy can be carried out. Christians often talk of the Holy Spirit in strange ways, but concerning the human spirit, they are blind. How about us? We may have been enlightened, but we are not absolute concerning our spirit. In the church life, we still exercise our mind. We still give too much room to our emotions, especially the sisters. We do not adequately appreciate and use our spirit. If questions arise in the church life, sisters react emotionally. Words will not subdue them, but tears will. With the brothers the problem is with their big head and their turning eyes! While they are listening to a message, they are thinking, &#8220;Yes, but-.&#8221; Most brothers are too logical and most sisters too illogical. Besides the problems of emotion and logic, there is also the matter of the strong will. The stubborn ones do not care what is said nor how many tears the sisters shed. Their only concern is their stubborn will.<p>These three problems do not wait for a time of turmoil to appear. Even in the prayer meeting or in the Lord&#8217;s table meeting, some brothers are exercising their mind, some sisters are exercising their emotions, and some strong-willed ones are thinking how much they know and how little the elders know.<p>Disregarding our spirit in this way annuls our worship. When we come to the meetings, and in our daily life as well, we must learn to use our mind, our emotion, and our will as utensils. Just as we use a key to open the door and then put the key back in our pocket and forget about it, so when we need to use our emotions, or our mind, or our will, we use them temporarily but we do not remain in them. We remain in our spirit. When we hear gossip being spoken, we exercise our spirit. When we come to the meetings, even the more we forget about our mind, emotions, and will and come wholly and absolutely in our spirit.<h2 class=head1>THE MEANING OF WORSHIPPING IN SPIRIT</h2><p>To worship in spirit is to worship in oneness. When the Lord talked to the Samaritan woman, she was exposed as a sinner. She therefore turned the subject from the matter of husbands to the matter of worship. She changed the topic of conversation from an ugly shameful subject to the marvelous, wonderful one of worship! &#8220;Jesus said to her, You have well said, I don&#8217;t have a husband; for you have had five husbands, and the one you now have is not your husband&#8221; (John 4:17-18). The woman&#8217;s reply was, &#8220;Our fathers worshipped in this mountain, and you say that in Jerusalem is the place where men must worship&#8221; (v. 20). The Lord&#8217;s reply was that the age had changed. Formerly to worship God people had to go to God&#8217;s chosen center, Jerusalem, Mount Zion. Now the hour was changing. It was a new age because Christ had come. The worship was no longer to be on this mountain nor in Jerusalem, but in spirit (see vv. 21-24).<p>This spirit in which we worship God is the fulfillment of Jerusalem. In Deuteronomy 12, 14, 15, and 16 the Lord again and again charged the children of Israel that when they entered the good land they should not worship Him in the place of their preference. They must come to the appointed place with their tithes and the top portion of the produce of the good land. They must come to the place where God would set His name and where His habitation would be.<h2 class=head1>ONENESS IN JERUSALEM</h2><p>For centuries that unique center, Jerusalem, kept the children of Israel in oneness. The males were required to appear there before the Lord three times a year; otherwise, they would be cut off.<p>Suppose I lived in those days and had a quarrel with my neighbor about his barking dog. I would tell him the dog had kept me awake all night. Did not God say, through Moses, that we should love our neighbor as ourself? Didn&#8217;t he care that I couldn&#8217;t get any sleep all night? The result of the quarrel was that we stopped talking to each other. Two months went by. It was now the seventh month; the feast of tabernacles was coming up. Both my neighbor and I had to go or we would be stoned to death. We both went, he along one lane and I along another. When we reached the foothill of Mount Zion, there was only one way. We had to go up together, singing the songs of ascent. How could we sing, &#8220;Behold, how good and how pleasant it is for brethren to dwell together in unity!&#8221; (Psa. 133:1) when we were still not at peace with each other? I was the older one. My heart was softened. I greeted him, saying, &#8220;Hi, brother. I still love you.&#8221;<h2 class=head1>ONENESS IN THE CHURCH LIFE</h2><p>Do you see how this unique center forces us to be one? This is the worship in Jerusalem. In the New Testament the worship is in spirit. We know this because Ephesians 2:22 says that God&#8217;s dwelling place today is in our spirit. Our spirit is the center where we worship God. The children of Israel were divided into many groups, but whenever they came to Jerusalem they were one. The same is true of us. When we are in our emotions, or in the mind, or in our will, we are divided. Not only can the emotional sisters not be one with the strong-minded brothers; these same brothers cannot be one with each other.<p>Suppose there is a service group meeting. If you do not go in your spirit, be prepared for arguing. Within ten minutes you will all be expressing your concepts, even if you are only discussing the best time to meet. The problem is not with your heart; you all love the Lord and have a heart for the church. The problem is with your head. You cannot be one with others in your mind.<p>The best way to come together to serve in oneness is to avoid talk. Pray instead. When we were in Elden Hall in Los Angeles in 1965 to 1967, the serving brothers could not work together. When they met, they began to discuss. (They called it fellowship!) The more they &#8220;fellowshipped,&#8221; the more opinions they had. Then they would begin to argue. In 1966 pray-reading came in, and then in 1968 calling on the name of the Lord. After that there was no more &#8220;fellowship.&#8221; When the service groups met, they would pray-read and call on the name of the Lord. This brought them all into one spirit. That was the end of their opinions. Where did they become one? In the spirit. Where are Christians divided? In their mentality.<p>If we do not keep ourselves in the spirit, but indulge in using our mind, we shall soon be divided. All of us in the recovery must be on the alert. We must have a holy fear of our opinions. Paul told the divisive Corinthians that they should be perfectly attuned to the same opinion (1 Cor. 1:10, Gk.). How can we be attuned to one opinion? It is only by exercising our spirit. If I do not remain in my spirit, I can give you several opinions. We all are opinionated. As long as we are living, we have opinions. While we are listening to a message, we may be thinking about what the speaker is wearing, or why some brother&#8217;s hair is cut a certain way. Our opinions are always critical of others. What shall we do about these critical opinions? Let us turn to our spirit; just a little turn, and all criticisms stop.<p>If you try to eliminate the opinions of the saints by teaching or admonishing, that very teaching is an opinion. It does not help to try to adjust others. Do not make comments about how they dress. Your business is to turn to your spirit. Don&#8217;t talk about the Scripture verses that you interpret differently. The best church is the one where opinions are not heard. Everyone practices turning to the spirit.<p>Many times we are unaware that we are criticizing. We may ask a simple question right after the meeting, like, &#8220;How was the meeting this morning?&#8221; Such a question unlocks the door to opinion. The reply will be, &#8220;Oh, the message was all right, but-.&#8221; There is always a but. We must learn to answer such questions with &#8220;Praise the Lord!&#8221; It is not safe to express any opinion. Whether the meeting is living or dead, have no idea. Exercise not to discuss how it is. It is not easy to stay out of our mind or our emotions and remain in our spirit. In this place there is no vain talk, no unnecessary fellowship, and no opinions. Rather, there is prayer, singing, and praising.<h2 class=head1>JOY IN THE SPIRIT</h2><p>In the church life we should all &#8220;be filled in spirit, speaking to one another in psalms and hymns and spiritual songs, singing and psalming with your heart to the Lord&#8221; (Eph. 5:18-19). &#8220;Let the word of Christ dwell in you richly in all wisdom; teaching and admonishing one another in psalms and hymns and spiritual songs, singing with grace in your hearts to the Lord&#8221; (Col. 3:16). We are to be filled not only with the riches of God, but with the Word of God. The living Word will so fill us that we shall be singing, praising, and psalming. Rather than exercising the mind or giving room to the emotions, our whole being will be filled with joy in the spirit.<p>This is the right church life. It can only be in our spirit. It is easy to walk out of our spirit without even realizing it. We may have departed quite far away, yet not know it. But once we discover that we are away, we should return quickly.<h2 class=head1>RECOVERING THE USE OF THE SPIRIT</h2><p>It is not possible to overstress this matter of the spirit. If we take away from the New Testament these two spirits, the divine and the human, the New Testament becomes empty. Yet Christians pay inaccurate attention to the Holy Spirit and nearly neglect the human spirit. Now is the time when the Lord will recover not only the proper realization of the Holy Spirit, but also the full use of our human spirit.<p>The most pleasant thing in the eyes of God today is that we remain in our spirit. May we not want to say anything apart from our spirit. May we not want to go anywhere or do anything without being in our spirit. All day long &#8220;in spirit&#8221; should govern us and direct all our activities. If we speak, think, move, and act in spirit, we are victorious, holy, and spiritual. We shall be pleasant, not only to ourselves, but to God and others as well. Such a daily life is a good pleasure to God. A Christian life and a church life that are in spirit are what pleases Him.<h1 class=msg>CHAPTER THIRTY-NINE</h1><h1 class=msg>THE FATHER&#8217;S LIFE AND THE SON&#8217;S LIVING</h1><p>Though most Christians know that the subject of the Gospel of John is life, few know how to take such a life. Yes, it is correct to say that believing in Christ is the way to take this life, but how can we live such a life out? Since my youth, when I received the Lord, I knew He was my life, yet I kept wondering how I could live by His life. How could it be practical to me in my daily living?<h2 class=head1>YOUR LIFE VS. YOUR LIVING</h2><p>No doubt you too have this same question. You realize you have eternal life, the very life of God, yet your living is another story. How about your temper? your sulkiness? your gossiping? your loose life? your light, joking words? Are these the living of the divine life? According to the inner life, you are a certain person; but according to your living, you are another. These two stories are with you all day long. The ten minutes you spend in the Word every morning are wonderful, but what about the rest of the time? Part of the day you experience a bird&#8217;s life, soaring and free! But you have also the experience of a dog&#8217;s life, barking on the earth, even though your barking may be only in a whisper!<p>Why is it that we have a bird&#8217;s life yet have a dog&#8217;s living? Our living does not correspond with our life. I was saved over fifty years ago, when I was in my late teens. China at that time was a heathen country, full of the teachings of Confucius and the idols of Buddhism. Yet in that heathen country the Lord did grant His gracious visitation not only to me but also to many other seeking college students. I believe this visitation was the answer to the prayers of many saints in England who prayed for China after the Boxer rebellion in 1900, when many foreign missionaries were killed. The Lord came in around 1920 and saved many of us college students. We loved the Lord, and we loved the Bible. Yet we were desperately in need of help. The missionaries were able to help in the gospel, but they did not know how to live Christ. From searching the Word and seeking the Lord, we knew we needed a living to match the life within us. We collected many spiritual books, but even in them we could not find the way.<p>After a number of years we found out that in the Gospel of John there is first the believing in Jesus as the Son of God and then the loving of Him. In 1:12 there is the matter of believing. To believe is to receive the Son of God. In 21:15-17 the matter of loving is raised. &#8220;Simon, son of John, do you love Me?&#8221; Peter was asked three times. To receive this life we must believe in the Son of God, but to live the life we have received we must love.<h2 class=head1>THE SECRET OF LIVING OUT THIS LIFE</h2><p>Neither believing nor loving, however, is the secret of living out the life we have received. The key is found in John 5, 6, and 7. The principle is that this life of someone has to be lived out by another. Only in these three chapters is it clear that the life is the Father&#8217;s, yet He does not live this life out. His desire is to have the Son live it out. The life is the Father&#8217;s, but the living is the Son&#8217;s. John 6:57 says, &#8220;As the living Father sent Me, and I live because of the Father, so he who eats Me shall also live because of Me.&#8221; Then 5:26 says, &#8220;For even as the Father has life in Himself, so He gave to the Son also to have life in Himself.&#8221; By considering these two verses together, you can see that the life was the Father&#8217;s, yet He wanted the Son to live it out. This life involves two persons; it is the life of the first, but it is lived by the second. The two have one life with one living. The matter of living does not pertain to the Father, but to the Son. Yet the life is not the Son&#8217;s, but the Father&#8217;s.<h2 class=head1>TWO PERSONS BUT ONE LIFE LIVED</h2><p>Does 5:26 mean that the Father has the life and lives, while the Son also has the life but with a separate living? How many Persons are mentioned here? There are two, one the Giver and the other the Receiver. How many livings? Only one. How there could be two Persons but only one living is too mysterious for us to understand; all we know is what the Bible says.<h2 class=head1>AN ILLUSTRATION</h2><p>I have seen a few marriages which demonstrate this principle. In such cases, the husband and wife have only one living. Though two people are involved, the wife&#8217;s living is her husband&#8217;s. When there are two livings in married life, the result is separation and divorce. Do you and your spouse have only one living?<p>Marriage is not only a human living arrangement, but also a picture of the divine relationship. Christ is the husband and the church is the wife, as Ephesians 5 makes plain. Should the church, the wife of Christ, have a living separate from Him?<p>The key to married life is not found in Ephesians 5 but in John 5, 6, and 7. Too many Christians study the black and white instructions in Ephesians 5 without ever getting the secret of such a wonderful life. When a couple has only one life and one living, that is heaven.<p>Perhaps I may illustrate with my own marriage. Most of the time there is harmony in our home, with one life and one living. Sometimes, however, my wife lives her life and I live mine. One cause of trouble between us is her concern for my health. I am very fond of American desserts, but she thinks they are bad for my health. Sometimes some older sisters will bring a cake to the house. My wife tries to hide this from me, but on some occasions I can hear the talking when I am working in my study. Later I ask her where the cake is, only to find out that she has already passed it on to our grandchildren! Here you can see there are two lives and two livings.<p>It is a mystery how the Father and Son can have one life and one living. The life is the Father&#8217;s and the living is the Son&#8217;s. The Son&#8217;s living is by the Father&#8217;s life. &#8220;The living Father sent Me, and I live because of the Father....The Son can do nothing from Himself except what He sees the Father doing....I can do nothing from Myself....If anyone wills to do His will, he shall know...whether I speak from Myself. He who speaks from himself seeks his own glory, but He Who seeks the glory of Him Who sent Him, this One is true...(6:63; 5:19, 30; 7:17-18). The speaking and the doing of the Son-that is, His whole living-was the Father&#8217;s. Because He lived the Father&#8217;s life, His living was the living of the Father.<h2 class=head1>THE SHORTCOMING OF THE SPIRITUAL BOOKS</h2><p>What I am sharing with you is the fruit of what I have learned and experienced these many years. As I have said, in the early years we collected many spiritual books on the way to have a holy, victorious life. We read them and attempted to practice what they taught. Actually those books did not help us very much.<p>On the matter of overcoming sin, for example, most writers referred us to Romans 6. You must die, they said, because once you die you are free from sin. When we tried to practice this, however, we could not find the way to die. Eventually we concluded that reckoning was the answer. As A. B. Simpson&#8217;s hymn says,<p class=hbody>There&#8217;s a little word that the Lord has giv&#8217;n<br>For our help in the hour of need:<br>Let us reckon ourselves to be dead to sin,<br>To be dead and dead indeed.</p><p class=hbody2>Let us reckon, reckon, reckon,<br>Let us reckon, rather than feel;<br>Let us be true to the reck&#8217;ning,<br>And He will make it real.</p><p class="hbody">Hymns, #692</p><p>I did a lot of reckoning and discovered that if I did not reckon, sin was somewhat dormant. The more I reckoned, however, the more alive sin became in me. That way did not work, nor did most of the other ways recommended by the Christian writers.<p>Eventually we discovered that the way is Christ (John 14:6). The way to overcome sin is Christ. The way to die is Christ; when you take Him, you die. The way to holiness is Christ. The way to pray is Christ. The way to study the Bible is Christ. The way to love your wife or submit to your husband is Christ. He is the way.<h2 class=head1>JOINED TO THE LORD</h2><p>When we are saved, we are joined to Christ (1 Cor. 6:17). Salvation is not merely to be rescued from hell; it is primarily to be joined to the Lord as one Spirit. We are one with Christ. Consequently, His life becomes our life.<p>Christ today is hidden. He does not live Himself out. No one on the whole earth can see Him directly. Where is He? Christ has two concealments, one in heaven and the other on earth. We are His earthly concealment. When Christ was on earth, the Father was hidden; the Son lived the Father out. Today the principle is the same. The Son is hidden. We are charged to live Him out. The life is the Son&#8217;s, and the living is ours.<p>To realize this is a help when you touch the Word. Give up your concept that Christ wants to teach you and correct you. The central thought in the Bible is that Christ must be your life and you must live Him out as your living. You may ask, &#8220;Don&#8217;t I have my own life?&#8221; Yes, you do, but that life is not the real life. It is a life of form, not of reality; it is a container, not the content. Your life is a container to hold Christ as your life. He wants to be the content of your life. This is the concept you must bring to your reading of the Bible. If you come to the Word for teaching, you are behaving like a disciple of Confucius, not like a believer in Christ! Come to the Bible for more supply of this life. Every morning, when you turn to the Bible, do not look for teachings. This natural concept is in our blood. When we read other books, we are looking for knowledge. Drop this thought when you turn to the Word. You are coming to it for nourishment, not for instruction.<h2 class=head1>LIVE BY ME</h2><p>The daily walk of a Christian is not a matter of morality or ethics. It is the living of this divine life. &#8220;As the living Father sent Me, and I live because of the Father, so he who eats Me shall also live because of Me&#8221; (John 6:57). To live because of Him means that He is your life. He is within you as your life, and He has to be without as your living. Though He is one Person and you are another, He wants you to be one with Him. Human culture, whether western or eastern, has developed a code of ethics to uplift morality. We have all been raised under this influence. Our natural concept when reading the Bible is to find out how we should behave ethically. This concept is a frustration to the proper Christian life. Though the Christian life undoubtedly represents the highest ethics, it is not concerned with ethics. Our morality, humility, love, and kindness are the highest because they are Christ Himself. In our dictionary there is only one word, Christ, and one footnote, the church! It is Christ who is our love or humility or kindness. We live Him. He is our everything. This I say partly from what I have read, but mostly from my experience.<p>Let us come back to the illustration of the cake. When I found out my wife had given away the cake brought for me, years ago I would be annoyed and ready to say some angry words to her. But within I would be checked, &#8220;Who is this who is angry-you or Christ? Those angry words about to come out are yours, not Mine. Remember the message you gave last weekend on not living by yourself? Who is chasing after this cake? Is it Christ or you?&#8221; I would feel so ashamed I would not have the boldness to say the Lord&#8217;s name or to pray. I could not and would not pray. I would just go on strike! After many such experiences, I learned. Now, by His mercy, however many cakes are concealed from me, I can smile and say, &#8220;Praise the Lord!&#8221; Because that is what He says, I say it too. I live Him. He does not want that much American dessert. I am one with Him. He is my life and I am His living.<p>You may sing, &#8220;Amen the Word of God,&#8221; but suppose the Lord says, &#8220;No more cake for you! All the cakes that come are for your grandchildren.&#8221; Will you still say amen? Saying amen is not what matters; He wants you to be one with Him. This is what Paul testified of in Galatians 2:20. It was no longer Paul that was living, but Christ who lived in him. The Lord said in John 14:19-20, &#8220;Because I live, you shall live also. In that day you shall know that I am in My Father, and you in Me, and I in you.&#8221; Christ and we live together, having only one life and one living.<p>You need to come to the Word several times daily in order to receive the supply of Christ. Do not use the Word the way many Christians do when they have a Bible study. Suppose there is a Bible study class every week, and one week the topic is Ephesians 5. The Bible teacher charges the husbands in accordance with the Scriptures to love their wives. Then he charges the wives to submit to their husbands. After the class a quarrel develops between a husband and wife, each accusing the other of not fulfilling the exhortations they heard.<p>Such is the effect of teaching. There is no life supply. The Bible teacher has made the Bible the tree of the knowledge of good and evil instead of the tree of life. We should rather pray when we come to the Word, &#8220;Lord, supply me. I come to Your Word to receive nourishment. I am not interested in knowledge or instruction. I care only for Your supply.&#8221; Do not try by yourself to do the things that are taught in the Bible. I realize this sounds strange, but I know what I am talking about. Come to the Word with a sincere heart and an open spirit, to receive the Lord Himself through the Word as your supply. The best teachings do not come from the black and white pages, but from the real nourishment. The nourishment of life will teach you.<h2 class=head1>NOT TEACHING, BUT TRANSFORMATION</h2><p>This kind of teaching through being nourished transforms you. It seems to be a correction, but actually it is transformation. The Word as the life supply metabolically changes you, carrying away the old and replacing it with the new. This change is organic, not lifeless.<h2 class=head1>PRACTICING</h2><p>To practice living out this life, do not do or say things quickly. If your spouse gives you a hard time, do not be troubled. Be steady. Check with the Lord. &#8220;Lord, You act in me. I would not do anything. I am one with You. You be the One to answer for me.&#8221; Do not be pushed into reacting hastily. If you will practice this secret, you will see how different we are from worldly people. They have only their own life, but we have the life of Christ. This makes us a special people. We are privileged to have Christ as our life. Now He wants us to live Him and to have Him as our living. That is why I said that we should not try in ourselves to keep the word of the Bible. That is the wrong way. Just be one with the Lord. Hold the attitude that you are one with the Lord and that He is your life. This is the secret of how to take the life revealed in the Gospel of John.<h1 class=msg>CHAPTER FORTY</h1><h1 class=msg>TWO PERSONS WITH ONE LIFE AND ONE LIVING</h1><p>It is difficult to explain our Christian life. For many years I have considered what the nature of the Christian life is and how it can be described. Is it a human or a divine life? In our previous message we likened it to marriage. However, in marriage the wife does not have her husband&#8217;s life; thus, this illustration is faulty. The Father and the Son had only one life. The same is true of Christ and the church. What Christ has as life is the life of the church.<p>The ethical relationships described in Ephesians 5 and 6 cannot be worked out in ourselves. We cannot carry out these relationships by our natural life. We may have thought before that we could, but actually it is beyond our ability. Does this mean that whatever the Bible tells us to do is in vain? No, but we cannot fulfill its exhortations in and of ourselves. The love in Ephesians 5, for example, does not come from us. It is from the Lord. Christ has to be our life.<h2 class=head1>SOME WRONG CONCEPTS OF THE CHRISTIAN LIFE</h2><p>Many Christians are still under the natural concept that now that they are Christians they must improve their behavior. This concept of seeking to live the way God&#8217;s children should live must be dropped.<p>The basic revelation in the Bible is that you must take Christ as your life. You are to do this not because you are evil, or weak, or defeated. Christ took the Father&#8217;s life not because His own life was weak but in order to fulfill the Father&#8217;s desire. &#8220;I do not seek My own will, but the will of Him Who sent Me&#8221; (John 5:30). This was His commission. It may sound like Christian teaching to say that you need another life because your own life is inadequate, but actually such a teaching is religious. Even if you have the best life, God does not want it. Even if you can put Satan under your feet, God is not interested. God wants Christ to be lived out by you.<h2 class=head1>THE WAY CHRIST LIVED</h2><p>&#8220;As the living Father sent Me, and I live because of the Father, so he who eats Me shall also live because of Me&#8221; (John 6:57). How many times we have read or recited this verse! Notice that there is no mention of weakness, sin, or better behavior. There is simply the desire of the living Father to live in the Son. Why did this living Father send the Son? It was not to establish an empire but to live Him. To live by the Father was the Father&#8217;s commission. Jesus did not accomplish any impressive work. He merely lived a life to express the Father.<p>&#8220;So he who eats Me&#8221; tells us that the Lord wants to be eaten by us. I did not see this until 1958, some thirty-three years after I was saved. In the spring of 1958 I gave three consecutive conferences in Taipei on the eating of Jesus. The messages were new and fresh. After the first meeting, a brother who was a professor came to me, protesting that to use the words &#8220;eat Jesus&#8221; was too barbarous and uncultured. My reply was that this term was not initiated by me but by Jesus. It was He who said &#8220;he who eats Me.&#8221; I told the brother to drop his cultural mentality and come back to the pure Word. The Lord&#8217;s concern is for our eating of Him, not for the dictates of culture.<p>Your life must be Christ, and Christ must be your life. To try to improve your behavior is of no avail. Live Christ. The Son came not to live Himself, but to live the Father. Jesus came, not primarily to save sinners, but to fulfill the Father&#8217;s commission. It was for this purpose that He went to the cross. If the cross had not been the Father&#8217;s will, Christ would not have accepted it. You remember His prayer in Gethsemane, &#8220;Not as I will, but as You will&#8221; (Matt. 26:39). He came not to seek His own will, but the will of Him who sent Him. That He went to the cross to save sinners was to do the Father&#8217;s will.<p>The Son did not live another life of His own. Though He and the Father were two Persons, They had only one life and one living. The same should be true of us. Though we and the Lord are two, we should not have two lives, nor should we have two livings. The one life that we both have is His, but the living is ours. Our living must be by His life, expressing Him, not ourselves.<h2 class=head1>THE NATURE OF THE CHRISTIAN LIFE</h2><p>What, then, is the Christian life? It is a life involving two persons, but these two persons have only one life and one living. The life is His, and the living is ours. All day long we must be in the reality of this life. This means we must deny our own life. It is our life which must be put aside, that we might live His. The living must be ours, however, because He is concealed, not only in the heavens but also within us.<p>Go to the Lord to pray about this. &#8220;Thank You, Lord, that we two-You in me and I in You-have but one life. Show me this life. Grant me the grace to realize this life and to take this life by putting aside my own life. Thank You also, Lord, that You and I can have just one living, not Yours but mine.&#8221; Keep praying this way day after day till you become clear. Do not esteem human culture and ethics. Do not resp6ct moral, natural concepts. Drop your religious ideas. Pick up the Bible with a purged mentality and read it by prayer and the exercise of your spirit. Then you will become clear about what the Christian life is. You will come to the deep realization that you and Christ do not have two lives but one and that your own life must be set aside.<h2 class=head1>PUTTING ASIDE YOUR OWN LIFE</h2><p>You can put your life aside by putting aside your own will and your own glory. The One sent by the Father told us that He did not seek His own will (John 5:30) nor His own glory (8:50). If you put your will and your glory aside, you will be denying yourself. Your will is within; your glory, without. Every human being is for these two things. Why do you like to live by yourself? It is that you may carry out your will for your glory. From my own experience I have learned that the difficulty in putting aside my life lies in my will. The &#8220;I&#8221; has its center in the will, which is within. Without is personal glory, which includes position, rank, display, and popularity. Not only in worldly society is everyone for his own glory; even in the church we all like to be somebody. I heard of a Christian group which claimed to make somebody out of everybody. In the church, however, you are made a nobody. The church annuls everyone. If you want to be somebody, do not come to the church. The aspiration to be somebody may be called self-exaltation. It is the glory of the natural life. When you put down the will of the natural life and lay aside its glory, the natural life is finished.<p>When the Lord Jesus said that He did not seek His own will nor His own glory, He was declaring that He was simply taking the Father as His life, that He was fulfilling the Father&#8217;s commission by seeking only the Father&#8217;s will and the Father&#8217;s glory.<h2 class=head1>BEING HELPED BY THE WORD</h2><p>If you have this same attitude, of laying aside your will and your glory, you will find you have the best way of coming to the Word. Otherwise, the help you receive from the Word will be fragmentary. Thorough help from the Word will be yours only if you do not seek your own will and your own glory. Seek Christ as your life and live Him out.<p>As long as you are somebody, you are taking yourself as life. Only when you are willing to be nobody will you take the Lord Jesus as your life. On the first day that the Lord began His ministry, He went to John the Baptist to be buried. From that day the man Jesus lived a terminated life. All He had to do was to live the Father. His whole life from that first day was under the cross. He lived a crucified life. If you read the four Gospels again in this light, you will see how new they become.<p>We need to live a crucified life, one in which our will and glory are constantly annulled, making us nobodies. Then Jesus Christ becomes our life, and we live Him. This is the Christian life. It is for this life that we need to come to the Word. The Word does not nourish the natural life. But when you live Christ, the Word nourishes you in His life.<h2 class=head1>CONTENT TO BE NOBODY</h2><p>Some have expressed the opinion that those who are in the church are just &#8220;a bunch of dummies.&#8221; Perhaps it is more accurate to say that we are nobodies. You may have a doctoral degree, but in the church you are nobody. In the secular world you may have status, but in the church you are nobody. If you want to be somebody, the church is the wrong door for you to enter. In the political circle or the educational world you may have rank, but once you step through the door of the church, be prepared to be nobody.<p>Are you willing? For myself, I can testify that I have no desire to be anybody. I am happy to be despised, belittled, criticized, and opposed. What a liberation to be content to be nobody! Here is life and peace.<h2 class=head1>SATISFIED WITH THE HIGHEST COMMISSION</h2><p>The Son of God came with the divine commission to seek the Father&#8217;s will and glory. We Christians are to live the same way. &#8220;Lord, thank You. I have the highest commission, that of living You out. How good it is that You are my life! What a privilege that I can take You and live You out! How I thank You!&#8221; Is not this life higher than having even three PhD&#8217;s?<p>Young people, are you satisfied to be nobody? Rather, are you satisfied with the highest commission, that of taking Christ as your life and living Him? What a commission!<p>This is the Christian life and also the church life. It is no more I but Christ that lives in me. &#8220;Thank You, Lord, that You and I have one life and one living. The life is Yours; the living, mine. Hallelujah that I can have one life and one living with You!&#8221;<h2 class=head1>NOT WORRYING ABOUT NEGATIVE THINGS</h2><p>Do not be concerned about worldliness. Do not be troubled about your weakness. Do not be preoccupied with sins. When Christ is lived out, all these negative things will flee away. The more you try to deal with your sin, or overcome the world, or gain the victory over your weakness, the more you will be troubled by these very things. You are not commissioned to overcome sin, weakness, or the world. Your commission is to live Christ out. When you see this vision and you are such a person, the Bible is for you. It will nourish and supply this life.<h1 class=msg>CHAPTER FORTY-ONE</h1><h1 class=msg>THE REVELATION OF LIFE AND THE WAY TO TAKE CHRIST AS LIFE</h1><p>Even though we know that the Bible is a book of life and that Christ is life, to some extent we are still short of the revelation of life.<h2 class=head1>A SURVEY OF LIFE IN THE BIBLE</h2><p>Why is it that the Bible begins and ends with the tree of life?<p>After creating man, God put him in a garden in which was the tree of life. From this picture it is clear that the man created in God&#8217;s own image did not have the life signified by that tree. We can also see that it was God&#8217;s intention for man to have that life, rather than only his human life.<p>There are several kinds of life mentioned in the Bible. Besides the divine life and the human life, there are also the animal life and the plant life. God&#8217;s life is the highest and the plant life the lowest. Further, within us as human beings there are three kinds of life. The physical life is called bios (Gk.); the psychological life, psuche; and the divine, eternal life, zoe. God created us with the bios life for our body and the psuche life for our soul. When a person dies, it is the bios which ceases; the psuche lives on.<p>God did not put the divine life into man when he was created. Rather, He gave man a free will that he might choose the divine life, symbolized by the tree of life. As we know, man did not so choose.<p>Then the Lord Jesus came. In the Gospel of John He is described as the Word and as God, and then we are told, &#8220;In Him was life&#8221; (1:1, 4). I used to wonder what the tree of life was. I was familiar with lots of different trees, but the tree of life I did not know. In time I came to realize that the tree of life is the Lord Jesus. John 1 mentions life but not the tree. But when you come to John 15 there is the tree. It is a vine tree. A grapevine is not useful in providing lumber for building, nor is it good for burning. It is only good for life. By bringing John 1 and John 15 together, we have the tree of life, the Lord Jesus Himself. He said, &#8220;I am...the life....I came that they may have life and may have it abundantly&#8221; (14:6; 10:10). He also told us that He is the bread of life (6:35) and has the water of life (4:14). The bread of life is good for eating, the water of life for drinking.<p>Christ is also called the Prince of life (Acts 3:15). The word translated prince could also be translated originator or author. However we translate it, it indicates that life pertains to Him.<p>In the Epistles there is the Spirit of life (Rom. 8:2), the word of life (Phil. 2:16), and Christ our life (Col. 3:4).<p>From all these verses we can see that life is a Person, not a condition. Suppose in a meeting people are jumping up and shouting. Would this be an indication that they are full of life? If so, there is more life at a ball game because more shouting and jumping go on there. Jumping is not life, though life may jump. Jumping is a condition; life is a Person, Christ our life.<p>At the end of the Bible the first promise to the overcomers is, &#8220;To him who overcomes, to him I will give to eat of the tree of life, which is in the paradise of God&#8221; (Rev. 2:7). Here the tree of life comes into view again. Then the picture in the last chapter includes the tree of life. In the holy city there is a river flowing out of the throne of God; on either side of the banks of the river is the tree of life. I used to wonder how a tree could grow on two banks, but once I realized this tree is a vine I could see how it would spread to both sides. This tree grows in the water of life. When you get into the water, you get the tree. Thus, the last invitation in the Bible is, &#8220;Let him who is thirsty also come; he who wills, let him take the water of life freely&#8221; (22:17). The one who takes the water of life will surely have the tree of life also, because the tree is included in the water. There is the implication that it grows in the water of life.<h2 class=head1>A LACK OF ADEQUATE REVELATION OF LIFE</h2><p>Though many of us have heard about the matter of life in the Bible, we nonetheless do not see it adequately. Let me illustrate.<p>Suppose I go home and knock at the door for my wife to let me in. When she does not open it fast enough to suit me, I knock again hard. Then the door opens and she says, &#8220;Why do you have to bang on the door?&#8221; I reply, &#8220;What takes you so long to get here and open it?&#8221; Then I go in and sit down to eat the dinner she has prepared for me. While I am eating, I am regretting, thinking how poor I am. I told others to live Christ and to walk in life, yet look how I behaved. The food is sweet, but the feeling is bitter. I must apologize, confess to my wife, and ask for forgiveness. I am reluctant, because after so much teaching of others to walk in life, I do not have the face to admit my shortcoming. Nevertheless, I do make confession and then add, &#8220;I hope from now on I will never behave that way again.&#8221;<p>Do you think my word never to &#8220;behave that way again&#8221; is right or wrong? To express that kind of wish shows that I am short of the revelation of life. It indicates that I am still trying to improve my behavior; that I am not taking Christ as life; and that I do not have the real intention to take Him as my life.<h2 class=head1>GOD&#8217;S CONCERN FOR LIFE, NOT BEHAVIOR</h2><p>We need revelation to see that God is not concerned about how we behave. Whether you hate your wife or love her, whether you are proud or humble, are not what matters. God wants you to take Him as your life.<p>Notice that when God created Adam and placed him in a garden before a tree, He did not command Adam to worship Him, to love his wife and be a good husband, nor to behave nicely and be a good father to the children they would have. If we were God, we would no doubt have given Adam many such exhortations. We would have also added some negative commands, that Adam must not be hateful, nor proud, nor kill his wife, nor smite his children. Our Genesis 2 would have been much longer!<p>God&#8217;s only command to Adam was regarding eating. If Adam ate of the wrong tree, death would be the result; if he ate of the right tree, life-the eternal, divine life-would be his. What we eat becomes part of us. The food we eat is assimilated to become our very being. We are composed of the chickens, cows, and other foods we have eaten! In that garden stood the tree of life, signifying the Prince, Originator, Author of life, Jesus Christ, the very God, as our life. Had Adam taken of that tree, he surely would have taken God into him; God would have been in him. This very thought is in the New Testament, in the Gospel of John, when the Lord Jesus said that He would be in us and we in Him (John 14:20). How is He to be in us? We must receive Him, as is signified by eating and drinking. He is the bread of life. &#8220;He who eats Me shall also live because of Me&#8221; (6:35, 37). He is also the One who has the water of life. &#8220;If anyone thirst, let him come to Me and drink....Out of his innermost being shall flow rivers of living water&#8221; (7:37-38). The Lord Jesus likened our receiving Him to eating and drinking. When we eat and drink, something is taken into us.<h2 class=head1>READING OUR CONCEPTS INTO THE BIBLE</h2><p>When we come to the Bible, however, we miss this concept that God desires to come into us to be our life. Genesis 2 clearly implies this. But we pass over this concept and pay attention to what the Scripture says about love, or submission, or kindness, or humility. In effect, we each have our own version of the Bible. Brother Nee once told us that everyone&#8217;s Bible is according to himself. Though there is only one Bible, in the hands of Christians it becomes many. Our Bible reflects us; it says what we want it to say. If we are slow, when we read the Bible, we overlook the portions that mention being quick. If we are husbands, we overlook the verse about husbands loving their wives and pay attention to, &#8220;Wives, be subject to your own husbands as to the Lord&#8221; (Eph. 5:22). The wives, for their part, slight the verses on submission and notice the verse that says, &#8220;Husbands, love your wives&#8221; (v. 25). Throughout the whole Bible runs the theme of life. But because we do not have this concept in us, we do not notice it. Instead of reading something from the Bible into us, we read into the Bible what is already in us. That is why we find submission, love, humility, and kindness there. That is why we see good behavior and correction in its pages.<p>We need a revelation of life! Then we shall realize that whether we love or hate, it is still from ourselves. In a way, love is worse, because then we expose ourselves; when we hate, we try to hide it. The same is true with humility and pride. It makes no difference whether we are proud or humble. God wants us to live Christ, not humility or pride. I have been crucified with Christ; it is no longer I, but Christ that lives in me. This is God&#8217;s desire and intention.<p>If I see this, I shall speak to my wife differently after I lose my temper with her for not opening the door fast enough. Rather than promise not to behave that poorly again, I shall say, &#8220;Dear, I feel ashamed. I did not live Christ. Pray for me, that I may have the grace, in things great and small, to live Him. Whether I am humble or proud before you, there is no Christ. Pray for me. I do look to Him that I may live Him in every situation.&#8221; This is what God wants. By living Christ the tree of life gets into us.<h2 class=head1>REPENTING FOR OUR GOOD BEHAVIOR</h2><p>In the early days of my Christian life I repented many times for my sins, weaknesses, and failures. Now, however, most of my repentance is for being short of Christ. A number of times after I have been with the brothers and treated them in a courteous, humble way, I have gone to the Lord to repent. &#8220;Lord, forgive me. I was humble, but I was short of You. The brothers appreciated me and thought I was nice, but I did not minister any Christ to them. Forgive me, Lord, that I did not live You.&#8221;<p>Have you ever repented that you are short of Christ? You love others, but there is no Christ. You behave properly, but there is no Christ. You may have repented for not honoring your parents or for other wrongdoing, but you need a higher repentance. You need to repent of your goodness, or of the humility you have practiced, outside of Christ. You may have been born humble. You live out your humility, but you have not lived out Christ; you are short of Him.<p>The church life is not a life of good behavior. The church is the Body of Christ, not the body of love, humility, or patience. Because we are His Body, what we are must be Christ. My physical body expresses only me. The Body of Christ must express only Him. The love in the church must be Christ. The same is true of every other virtue.<p>To see this is to have a revelation of life. This vision will make you hate your love. You will reject your patience. You will condemn your humility. This is not to say that you will be hateful, impatient, and proud. No, it means that you will live only Christ. You will not know love or patience or anything else. You will know only Christ and the church. Once you have seen life, you will hate what is good but not life. Many men love their wives, but it is not Christ who is the love. Our love must be Christ.<p>If you are truly seeking after the Lord, the day will come when you will see that what God desires is not your doing, your behavior, or your virtues, but Christ. Christ is to be your living, your daily walk, your everything.<p>One day, after I had been saved a number of years, Brother Nee asked me, &#8220;What is patience?&#8221; I did not know how to answer. Finally he said, &#8220;Patience is Christ.&#8221; Patience is Christ! It sounded like a foreign language. I knew what patience was, but I did not know how to answer his question. Then when he said that patience is Christ, I could not understand. I was not educated that way.<p>In these years, however, since 1962, I have ministered along this line many times. I have learned that many in the churches do not have this revelation. They may have some knowledge about it, but knowledge does not affect you. As Proverbs 29:18 says, &#8220;Where there is no vision, the people run wild&#8221; (Heb.). A vision controls, but knowledge does not. It is not enough to know that Christ is life. You need to see this as a vision which governs your life.<h2 class=head1>HOW TO TAKE CHRIST AS LIFE</h2><p>When I was young, I heard it said that Christ was the bread of life. At that time I did have Christ within. I remember wondering: if He is the bread of life, how do I eat Him? But nobody told me. Then several years later a renowned traveling preacher came to town and gave a message on John 10:10. I remember the subject well, on how Christ came that we might have life, and might have it more abundantly. But I was left with no impression as to how to take Him as life.<p>Even our physical life is mysterious, not to mention taking Christ as life. Though I am obviously alive and full of life, my life itself cannot be seen or touched. This is even more true of Christ. He is invisible, yet real. He is concrete, yet abstract. He is present with us, yet mysterious. If He is the bread of life, how do we eat Him? If He has the water of life, how do we drink it?<p>We need to realize that Christ is nothing less than God Himself. Do not think that besides Christ there is God. Christ is God. This is beyond our understanding, but do not be bothered by the teaching regarding the Trinity. The Bible clearly says that Christ is God (John 1:1; Rom. 9:5). Christ is also the Spirit (2 Cor. 3:17; 1 Cor. 6:17). Furthermore, He is the Word (John 1:14). For us to take Christ as our life, we must realize that Christ is mysterious, that He is God, that He is the Spirit, and that He is the Word.<p>In the Scriptures we have the terms tree of life, bread of life, water of life, Spirit of life, and word of life. Why are so many terms needed to describe Christ as life? It is to help us understand this abstract, mysterious One. The tree of life indicates the source of life; the bread of life, that this life is edible; the water of life, that it is drinkable; the Spirit of life, that life is just the Spirit of God; and the word of life, where that life is to be found.<p>To find this invisible One who is the Spirit, we have a book called the Bible, the Word of God. The Bible itself is not Christ nor the Spirit, but the word of the Bible is the Spirit and is Christ and is God. We say this because in our experience when we touch the Word, we touch the Spirit, Christ, and God. To find Christ we cannot go to the heavens. If we say He is in our spirit, others will say they cannot get into our spirit to see Him. But we can find Him in the Word. If we are asked where Christ is, we can reply that He is in John 1:1-18! We can tell the inquirer that if he will read these verses over and over and open himself, he will find Christ. Try preaching the gospel in this way.<p>For ourselves we can testify that Christ is not only in John 1, but in every chapter of the Bible. This One in the Word is our food. &#8220;Man shall not live on bread alone, but on every word that proceeds out through the mouth of God&#8221; (Matt. 4:4). Every word that proceeds out of the mouth of God conveys Christ. Christ is the real living Word out of the mouth of God.<h2 class=head1>TAKING IN THE RICH WORD</h2><p>Every morning we need to have two breakfasts. I do not need to exhort you to have your physical breakfast, but I surely would encourage you to set aside time first thing in the morning to have your spiritual breakfast by reading the Word.<p>You may say that you are too busy, that you go to school or to work too early, that you have young children, or that you have to get your husband off to work. These are just excuses. The more you excuse yourself the more excuses you have. For many years I would go into my study in the morning and find on my desk a pile of letters or manuscripts or other things requiring my attention. It was a temptation to take care of the work. Now, however, by His mercy and grace I have learned to ignore the work on my desk and first turn to the Word.<p>Take ten minutes to eat a few verses. Do not eat too much. Do not read the Bible in a haphazard way. Ask the Lord what book you should read. If it is Romans, read it through consecutively, a few verses a day. Do not skip over what does not appeal to you. You may not like the last part of chapter one, but read it anyway. It will preserve and inoculate you. After you have gone through Romans, the Lord may constrain you to read through 1 Corinthians. Before too long you will find there is a difference in your life. Because Christ is in the Word, when you take in the Word, you are taking Him in. This rich nourishment will make you grow.<p>Nothing can compare with the riches in the Bible. I appreciate the Life-study Messages, but not one is as rich as the Bible. The writings of Confucius are good in ethics, but they lack the riches of life found in the Bible. However many times I reread its pages, there is always something new. It is an inexhaustible book. Just one word can help you in a general way, in a negative way, and in a positive way. I have had this book in my hand for over fifty years, and scarcely a day has gone by when I have not read it. I have never gotten tired or bored with it. The more you read it, the better. Nothing will nourish, strengthen, comfort, and edify you like the Bible.<p>Every morning, then, have a good spiritual breakfast. Then at noon take another five to ten minutes to turn to the Word. In the evening spend a little more time to read two or three chapters. You will never regret doing this. It is the way to eat Christ.<h2 class=head1>DRINKING OF THE SPIRIT</h2><p>Besides being the word for you to eat, Christ is also the Spirit for you to drink. To drink, spiritually speaking, is to breathe. To breathe is to pray. By praying you breathe. By breathing you drink. Mingle your reading of the Bible, then, with praying. In your ten minutes in the morning, read your verses, then reread them with prayer. There is no need to compose a prayer. Simply pray the words of the verses. Repeat them as your prayer. Use the text of the Bible as your prayer book! If you are reading in John 1, you can say, &#8220;In the beginning. Thank You, Lord, You were there in the beginning. In the beginning was the Word. Lord, You were the Word and You were in the beginning.&#8221; By pray-reading in this way you will be eating and drinking. To eat without drinking is dry. Our reading needs to be mingled with our praying. After you pray and read, read and pray, you will be full of food and water. You will have taken in Christ Himself.<h2 class=head1>PAYING ATTENTION TO CHRIST</h2><p>It may have been your former practice to seek the Lord&#8217;s will, to find out what is right or wrong, and what you should or should not do. Do not follow that way any longer. Simply keep your whole being turned to Christ. Do not ask, &#8220;Lord, should I stay here or go?&#8221; or &#8220;Lord, what shall I speak?&#8221; Pray rather in a simple way, &#8220;Lord, are You staying here, or are You leaving? Lord, are You going to speak? I am not interested in whether this is right or wrong, whether I should speak or not speak. I only want to know, is this You?&#8221; If your wife offends you, check with the Lord, &#8220;Lord, I&#8217;m annoyed with my wife. Are You mad at her too?&#8221; The Lord will say, &#8220;No, I am not annoyed with her.&#8221; Since the Lord is not annoyed, there is nothing for you to do.<h2 class=head1>DOING EVERYTHING WITH HIM</h2><p>Learn not to do anything without the Lord. Do everything with Him. In God&#8217;s economy it is not a matter of what to do and what not to do. The question is, Who is doing it, you or He? Even when it comes to loving others, your love is not acceptable to God. It must be Christ who loves. Whatever you are doing, keep checking with the Lord, &#8220;Lord, is this You or me?&#8221; Do not be concerned about the world, Satan, your sins, weaknesses, and mistakes. Keep your whole attention centered on Christ. &#8220;Lord, apart from You I would not do anything. I would not even say a word to my wife. I would not hate people; neither would I love them. I would do nothing without You. Apart from You I am jobless; I have no life to live; I am through.&#8221;<p>We have tried other ways. We read and practiced what Christian books advocated as the way to victory or holiness. The books were of little help; the ways did not work well. Eventually we found out that Christ is the only way that really works. When you do everything in Him and with Him, the flesh, sin, and worldliness will flee away.<p>&#8220;Lord, grant me the grace that day by day this matter of doing everything with Christ may not be a mere teaching. I want it to be my moment-by-moment practice. All day long I would not live apart from You. I want to do everything with You and in You.&#8221; If you will practice this daily and hourly, you will find that Christ will be your life practically. Apart from Him we can do nothing (John 15:5), but we can do all things through Him who empowers us (Phil. 4:13, Gk.). This is the Christian life.</body></html>
