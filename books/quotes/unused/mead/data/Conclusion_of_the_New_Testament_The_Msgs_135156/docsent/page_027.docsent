   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>h For Them to Boast in Him</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Christ lives in the believers also that they may boast in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In Philippians 3:3 Paul says, "We are the circumcision, who serve by the Spirit of God and boast in Christ Jesus, and have no confidence in the flesh."</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Those who are the circumcision here are the New Testament believers, the ones genuinely circumcised by Christ's crucifixion.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>They are absolutely different from the Judaizers.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>They serve as priests by the Spirit of God, not by the ordinances of law; they boast in Christ, not in the law; and they have no confidence in the flesh but have their confidence in the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The Judaizers did evil things and even boasted in them, whereas the true believers boast in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>They glory and rejoice in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The word "boast" implies not only boasting but also rejoicing and glorying.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Our boasting, glorying, and rejoicing are not in our outward deeds, not in our behavior or conduct, but in Christ alone.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The Judaizers had confidence in the flesh, whereas the true believers in Christ have no confidence in the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>As a result of our experience and enjoyment of Christ's living in us, we boast in Him. i For Them to Be Found in Him</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Christ lives in the believers for them to "be found in Him" Phil 3:9a .</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Paul's earnest desire was to be found in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>In the past Paul was fully in the Jewish religion under the law and was found by others in the law.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>But at his regeneration he was transferred from the law and his former religion into Christ, and he became "a man in Christ" 2 Cor 12:2 .</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Now he desired to be found in Christ by all who observed him the Jews, the angels, and the demons.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>This indicates that he aspired to have his whole being immersed in Christ and saturated with Christ so that all who observed him could discover him in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>We also should aspire to be found by others in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>To be found in Christ actually means to be observed, seen, or discovered in Christ by others.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Before Paul was transferred into Christ, He lived in the law and under the law.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>He was a person altogether encased by the law, enveloped by it and fully boxed in by it.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>But one day he was transferred out from under the law into Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Henceforth, whenever others observed him, they could tell that he had become a person in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Paul was not in culture, philosophy, or religion.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>He was a person who lived in Christ, and his aspiration and expectation were that he would be found in Christ by others.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>It is one thing to have a doctrinal understanding of being found in Christ; it is quite another thing to be found in Christ in our daily living.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Where we are when others observe us indicates the realm in which we live.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>If we live in our culture or in our good behavior, we shall be found in culture or in our behavior by others.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>In whatever realm we live, that is where we shall be seen, observed, and discovered by others.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>To be found in Christ means that He is our unique expression.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Because Paul could be found in Christ, Christ was his expression.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>In every aspect and from every angle, only Christ could be seen upon him.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Paul's aspiration was that Christ would be his only expression.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>He did not want to be found in his natural virtues or in culture or religion.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Likewise, we should aspire to be found not in our natural virtues but in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>If we would be found in Christ, we need to be watchful moment by moment, continually on the alert to live in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>If we are not alert, we shall immediately be distracted from Christ and live in something other than Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Our living may be very good, but in our experience we are not in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>We should live in Christ and become those who are in Christ in a practical way in our experience.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Then when others see us or observe us, they will find us in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>We shall not be found in our own virtues we shall be found in Christ and in Him alone.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The more we live Christ, the more we shall be found in Him.</S>
