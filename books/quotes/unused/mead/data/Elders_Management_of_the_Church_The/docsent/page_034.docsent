   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Frequently, problems in the church come from the panicking of elders who are unstable in character.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Things may not have been so serious at the beginning, but an unstable character makes things worse and rumors multiply.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>On the other hand, if one is stable and silent, he will see that the rumors will gradually subside.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Even when a brother falls, you must not be anxious.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Do not tell others right away, saying, "Brother So-and-so, who is responsible in a district, has gone to see a movie."</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Perhaps he just went once to see a movie, but you tell others a hundred times.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>This will cause a storm.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>There is no need for you to shout this way.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>You must learn to be stable, and to wait and see.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>When you are stable in this way, you will be led by the Lord to know how to help him.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>All accurate leadings, feelings, and burdens are obtained by those who are stable before God.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>One of the things Satan likes the most is to see us being unstable.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>He likes to stir up a storm.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The more you argue, the happier he is.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The more you panic, the happier he becomes.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The more rumors you spread, the happier he is.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>When one elder finds out that a brother is going to a movie, he hurries to tell another elder.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>This second elder reacts immediately, "Oh, how terrible!</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>This is too bad!"</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The visit to the movie may not have been so bad at the beginning; what really makes it bad is a few elders helping Satan to throw in the stones.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>In the end, there is no more peace.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Therefore, we must learn how to deal with Satan's disturbance here.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>No matter how many stones are thrown into this lake of mine, my lake still remains calm.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>No matter how much trouble you stir up, I am still stable.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>A thousand words cannot move me one bit.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>To be hardened at heart is wrong, and to be stiff-necked is also wrong, but you should learn to be stable.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Without such a character, you have no backbone.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>When the east wind blows, you go to the west.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>When the west wind blows, you fall to the east.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>A person who does not have a backbone cannot manage the church.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>I want to reaffirm to you brothers and sisters that everything can be solved if we are willing to wait a little.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Time is often the salvation sent by God.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Let us consider again the matter of preaching.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>If due to laziness we do not want to preach, that is a great loss.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>However, if due to our cautiousness we wait again and again before we preach, this is a great profit.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>It is one thing to put off preaching because of laziness; it is another thing to wait for the sake of caution.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Even in visitation we cannot be too hasty.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>We must also wait to see if the feeling to visit changes or not.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Experience tells us that if you visit in such a stable way, often you will see that such a visitation comes at the right time and has the Lord's presence within it.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Therefore, we must learn not to panic or to be upset and hasty.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Unless we are very sure of a matter, we must not make quick judgments.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>All this is part of a stable character.</S>
