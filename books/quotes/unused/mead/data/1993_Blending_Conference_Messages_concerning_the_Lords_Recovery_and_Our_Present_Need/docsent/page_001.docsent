   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>This book is composed of messages given in Anaheim, California on May 28-30, 1993.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The opening word and the initial speaking of messages one, three, five, and seven were by Brother Witness Lee.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The rest of the speaking was by 46 brothers throughout Southern California.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>AN OPENING WORD Scripture Reading: Rev 3:1-3, 14-16 OUTLINE We need to be vital for the Lord's recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>We should condemn the condition in Sardis: Having a name of being living, and yet being dead.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Having nothing completed, but having all things dying.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>We should abhor the situation in Laodicea: Being neither cold nor hot but lukewarm.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>To be spewed out of the Lord's mouth.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Hence, we should hate deadness and lukewarmness that we may be vitalized.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Prayer: Lord, we thank You and worship You for this blending conference.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>For such a blending, we need You.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>We need Your Spirit, we need Your mercy, we need Your blessing, and we need Your presence.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Lord, be with us to the uttermost.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Bless us with Your presence.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Visit each one of us and touch us.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Touch our spirit that You may gain us, that we may gain You.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Lord, thank You for this blending.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>We want to learn how to be blended in You, with You, and through You.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Blend us all together that You may have a way to go on for Your recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Cover us with Your prevailing blood.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>We can never forget Your enemy, the subtle one, the evil one, the devil, Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Lord, put him to the corner throughout this conference.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>We look to You for the victory over all the enemies.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Give us the liberty, give us the freedom, and give us the boldness.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Anoint us; this is what we need.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Thank You, Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Amen.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The four banners for this conference are very simple, yet they are all-inclusive.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>I hope that in this blending conference we will all be anointed and deeply impressed with these four banners:</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The all-inclusive Christ is the God-allotted portion to the saints Col 1:12 He is the Firstborn both in creation and in resurrection that He might have the preeminence in all things Col 1:15-18 In Him all the fullness of the Godhead was pleased to dwell bodily Col 1:19; 2:9 In the new man, He as our life is all the members and in all the members Col 3:4, 10-11 I. WE NEED TO BE VITAL FOR THE LORD'S RECOVERY</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Our being blended is for us to be vitalized, to be made living and active.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>In these days our need is to be vitalized, that is, to be made vital for the Lord's recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>II.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>WE SHOULD CONDEMN THE CONDITION IN SARDIS</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>We all need to have some inward realization concerning our present situation.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The first aspect of our condition may be deadness.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>If we are not vital, we will surely drift into this kind of condition and this kind of situation.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>We need to condemn the condition in Sardis: having a name that we are living and yet being dead, and having nothing completed but having all things dying Rev 3:1-3 .</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>III.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>WE SHOULD ABHOR THE SITUATION IN LAODICEA</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The second aspect of our condition may be lukewarmness.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>We also need to abhor the situation in Laodicea: being neither cold nor hot but lukewarm, and being about to be spewed out of the Lord's mouth vv.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>14-16 .</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>IV.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>HENCE, WE SHOULD HATE DEADNESS AND LUKEWARMNESS THAT WE MAY BE VITALIZED</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>We all need to be vitalized by the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>We should hate the deadness characterized by the church in Sardis and the lukewarmness characterized by the church in Laodicea.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>In order to be vitalized, we need to be blended with one another, not only as individuals but also as the churches.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>We need to learn the lesson of how to be enriched, how to be vitalized, to be living and active, by being blended together.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>In this blending conference we are burdened to cover seven messages.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>I will speak in four of these messages; the remainder of the speaking in all seven messages will be done by various brothers selected from among the clusters of churches in Southern California.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>After each message a number of saints from the churches will share to confirm the striking points in the messages.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>W.L.</S>
