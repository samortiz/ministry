Arriving is more than just something of the heart, it involves some action. Arriving is not just unity of the heart, it is unity that involves some movement. Since there is one life, there should be one testimony. Therefore, he felt it was wrong to have two administrations in one locality and that he should take action to arrive into the Body. After dinner one day we talked together, sang hymns, and prayed. Brother Niu was full of praise and full of indebtedness to the Lord. When he returned to the Body of Christ, he touched God's riches which he could not have touched outside the Body.</p><p>Respectfully,<br />Dah-weh<br />March 1951</p><h2 class="head2">Seeking Fellowship (Foochow)</h2><p>With regard to the condition of the church in Foochow, by the Lord's grace, all the meetings are going on as usual. Every month each home meeting has special gospel meetings for several consecutive days. Thank the Lord, the results are better than those in the past. We have had three baptisms over the past three months. The brothers and sisters are divided into twelve home meetings.</p><p>With respect to the ministry of the word, we are going over Basic Truths. We do this because the newly-baptized ones do not seem to be able to keep up in Lessons for Building Up New Believers, but they feel that ordinary gospel messages are too tasteless. Therefore, they need this kind of message, and then we will continue with the edification of the new believers. In the meetings every month the believers are edified, and sinners are saved.</p><p>With regard to the meetings to edify the new believers, we are now meeting in fourteen homes according to the condition of the believers in each area. In these meetings we preach a message first and then divide into small groups for discussion and testimonies.</p><p>The co-workers have gone out to visit all the localities in the northern and eastern parts of Fukien province. The believers in all the localities are really hungry and thirsty; they hope that people could visit them often to help them.</p><p>With regard to unity, recently many people from different denominations have come to fellowship with us. For example, an elderly Congregationalist minister, who is eighty years old and had been a minister for fifty years, saw the way and wants to walk with us. He stood up in a love feast and gave a short testimony, saying that he was very happy. A female preacher from the Episcopalian Church brought several young brothers and sisters to fellowship with us after seeing this way. This sister is now learning to serve among us. Another Congregationalist preacher, who is a seminary graduate, came from the Dongmen Chapel and was received at last week's Saturday fellowship meeting. Other groups and individuals that love the Lord are also seeking fellowship.</p><p>Your brothers,<br />Chen Bi-yin, Chu Mao-xiang, Cheng Zheng-guang,<br />and Yeh Feng-sheng<br />February 16, 1951</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_045.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_047.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Collected Works of Watchman Nee, The (Set 3) Vol. 56: The Open Door & The Present Testimony &nbsp; pg 46</div><br></body></html>
