<H2 CLASS=HEAD2>3. The Contents</H2>

<P>The contents of Song of Songs are the progressive experience of an individual believer's loving fellowship with Christ. To use Hudson Taylor's expression, this is a book of union and communion with Christ.</P>

<H2 CLASS=HEAD2>4. The Sections</H2>

<P>The sections of Song of Songs, which are according to the intrinsic and spiritual significance of this book, are as follows: drawn to pursue Christ for satisfaction (1:2&#151;2:7); called to be delivered from the self through the oneness with the cross (2:8&#151;3:5); called to live in ascension as the new creation in resurrection (3:6&#151;5:1); called more strongly to live within the veil through the cross after resurrection (5:2&#151;6:13); sharing in the work of the Lord (7:1-13); and hoping to be raptured (8:1-14).</P>

<H2 CLASS=HEAD1>I. ATTRACTED TO PURSUE AFTER CHRIST</H2>

<P>Let us now begin to see how the seeker is drawn to pursue Christ for satisfaction (1:2-4a).</P>

<H2 CLASS=HEAD2>A. The Lover's Yearning</H2>

<P>"Let him kiss me with the kisses of his mouth!/For your love is better than wine./Your anointing oils have a pleasant fragrance;/Your name is like ointment poured forth;/Therefore the virgins love you" (vv. 2-3). These verses express the lover's yearning.</P>

<H2 CLASS=HEAD3>1. Yearning to Be Kissed by Christ</H2>

<P>The lover of Christ yearns to be kissed by Christ with the kisses of His mouth (v. 2a). The kisses of the mouth are the most intimate kiss. This yearning to be kissed by Christ is a response to Christ's cheering love, which is better than wine (v. 2b), and to His charming name (person), which is like ointment poured forth with the pleasant fragrance of the anointing oils (v. 3a).</P>

<P>Song of Songs is composed of many figures. The first figure is the wine which cheers people up. The wine here signifies Christ's cheering love. When we are down, if we consider Christ's love, we will be cheered. The second figure is ointment. His charming name, which signifies His person, is like ointment poured forth. No one can resist His cheering love and His charming person.</P>

<H2 CLASS=HEAD3>2. Because of His Cheering Love<br>
and Charming Name,<br>
All the Chaste Believers Loving Him</H2>

<P>Because of His cheering love and charming name, all the chaste believers love Him (v. 3b). We all would condemn a man who attracts many young women to pursue him. But with Christ it is different. The more chaste lovers of Christ there are, the better.</P>
