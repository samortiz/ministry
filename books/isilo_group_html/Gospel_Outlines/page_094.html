<h1 class="title">THE CONDEMNATION<br />
OF THE SELF-RIGHTEOUS AND<br />
THE JUSTIFICATION OF THE SELF-ABASED&mdash;<br />
The Third Contrast in Luke</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture: Luke 18:9-14</h1>
<ol class="upper-romanbd">
<li>Two men praying
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>In terms of action, this passage of the Scripture is not talking about two different people doing two things, such as a good person committing a sin or a bad person not committing a sin. No, the two were praying and were drawing close to God.</li>
	<li>Their actions were the same, but the persons were different, and their positions were also different. One was a Pharisee, and the other a publican, a tax collector. The Pharisee represented a high-ranking person, and the tax collector, a despised person.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>A self-righteous man
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>The self-righteous man was the Pharisee. He was self-righteous not before his audience, but before God. He prayed, &ldquo;God, I thank thee, that I am not as the rest of men, extortioners, unjust, adulterers, or even as this publican. I fast twice in the week; I give tithes of all that I get.&rdquo; In essence, in his prayer he was asking God to thank him. Because of self-righteousness, he was saying, &ldquo;I am not like other people. I am not like my colleague who is sitting in front of me. I am not like my classmate who is sitting beside me. I am not like the professor living next door.&rdquo;</li>
	<li>Nearly all the religious people are self-righteous; so are moral people. The Pharisee represents both of these two groups of people, the religious people and the moral people. He fasted twice a week, and gave tithes. These are religious matters. He was neither an adulterer nor an extortioner. These are moral matters.</li>
	<li>The Pharisees are false religionists and false moralists.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>A humble man
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>Describe the way the tax collector prayed. He stood afar off and dared not lift up his eyes toward heaven but smote his chest saying, &ldquo;God, be Thou merciful to me a sinner.&rdquo;</li>
	<li>Nearly all the immoral, sinful people have a humble feeling.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>The results of self-righteousness and self-abasing
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>The one who humbled himself was justified. Humbling oneself is not a virtue but a confession which affords God a chance to grant His mercy.</li>
	<li>The self-righteous one was condemned, because self-righteousness shuts off God&rsquo;s mercy.</li>
	<li>Christ has accomplished redemption. A man who humbles himself and believes in Christ shall be justified. A man who is self-righteous and unbelieving shall be condemned.</li>
	</ol></li>
