   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>The Flow Vindicating</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>How can we determine how much we have been measured and possessed by the Lord?</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>We can know by how deep the river is.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>If the river is only up to our ankles or up to our knees, it proves we have not been measured fully by the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>How deep the river is depends on how much we have been measured by the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>There is no need for you to argue with me and try to justify yourself.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Simply check the depth of your flow.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Look at your flow within.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Is the flow within you up to the ankle? or up to the knee? or up to the loin? or has it become a river that you cannot pass over?</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The same principle applies to the local churches.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>There is no need to argue concerning your local church.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>You may think that your local church is the best.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>But simply check the flow.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>How deep is the flow?</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>You may say that you have a flow, but how deep is the flow?</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Is the flow in your church only to the ankle? or is it to the knee? or is it to the loin? or has it become a river?</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The flow in your local church depends upon the degree of the Lord's measuring and possessing.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>We may fool one another, but we can never fool the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>He knows the depth of the flow where we are.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The depth of the flow depends on how much we have been measured and taken over by the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>For His measuring, the Lord needs our cooperation.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The Lord can never judge us, measure us, possess us, and take us over without our adequate cooperation.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>We look to the Lord for His mercy that in all the local churches there will be a river that no man can pass over.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>THE FLOW RESTRICTING OUR NATURAL MAN</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The most convenient way to walk is on dry land where there is no water.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>When the flow of the river comes, it is wonderful, but it is not convenient.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>When the water is up to your ankles you can still walk, but it is not very convenient.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>When the water rises up to your knees, it is even more difficult to walk.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>When the water comes up to your loins, it becomes very difficult to walk.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Before you enjoy the grace of the Lord as the flow, you are able to do whatever you like.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>It is very convenient for you to walk.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>When you experience the Lord's flow only in a shallow way, you can still walk by your own effort.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>But as the flow becomes deeper, your walk becomes more difficult.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>You have the grace, and yet the grace is not sufficient.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>You must still exercise your own effort.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>As the flow increases, it bothers, restricts, and frustrates you.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>When the flow of grace rises higher to the loins, it is more difficult to move.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>This is the hardest time to be a Christian.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>You have sufficient grace so that it is not easy to lose your temper, and yet you do not have sufficient grace to overcome your temper.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>This is a real dilemma.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Neither way is easy.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The grace is there, yet it is not deep enough.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Once the water of life becomes so deep that it is a river you cannot pass over, then you will shout, "Hallelujah!"</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Then you will swim in the river.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>When you swim, you give up standing on your own feet.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>To swim means you are not standing on your own two feet; you give up your standing.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>I am afraid that many of you have not given up your standing.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>You are standing on your own two feet.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>You are still struggling on your own standing.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>You are standing on your two feet exercising your own efforts to become an overcomer.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>You need more grace; you need a deeper flow so that you will give up your standing and swim in the river.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>The best way to swim in this river is to put your trust in the water and forget about your own efforts.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Let the water float you.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Hallelujah, this is wonderful!</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>This is sufficient grace, but you must go along with the flow.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>When you are being supported by the river, you should not have your own direction.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>You must forsake your own direction and go in the direction of the flow.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Many times the flow is toward the east, but your intention is toward the west.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Because we human beings are not simple, the Lord always has some problems with us.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>But hallelujah, we do have the flow!</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Hallelujah, we do have the river!</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>THE RIVER CAUSING EVERYTHING TO LIVE</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Where the river flows, everything shall live and be full of life.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>This river is the river of life, and only life can cause things to live.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Mere teaching or gifts cannot impart life.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Ezekiel does not say that everything shall be known or that everything shall speak in tongues or that everything shall exercise gifts, but that everything shall live 47:9 .</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>In this flow the trees live and bear sweet, delicious fruit every month 47:12 .</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Furthermore, the water brings forth an abundance of fish 47:9 .</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>The cattle are included within the names of two cities, Engedi and Eneglaim 47:10 .</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Engedi means the fountain of kids or lambs, and Eneglaim means the fountain of two calves.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>These are the fountains for the young cattle, the kids, and the calves.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Thus, the flow of the river produces trees, fish, and cattle.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>In the proper church life, there should be many trees bearing good fruit as food.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>There should be no lack of fruit.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>All the trees grow by the living water.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>If the church in your place is living, there should be trees bearing fruit.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>When there are trees bearing fruit, it indicates that there is a flow in your church.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>By the flowing of the river there is also fishing 47:10 .</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>Fishing signifies increase in numbers.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>If the number of people in your local church does not increase year after year, it means you have no fishing, and no fishing means there is no flow.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>We need the flow for the fishing.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>We need a place to cast out the net and a place to spread the net.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>We need fishing to have an increase in number.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>In the local churches we also need some fountains of kids and fountains of calves for feeding.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>We must have not only fishing, but also feeding.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>Thus, we need food, we need increase in number, and we also need feeding.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>This will bring in the mingling and the building up of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>Hallelujah!</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>We need Engedi, and we need Eneglaim, the fountains of the kids and the calves.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>All these items depend upon the flow of the river.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>We all need such a flow.</S>
