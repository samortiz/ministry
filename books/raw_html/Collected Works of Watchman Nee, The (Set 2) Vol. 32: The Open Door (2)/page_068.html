<h2 class="head2">A Letter from Brother Witness Lee, Chefoo</h2><p>I left Peking for Tientsin at the beginning of October and spent two weeks conducting meetings at the chapel of the Evangelistic Crusade. Then I had a few days of meetings with the saints in Yao-Hwa Lane on the subject of the cross and life. At the beginning of November, I left Tientsin for Chefoo. In Chefoo I spoke with the brothers and sisters about the kingdom and the matter of testimony, and then I met with the co-workers for a few days. The condition of the saints in Peking was quite good. In particular, the sisters seem to have experienced an inward revival. Two sisters seem to have been called by the Lord. They are both nurses and had discussed the matter of calling with Sister Wang. The time was not yet ripe for them then. But now perhaps the time is ripe. Brother Chao Chi-gwang has been raised up to join the co-workers. This brother studied at the Baptist Seminary in Hwang County. Now he is preaching the gospel around Si-Shiang. Brother Chang Tien-ren is now working for the Lord in Yi County. They all came with Brothers Chang Tze-jieh, Kuo Bu-yueh, and Chao Bi-chen to meet with us in Chefoo. Then Brother Chang Tze-jieh went to Tsingtao. He is still there. Brother Chao Bi-chen went to Tsinan and intends to stay there for some time. Brother Kuo Bu-yueh left for Tientsin and is now in Peking. Presently, four sister co-workers are in Chefoo&mdash;Soong, Ang, Lee, and Wang.</p><p>Concerning the literature work, we have not taken care of The Christian properly during the past few years (the responsibility being mainly with me). But more and more I have the inward feeling that this magazine is necessary. May the Lord bless it and grant that it be published once every two months as scheduled. The Lord has mainly shown me the truth of the kingdom during the last year. In Peking and Chefoo I have turned the attention of the brothers and sisters to the pursuit of the kingdom. I have the intention of making the next few issues of The Christian special issues, concentrating on the gospel of the kingdom. I also feel to write on some simple subjects and something related to prayer.</p><p>Has Brother Nee left for the United States yet? I have not corresponded with him for a long time! I wonder when he will be back. I deeply desire to be taught by him again. I read one piece of news from a Brethren magazine, The Witness, which spoke of Mr. Nee's testimony for the Lord abroad. The listeners had a very good impression of him. Thank the Lord! I intend to prepare some articles for The Christian here. The Lord willing, I will go to Tsingtao, Yi-Du, Gao-Mi, and Tsinan after the Chinese New Year and visit the brothers and sisters there. The Lord's grace be with you.</p><p>Brother Witness Lee, January 17</p><h2 class="head2">A Letter from Watchman Nee, England</h2><p>My work here has witnessed much blessing. I hope that everything bears eternal value before the Lord. More and more I feel the need for the natural man to be bound. When we lose our freedom, we will have the power of life. Do you agree with me? My concern about the co-workers is that not too many know what their natural strength is, much less how to deny it. I sigh for purity for myself and seek to be without any mixture. May the Lord grant us the grace.</p><p>Brother Watchman Nee</p><p>P.S. My concern all these years has been that brothers who have come in after us have not learned the cross; they do not know the corruption of the flesh. They lack the experience of the hollow of Jacob's thigh being touched. They need revelation, and they need to be touched by God so that their flesh will experience an irreparable blow that makes them lame for the rest of their life. When we passed through the Lord's dealings, we did not treasure these dealings. When we see the need in others, we realize how much these dealings are necessary. I intend to leave England for America on February 4. I am still translating Rethinking Our Work [The Normal Christian Church Life]. I will return home from America. If there is the need for me to return earlier, please write, and I will come back earlier. My correspondence address is: c/o Thomas Look & Son, Paris via Siberia.</p>
