   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER FOURTEEN THE LORD S DAY Scripture Reading: Rev 1:10; Psa 118:22-24; Acts 20:7; 1 Cor 16:1-2 I. THE LORD S DAY BEING DIFFERENT</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>FROM THE SABBATH DAY</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>God completed the creation of all things in six days and rested from all His work on the seventh day.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Twenty-five hundred years later, He gave the Ten Commandments Exo 20:1-17 .</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The fourth commandment reminds man to remember the Sabbath.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In other words, it reminds man to remember God s work.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>This remembrance reminds man that God spent six days to restore the earth and then rested on the seventh day.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The seventh day was originally God s day of rest.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Twenty-five hundred years later, God gave the seventh day to man as the Sabbath day and told man to rest on this day.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Everything in the Old Testament is a shadow of the coming good things Heb 10:1 .</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Like all other types in the Old Testament, the Sabbath which God gave man has its spiritual significance.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>God created man on the sixth day and rested on the seventh day.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>As soon as man was created, he did not enter into work but into God s rest.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>God worked six days and then rested one day.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>But when man came, there were not six days followed by one day, but one day followed by six days.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Man rested first and then worked.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>This is the principle of the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The Sabbath is a type of the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Salvation comes first; work comes later.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>First we have life; then we have the walk.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Rest comes before the work and the walk.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>This is the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>God shows us that He has already prepared the rest of redemption.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>After we enter into it, we work.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Thank God, we work because we first have rested.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The significance of the Sabbath is that man stops his work and enters into God s rest.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>For man to enter God s rest means that man does not do his own work but instead accepts God s work.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Therefore, it is a great sin to break the Sabbath.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>If you work when God asks you not to work, you have rejected God s rest.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Breaking the Sabbath is like Moses smiting the rock with the rod.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>God commanded Moses to speak to the rock before their eyes that it may yield its water Num 20:8 .</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>God did not ask him to smite the rock with the rod.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The rock should not have been smitten a second time; it had already been smitten once Exo 17:1-6 .</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The work had already been done, and he should not have tried to do it again.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Doing anything again means to overthrow the accomplished work.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Moses should have obeyed God s word and commanded the rock to yield the water.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Smiting the rock a second time meant that he was denying God s first work.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Moses disobeyed God s command.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>As a result, he could not enter the land of Canaan Num 20:7-12 .</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>To man, breaking the Sabbath does not seem to be a great matter.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>But in God s truth, it is a great matter.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Man should enjoy God s rest first and then work.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>He should receive the gospel first and then have the walk.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Man should only do God s work after he has enjoyed God s rest.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>If he breaks the Sabbath, he is violating the divinely ordained principle.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>This is why the Sabbath occupies such an important place in the Old Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The Old Testament records the story of a person who collected firewood on the Sabbath.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>When this was discovered, the whole congregation took him outside the camp and stoned him to death.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>This person had broken God s Sabbath Num 15:32-36 .</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>A man who does not rest is one who thinks that he can work and act by himself; he thinks that he does not need God s work.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>God, however, is satisfied with His work.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Keeping the Sabbath means that man is also satisfied with God s work.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Keeping the Sabbath means that man rests in God s rest and accepts His work.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>This is why God commanded in the Old Testament that no work be done on the Sabbath.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>This is what the Old Testament shows us.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>However, the situation is different in the New Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>On the Sabbath the Lord Jesus went to the synagogue and read the Scripture Luke 4:16 ; He went to the synagogue and taught people Mark 1:21 .</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>The apostles also went to the synagogue to reason about the Scriptures on the Sabbath Acts 17:1-3; 18:4 .</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>This shows us that there was not only a passive rest on the Sabbath but also an active work on this day.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Originally it was a day of physical rest, but in the New Testament it becomes a day of spiritual pursuit.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>This is an improvement from the Old Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>If we read the Bible carefully, we will see that God s revelation in the Bible is progressive.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>In the message on Reading the Bible in chapter nine, we said that we need to learn the facts when we read the Bible because there is light in the facts.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Once the facts change, it means there is new light.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>This is what happens in the case of the Sabbath.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Initially the Scripture said, God blessed the seventh day Gen 2:3 , but the Scripture calls the day the Lord Jesus resurrected from the dead the first day of the week Matt 28:1 .</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>It does not say that the Lord Jesus resurrected on the seventh day but that He resurrected on the first day of the week.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>All the four Gospels show us that the Lord Jesus resurrected on the first day of the week.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>At least five of Jesus appearances after His resurrection were on the first day of the week John 20:1, 11-19; Matt 28:1-9; Luke 24:1, 13-15, 34, 36 .</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>In Acts the outpouring of the Holy Spirit took place on the day of Pentecost, which was the day following the Sabbath Lev 23:15-16 , the first day of the week.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>The first day of the week is the Lord s Day.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>We will speak more about it later.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Of course, this does not mean that God wants to replace the Sabbath with the Lord s Day.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>But the Bible clearly shows us that God is turning our attention to the first day of the week.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>We mentioned earlier that the Sabbath is a type of the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>The type of the gospel goes away when the reality of the gospel comes.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>The gospel is the principle behind the Sabbath, just as the cross is the principle behind the sacrifice.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>In the Old Testament the sacrificial bull and lamb are types of the Lamb of God the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>The bull and the lamb are not needed now that the Lord Jesus has come.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>Today if a man still brings a bull or a lamb to sacrifice to God, he is ignorant of the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>How can a man offer up a bull or a lamb when the Lord has already become the offering?</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>Likewise, the gospel has already come.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>Man can now rest in God through the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>God has accomplished all His work through His Son s redemption on the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>Therefore, He does not charge us to work first but to rest.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>We should rest in the work of His Son.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>We do not come to God to do any work; we come to Him to rest.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>The gospel ushers us into rest in God.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>We serve only after we rest.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>After the gospel, rest is brought in, and the Sabbath is spontaneously annulled for the believers just as the sacrifice of bulls and lambs was annulled.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>The Sabbath is over for us just as the sacrifice of bulls and lambs is over.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>The Sabbath is a type in the Old Testament; this type has already been fulfilled in the New Testament.</S>
