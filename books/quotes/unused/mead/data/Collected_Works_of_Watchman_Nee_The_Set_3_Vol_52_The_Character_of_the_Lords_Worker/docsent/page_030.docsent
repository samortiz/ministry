   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Ninth, we should pay special attention to another point, which is to "not strive nor cry out."</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The Bible prophesied of the Lord: "He will not strive nor cry out, nor will anyone hear His voice in the streets" Matt 12:19; Isa 42:2 .</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Paul said, "A slave of the Lord ought not to contend" 2 Tim 2:24 .</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>This means that no servant of the Lord can strive or make a loud noise.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Making a loud noise is an expression of rudeness.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The Lord's servant should be under such control that he will "not strive nor cry out."</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>He should not quarrel with anyone.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Loud speaking usually indicates a lack of power, at least the power of self-control.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>No servant of the Lord should be so loud that his neighbor can hear his voice next door.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>No one could hear the Lord's voice in the streets.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>This is the pattern He left for us.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>This means more than a rejection of lies.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Many words are indeed correct and true, but we would rather not strive or cry out.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>"A slave of the Lord ought not to contend."</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>We can keep our mouth shut about many things.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>A brother or a sister has to be extremely loose before he or she can shout at others.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>He or she must have been living an undisciplined life for many years before he or she could shout with little restraint.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>We should restrict ourselves and exercise discipline over our own voice, like the Lord, whose voice was not heard in the streets.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Let us learn to muzzle our mouth from unwarranted noise, shouting, crying, and clamor.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>This does not mean that we should try to act in a sober and quiet way.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>We have to be spontaneous, and when we meet others, we have to speak with them in a proper and natural way.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>But the fact remains that those who have never been disciplined in their speaking will face difficult times in the work.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>We hope that all the workers of the Lord will learn to be finer and more tender and that no one will be rough and uncouth.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Our Lord is very fine and tender.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>He did not strive or cry out, and no one heard His voice in the streets.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>God's servants should give others the impression that they are fine and tender persons before the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Tenth, we need to pay attention to the matter of motive and fact.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>What we say is one thing, but our motive is another thing.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>God's children should not only pay attention to accuracy in words but also to accuracy in the facts.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>We should rather be accurate in facts than accurate in words alone.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Many people only pay attention to accuracy in their words; they do not care about accuracy in the facts.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Actually, even when we are very careful and accurate about the things we say, we may still be in error.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Before the Lord we have to pay attention to accuracy in facts.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>If we do not pay attention to accuracy in facts, we will be of little use to the Lord even if our words are correct.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Some brothers and sisters pay much attention to their words, yet we cannot trust them, because even though we have never found a mistake in their words, we know that they are only concerned about the correctness of their words; they are not concerned about the correctness of their facts.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Suppose you hate a brother in your heart.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>This is a fact.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>As far as the fact is concerned, you hate him.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>But when you see him in the streets, you nod at him and greet him just the same.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>When he visits you, you serve him food, and when he is sick, you visit him.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>When he is in need, you give him money and clothing.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Another brother may come to you and ask you, "How do you feel about this brother?"</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Even though you have no love for him in your heart, you still answer, "Did I not nod at him and greet him?</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Did I not visit him when he was sick?</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Did I not take care of him when he was poor?"</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>It is true that you have the arguments.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The law may be on your side, and your words may all be correct.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>But you are still lying because what you say does not reflect the facts.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Some brothers and sisters pay much attention to procedures.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>You cannot find any fault with their procedures, yet their heart says something absolutely different.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>This is wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>It is wrong to be correct in words but incorrect in facts.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>When we speak to others, we should not just pay attention to correctness in procedure and assume that we are telling the truth; we should instead pay attention to our motive before the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>This has to do with the fundamental issues that lie behind our words.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Do not think that it is enough to use the correct words.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Do not think that it is enough to be nice and cordial to others.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>You cannot say that just because you have these things, you do not hate your brother.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>We have to consider the facts.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>The proof is not in the words you speak.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>We should speak the truth, the things that are actual facts.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>If the facts are wrong, we are still lying even if we use all the right words.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Unfortunately, this is the way many people live.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>In speaking, we should take care not only of the words themselves but should go deeper to our motive and care for the facts.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Eleventh, we should not speak any idle words.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>"For out of the abundance of the heart the mouth speaks....Every idle word which men shall speak, they will render an account concerning it in the day of judgment" Matt 12:34-36 .</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Following this the Lord says, "For by your words you shall be justified, and by your words you shall be condemned" v. 37 . When God's children come together, it is advisable for them to eliminate idle words.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>This does not mean that we should not greet each other or talk about the weather or gardens.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Words of greeting have to do with maintaining human relationships, and it is proper to have them in our conversation.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>But idle words are gossip about this and that family; they have nothing to do with us directly.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>They are unnecessary.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>The Lord Jesus says, "Every idle word which men shall speak, they will render an account concerning it in the day of judgment."</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Idle words will not be spoken once, but twice.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>They are spoken once today, and when the day of judgment comes, they will be spoken once more.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>All idle words will be repeated; a person will have to render an account concerning them in the day of judgment.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>One day we will discover the many idle words that we have spoken, and God will justify us or condemn us based on these words.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>This is why we cannot speak any word in a light way.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>Many jokes, light talks, and jestings have to be ruled out.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>It is of course a different story when some brothers and sisters make a few clever remarks once a while, or when they say a few amusing words to their children and grandchildren.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>Paul refers in his Epistle to the Ephesians to "obscenity and foolish talking or sly, filthy jesting" 5:4 .</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>These are frivolous words, and we should reject them and turn away from them.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>Moreover, there should not be any scoffing among us.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>At the time the Lord was on the cross, men scoffed Him, saying, "Let Him be.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>Let us see if Elijah is coming to take Him down" Mark 15:36 .</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>This is scoffing.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>Those who do not believe in the Lord's second coming scoff and say, "Where is the promise of His coming?</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>For since the fathers fell asleep, all things continue in this way from the beginning of creation" 2 Pet 3:4 .</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>Others may scoff and jest in all kinds of ways, but God's children should not allow these things to come out of their mouth.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>There are many other kinds of unfitting words, such as words spoken behind others' backs or words of criticism.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>As for reviling words, they are sin and should be refused Titus 3:10 ; they definitely should not come out of a Christian's mouth.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>We have to watch out for all these kinds of words and refrain from all of them.</S>
