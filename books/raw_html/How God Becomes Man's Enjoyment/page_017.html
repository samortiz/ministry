        <h2 class="head1">ALL POSITIVE PERSONS, MATTERS, AND THINGS<br />
IN THE BIBLE<br />
SYMBOLIZING OR DENOTING CHRIST</h2>
<p>All positive persons, matters, and things in the Bible either symbolize or denote Christ. We will illustrate this with Genesis 1. Verse 1 says, &ldquo;In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth.&rdquo; We should see Christ in this verse. When God created the heavens and the earth, Christ created the heavens and the earth, for Christ is God (Heb. 1:2).</p>
<p>&ldquo;The earth became waste and emptiness, and darkness was on the surface of the deep, and the Spirit of God was brooding upon the surface of the waters&rdquo; (Gen. 1:2). The first half of this verse does not refer to Christ, because it describes a negative situation. The second half of the verse refers to Christ. The Spirit of God brooding upon the surface of the waters refers to Christ as the Spirit of life coming to produce life.</p>
<p>&ldquo;God said, Let there be light; and there was light&rdquo; (v. 3). God&rsquo;s speaking is equal to Christ&rsquo;s speaking. What God spoke is the Word of God, and Christ is the Word of God. The speaker in this verse is God and Christ, and the words that were spoken are Christ. Light also signifies Christ (Matt. 4:16; John 8:12; 9:5)</p>
<p>&ldquo;God saw that the light was good, and God separated the light from the darkness. And God called the light Day, and the darkness He called Night. And there was evening and there was morning, one day&rdquo; (Gen. 1:4-5). These verses speak of the separation of light from darkness. This refers to Christ separating the things of light from the things of darkness. The day is Christ, but the night is not Christ. Christ is light, and He is the day. Whoever has Christ has light and lives in the day. Whoever does not have Christ is in darkness and gropes in the night.</p>
<p>&ldquo;God said, Let there be an expanse in the midst of the waters, and let it separate the waters from the waters. And God made the expanse and separated the waters which were under the expanse from the waters which were above the expanse, and it was so. And God called the expanse Heaven. And there was evening and there was morning, a second day&rdquo; (vv. 6-8). The expanse in verse 6 is not positive. God saw things as good on every day of creation except for the second day. The expanse refers to the atmosphere, that is, the air that surrounds the earth. The air is not positive, because it is full of fallen angels; hence, the air does not refer to Christ. When Christ came, He separated the waters which were above the expanse from the waters which were under the expanse; that is, He separated the heavenly from the earthly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;God said, Let the waters under the heavens be gathered together into one place, and let the dry land appear; and it was so. And God called the dry land Earth, and the gathering together of the waters He called Seas; and God saw that it was good&rdquo; (vv. 9-10). The earth refers to Christ. A portion of the earth became the land of Canaan, which typifies Christ. The seas do not refer to Christ, for they are the dwelling place of demons and are therefore negative. According to Daniel 7:3 and Revelation 13:1, persons and matters that oppose God come up out of the sea. Therefore, God will eventually remove the sea, and it will be no more (Rev. 21:1).</p>
<p>Seas and the expanse are negative places, but the earth is a positive place. Dry land signifies Christ. Water in these verses represents death, but the earth represents life. The separation of the waters from the earth signifies the separation of death from life. This was a third separation. The first separation was the separation of light from darkness, the second was the separation of that which was above from that which was below, and the third was the separation of the waters from the earth. When the word of Christ reaches man, the Spirit operates within man to separate darkness from light, the earthly from the heavenly, and death from life. Then Christ will become the good land within man, and He will bring forth the riches of life.</p>
<p>The earth emerging from the waters also signifies Christ resurrecting from death to bring forth the riches of life. The earth came out of the waters on the third day, and Christ resurrected on the third day.</p>
<p>&ldquo;God said, Let the earth sprout grass, herbs yielding seed, and fruit trees bearing fruit according to their kind with their seed in them upon the earth; and it was so...And God saw that it was good. And there was evening and there was morning, a third day&rdquo; (Gen. 1:11-13). The earth refers to Christ, so the grass, herbs, and fruit trees that sprouted forth from the earth refer to the various riches of the divine life that issue from Christ. Therefore, we should see Christ in herbs and fruit trees. Christ is the grain of wheat that fell into the ground and died so as to bear much fruit (John 12:24). Christ is typified by the plant life.</p>
<p>&ldquo;God said, Let there be light-bearers in the expanse of heaven to separate the day from the night, and let them be for signs and for seasons and for days and years; and let them be light-bearers in the expanse of heaven to give light on the earth; and it was so. And God made the two great light-bearers, the greater light-bearer to rule the day and the lesser light-bearer to rule the night, and the stars. And God set them in the expanse of heaven to give light on the earth and to rule over the day and over the night and to separate the light from the darkness, and God saw that it was good. And there was evening and there was morning, a fourth day&rdquo; (Gen. 1:14-19). We can see Christ in these verses. The sun denotes Christ. He is the Sun of righteousness and the rising sun (Mal. 4:2; Luke 1:78). The moon reflects the sun and refers to the church, for the church reflects Christ. The stars refer to those who are saved (Dan. 12:3; Rev. 1:20).</p>
<p>The light-bearers are heavenly. They are set in the expanse of heaven to give light to the earth. They are for signs and for seasons, for separating light from darkness, and for ruling over the day and the night. Christ and the church with the saints are heavenly light-bearers in a heavenly position, giving light to the whole earth, being for signs and for seasons, and separating day from night and light from darkness. This means that without Christ, the church, and the believers, everything in the universe is dark and confused. The Gregorian calendar is the Lord&rsquo;s calendar. Even those who oppose God and resist Christ have adopted the Gregorian calendar. Christ is the great light who establishes the days and the years. Only the church and the saints can bring seasons and feasts to the human race.</p>
<p>&ldquo;God said, Let the waters swarm with swarms of living animals, and let birds fly above the earth in the open expanse of heaven&rdquo; (Gen. 1:20). This also refers to Christ. Since water in this verse signifies death, letting the waters swarm with living animals is to bring forth life from death. This certainly refers to Christ&rsquo;s resurrection life. The birds that fly in the expanse refer to Christ in His ascended and transcendent life.</p>
<p>&ldquo;God created the great sea creatures and every living animal that moves, with which the waters swarmed, according to their kind, and every winged bird according to its kind; and God saw that it was good&rdquo; (v. 21). The creatures in the water signify the life of Christ that overcomes death, and the birds signify the life of Christ that transcends the earth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;God blessed them, saying, Be fruitful and multiply, and fill the waters in the seas, and let the birds multiply on the earth. And there was evening and there was morning, a fifth day&rdquo; (vv. 22-23). This refers to the resurrection life of Christ filling man and filling the earth. When we preach the gospel, the divine life is brought forth from death waters. According to God&rsquo;s view, people in the world are dead, but they are brought into life when they receive the gospel, just like the fish that swim in the sea. After they are saved, they are edified and grow in the church, just like birds that fly in the expanse and live in the heavenly realm. At this point, the life that overcomes death becomes the transcendent life.</p>
<p>&ldquo;God said, Let the earth bring forth living animals according to their kind, cattle and creeping things and animals of the earth according to their kind; and it was so. And God made the animals of the earth according to their kind and the cattle according to their kind and everything that creeps on the ground according to its kind, and God saw that it was good&rdquo; (vv. 24-25). Among the four living creatures in Ezekiel 1:10, the ox represents the cattle, and the eagle represents the birds. Creeping things, such as serpents and scorpions, are negative and refer to the devil and those who belong to him. The Lord Jesus gave His disciples &ldquo;authority to tread upon serpents and scorpions&rdquo; (Luke 10:19). To tread upon serpents and scorpions is to tread upon the devil and those who belong to him. None of the four living creatures have the face of a scorpion or a serpent, that is, of a creeping thing, because the creeping things are negative and do not denote Christ. Some animals are positive, and some animals are negative. The lion as the king of the beasts is positive and represents Christ (Rev. 5:5). Therefore, one of the four living creatures has the face of a lion, denoting Christ as the majestic and victorious King.</p>
<p>&ldquo;God said, Let Us make man in Our image, according to Our likeness; and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea and over the birds of heaven and over the cattle and over all the earth and over every creeping thing that creeps upon the earth&rdquo; (Gen. 1:26). Christ is the image of God (Col. 1:15; Heb. 1:3). Hence, for God to make man according to His image was for Him to make man according to Christ. The Maker is Christ, God&rsquo;s image is Christ, and the man who was made signifies Christ. The man who was created was the first Adam, and Christ is last Adam (1 Cor. 15:45). Adam was the first man, and Christ is the second man (v. 47). God wanted man to have dominion over everything that He had created. This is spoken of in Psalm 8:4-8: &ldquo;What is mortal man, that You remember him, / And the son of man, that You visit him? / You have made Him a little lower than angels / And have crowned Him with glory and honor. / For You have caused Him to rule over the works of Your hands; / You have put all things under His feet: / All sheep and oxen, / As well as the beasts of the field, / The birds of heaven and the fish of the sea.&rdquo; Hebrews 2:6-8 applies this word to Christ&rsquo;s becoming a man and receiving all authority in heaven and on earth in order to exercise God&rsquo;s dominion in the universe.</p>
<p>&ldquo;God created man in His own image; in the image of God He created him; male and female He created them&rdquo; (Gen. 1:27). The male life refers to Christ, and the female life refers to the church with the saints.</p>
<p>&ldquo;God blessed them; and God said to them, Be fruitful and multiply, and fill the earth and subdue it, and have dominion over the fish of the sea and over the birds of heaven and over every living thing that moves upon the earth&rdquo; (v. 28). We can see Christ and the church in this verse. Christ and the church will fill the earth and have dominion over the earth. God has not set the angels over the coming inhabited earth, but He has set Christ and those who are of Christ to fill the earth (Heb. 2:5-9; Eph. 1:22-23; Rom. 16:20).</p>
<p>&ldquo;God said, Behold, I have given you every herb that produces seed that is on the surface of all the earth and every tree which has fruit that produces seed; they shall be for you as food&rdquo; (Gen. 1:29). This verse refers to Christ and the riches in Christ. God has given all the riches in Christ to us as our food.</p>
<p>&ldquo;To every animal of the earth and to every bird of heaven and to everything that creeps upon the earth, in which is a living soul, I have given every green herb for food; and it was so. And God saw everything that He had made, and indeed, it was very good. And there was evening and there was morning, the sixth day&rdquo; (vv. 30-31). This verse also refers to Christ. Everything God created in Christ was very good, and everything that was outside Christ was not good.</p>
<p>Genesis 1 shows that the Bible is full of the revelation of Christ and that Christ is the center of the Bible. If we read the Bible with this view, we will see that there are at least two hundred persons, matters, and things that denote Christ.</p>

 	<h2>Noise Words</h2>
 	<p>Common words, such as "and", "is", "but", and "the", also known as noise words, are bypassed in a search. The search string, the Spirit &amp; who, would result in an error since who, which stands by itself, is a noise word. The following is a list of noise words:</p>
	<p>$, a, also, an, and, another, any, are, as, at, be, because, been, being, both, but, by, came, can, did, do, each, for, has, had, he, have, her, here, him, himself, his, how, if, in, into, is, it, like, make, me, might, much, my, of, on, or, our, out, over, said, should, since, some, still, such, take, than, that, the, their, them, then, there, these, they, this, those, to, too, very, was, way, we, well, were, what, where, which, while, who, with, would, you, your</p>

<div id="myModalRanking" class="reveal-modal">
  	<h2>Ranking</h2>
  	<p>Rank is a value from <strong>0</strong> to <strong>1000</strong> indicating how closely a match scored or ranked against the original search string. Rank values are affected by the following factors:</p>
		<ol>
            <li><span>The total number of occurrences of the original search words/phrases in a portion of a book.</span></li>
            <li><span>Content that includes the search words in close proximity to each other are ranked above those that do not. Therefore, a portion of a book that has the search words in close proximity may have a higher ranking than another portion of a book that has a higher hit count but the words are not in close proximity to one another. Therefore, we also include a search word hit count for reference.</span></li>
            <li><span>The rank values are relative to each other. Therefore, it is not possible to interpret the RANK value as a percentage or group the rank values into high/medium/low ranges. Think of rank as a method to order the results for a specific search.</span></li>

<div id="myModalScope" class="reveal-modal">
 	<h2>Search Scope</h2>
 	<h3>Include All Word Forms</h3>
	<p>This option breaks out the search string into its individual words and generates all conjugations and declensions for each word in the search phrase. A search on the word, dwell, would search for dwell, dwelling, dwelling's, dwells, dwelt, and dwelled.</p>
	<p>There is no need to use ^ (inflectional search) or * (prefix search) when using the Include all word forms search scope.</p> 
	<h3>Specified Word Forms</h3>
	<p>This option searches for exact matches of the specified words or phrases used in the search string. Use of ^ (inflectional search) with a particular word in the search string will broaden the search for that given word in that all conjugations and declensions for that word will be searched. Similarly, use of * (prefix search) with a particular word in the search string will broaden the search for that given word in that all words with that prefix will be searched as well.</p> 
	<h3>Note</h3>
	<p>Common words, such as "and", "is", "but", and "the", also known as noise words, are bypassed in a search. A list of all noise words is as follows:</p>
	<p>$, about, after, all, also, an,and, another, any, are, as, at, be, because, been, before, being, between, both, but, by, came, can, come, could, did, do, each, for, from, get, got, has, had, he, have, her, here, him, himself, his, how, if, in, into, is, it, like, make, many, me, might, more, most, much, must, my, never, now, of, on, only, or, other, our, out, over, said, same, see, should, since, some, still, such, take, than, that, the, their, them, then, there, these, they, this, those, through, to, too, under, up, very, was, way, we, well, were, what, where, which, while, who, with, would, you, your</p>
