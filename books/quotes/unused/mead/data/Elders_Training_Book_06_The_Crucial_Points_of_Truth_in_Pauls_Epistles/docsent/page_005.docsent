   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>JUSTIFICATION BY FAITH IN THE ONE</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>WHO GIVES LIFE TO THE DEAD AND</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>CALLS THE THINGS NOT BEING AS BEING</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Romans 4:17 says, As it is written, I have appointed you a father of many nations, before the God whom he believed, who gives life to the dead and calls the things not being as being.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Justification by faith is the crucial point in this chapter, but the crucial element is not justification by faith.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>We are justified by faith in the very God who gives life to the dead and calls the things not being as being.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>It is this kind of faith by which God justifies us.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Usually we understand justification by faith in Jesus Christ, who died for us and who resurrected for us.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>In Romans 4, however, we see justification by faith in the One who gives life to the dead and who calls not being as being.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>When we believe in the Lord Jesus we are justified by the very God who gives life and who calls not being as being.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>When He justifies you, He gives you life and He calls not being as being.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>When the very God justifies you, at that time He makes you a new creation.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>This is to call not being as being.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>At one time nothing was within you as a new creation.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>But when God justified you, at that very moment He called not being as being.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Now within you there is the new creation.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>At the same time He gives you the eternal, divine life.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>If you get into this point with much labor, you will be brought into the central thought of Romans 4.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>In the past we only saw that when we were justified by God He forgave us of all our sins and reconciled us back to Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>As a result, we have no more condemnation but peace toward God.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>We never thought that justification involved the new creation being called into being and the divine life given to us.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>When we go as a gospel team to a campus to preach the gospel, we need to tell others this wonderful truth.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>We may say, Today you can be justified by the One that justifies, the Justifier.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>When He justifies you, He gives you life, and He calls not being as being to make you a new creation.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The presentation of such a wonderful truth would be powerful.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Such a gospel would be the power to convince many professors on the college campuses.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>We all have to learn to labor in such a truth.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>IN ADAM</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The crucial point in chapter five is in Adam.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>In Adam we were born sinners, we were constituted sinners, and we inherited sin and death 5:12 .</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The contrast to being in Adam is to be in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>In Christ we receive righteousness versus sin and life versus death.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>In this life we can reign as kings 5:17 .</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>These are the main aspects of this crucial point.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>IN CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The way we got into Christ was by being baptized into Christ 6:3 .</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>This point must be stressed in the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>We must tell others: Since you have believed, you must be baptized.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>When we baptize you in the water, we are actually baptizing you into Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>You were in Adam and now we are transferring you out of Adam into Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Since you are in Christ, you are identified with Christ in His death and in His resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>In His death you are out of the sinful flesh and out of the power of sin.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>In His resurrection you are in newness of life, so you can live a life that is out of the flesh and out of sin and in His resurrection life with its newness.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>IN THE FLESH</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Romans 7 reveals the bondage in the flesh under the law by the indwelling sin unto death and wretchedness.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>In the flesh you are sinful because in the flesh you have been sold under sin 7:14 .</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>In the flesh sin is your master, sin is your director, sin is your boss.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Because you are in the flesh there is no way to get out of sin.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>This sin masters you, governs you, enslaves you, and eventually kills you 7:11, 17, 20 .</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Your weakness is fully exposed in the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>You become a wretched man and this issues in death 7:24 .</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>IN THE SPIRIT</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>In Romans 8 is the freedom in the Spirit without law by the indwelling Christ unto life and peace.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>In the Spirit you are set free from sin and death.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>In the Spirit you enjoy life because you have the law of the Spirit of life 8:2 .</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>This divine life can be enjoyed in all three parts of our being.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>First, this life is in our spirit 8:10 .</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Then we enjoy this life in our mind 8:6 .</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Finally, we can enjoy this life in our mortal body 8:11 .</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>If we walk according to the spirit, the righteous requirements of the law will be fulfilled 8:4 and we will be led as the sons of God 8:14 .</S>
