<h1 class="msg">CHAPTER FOUR</h1>
<h1 class="title">EXERCISING THE SPIRIT<br />
IN READING THE WORD AND PRAYING</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Acts 1:14; 2:41-42; 6:4; Rom. 12:12; 1 Thes. 5:16-17</h1>
<p>According to Acts 2:41-42, the first group of believers continued steadfastly in four things: the teaching and the fellowship of the apostles, breaking of bread, and prayers. Other verses in Acts that speak of continuing steadfastly in prayer include 1:14 and 6:4. Furthermore, Romans 12:12 says, &ldquo;Persevere in prayer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>First Thessalonians 5:16-20 says, &ldquo;Always rejoice, unceasingly pray, in everything give thanks; for this is the will of God in Christ Jesus for you. Do not quench the Spirit; do not despise prophecies.&rdquo; This portion unveils the meaning of quenching the Spirit. When we pray unceasingly and give thanks in everything, we do not quench the Spirit. When we do not pray or give thanks, we quench the Spirit.</p>
<h2 class="head1">KNOWING THE LORD THROUGH THE WORD<br />
AND TOUCHING THE LORD THROUGH THE SPIRIT</h2>
<p>God is in the Son, the Lord Jesus, so that His children may enjoy Him. We can know, touch, and enjoy the Lord Jesus through the Word and the Spirit. The Word is for us to understand and know Him, and the Spirit is for us to contact and touch Him. God has given us the holy Word and the Holy Spirit. We have the Bible, the Word of God, in our hand, and the Holy Spirit within us. We can read the Bible anytime and anywhere. This is the way for us to understand and know more about the Lord Jesus. This is the function of the Word. The Word conveys, manifests, and reveals the Lord Jesus to us.</p>
<p>If we did not have the Bible and if we did not have the ministry of the word, there would be no way for us to know our glorious and rich Lord. However, we have not only the Bible, the Word of God, but also the ministry of the word. We can read the Bible at any time and in any place, and we can also listen to the Lord&rsquo;s word. Hence, we are able to know and understand more concerning the Lord.</p>
<p>It is one thing to know and understand something, but it is another matter to experience something. Suppose you are invited to a feast with many delicious dishes, and someone explains how each dish was prepared, what ingredients were used, and their nutritional value. This will give you an understanding of the meal. But it is not sufficient to understand. You still need to eat. It does not matter whether you use a fork or a pair of chopsticks, you must eat the food on the table. Understanding is one thing, but eating, enjoying, is another.</p>
<p>In the Bible the Lord&rsquo;s supply is likened to food. He is the bread of life and the living water. We should not think that it is enough for us to know, understand, and apprehend the Lord as the bread of life and the living water. We must also eat and drink Him. A newborn babe does not know anything, but he drinks milk. Although he does not understand its nutritional value, he drinks milk. Hence, although understanding is helpful, our ultimate goal is to receive the supply.</p>
<p>Our seeking of the Lord is by the Word. The more we know and understand the Word, the more we can gain the Lord. When we were newborn babes, we knew nothing except to drink milk. The more we grew, the more we learned. Now that we are adults, we know what we should eat and what we should avoid. This kind of knowledge helps us to enjoy our food. This same principle applies to our enjoyment of Christ. Therefore, we need both to understand and to enjoy Christ. Understanding and enjoying complement each other, and both are indispensable.</p>
<h2 class="head1">ENJOYING THE LORD<br />
BY READING THE WORD AND BY PRAYER</h2>
<p>Let us consider how to eat and drink the Lord, that is, how to receive and gain Him. Eating the Lord is simpler than eating food; there is no need of chopsticks or of forks and knives. When we read the Bible, we can pray over any verse. When we pray, we exercise our spirit. We use our mind to understand and apprehend, and we use our spirit to pray. We cannot say that our spirit is always the source of our prayer, but as long as we would pray, our spirit will be stirred up. For example, a child does not know how to use his feet when he begins to walk. He simply tries to walk and then learns how to use his feet, because walking requires that he use his feet. Likewise, praying requires the exercise of our spirit. We do not need to analyze whether we are using our mind or our spirit to pray. As long as we are willing to pray, our spirit will come forth. Perhaps the first sentence comes from our mind, but if we continue to pray, spiritual utterances from our spirit will come forth. We may not know whether we are exercising our spirit, but eventually, our spirit is stirred up.</p>
<p>Here is an illustration. In Matthew 8:24 through 27 the Lord Jesus and His disciples crossed the sea. While they were crossing the sea, there arose a great tempest, but the Lord was sleeping in the boat. The disciples were frightened and cried out, &ldquo;Lord, save us; we are perishing!&rdquo; The Lord rebuked them, saying, &ldquo;Why are you cowardly, you of little faith?&rdquo; Then He arose and rebuked the winds and the sea, and there was a great calm. This is a simple portion of the Bible, but if we are seeking the Lord, the Spirit will touch us. We will see that when He was on earth, the Lord Jesus was a man whose outward appearance and actions were not different from those of other people, yet He was very different. He did not fear a dangerous situation but was able to sleep peacefully during a tempest. The disciples were all worried, but the Lord was sleeping. When we read this portion, we might say, &ldquo;Lord, You are wonderful. Everyone was scared, but You were sleeping peacefully.&rdquo; Then we should turn this thought into prayer. The more we pray, the more we will be inspired, and the more we are inspired, the more we will pray. As a result, we will be filled with the Lord.</p>
<p>If we read a portion of the Word and pray in the morning, we will have a good morning watch. In our morning watch we should read the Lord&rsquo;s Word in a simple way with a seeking heart in order to receive inspiration. We should then pray in a simple manner according to our inspiration. After praying, we should read the Word again in order to receive further inspiration, which we should again turn into prayer. We might spend only eight to ten minutes to read the Word and pray in this way, but we will surely be filled with the Spirit; we will be full of Christ. Not only so, we will have Christ&rsquo;s presence and power the rest of the day. When we encounter problems, Christ will encourage us; when we encounter temptations, He will resist them for us. When we touch the Word, we also touch the Spirit. This is the way to eat, drink, and enjoy the Lord in the Word and as the Spirit.</p>
<p>Many educated people do not like to read the Gospels. Once a college professor said that the four Gospels are not up to the standard of religious classics, because they are a record of unrelated matters, such as a hemorrhaging woman touching the fringe of the Lord&rsquo;s garment (Matt. 9:20-22; Mark 5:25-34; Luke 8:43-48), the blind asking for healing (Matt. 20:29-34; Mark 10:46-52; Luke 18:35-43), and little children being brought to the Lord Jesus for blessing (Matt. 19:13-15; Mark 10:13-16; Luke 18:15-17). These seem to be children&rsquo;s stories. How can they be considered as the Word of God? On the contrary, the four Gospels are certainly not simple. Rather, the simple words and understandable examples portray our glorious and rich Christ as the embodiment of God. We should practice to pray over the inspiration that we receive when we read the Bible. The more we pray, the deeper He will touch us, and we will gain more of His element. Eventually, we will be filled with Christ.</p>
<p>A well-trained physician told me that he had read many famous writings but that he still felt empty within. I recommended that he read the Gospel of John, because it is a book on life and is above other writings. After a period of time, he came to me and said, &ldquo;Mr. Lee, I have finished reading the Gospel of John, which you had recommended. It is altogether meaningless. The entire book consists of stories about people, which mean nothing.&rdquo; Therefore, I read a few verses from the Gospel of John with him. &ldquo;In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God&rdquo; (1:1); &ldquo;I am the light of the world; he who follows Me shall by no means walk in darkness, but shall have the light of life&rdquo; (8:12); &ldquo;God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son, that everyone who believes into Him would not perish, but would have eternal life&rdquo; (3:16); and &ldquo;in that day you will know that I am in My Father, and you in Me, and I in you&rdquo; (14:20). After reading these verses, I said, &ldquo;Do you think these words are meaningful or not?&rdquo; He replied, &ldquo;They sound quite mysterious,&rdquo; and I said, &ldquo;Exactly so. The Gospel of John is not a simple book. The words seem easy, simple, and common, but they contain the speaking of a tremendously great God and a tremendously glorious Christ. If you would seek Him with a humble heart and read His Word, you will discover that it is very mysterious. Not only so, if you are willing to pray according to what you sense while you read, you will touch Christ and be filled with Him. You will also be full of joy and peace.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Many saints not only understand what I am saying but have also experienced this. When we turn what we read in the Word into prayer, we will be joyful, peaceful, satisfied, and strengthened. We will mount up with wings like eagles. This is how to touch the Word and the Spirit. This is also what we refer to as reading and praying.</p>
