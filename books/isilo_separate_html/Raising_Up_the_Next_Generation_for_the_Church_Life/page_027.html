<p>We are regenerated of God the Spirit to be spirits&mdash;gods (John 3:6b) belonging to the species of God to see and enter into the kingdom of God (vv. 3, 5). John 1 tells us how we received the authority to be the children of God. Then John 3 speaks of regeneration again. Verse 6 says, &ldquo;That which is born of the flesh is flesh, and that which is born of the Spirit is spirit.&rdquo; We are the flesh and born of the flesh in our natural life. But we were born of God the Spirit to be spirits, gods. That which is born of a cow is a cow. That which is born of a horse is a horse. We are born of the Spirit, and the Spirit is God. John 4:24 tells us clearly that God is Spirit. Because we are born of God the Spirit, we must be gods in life and in nature but not in the Godhead. If we do not believe that we who are born of God are gods, then what are we? That which is born of the Spirit is spirit.</p>
<p>Our second birth caused us to enter into the kingdom of God to become the species of God. The animals and plants have their particular species. We are born of God, so we are gods belonging to the species of God. We should always remember that we are God-men belonging to the species of God. A God-man does not quarrel with others. This is an intrinsic-study of the Word of God.</p>
<p>Regeneration is the first step of Christ&rsquo;s organic salvation. The washing of regeneration purges away all the things of the old nature of our old man (Titus 3:5). This washing is an organic saving. Without regeneration&rsquo;s washing, there would be layers of the old creation in our being. Perhaps some would feel that they are not of the species of God, but of the &ldquo;species&rdquo; of the Americans. This species should be washed away. We need to see that regeneration as the first step of Christ&rsquo;s organic saving is to wash away the layers of the old creation of our old nature.</p>
<p>We must not forget that we are God-men belonging to God&rsquo;s species. As God-men born of God and belonging to God&rsquo;s species, we cannot speak to our spouse in a loose way. A husband must be a God-man, living as a God-man. To be merely a good man is far away from God&rsquo;s good pleasure. We need to see that we are God-men, born of God and belonging to God&rsquo;s species. This is the beginning of the God-man living.</p>
<p>God loves you. God has a good pleasure to make you the same as He is. He is God, so you must be God also. A God-man living is God living. This kind of teaching is much higher than the teaching concerning how to be holy or victorious. In my early days as a believer, I saw many books on how to live the Christian life, but these books did not really reveal the way. How can you be holy? You can be holy by living a God-man life. How can you be victorious? It is only by living a God-man life. Never forget that you are a God-man, born of God and belonging to God&rsquo;s species. (<em>The God-man Living,</em> pp. 8-9)</p>
<h2 class="head1">REVOLUTIONIZED BY REALIZING<br />
THAT WE ARE GOD-MEN</h2>
<p>When we think of ourselves as God-men, this thinking, this realization, revolutionizes us in our daily experience. For example, a brother may be unhappy with his wife. But he remembers that he is a God-man, and immediately his attitude is changed. Then he will desire to be a God-man husband.</p>
<p>We need to understand that to be a part of mankind is to be something negative. In God&rsquo;s view <em>mankind</em> is a negative term referring to fallen man. As believers in Christ and children of God, we are not mankind&mdash;we are God-man kind. To realize this is to be changed, even revolutionized. When we realize that we are God-men, we will say, &ldquo;Lord, You are the first God-man, and we are the many God-men following You. You lived a human life, not by Your human life but by God&rsquo;s divine life to express Him. His attributes became Your virtues. You were here on this earth dying every day. You were crucified to live. Lord, You are my life today and You are my person. You are just me. I therefore must die. I need to be conformed to Your death. I have to be crucified to die every day to live a God-man&rsquo;s life, a human life yet not by my human life but by the divine life, with Your life and Your nature as my constitution to express You in Your divine attributes, which become my human virtues.&rdquo; This makes us not just a Christian or a believer in Christ but a God-man, one kind with God. This is the highest point of God&rsquo;s gospel. (<em>Life-study of 1 &amp; 2 Chronicles,</em> pp. 27-28)</p>
<h2 class="head1">REVOLUTIONIZED BY REALIZING WHO WE ARE</h2>
<p>Since the ministry began in the United States in 1962, I have actually ministered only one matter&mdash;God becoming a man that man may become God in life and in nature. However, it was not until February 1994 that I received such a clear view with a heavy burden to tell God&rsquo;s people that we all are God in life and in nature but not in the Godhead.</p>
<p>To know who we are and to realize who we are revolutionizes us. Suppose a certain brother who has been living like a scorpion realizes that, as a child of God, he is God in life and in nature. Immediately this brother will be radically changed. The atmosphere and everything related to him will also be changed. If all of today&rsquo;s Christians realized that they were God in life and in nature, the whole world would be different.</p>
<p>During the past ten months, I have often checked with myself: &ldquo;Is a God-man like this? You have spoken that the believers have become God in life and in nature, yet what are you now? Are you God or are you something else?&rdquo; My answer has been to repent and ask for the Lord&rsquo;s forgiveness because at least some of the things I did were not in Him or according to Him. This realization has revolutionized me.
