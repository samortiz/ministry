The spirit within us is released only to the extent that our outer man, that is, our mind, emotion, and will, is broken. Only then can we exercise our spirit. We have to learn a basic lesson from God&mdash;allowing Him to break our outer man. The Bible divides man into two parts, the outer man and the inner man. We have one more person than an unbeliever; we have an inner man. At the time of our regeneration, God begot this man within us. Today our inner man is surrounded by our outer man. When others touch us, they may touch our outer man or they may touch our inner man. There is a clear difference between shaking hands and shaking gloves. When some come to us, we touch their spirit, their inner man. When others come to us, we only touch their mind, emotion, and will, their outer man. Their spirit is altogether concealed by their strong mind, emotion, and will. This is like shaking hands with a person wearing gloves. We can only touch the gloves; we cannot touch the hands. An unsaved person does not have this distinction between the outer man and the inner man. The outer man and the inner man are not side by side. Rather, the inner man is wrapped within the outer man; one man is within the other.</p><p>Today man's need is the release of our inner man, that is, the release of our spirit. This is the only way men will receive supply from us. How then can the inner man be released? How can we separate the outer man from the inner man? How can the inner man not be "gloved-in" by the outer man? The Gospel of John says that except a grain of wheat falls into the ground and dies, it abides alone. But if it dies, it bears much fruit (12:24). If those who follow the Lord would lose their soul-life, they would gain life. If our soul-life dies, we will minister life to others. Expressing life means the breaking of the outer shell and the release of the inner life. Today many people are living, but they are not enlivening. In other words, they cannot reproduce; they cannot impart life to others. Only those whose outer man is broken are able to release their inner man. We should not think that we can learn some teachings from Foochow and then go home to carry on a work for the Lord. That would be too cheap! If our outer man is not broken and there is not a free channel through it, our spirit will not be released, and we will never touch others' spirit. We also will not have a proper knowledge of men. Those whom we think are good are not necessarily good, and those whom we think are bad are not necessarily bad. If our outer man is not broken, we are like an insulator. When a wire is insulated with rubber, no electricity passes through, and light is not produced. No matter how hard we touch the outer man, we can never strike inward reality. This is like shaking a gloved hand; only the glove is touched. Those who are tried before the Lord and whose outer man is broken will be able to release their inner life; they will bear much fruit.</p><p>The breaking of the outer man involves the operation of the cross. But in what area does the cross apply its breaking? It is applied invariably to the strongest area of our life. Whatever the strongest area of our life is, that is the area where the cross operates. When a man hits the wall, his nose gets hurt first because his nose is the outstanding part of his body. It is hard to hide whatever stands out in a man. Once this strong area is broken and removed, it will be easy for one to touch the spirit. Brother T. Austin-Sparks is robust in his mind, calm in his emotion, and strong in his will. He is strong and steady. But when you touch him, you do not touch his mind, emotion, or will, but his spirit. Miss M. E. Barber was astute and quick, but one did not feel her astuteness or her natural quickness. These traits were broken in her. When we say that the outer man has to be broken, we do not mean that the outer shell has to be removed altogether. We merely mean that the outer shell has to crack, and there have to be gaps and openings. If the Lord does not secure gaps and openings in us, we will have no way to go on. It is impossible to put up a spiritual performance. What we need is genuine breaking.</p><p>Second Corinthians 4 speaks of the treasure in the earthen vessel. The earthen vessel does not need more paint or ornamentation; it only needs breaking. This is the only way for the treasure within to be made manifest. We do not have to act calm, godly, or gentle before God. All we have to do is to allow the inner man to come out. We only need to allow God's life to flow out. We may be very talkative, quick, or jovial. There is nothing wrong about this. But if our outer man is not broken, it will not do us any good even if we shut our mouth, remove our smile, and remain silent. Today it is not a matter of whether or not the glove is good, but whether it is torn. Many people have been Christians for years. Yet they do not yield to God's discipline, and God cannot get through with them. The Lord is doing one thing on earth today&mdash;He is buffeting our outer man daily. Many people are always dissatisfied with the fellowship and coordination they have with the brothers and sisters in the church. They criticize and complain that this is wrong and that is off. They think that they are the only ones who are right and that everyone else is wrong. They protect their outward shell. It is amazing that after the Lord has buffeted them daily through their environment, they still cannot get through. The more buffeting some people experience, the more they murmur. They maintain intact all the time. Such ones are altogether useless. If we are taking our own way all the time, how can we expect God to use us to become a blessing to others? Some people become rebellious as soon as they are put under some authority or are wounded a little. How can such ones become a supply to others?</p><p>In the Bible, Job was an example of endurance. But it was Jacob, who was greatly chastised, who received the greatest mercy. The more authority there is in the church, the more chastisement God's children will receive. Most of us are better than Jacob at birth, but none of us can match Jacob's end. He did not have a good start, but he did have a good ending. He had the worst possible beginning. He held on to his brother's heel in his mother's womb. From the time he was born, he struggled. But he became crystal clear towards the end of his life. Among all the men in the Old Testament, Jacob had the best death. Isaac lived in peace for the first half of his life, but he was a blind and deceived man when he was on his deathbed. Jacob's pathway, however, became brighter and brighter as he moved towards the end. Ultimately, he did not speak of his own wisdom but only of God's mercy. He received the most mercy, because he received more chastisement from God's hand than others.</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_004.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_006.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Collected Works of Watchman Nee, The (Set 3) Vol. 59: Miscellaneous Records of the Kuling Training (1) &nbsp; pg 5</div><br></body></html>
