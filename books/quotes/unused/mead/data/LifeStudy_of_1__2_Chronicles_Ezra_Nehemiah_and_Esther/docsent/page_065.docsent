   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE ESCHATOLOGY OF THE CHURCH</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>ACCORDING TO THE DIVINE REVELATION</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>OF THE SCRIPTURES Scripture Reading: Rev 17:1-6, 16; 14:8; Matt 13:37-42; 1 Cor 3:9b-15; Rev 21:1-11, 18-21</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>We need to see that there is not only an eschatology of the world, the study of the end of the world situation, but also an eschatology of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Our study of this crucial matter is according to the divine revelation of the Scriptures.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>We believers in Christ are not only in the world but also in the church.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The genuine church exists within Christianity.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Christianity has become very great and includes mainly the Catholic Church and the Protestant church.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The Catholic Church and the Protestant church were not there at the time of the apostle Paul.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>What was there at his time was the original and recovered church.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The recovered church refers to the original church.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>These two are one.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Paul rebuked the Corinthian believers in his first Epistle to them by telling them that they were trying to divide Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>There were various parties in Corinth who were saying, I am of Paul, I am of Apollos, and I am of Cephas.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The self-supposed spiritual ones said, I am of Christ 1:12-13a .</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Thus, there were four divisions in Corinth.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The church in Corinth was an original church, but it had degraded; it had lost something.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>At that juncture Paul wrote them.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>His Epistles to them were recovery books; they recovered the church in Corinth.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>By reading Paul s second Epistle to Timothy, we can also see that at Paul s time the church had degraded.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Some had left the Christian faith.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Others, like Alexander the coppersmith, opposed Paul to the uttermost 4:14 .</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>But Paul himself declared that he had kept the faith v. 7 . Second Timothy is a book of recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The original church existed only for about half a century.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The apostles established the original church within less than fifty years.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>But while Peter, John, and Paul were still living, the church fell from its original state to a degraded state, a deformed state, and even a transmuted state.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>This is why the Epistles were written.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>All the second letters of Peter, John, and Paul e.g., 2 Peter, 2 and 3 John, 2 Corinthians, etc. were letters of recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>All these letters were for recovering the lost church.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>At John s time, some even said that Christ never came in the flesh 1 John 4:2-3; 2 John 7 .</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Others said that Christ was not the Son of God but eventually became the Son of God 1 John 2:22-23 .</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The church had become deformed, changed in form, and transmuted, changed in nature.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Thus, John wrote to the believers to recover them.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>At the time of the apostles we can see the original and recovered church.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The recovered church came into being just a little later than the original church.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The original church lasted only for a short time.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>It was born into a sick situation, an unhealthy environment.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>When the apostle Paul was sent by the Holy Spirit from Antioch to Asia to preach the gospel and to set up churches, the opposing Jews came to frustrate him.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>After the churches were established, the Gnostics came in to make trouble.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Thus, the church became sick either from Judaism or Gnosticism.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The original church did not last too long, but God would not let the church be lost without any kind of recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>This is why the Lord as the Head of the Body charged the apostles Peter, John, and Paul to write their later Epistles to recover the church.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>We have to realize that the Lord s recovery began at the end of the first century.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>In every century afterward, the Lord raised up a number of Ezras and Nehemiahs to recover, to reconstitute, the church.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>In the first five centuries, there was only the original and recovered church.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Then near the end of the sixth century the Catholic Church came into existence.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>At that time the pope was recognized as the authority of the Catholic Church.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The Protestant church came into existence at the time of Martin Luther during the Reformation in the sixteenth century.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Today there are still these three kinds of churches.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>The church of the recovery is always taking a narrow way.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>All of those who participate in the recovered church learn the special lessons in the Christian life.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>They learn to know Christ, to know themselves, and to know the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>They learn how to be crucified to live the God-man life.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>All the members of the church should be God-men because the church is formed with the deified man.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>The high truth of God becoming a man that man might become God in life and nature but not in the Godhead was discovered by the church fathers in the second century.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>This was something of the Lord s recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>With us the Lord s recovery began in mainland China seventy-two years ago.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Today there are mainly three kinds of churches on earth: the Catholic Church, the Protestant church, and the original and recovered church.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>We must choose the original and recovered church because it is genuine.</S>
