   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE SPIRIT BEING THE REALITY AND SINCERITY OF OUR BEING</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The spirit is the innermost part of our whole being.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>It is the very center, the very reality, of the human being.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>We often speak of the sincerity of the heart, but the real sincerity is not in the heart.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The spirit is even deeper than the heart, so the real sincerity is in the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>When we contact others with our emotions or mind, we are not sincere with them.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Because we feel happy with others, we may treat them well; this is to contact them with our emotions, which is not sincere.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Sometimes we may contact others with our mind or reasonings, but this also is not sincere.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>We contact others in sincerity when we contact them in the spirit, because this is a contact from the innermost part of our whole being.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The best time to realize that a person is contacting someone from his spirit is when he loses his temper.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>For someone to lose his temper is the most sincere contact, because it is easy to release the spirit when we lose our temper.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>If we can control ourselves, we can always pretend and say, "O brother, I love you."</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>This is a pretense.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>It is a love in word, or at most in our understanding or our emotion.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>But when one day we lose our temper, whatever is truly within us is released.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>It is difficult for people to release the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>We can speak many things from the emotions and the mind without the release of our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Sometimes a brother ministering from the platform ministers only from his mind or his emotion, and there is almost nothing released from his spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>As ministers of the word and those who serve the Lord, we must learn how to release the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Even in a prayer meeting, it is sometimes difficult to utter a prayer because we have too many considerations.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>We have self-consciousness, considerations about others, and problems with language, grammar, composition, and content, among other things.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>We are so much in our considerations that we are hindered from expressing a prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Sometimes we can express a prayer only in a timid way, saying, "Lord, I am so weak.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Help me, Lord."</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>This may be merely out of our mouth and mind, having nothing from the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>This is why many times we need the outpouring of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>When the outpouring of the Spirit comes upon us, we release our spirit and pray from the depths of our whole being.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>We may only say, "Lord, be merciful to me," but our spirit is released by this prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>However, we should not think that to shout and pray loudly are to release the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The spirit can be released without much emotion.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>DEALING WITH THE SPIRIT TO HAVE A PURE AND CLEAN SPIRIT</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>In order to serve the Lord and to practice the church life, sooner or later we will find that the biggest lesson to learn is the dealing with the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>We may illustrate this in the following way.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>A brother may receive a certain light from the Scriptures.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>This causes him to be very happy and rejoicing, and when he comes to the meeting, he is excited and can barely control himself.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The first chance he gets, he stands up and releases his revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>There is no doubt that he has heavenly, spiritual light, but he delivers his message with an impure spirit, a spirit that is not purified and is full of human excitement and the human essence and element.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>His message is one of heavenly light; it may even be a great and unprecedented revelation, something the church has never before seen.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>However, it may be released with a proud spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>We may go to a brother to speak something very spiritual, yet we may speak it in a spirit that is not meek, not humble, and not of love.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Our message may be entirely right, good, and necessary, but our spirit is wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Now we can see what it means to deal with the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>If we do not deal with our spirit, we can never give people a pure flow of the pure, divine water.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>We can never be a pure channel for a pure flow of the pure inner life.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>In order to be a pure channel, we need to deal with our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>We may say that there is nothing wrong with our message.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Our light is not wrong, and we are not sinful.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>However, what kind of spirit do we have?</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>It may be a spirit that is not meek, not pure, not humble, and not of love.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Sometimes our spirit may not be one of sobermindedness.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>It may be a spirit of a foolish mind.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>When some brothers speak something in the meeting, they have the release of the spirit, but their spirit is one of foolishness; they have a foolish mind with the spirit.</S>
