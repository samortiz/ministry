   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER EIGHT THE POSITION AND FUNCTION OF THE ELDERS THE POSITION OF THE ELDERS</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In this chapter we will have a thorough fellowship concerning the elders' position and function.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>How a church goes on depends upon the eldership.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>We cannot say that there is absolutely no position of elders.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Actually, any person has a position.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Even a man or a child has a position.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The professors have a position in their schools and even a student has his position.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>We all must see this matter of the position of the elders.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>No Rank</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>First, the position of the elders should not be considered a position of any high rank.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Strictly speaking, according to the New Testament, in the church there should be no rank.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>This matter of ambition for position and rank was there even with the early disciples, especially among the twelve Matt 20:20-24 .</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>In Matthew 20 and 23 the Lord Jesus did not allow one inch of ground to be given to rank.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>He told the disciples that the church was not like the Gentiles.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>With the Gentiles there are kings and persons of high rank to govern them, but there should be nothing like this among the believers.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Then the Lord Jesus said, "And whoever wants to be first among you shall be your slave" Matt 20:27 .</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Among the believers there is only the brotherhood; we are all brothers Matt 23:8 .</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>When the Brethren were raised up in Britain, many people did their best to ascribe a name to them so that they could be denominated.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Because people could not find a name for them, they began to call them the Brethren because they practiced the fact in the Bible that they were all brothers without rank.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The name that was used was the King James rendering "brethren."</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>This was not a name that the brothers picked up themselves.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Rather, it was a nickname ascribed to them.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>They realized that there should be no rank among the believers.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Also, before the so-called Plymouth Brethren there were brothers in the seventeenth century known as the Grace Brethren and the Moravian Brethren.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>There were different kinds of brothers in Europe which followed the principle that among the believers there should be no rank.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>We all have a position, but do not think that we have a rank.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Then the episcopal thought invaded the church.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Episcopal means having the church government by bishops.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The word bishop is included in the word episcopal which in the Greek is episkopos.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>It was Ignatius in the second century who mistakenly taught that an overseer, a bishop, is higher than an elder.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>However, an overseer or bishop in a local church is an elder Acts 20:17, 28 .</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The two titles refer to the same person; elder denoting a person of maturity; overseer, denoting the function of an elder.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>An elder is a brother who is more mature and more experienced.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>This does not denote any rank.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>To interpret in this way is according to the worldly, natural concept.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>When the word overseer is used, most people do not have the concept that this is a high rank.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>However, the word bishop from Latin episcopus carries with it the concept of a high rank in the religious mind.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Today in Catholicism there is the hierarchy of bishops, archbishops, cardinals, and the pope.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The degraded and organized Christianity has brought in the concept of rank and is using terms such as these.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Not only do the Catholic Church and the Episcopal Church have bishops, but also the Methodists have bishops.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Ignatius was a dear brother, but he made a big mistake in teaching that an overseer, a bishop, was higher than an elder.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>This shows us that we must be careful in interpreting the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>An overseer or bishop according to Ignatius controls the elders in the churches.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>This may have seemed like a small mistake, but this was the opening of the door for the hierarchy in today's Christendom.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>We must realize that this thought of rank still remains in our mentality.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>This thought is not only devilish but, even more, it is hellish.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>We must got rid of this thought of rank.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>It should not remain in our mentality.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Everybody has a position.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>The sisters have their position and the brothers have their position, but there should be no rank.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>The elders are not higher than the brothers and the sisters in the local church.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Rather, according to the Lord's teaching, the elders are lower because they are the slaves.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>The sisters who are the wives of the elders should not consider that their husband is higher than others.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>They should consider that their husbands are slaves and that they are the wives of the slaves.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>On the other hand, we consider that it is a real honor to be a slave to serve the churches.</S>
