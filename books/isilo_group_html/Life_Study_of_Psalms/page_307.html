Seeking It, Longing for It,<br>and Hoping in It with Prayer</H2><P>The psalmist also sought God's word (vv. 45, 94), longed for it (vv. 20, 40, 131), and hoped in it with prayer (vv. 43, 74, 114, 147).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>M. Trusting in It</H2><P>In verse 42 the psalmist declared that he trusted in God's word.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>N. Musing on It</H2><P>In several verses the writer of Psalm 119 tells us that he mused upon God's word (vv. 15, 23, 48, 78, 99, 148). To muse on the word is to taste it through careful considering. Thus, musing is a kind of enjoyment. I can testify that most of the enlightenment I receive comes by musing on the Word early in the morning. As I muse on the Word, I think about it with much consideration in a detailed way.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>O. Considering It</H2><P>In verse 95b the psalmist said, "I consider Your testimonies." To consider the Word is to think it over very carefully. Concerning this, we may use the word mull. To consider the Word is to mull it over, even to study it and research it.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>P. Esteeming It Right concerning All Things</H2><P>"I esteem all Your precepts concerning all things to be right" (v. 128a). Here we see that the psalmist esteemed God's word to be right&#151;to be upright, straight, strict&#151;in all things.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>Q. Learning It</H2><P>"Your hands have made me and fashioned me;/Give me understanding that I may learn Your commandments" (v. 73). This indicates that God has created us in such a way that we may have understanding of His word and learn it. In verse 71 the writer says, "It is good for me that I have been afflicted,/That I might learn Your statutes." This indicates that suffering and affliction can help us to learn God's word.</P><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_306.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_308.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Life-Study of Psalms &nbsp; pg 307</div><br></body></html>
