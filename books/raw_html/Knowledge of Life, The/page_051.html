 <h2 class="head1">II. LIFE IS FROM LIGHT</h2>
<p>The whole Bible reveals that life comes from the shining of light. When light enters, life follows. Where light is, there life is. The amount of life is in direct proportion to the amount of light. Genesis chapters one and two say that before God began His recovery work, the entire earth was void and dark, which means that it was filled with death, for darkness is the symbol of death. Therefore, the first step of God&rsquo;s work was to command that there be light. When light came, it destroyed the death which belongs to darkness and began to bring in life. Thus, life follows light, and life begins from light.</p>
<p>The first day God commanded the light; then the plant life was brought forth on the third day. For the plant life, the light of the first day was sufficient. Yet for higher life, stronger light was required. Therefore, on the fourth day, God commanded the sun, moon and stars to shine forth. In this way, higher life was brought in. Not only were there birds, fish, beasts, and all kinds of animal life, but also the life of man, who was in the image of God. Finally, on the seventh day, God, who was represented by the tree of life, came forth. God as the highest light brought in the highest life, which is the life of God. The process of the appearing of various kinds of life shows us that life always follows light. Life begins with light, and life proceeds higher as light becomes stronger.</p>
<p>The light of the first day was not concrete; therefore, it brought in the plant life, the lowest life, a life which is without consciousness. This symbolizes the shining of light we received within when we were first saved (2 Cor. 4:6). Though this light brought the life of God into us, yet it only imparted to us a life in the initial stage, a life which does not have much substance and is without form.</p>
<p>The light of the fourth day was stronger than the light of the first day. It was more clear and definite, more concrete. Therefore, it brought in higher life, the animal life. Because the light was more substantial and strong, the life was also more substantial and high. Light progressed and, following it, life also progressed. This typifies our experience: as within us we receive stronger, clearer, more definite, and more concrete shining of light, the life within us also grows and becomes more defined in form. Thus, Christ is &ldquo;formed&rdquo; within us.</p>
<p>The light of the seventh day was the highest; therefore, it brought in the highest life, the life of God, which was represented by the tree of life. When light reached the apex, life also attained to the peak. When light becomes complete, life also becomes full. When within us the shining of light we receive has reached the apex, our spiritual life will also have become full and mature and will have reached the state of being completely like God.</p>
<p>In Genesis chapters one and two, the Holy Spirit continually shows us that life follows light. He shows us that light is divided into three stages&mdash;the first day, the fourth day and the seventh day; therefore, life is also divided into three stages. Light marks the beginning of each stage. The light of a particular stage brings in the life of that particular stage. The degree of light of that stage determines the degree of life it brings in.</p>
<p>The purpose of God was that man, who was created in the light of the fourth day, might touch the tree of life, which was manifested in the light of the seventh day, and thereby receive the uncreated life of God represented by this tree. Unfortunately, before man received this life, Satan came to tempt him. He persuaded man to receive the life of Satan, which was represented by the tree of good and evil, and thus man became corrupted. Then, since man was corrupted, God could only blockade the tree of life so that man could not touch it (Gen. 3:24). In this way, the life brought in by the light of the seventh day was put aside. Then, one day, God Himself was made flesh and came to earth to be light and life. John spoke of Him, saying, &ldquo;In him was life; and the life was the light of men&rdquo; (John 1:4). He Himself also said: &ldquo;I am the light of the world: he that followeth me...shall have the light of life&rdquo; (John 8:12). Thus, the coming of the Lord Jesus to earth meant that the light of the seventh day accompanied by the life of the seventh day was again manifested among men so that all who believe and receive Him can receive this life in them. In this way, the original intention of God is fulfilled.</p>
<p>In Revelation chapters twenty-one and twenty-two, the New Jerusalem appears. Within that city there is the light of the glory of God; therefore, there is no need of the light of sun and moon. There is also no longer any night. At the same time, in the midst of the street of the city, there is a river of water of life, and on both sides of the river is the tree of life. All those who are saved may freely drink of the water of life and partake of the tree of life. Thus, the interior of that city is filled with light and life. On the one hand, light chases away darkness; on the other hand, life swallows up death. This is the glorious scene when the life in the light of the seventh day is received by men and mingled with men. It is also the ultimate consummation of God being received by men as life in light.</p>
<p>All these passages show that there is a line in the whole Bible which continuously speaks of life and light together. Where light is, there is life. This is a great principle in the Bible. Psalm 36:9 says, &ldquo;With thee is the fountain of <em>life;</em> in thy <em>light</em> shall we see light.&rdquo; This also clearly speaks of the relationship between life and light. Life always follows light, and only light can bring forth life.</p>
 <p>Therefore, if we want to know the condition of life in a man, we must see the state of the enlightenment within him. We often think that if a man becomes a little more zealous, his life has grown; or if he is a little more pious, his life is improved. Such concepts are totally incorrect. Life is not in the zeal of man; neither is it in the piety of man. There is only one realm and one source of life, and that is light. Life rests with light; life also comes from light. To determine whether a person has grown in life, we must observe the condition of his enlightenment within.</p>
<p>Thus, if we want to help others to grow in life, we must help them to be enlightened. If others can receive enlightenment from us, they can grow in life. For example, in the ministry of the Word, if what we say is but a kind of encouragement or teaching, it can only stir people, influence people, and cause them to improve in behavior; it cannot produce the end result of life. Our work also can only have temporary effect; its issue cannot remain long. If we ourselves have been enlightened and live in the shining of light, then the words we release can bring light, which makes manifest the actual difficulties of men. (Ephesians 5:13 refers to this when it says that all things that are reproved are made manifest by the light.) After men hear such words, they may not remember the doctrine clearly, yet deep within them there is left something living which constantly moves them, touches them, and effects changes in their daily living. Such changes are not outward reform through human effort, but are the manifestation of life from the receiving of enlightening within; therefore, the issue can endure without change.</p>
<p>In preaching the Gospel, the same principle applies. Some who preach the Gospel can convince men by their words; yet they cannot cause men to touch from within the shining light of the Gospel. Therefore, though a man says with his mouth that he believes and even is determined in his heart to believe, he cannot from within receive life to be born again and be saved. Nevertheless, some who preach the Gospel preach words which are full of light. While men are listening, the light of the Gospel shines into them. They may continually shake their heads and say, &ldquo;I do not believe,&rdquo; yet after they return home, something inside continually tells them, &ldquo;Believe, believe!&rdquo; Then they cannot help but believe. This is the result of that shining of light which causes men to receive life from within and thus be born again and saved. These examples all reveal that life comes out of light. With light, life can be brought forth; without light, life cannot be brought forth. Life springs indeed from light.</p>
