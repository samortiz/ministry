<h2 class="head2">Letters from Hwa Shi-bin, Chekiang Province</h2><h2 class="head3">One</h2><p>Dear Brother Dah-Wei:</p><p>After the conference in Ning-Hai, I went to two meetings in the villages in Shi-Pu at the invitation of Brother Hwang Mei-tong. Recently, I joined Brother Lou Chuan-en to work in the denomination in Hun-Si-Kou. I would be happy to see any so-called results of the work manifested at the judgment seat of the Lord. The responsible brothers here hope to join Brother Chang Kwang-rong to do some work and render the brothers some help in the cities and the villages when spring arrives. Some believers in Shi-Pu need your edification. Brother Hwang Mei-tong charged me to request your prayer for him. Recently, I have been learning the lesson of a prayer life. Dear beloved Lord, although we are separated in different parts, may Your pillar of cloud guide us all the time so that our ways, our life, and our work will fall within Your will, amen. Peace to you in the Lord.</p><p>Brother Hwa Shi-bin, September 14, 1938</p><h2 class="head3">Two</h2><p>I left Ning-Hai for Sin-Chang at the end of July. On August 2, which was a Lord's Day, I went to Chang-Loh in Sheng County for three days of meetings. About thirty brothers who came from Shen County and Dong-Yang were seeking the truth. The atmosphere was good. May the Lord lead them on. On the eighth I arrived at Wu-Yi. I went to Yao-Chi the next day to work together with Brother Ding Keh-chang. We prayed and served the Lord together and testified for the Lord day and night. Thank the Lord! The Lord willing, we will first do some work in the villages, and we will wait on any large-scale meetings in the cities until you come to Wu-Yi. I heard that Brother Chou Shing-yi is resting in Ping-Yang due to illness. Please give my sincere regards to him. If Brother Chang Kwang-rong returns to Ping-Yang from Tai-Shun, please give him my regards. May the Lord's grace be merciful to me so that I can be dealt with through this coming trip, so that my self-life may be lost, and so that the spring of life can flow out from His fullness. Peace to you in the Lord.</p><p>Brother in the Lord,<br />Hwa Shi-bin, October 3, 1938, Ning-Hai, Chekiang province</p><p>(We received Brother Hwa's letter on February 2, stating that he had returned from Jin-Hwa over ten days ago. He conducted five conferences in towns and villages around Ning-Hai in January. Because a few local churches have weaknesses, Brother Lou Chuan-en will not leave for now; instead, he will strengthen the church in Ning-Hai. There is the need for the prayers of those in one accord&mdash;Editor.)</p><h2 class="head2">A Letter from Brother Han Fu-shen, Ch'ang-Teh</h2><p>I moved to the village (Chou-Jia-Dien) on the thirteenth of last month. I hope to stay in the countryside for two to three months. Next spring I will pay a visit to Chi-Li and then go to Dah-Yung. Thank the Lord that my health has been recovered. I expect to be able to withstand the hardship of traveling. By summer of next year, I may be able to work in Yuan-Ling and Chen-Xi. The only thing I am clear of is the first step. I will have to wait for His guidance concerning the rest.</p><p>Brother Han Fu-shen, December 31, 1938</p>
