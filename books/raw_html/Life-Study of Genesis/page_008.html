<H2 CLASS=HEAD4>c. Basis</H2><P>The basis of creation is God's will and plan (Eph. 1:10). Revelation 4:11 tells us clearly that all things were created according to God's will. God has a will, and according to that will He conceived His plan. According to that will and plan He created all things.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD4>d. Means</H2><P>The means of God's creation were the Son of God (Col. 1:15-16; Heb. 1:2b) and the Word of God (Heb. 11:3; John 1:1-3). The Bible clearly tells us that God created the heavens and the earth by Christ as the Son of God and as the Word of God. The Son of God and the Word of God are one.</P><P>We all must realize that God's eternal and central purpose is altogether for His Son, Christ. The Bible says that when God created the heavens and the earth and all the other items He did it through Christ and by Christ. All things were made through Christ, by Christ, and, in a sense, in Christ. From the time of creation, all things subsist in Christ. Christ is the hub which holds together every part of the universe.</P><P>Hebrews 1:3 says that Christ holds all things by the word of His power, and Colossians 1:17 says that all things subsist in Christ. Apparently the earth is hanging on nothing, but, in reality, it is held by Christ. If only one of the planets were to move a little wrongly, there would be a big collision. But the Lord holds everything. Hallelujah!</P><P>Why does Christ hold everything? He holds all things for His glory, for His Body. If the heavens were to collapse and the earth to drop, then where should we be, and where would the Body be? We do have such a good earth on which to live and walk, and we have the heavens to serve us. When we need the sunshine, the heavens send it. When we need the rain, the rain comes. When we need the air, the air is here. There is no air on the moon, but surrounding the earth there is the firmament, there is the air. The heavens serve the earth, and the earth is for us, and we are here for the Body and even we are the Body. Christ loves the Body. For His Body He holds the whole universe. Hallelujah!</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD4>e. Process</H2><P>Job 38:4-7 reveals the process of God's creation. The heavens with all the hosts and angels therein were created first. The earth, probably with some living creatures, was created second. We say "probably" because there is not a clear word about this matter. Some portions of the Word give us inferences. Job 38:4-7 says that when God laid the foundation of the earth, the stars and the angels (the sons of God) were there already. This proves that the heavens with all the stars and angels were created first, and that the earth was created second.</P>
