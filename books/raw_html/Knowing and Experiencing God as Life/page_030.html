        <h2 class="head1">THE ACCOMPLISHMENT<br />
OF THE LORD&rsquo;S REDEMPTION</h2>
<p>For the fulfillment of God&rsquo;s desire, the Lord Jesus had to accomplish a few matters. First, the Lord had to solve the problem of man&rsquo;s sinful deeds and the problem of man&rsquo;s record of sin before God. Second, He had to terminate the corrupt, sinful nature in order to work Himself as the model into man. Third, He had to destroy Satan. Fourth, He had to solve the problem of the world, which hangs on Satan and usurps man.</p>
<p>These matters were dealt with through the crucifixion of the Lord Jesus. First, He bore our sins on the cross (1 Pet. 2:24; 2 Cor. 5:21); God caused the iniquity of us all to fall on Him (Isa. 53:6; John 1:29), and in Him God judged sin in the flesh (Rom. 8:3). Thus, His blood redeems us from our sins, solving the problems of our sinful deeds and our record of sin. Second, the Lord Jesus was crucified in the flesh; hence, man&rsquo;s sinful nature was put to death on the cross (v. 3). Third, He destroyed Satan, who is mixed with man&rsquo;s sinful nature (Heb. 2:14). Fourth, He judged the world, which hangs upon Satan (John 12:31; 16:11). On the negative side, these matters were solved by the Lord Jesus through His death on the cross.</p>
<p>Furthermore, on the positive side, through His death on the cross, the Lord released His divine life. The divine life is rich and includes many elements. This life was released through His death (12:24). Then He was resurrected to become the life-giving Spirit (1 Cor. 15:45) in order to give us life. Hence, everything has been accomplished. Our problems have been resolved, and the divine life has been released. Moreover, the Lord with all His riches is now the life-giving Spirit. This Spirit has been sent forth into all the earth. Hence, no matter where a person may be, when his heart turns to God&mdash;he confesses his sins and receives the redemption of the Lord Jesus&mdash;the Spirit will enter into him and apply to him everything that the Lord Jesus has accomplished, including the record of sins being removed, the problems of man&rsquo;s sinful deeds and sinful nature being resolved, Satan being terminated, and the world being judged. Not only so, such a one also receives the divine life of God.</p>
<p>Everything that the Lord accomplished through His death on the cross is in the Spirit. Therefore, when we let the Spirit have the ground to operate in us freely, He will lead us to experience all that the Lord has accomplished. We will experience our sins being forgiven, the record of our sins being cleansed, our sinful nature being put to death, and both Satan and the world being nullified. These items will be judged; they will no longer have any ground or authority in us. The Lord&rsquo;s death will do a continual work of eliminating these items in us. We will also experience God becoming our life to uplift our humanity so that we become people mingled with God.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE RESULT OF LIVING TO LAW BEING FAILURE</h2>
<p>God&rsquo;s way of salvation is to mingle with us. This should be our living. However, many of us still do not know God&rsquo;s way of salvation, nor do we see our weaknesses and impotence. Thus, we are still trying to keep the law. As a result, we fail repeatedly and are unable to experience the freedom and release in God&rsquo;s salvation.</p>
<p>This was also the experience of the apostle Paul. Before he was saved, he kept the law in Judaism and lived to the law. He did not know that man was corrupt, weak, and unable to keep the law. In Romans 7 he says that when he tried to keep the law that says, &ldquo;You shall not covet,&rdquo; coveting of every kind was activated within him (vv. 7-8). Then he received revelation from the Lord to understand that though the law is good, man is corrupt; hence, because of the weakness of man, the law cannot accomplish anything (vv. 12, 14, 18, 10). Eventually, Paul realized that God does not deal with people according to the law but that God deals with people according to Himself (8:2-4). God has given Himself to us to be our life. He does not want us to live according to the law but to live in Him. He gave the law to test and prove man so that we would see that we are corrupt and weak. We cannot keep the law, and God never intended for us to keep the law. Hence, the law is not the way that God deals with man. God deals with man by giving Himself to man, entering into man as life, living in man, and living out many virtues, such as goodness, holiness, love, and righteousness.</p>
<p>Having such a realization, Paul could say, &ldquo;I through law have died to law that I might live to God&rdquo; (Gal. 2:19). This means that he had cut off his relationship with the law and did not pay attention to the requirements of the law. The law says, &ldquo;You shall not covet&rdquo; (Rom. 7:7; Exo. 20:17), but Paul knew that it was not a matter of coveting but a matter of dying to the law so that he could live to God. The law says, &ldquo;You shall love your neighbor as yourself&rdquo; (Matt. 19:19). Paul knew that he had died to this law and that he was living to God. This means that God was his life; Paul followed God and was responsible to God. If God said, &ldquo;Paul, you should love your neighbor as yourself,&rdquo; Paul could reply, &ldquo;Yes, God, but I cannot do it. You must live in me and live out of me by loving my neighbor.&rdquo; Hence, Paul did not live by his soul-life; he lived by God.</p>
<p>We need to be clear concerning the difference between living to law and living to God. Many preachers say that believers should be humble and meek, should obey their parents, and should be nice. These are laws. Christians who receive such teachings are like the Israelites at the base of Mount Sinai; they said, &ldquo;All that Jehovah has spoken we will do&rdquo; (Exo. 19:8). This is almost always the condition of Christians who pursue the Lord; they live to the law.</p>
<p>The result of living to the law is failure. If we are determined to be humble and exert much effort to be humble, we will eventually be proud. Even if we are not proud outwardly, we will be proud inwardly; we are not able to be humble. Similarly, we cannot keep any commandment in the Bible. Eventually, we will be like Paul, who cried out, &ldquo;Wretched man that I am! Who will deliver me from the body of this death?&rdquo; (Rom. 7:24). Hence, we need to see that if we live to the law, we will be miserable. If we know God as life, we will have the attitude of dying to the law, not of living to the law. We have come to grace, to Mount Zion (Heb. 12:22); we have died to law. We do not know how to be humble or patient, nor do we know how to honor our parents. We only know that God is life in us, we live by Him, and we live to Him. We do not know the law. We know God as life.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE RESULT OF LIVING TO GOD<br />
BEING TO OVERCOME</h2>
<p>Only those who live to God can honor their parents, and only those who live in God can be humble. Such honoring of one&rsquo;s parents is not an outward behavior but the living out of God. Similarly, such humility is not manufactured by man; it is the living out, the expression, of God.</p>
<p>Our determination is futile; it is useless to have regulations. We must die to law. God is in us. We do not need to make up our mind, to determine, or to have regulations; we only want God to live in us. Hence, we must find some time daily to read His Word, touch Him, receive Him, and maintain our fellowship with Him so that He lives in our every word and action. We live in Him, and He lives in us. Then we will not need the law; instead, God will live out many virtues in us.</p>
<p>Furthermore, Galatians 2:19-20 will be realized in us. We will know what it is to die to law and live to God. We have been redeemed, and the all-inclusive Spirit of life has entered into us. All that needs to die in us must be terminated and cut off so that the divine life can enter in and enliven us. The things that need to be cut off, put to death, and terminated include not only the record of sin, sinful deeds, the sinful nature, Satan, and the world but also the law. The law was given by God to expose man&rsquo;s condition, but man uses it for his expression. We should no longer live to the law or keep the law. We should live to God and let Him live in us.</p>
<p>Galatians 2:20 says, &ldquo;I am crucified with Christ.&rdquo; We have been terminated, crucified. Hence, we are not under the law and do not have to keep the law; rather, we have died to the law. It is no longer we who live, but it is Christ who lives in us so that we may live to God, take Him as our life, and let Him live in us. Hence, we only know to love God, fellowship with Him, live in Him, and let Him live in us. We do not know the law or regulations; we know only to follow God, cooperate with Him, and coordinate with Him. We should always say Amen to His move in us, and we should cooperate with His operation in us. We should take Him as our life, live by Him, and let Him live in us. We must deny our soul-life. We are not obligated to any regulation, because we live to God. We are vessels of God. He has entered into us to be our life, and He wants us to live by Him and take Him as our life. We simply need to love Him and give ourselves to Him to live by Him, coordinate with Him, cooperate with His operation, live in Him, and let Him live in us.</p>
<p>The normal Christian life is according to the Lord&rsquo;s words in John 14:19: &ldquo;Because I live, you also shall live.&rdquo; We live in the Lord, and the Lord lives in us. In such a living we can say, &ldquo;Christ will be magnified in my body, whether through life or through death,&rdquo; and &ldquo;to me, to live is Christ&rdquo; (Phil. 1:20-21).</p>
<p>Galatians 2:19-20 and then Philippians 1:20-21 bring in the proper environment. These verses tell us what kind of person Paul was. He learned how to die to law and to everything outside of God, and he learned to live to God and to let God live in him. He was clear that he was crucified with Christ and that he no longer lived but that Christ lived in him. Therefore, God raised up environments to prove him. Some environments were unto life, and some were unto death. But whether the environment was of life or of death, everything was an opportunity for Christ to be magnified in Paul. He magnified Christ, lived by Christ, and took Christ as life. The result of such proving was that to Paul to live was Christ. This is the proper Christian life.</p>

 	<h2>Noise Words</h2>
 	<p>Common words, such as "and", "is", "but", and "the", also known as noise words, are bypassed in a search. The search string, the Spirit &amp; who, would result in an error since who, which stands by itself, is a noise word. The following is a list of noise words:</p>
	<p>$, a, also, an, and, another, any, are, as, at, be, because, been, being, both, but, by, came, can, did, do, each, for, has, had, he, have, her, here, him, himself, his, how, if, in, into, is, it, like, make, me, might, much, my, of, on, or, our, out, over, said, should, since, some, still, such, take, than, that, the, their, them, then, there, these, they, this, those, to, too, very, was, way, we, well, were, what, where, which, while, who, with, would, you, your</p>

<div id="myModalRanking" class="reveal-modal">
  	<h2>Ranking</h2>
  	<p>Rank is a value from <strong>0</strong> to <strong>1000</strong> indicating how closely a match scored or ranked against the original search string. Rank values are affected by the following factors:</p>
		<ol>
            <li><span>The total number of occurrences of the original search words/phrases in a portion of a book.</span></li>
            <li><span>Content that includes the search words in close proximity to each other are ranked above those that do not. Therefore, a portion of a book that has the search words in close proximity may have a higher ranking than another portion of a book that has a higher hit count but the words are not in close proximity to one another. Therefore, we also include a search word hit count for reference.</span></li>
            <li><span>The rank values are relative to each other. Therefore, it is not possible to interpret the RANK value as a percentage or group the rank values into high/medium/low ranges. Think of rank as a method to order the results for a specific search.</span></li>

<div id="myModalScope" class="reveal-modal">
 	<h2>Search Scope</h2>
 	<h3>Include All Word Forms</h3>
	<p>This option breaks out the search string into its individual words and generates all conjugations and declensions for each word in the search phrase. A search on the word, dwell, would search for dwell, dwelling, dwelling's, dwells, dwelt, and dwelled.</p>
	<p>There is no need to use ^ (inflectional search) or * (prefix search) when using the Include all word forms search scope.</p> 
	<h3>Specified Word Forms</h3>
	<p>This option searches for exact matches of the specified words or phrases used in the search string. Use of ^ (inflectional search) with a particular word in the search string will broaden the search for that given word in that all conjugations and declensions for that word will be searched. Similarly, use of * (prefix search) with a particular word in the search string will broaden the search for that given word in that all words with that prefix will be searched as well.</p> 
	<h3>Note</h3>
	<p>Common words, such as "and", "is", "but", and "the", also known as noise words, are bypassed in a search. A list of all noise words is as follows:</p>
	<p>$, about, after, all, also, an,and, another, any, are, as, at, be, because, been, before, being, between, both, but, by, came, can, come, could, did, do, each, for, from, get, got, has, had, he, have, her, here, him, himself, his, how, if, in, into, is, it, like, make, many, me, might, more, most, much, must, my, never, now, of, on, only, or, other, our, out, over, said, same, see, should, since, some, still, such, take, than, that, the, their, them, then, there, these, they, this, those, through, to, too, under, up, very, was, way, we, well, were, what, where, which, while, who, with, would, you, your</p>
