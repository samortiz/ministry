<h1 class=msg>CHAPTER FORTY-FOUR</h1><h1 class=msg>THE SIGNS IN JOHN FOURTEEN THROUGH SEVENTEEN</h1><h1 class=msg>(9)</h1><h1 class=scripture>Scripture Reading: John 14:16-24, 26; 15:26; 16:7</h1><p>In the three foregoing messages we have been considering the sign of the divine Trinity. We have covered a number of points related to the Father and the Son, and three matters related to the Spirit. In this message we shall continue to consider additional matters related to the Spirit and then go on to the next sign, the sign of another Paraclete.<h2 class=head2>Sent by the Father in the Son’s Name</h2><p>John 14:26 says, “But the Comforter, the Holy Spirit, whom the Father will send in My name, He will teach you all things, and remind you of all things which I said to you.” Here we see that the Father sends the Spirit in the Son’s name. According to 5:43, the Son came in the Father’s name: “I have come in the name of My Father.” For the Son to come in the name of the Father means that the Son comes as the Father.<p>Suppose brother A sends brother B to carry out a certain business matter in the name of brother A. In such a case, brother B comes in the name of brother A. Because brother A sends brother B in his name, brother B does not come in his own name, but comes in the name of brother A. This means that, in a very practical way, brother B comes as brother A. If we understand this illustration, then we can understand why according to Isaiah 9:6 the Son given to us is called the Father. This verse indicates that the Son comes in the Father’s name. He is the Son, but He is called the Father, for He comes in the Father’s name and thereby comes as the Father. Simply, this means that the Son and the Father are one (John 10:30).<p>The principle is the same with the Father’s sending the Spirit in the Son’s name. According to 14:26, the Father sends the Spirit, but He sends the Spirit in the name of the Son. Therefore, the Spirit comes in the Son’s name because the Spirit and the Son are one (2 Cor. 3:17).<p>As an illustration, let us suppose that brother A sends brother C in the name of brother B. If he were asked to identify himself, brother C could say, “I am brother C coming in the name of brother B and sent by brother A.” In a similar way the Spirit could say of Himself, “I am the Spirit coming in the name of the Son and sent by the Father.”<p>In 14:26 we have the Three of the divine Trinity: the Father, the Son, and the Spirit. According to this verse, the Father sends the Spirit in the name of the Son. Therefore, when the Spirit comes, the Father and the Son come with Him. We have seen that because the Son comes in the name of the Father, the Son is called the Father. Because the Spirit is sent by the Father in the Son’s name, so the Spirit comes in the name of the Son with the Father. This means that when the Spirit comes, the Triune God comes.<p>Just as the Son does not come in His own name but comes in the name of the Father, so the Spirit does not come in His own name but comes in the name of the Son. This means that although the Spirit is here, He is not here in His own name, but in the Son’s name. Furthermore, the Son is here in the Father’s name, not in His own name. Therefore, when the Spirit is here, the Son is here, and when the Son is here, the Father is here. This means that when the Spirit comes, all Three of the Triune God—the Father, the Son, and the Spirit—come with the Spirit.<p>In a previous message we pointed out that the Father cannot reach us directly. The Triune God reaches us as the Spirit, who is the ultimate consummation of the Triune God. When the Spirit reaches us, the Father and the Son also reach us. This is the Triune God reaching us as the Spirit. Therefore, when the Spirit comes into us, we have the Triune God entering into us. We have the Father as the source, we have the Son as the expression, and we have the Spirit as the One entering into us. Hallelujah for the Triune God reaching us as the Spirit sent by the Father in the Son’s name!
