   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>3 The Lord's Hiding of Himself</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The Lord always hid Himself; He did not like to have a name for Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>After He healed the leper, He charged him not to tell anyone Matt 8:4 .</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>After He drove out the company of demons, He charged the previously possessed man to go home and to speak what God had done for him Luke 8:39 .</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>After He opened the eyes of two blind men, He charged them not to let anyone know about it Matt 9:30 .</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>After God revealed Him to Peter as the Christ, the Lord charged the disciples not to tell others 16:20 .</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>On the Mount of Transfiguration, He was the only One who shone in glory.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Yet when they came down from the mount, He charged the disciples not to tell others what they had seen 17:9 .</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>We find a similar case in John 7.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The Lord's own brothers did not recognize Him.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>They told Him, "Depart from here and go into Judea...for no one does anything in secret and himself seeks to be known openly.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>If You do these things, manifest Yourself to the world" vv.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>3-4 .</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>His brothers said this because even they did not believe in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Yet He said, "My time has not yet come" v. 6 . After His brothers went up, He also went up to the feast, not to perform any miracles there, but to teach.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Here we touch our Lord's glory.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Everyone who tries to draw attention to himself is eager to present his work before men.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>But the Lord never wanted to purposely expose Himself before men.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The Gospels are full of such records.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>He stood before men only when there was the absolute necessity for it.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>He did not like to tell others who He was.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Even after He had performed a miracle on the blind man, He did not tell him who He was immediately.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>He held back the revelation of who He was until He brought the man into some further enlightenment John 9 .</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Before this, He would not tell him who He was.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>We need to know our Lord!</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>C. Impressions Resulting from Lessons</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>In order to understand the history both in the Old and the New Testament, we have to have the right impressions.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>In order to have the proper impressions, we have to be a tender person.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>This is the reason we have to go through proper lessons before the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>If a person has a low discernment, he cannot be expected to appreciate the dignity of the Lord Jesus when he reads the Gospels.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>If he is dealt with even a little, he will know what dignity is, and when he comes to the Bible again, he will have more appreciation of the dignity of the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>If he does not know the meaning of dignity and glory, how can he be expected to form an impression of the Lord's dignity and glory?</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>We have to receive the proper lessons from the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>His nature has to be added into us daily.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>In this way, our feeling towards God's Word will be finer and finer every day.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>We will have deeper and deeper impressions every day, and we will understand more and more of His Word every day.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>We should remember the principle that whoever has, it shall be given to him, and he will abound; but whoever does not have, even that which he has shall be taken away from him Matt 13:12 .</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>We should never neglect our lessons.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Otherwise, we will lose what we have.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>III.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>ENTERING INTO THE SPIRIT OF THE SCRIPTURES</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>In order to study the Bible well, we have to acquaint ourselves with the thoughts of the Holy Spirit as well as the facts from the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>In addition, we have to enter into the spirit of the Scriptures.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>A. Touching the Spirit behind the Word</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>God's Spirit prompted men to write the Scriptures, and whether it is history or doctrines, each portion has a spirit of its own.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Every portion of the Bible has its own unique spirit behind the word.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The Holy Spirit expresses Himself through the spirit of man.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>When we say that the Holy Spirit rejoices, the Holy Spirit is not just rejoicing within Himself; rather, the Holy Spirit is rejoicing through man's spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>In the same way, when we say that the Holy Spirit grieves, the Holy Spirit is not grieving within Himself; rather, the Holy Spirit is grieving through man's spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Hence, when the Holy Spirit enters man's spirit, the condition of the Holy Spirit becomes the condition of man's spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Putting it another way, we can say that the condition of man's spirit is the condition of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>When the Spirit of God recorded history, He recorded the facts of history.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>However, this history contained not only facts, it also captured a certain spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>We can say that certain feelings and conditions of the Spirit are impregnated within each portion of the Word.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>In the same principle, in the writing of the Epistles, the Holy Spirit did not just convey doctrines and thoughts.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Behind every passage there is the feeling of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>The Bible is not merely a book full of facts and doctrines.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>On the surface there are the words.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Underneath the words there are thoughts, and behind the thoughts is the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>If we only touch the words, our reading of the Bible is too superficial.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>If we can form a proper impression and enter into the thoughts behind the words, we have gone deeper.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>However, if we remain in this realm, our understanding is still very limited.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Behind every word of God is a certain spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>The feeling of the Holy Spirit and the condition of the writers govern these writings.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>When we study the Bible, we have to touch the spirit behind the word.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>There is an inseparable link between the word and the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>The ministry of the word is the release of the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Anyone who stands up to be a minister of the word has to release his spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>If he cannot release his spirit, he cannot be a minister of the word.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Moreover, the spirit must be right.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>One must have a right spirit before he can have a right ministry of the word.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>We often fail as ministers of the word because the spirit cannot match the word that is released.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>There is nothing wrong with the words that are spoken, yet something is wrong with the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>The words are strong, but the spirit is weak.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>However, the ministers of the word in the Bible did not have this problem.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>Their spirit matched the content of their writings.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>Behind every passage and every book, there is a proper spirit; this spirit is impregnated in the word.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>In releasing the ministry of the word, we need the word on the surface and the spirit to back up the word.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>In receiving the ministry of the word, we also have to touch the spirit behind the word.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>When we study the Bible, our purpose is to receive the ministry of the word.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>As such ones, we have to touch the spirit behind the word.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>If we do not touch that spirit, our understanding of the Bible will be very shallow indeed.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>At most we will have some doctrines and facts; we will not find spiritual nourishment.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>If God's word is only impressions and thoughts to us, it cannot become our food.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>God's word must become spirit before it can become our food.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>Our food can only come as we touch the spirit behind the word.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>The essence of the Bible is spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>If we do not touch the spirit behind a passage, we have not touched that portion of the Scriptures yet.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>In reading the Bible, we have to touch the spirit, that is, the particular spirit behind a portion of the Word.</S>
