<h1 class="title">PREFACE</h1> 
<p>This book is composed of nine gospel messages given by Brother Witness Lee. The time and place that the messages were given are not known. These messages were originally published by the Taiwan Gospel Book Room in separate issues of <em>The Ministry of the Word</em> magazine beginning in 1951. The first chapter concerns the first sign performed by the Lord Jesus: the changing of death into life. The following chapters are based on eight cases in the Gospel of John and cover the needs of eight kinds of people&mdash;the moral, the immoral, the impotent, the hungry, the thirsty, the sinning, the blind, and the dead. These cases depict man&rsquo;s true condition and then present the redemption of Christ in order to show how the eternal, uncreated, incorruptible, and unfading life of God is the answer to all man&rsquo;s needs.</p>
