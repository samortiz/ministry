<p>In 1 Thessalonians 2:8 Paul continues, &ldquo;Yearning in this way over you, we were well pleased to impart to you not only the gospel of God but also our own souls, because you became beloved to us.&rdquo; The word <em>yearning</em> indicates being affectionately fond of, affectionately desirous of, like a nursing mother affectionately interested in her child whom she nourishes and cherishes. This was what the apostles did with the new believers.</p>
<p>The apostles not only imparted the gospel of God to the Thessalonians; they also imparted their own souls. To live a clean and upright life as portrayed in verses 3 through 6 and 10, and to love the new converts, even by giving our own souls to them, as described in verses 7 through 9 and 11, are the prerequisites for infusing others with the salvation conveyed in the gospel we preach.</p>
<p>Paul&rsquo;s word in verse 8 about imparting their own souls to the Thessalonians can be compared to his word in 2 Corinthians 12 about being spent for the sake of the believers. Paul was willing to spend not only what he had, but was willing to spend himself, his very being. The apostles were willing to impart what they were into the believers. This can be compared to a nursing mother giving herself to her child.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE APOSTLES&rsquo; CONDUCT</h2>
<p>First Thessalonians 2:9 says, &ldquo;For you remember, brothers, our labor and travail: While working night and day so as not to be burdensome to any of you, we proclaimed to you the gospel of God.&rdquo; The apostles did not want to be a burden on the Thessalonians. Therefore, they labored night and day in order to proclaim to them the gospel of God.</p>
<p>In verse 10 Paul continues, &ldquo;You are witnesses, as well as God, how in a holy and righteous and blameless manner we conducted ourselves toward you who believe.&rdquo; <em>Holy</em> refers to conduct toward God, <em>righteous</em> to conduct toward men, and <em>blameless</em> to all&mdash;God, men, and Satan. In order to conduct himself in this way, Paul had to exercise strict control over himself. Verse 10 reveals that the apostles were those who practiced self-control.</p>
<h2 class="head1">A FATHER EXHORTING HIS CHILDREN</h2>
<p>Verse 11 says, &ldquo;Just as you know how we were to each one of you, as a father to his own children, exhorting you and consoling you and testifying.&rdquo; The apostle was strong in stressing what or how they were (1:5), for what they were opened the way to bring the new converts into God&rsquo;s full salvation.</p>
<p>In verse 11 of chapter 2 Paul likens himself to a father exhorting his children. In cherishing the believers as their own children, the apostles considered themselves as nourishing mothers. In exhorting them, they considered themselves fathers.</p>
<p>In verse 12 Paul exhorts the believers to walk in a manner worthy of God. If he himself had not walked worthily of God, how could he have exhorted others to do so? In this matter also, he set an example for the believers to follow.</p>
<p>Verse 12 indicates that walking worthily of God is related to entering into His kingdom and being ushered into His glory. The thought here, in contrast to that in verses 1 through 11, is quite deep. Here we have a matter often neglected by Christians. Not many believers are taught to have a Christian walk that will enable them to enter into the kingdom of God, a walk that will usher them into God&rsquo;s glory. Many Christians have never heard such a word. Nevertheless, this is included as part of Paul&rsquo;s teaching to young believers. (<em>Life-study of 1 &amp; 2 Thessalonians,</em> pp. 97-104)</p>
<p class="newSection">* * *</p>
<p>We may think that Paul should have given the new believers more doctrine, teaching, and instructions. Instead, Paul emphasizes the apostles&rsquo; coming, their preaching and teaching of the Word, and how the new believers accepted this word. Paul&rsquo;s emphasis is on the apostles&rsquo; conduct, on their living and manner of life. The reason for this emphasis is that Paul wanted to nourish the believers, to cherish and foster them. It was not Paul&rsquo;s intention to give them a lot of knowledge. He did not have the burden to teach them so many things. In the twenty verses of chapter 2 there is actually very little teaching. In verse 12 he does say that God has called the believers into His kingdom and glory; however, he does not develop these matters or explain them. Rather, in verse after verse, Paul mentions his manner of life, his way of preaching, and his being a pattern to the believers.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE WORK OF FOSTERING</h2>
<p>What we have in chapter 2 of 1 Thessalonians is the fostering of the young Christian life. In this chapter Paul is nourishing and cherishing the believers. According to his writing, he behaves himself as a nursing mother and an exhorting father. On the one hand, he is a mother cherishing; on the other hand, he is a father exhorting. His main concern is not teaching, but the carrying out of a fostering work to help the young saints to grow.</p>
<p>In 1:6 Paul says to the Thessalonians, &ldquo;You became imitators of us and of the Lord.&rdquo; Imitating is related to growing. In fact, in many ways to imitate is to grow. In a family children imitate their parents and older brothers and sisters. The little ones do not invent anything; instead, they imitate others. A very good illustration of this is in the use of language. A child learns the language spoken by his parents. He speaks the same language with the same accent. A child learns the language and the accent by imitation. This illustrates the fact that children grow by imitating their parents. Therefore, in a family to imitate actually means to grow. The children imitate their parents in many things&mdash;in gestures, in speech, and even in character. Parents are patterns, models, for their children. Whatever the parents are, the children will be also.</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_046.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_048.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Raising Up the Next Generation for the Church Life &nbsp; pg 47</div><br></body></html>
