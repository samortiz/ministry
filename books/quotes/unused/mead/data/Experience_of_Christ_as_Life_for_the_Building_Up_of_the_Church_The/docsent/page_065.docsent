   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>REFRESHED IN OUR SPIRIT</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In 2 Corinthians 7:13 Paul said, "We rejoiced more abundantly over the joy of Titus, because his spirit has been refreshed by all of you."</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Here we have a number of lessons to learn.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>First, you have to refresh others' spirits.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Many times when you are with a certain brother or sister, after a while you feel the refreshment in your spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Someone else may be able to make you happy in your emotion but not refreshed in your spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Sometimes your emotional feeling may be hurt, yet your spirit is refreshed.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>To make people happy in the emotion is one thing.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>To make people refreshed in the spirit is another thing.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>So we all have to learn the lesson of refreshing others' spirits.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Second, you also need to learn to be refreshed in your spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Sometimes you do not care for this refreshment in the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Instead, you care for people's sympathy.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>If you are in a certain kind of trouble or trial, someone may sympathize with you and say something good to you.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>You may like this.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>But if someone would do something to refresh your spirit, you would not receive it.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>You have no willingness to have your spirit refreshed by someone.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>You have to learn to be refreshed in your spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>You should not care for people's sympathizing with you or saying something good to you.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>You should care only for your spirit being refreshed by others.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Third, we have to learn to be joyful in others' refreshment.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Paul was joyful in the refreshment of Titus's spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Sometimes we do not care for others' refreshment.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>We need to refresh others' spirits; we need to have our own spirit refreshed by others; and we need to be joyful in others' refreshment.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>WALKING IN THE SAME SPIRIT</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>In 2 Corinthians 12:18 Paul said that he and Titus walked in the same spirit and in the same steps.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The spirit here is our regenerated spirit indwelt by the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>This spirit governs, rules, directs, regulates, and leads us in our Christian walk Rom 8:4 .</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The apostles walked in such a spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Paul did not say that they walked in the same doctrine, but in the same spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>To walk includes speaking, thinking, talking, fellowshipping, and doing anything.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>We have to walk in the same spirit and in the same steps in a corporate way.</S>
