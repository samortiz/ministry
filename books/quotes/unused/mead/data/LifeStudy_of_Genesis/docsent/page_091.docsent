   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Charging Man to Bear Responsibility</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>to Cooperate with God 2:15</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>God charged man to till the garden that life may grow for the fulfillment of the first aspect of God's purpose, that is, to express God in His image.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Tilling the ground was for the growth of the tree of life.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>What does it mean to till the ground?</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>This matter of tilling the ground was sown as a seed in Genesis 2 and developed in Matthew 13.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>In Matthew 13 the Lord Jesus says that the ground is the human heart.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Furthermore, in Matthew 13 the tree of life is the Lord Jesus Himself as the seed which He sows into our heart.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>To till the ground means to loosen and break our hard heart, to open our heart to the heavens that rain may descend for the growth of life within us.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>When God charged man to till the ground, it meant that man had to be open, broken, and prepared for the tree of life to come into him.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Along with this charge, God gave man an order: man must not only till the ground, but also guard it.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>God warned man to protect the garden from the enemy that the second aspect of His purpose might be fulfilled, that is, to deal with Satan by His authority.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The tree of life requires the tilling of the ground, and the tree of knowledge necessitates the guarding of the ground.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>We need to till the ground that God might be able to enter into us.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>However, since Satan also wants to invade us, we need to guard the ground, leaving no opening for the tree of knowledge.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>To till the ground is to open ourselves to the tree of life; to guard the ground is to close ourselves to the tree of knowledge.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>d.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Warning Man</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Giving Him the Prohibition 2:17</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Genesis 2:17 tells us that God issued man a warning and gave him a prohibition.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>God wanted man only to touch Him to receive life, but not to touch the things apart from God to receive death.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>God seemed to tell Adam and Eve, "Don't touch the tree of knowledge only touch the tree of life.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>If you eat the tree of life, you will receive Me and have My life.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>If you eat the tree of knowledge, you will take in Satan and have his death."</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>This was not merely a commandment; it was a warning.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>We must realize that in the whole universe there are two sources: one is the source of life, and the other is the source of death.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Be careful which source you touch.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>If you touch God, you have the source of life and receive life.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>If you touch Satan, you have the source of death and receive death.</S>
