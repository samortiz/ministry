<h1 class=msg>CHAPTER NINE</h1><h1 class=msg>THE DIVINE DISPENSING OF THE ALL-INCLUSIVE CHRIST IN FEEDING, WATERING, AND TRANSFORMING THE BELIEVERS</h1><h1 class="title">OUTLINE AND SCRIPTURE READING</h1><ol class="upper-roman"><li>The all-inclusive Christ being the divine dispensing as the Passover Lamb and the unleavened bread, feeding the believers and supplying them life—1 Cor. 5:7-8:<br><br>1 Corinthians 5:7-8<br>Purge out the old leaven, that you may be a new lump, even as you are unleavened. For indeed our Passover, Christ, has been sacrificed. (8) Let us therefore keep the feast, not with old leaven, nor with leaven of malice and evil, but with unleavened bread of sincerity and truth.	<ol class="upper-alpha">	<li>Not only supplying the believers with the power of life for them to run the God- ordained race of following Him;</li>	<li>But also supplying the believers with nourishment of life and increasing God’s element of growth within them.</li>	</ol></li><li>The all-inclusive Christ being the divine dispensing as the spiritual rock out of which flows living water, and as the spiritual bread from heaven, nurturing them and supplying them with life—1 Cor. 10:3-4; John 6:57b-58a:<br><br>1 Corinthians 10:3-4<br>And all ate the same spiritual food, (4) and all drank the same spiritual drink; for they drank of a spiritual rock which followed them, and the rock was Christ.<br><br>John 6:57b-58a<br>…he who eats Me shall also live because of Me. (58a) This is the bread which came down out of heaven…	<ol class="upper-alpha">	<li>Not only supplying the believers with the life-power for them to run God’s race;</li>	<li>But also supplying the believers with the divine element for the growth of God.</li>	</ol></li><li>The all-inclusive Christ being the divine dispensing as the anointing of the compound Spirit, and as the sealing of the seal, saturating and transforming the believers—2 Cor. 1:21-22:<br><br>2 Corinthians 1:21-22<br>But He who firmly attaches us with you unto Christ and has anointed us is God, (22) who has also sealed us and given the pledge of the Spirit in our hearts.	<ol class="upper-alpha">	<li>Not only anointing and sealing God’s divine element into the entire being of the believers inwardly and outwardly;</li>	<li>But also transforming the believers’ nature metabolically by God’s divine element that they may have a divine transformation in their entire being.</li>	</ol></li><li>The all-inclusive Christ being the divine dispensing within the believers as the inscribing of the ink, who is the life-giving Spirit, and outside the believers as the “xeroxing” of the Spirit who transforms them (as a mirror), constituting the believers ministers of the New Testament; these believers reflect His glorious image to fulfill the New Testament ministry—2 Cor. 3:3, 18:<br><br>2 Corinthians 3:3<br>Being manifested that you are a letter of Christ ministered by us, inscribed not with ink, but with the Spirit of the living God; not in tablets of stone, but in fleshy tablets of the heart.<br><br>2 Corinthians 3:18<br>And we all with unveiled face, beholding and reflecting as a mirror the glory of the Lord, are being transformed into the same image from glory to glory, even as from the Lord Spirit.	<ol class="upper-alpha">	<li>Not only making the believers the constitution of Christ’s life within;</li>	<li>But making them Christ’s glorious expression without.</li>	</ol></li></ol>
