<H2 CLASS=HEAD1>XV. THE PRAISE OF THE SAINT<br>IN HIS GOING UP TO ZION CONCERNING<br>THE CHARGE AND THE BLESSING<br>OF THE CHILDREN OF ISRAEL<br>TO THE SERVING PRIESTS IN THE HOUSE OF GOD</H2><P>As the last of the Songs of Ascents, Psalm 134 is the praise of the saint in His going up to Zion concerning the charge and the blessing of the children of Israel to the serving priests in the house of God. This psalm indicates that the highest people, those who are in Zion, can bless everyone and teach everyone.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>A. The Charge to the Servants of Jehovah</H2><P>"Bless Jehovah now,/All you servants of Jehovah/Who stand by night in the house of Jehovah./Lift up your hands in the sanctuary,/And bless Jehovah" (vv. 1-2). This is the charge of the children of Israel to the serving priests. Although these priests are serving in the house of God, they are lower than the ones in Zion. Thus, those in Zion can give such a charge to these servants of Jehovah.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>B. The Blessing to the Servants of Jehovah</H2><P>"May Jehovah, who made heaven and earth,/Bless you from Zion" (v. 3). Here we see that the blessing comes from Zion, that is, from the highest people. If you read the history of the church, you will see that in every age and century God's blessing has come to the church because of the overcomers. Whenever there are some overcomers, there will be God's blessing. God always blesses His people from Zion, from the highest peak, from the ones who have attained to the top, to the position of the overcomers. From this position God blesses all His people.</P>
