   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER EIGHT THE PROPER STANDING OF THE CHURCH</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In these messages we have seen that the Lord s recovery today is concerned with two main items: the full experience of Christ in our spirit and the practical church life.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In the more than half century since 1922, the enemy has not ceased to attack the Lord s recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>During the past years in the United States, the attacks have always been on two points the Spirit and the ground of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The enemy has tried his best to defeat us regarding the Spirit for our experience and the church ground for our practice.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Here we see the subtlety of the enemy.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The points the enemy attacks are the crucial spots.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>If the enemy would attack any particular place, that spot must be vital.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Therefore, we have been burdened to cover these two matters.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>AN OVERVIEW OF THE CHURCH</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>IN THE NEW TESTAMENT</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>In this message, I am burdened to cover the matters of the practical church life and the proper ground.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>There are many verses that we need to mention.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>In Matthew 16:18 the Lord Jesus said, I will build my church.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The church here, which is built upon Christ as the rock, is the universal church.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>However, when the Lord Jesus said in Matthew 18:17, Tell it unto the church, He was referring, not to the universal church, but to a local church to which we can go.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>First Corinthians 10:32 speaks of the church of God, and 1 Corinthians 11:16 speaks of the churches of God.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Here we see the church, singular, and the churches, plural.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>In addition, we have some illustrations of the church: the church at Jerusalem Acts 8:1 , the church at Antioch Acts 13:1 , the church at Cenchrea Rom 16:1 , and the church at Corinth 1 Cor 1:2 .</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Galatians 1:22 and 1 Thessalonians 2:14 both speak of the churches in Judaea, that is, the churches in the Jewish territory of Judaea.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Furthermore, Romans 16:4 mentions the churches of the Gentiles.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Hence, we firstly have the churches in the Jewish land and then the churches in the Gentile world.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Acts 15:41 refers to the churches in Syria and Cilicia, two Gentile provinces of the ancient Roman Empire.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>In addition to Syria and Cilicia, the New Testament speaks of churches in three other provinces of the ancient Roman Empire: Asia, Galatia, and Macedonia.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>First Corinthians 16:19 speaks of the churches of Asia ; Galatians 1:2 and 1 Corinthians 16:1 refer to the churches of Galatia ; 2 Corinthians 8:1, the churches of Macedonia.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>In 1 Corinthians 4:17 we find the phrase every where in every church.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Acts 14:23 says that the apostles ordained elders in every church.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Romans 16:16 mentions the churches of Christ, and 1 Corinthians 14:33 the churches of the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Therefore, we have the churches of God, the churches of Christ, and the churches of the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>THE TWO ASPECTS OF THE CHURCH</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>As we have pointed out several times, every truth in the Bible has two sides.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>This is also true with respect to the church.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The church has two aspects: the universal aspect and the local aspect.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Universally, the church is uniquely one.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Locally, however, the church is expressed in many localities.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Therefore, the one universal church becomes the many local churches.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>God is expressed in Christ, Christ is expressed in the church, and the church is expressed in the local churches.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>If there were no Christ, then God would not be practical to us.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>We would be like the Jews who hold the doctrine of God, but who do not have Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>As a result, God is merely a term to them; He is not practical.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The practical God is the God expressed in Christ, because Christ is the practical expression of God.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Apart from Christ and outside of Christ, no one can have God.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>But if you have Christ, then you have God.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Where is Christ?</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Doctrinally speaking, you may answer, Christ is in the heavens.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>But if Christ were only in the heavens, how could we contact Him?</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>In that case, He would be doctrinal to us, but He would not be practical to us.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Surely we must say that today Christ is in the church.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Whenever you touch the church, you touch Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>If you have the church, then you have Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>By the word church, I do not mean a bungalow with a high tower and a bell; I mean the real church, which is the expression of Christ.</S>
