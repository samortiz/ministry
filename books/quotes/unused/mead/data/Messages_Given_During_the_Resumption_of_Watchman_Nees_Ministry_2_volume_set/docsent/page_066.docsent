   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Daily Hungry and Daily Satisfied</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>the Normal Experience of One</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Who Is in Fellowship with the Lord</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The Christian experience is one where we are daily hungry and are daily satisfied.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>I had a meal this morning.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>But by this afternoon and this evening, I will be hungry again.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>This is like a person having fellowship with the Lord in the morning; he feels sweet and satisfied.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>But in the afternoon, he needs to come to Him again.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>This is God speaking in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Many Christians do not pay attention to this.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>They do not realize that every time they are hungry, they have to contact God.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Every time we do not follow the Holy Spirit, we will lose the sense of hunger.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>This sense of hunger is the sense of life.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The Song of Songs says that God's leading directs us to the place of peace and rest.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>If we do not have rest, this proves that God is speaking to us.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>In the Song of Songs we see a person working for God, yet one who did not fellowship with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>She was busy with her work, yet she was hungry within.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>She asked where the Lord fed His flock, because she wanted to be satisfied, and she asked where the sheep could find rest.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>She asked these questions because she herself did not have rest.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>This sense of hunger and restlessness is God's speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The purpose of this speaking is to turn us to seek after the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The result of the Lord's leading is to bring men to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>At the end of chapter one of the Song of Songs, we see the result of the Lord's leading, which is the seeker sitting at the table with the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>In chapters two, three, and four she was repeatedly hungry and restless.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Every time she was hungry and restless, it was God's speaking to her for the purpose of drawing her to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>In this way, she was kept constantly in a state of seeking after God.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>There is no other way to take care of man's hunger and restlessness except by coming to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>ALL SPIRITUAL EXPERIENCES BEING</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>GOD PASSING THROUGH US</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Some people study the Bible and pray, but they are not satisfied.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The reason for this is that they need to have the sense of the Holy Spirit within them.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>When we pray, we cannot pray according to our mind or our memory; we have to pray according to our inner feeling.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>If we pray according to our inner feeling, the more we pray, the more we will touch God.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>This kind of prayer is like our eating; it satisfies us.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Some people pray according to their memory.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>They pray for their husbands, and they pray for their sons, from the first one to the last one, and ask God to protect them from car accidents.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>But the more such ones pray this kind of prayer, the emptier they become.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>After the prayer, when such ones see their children, they lose their temper again.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>What is the real prayer?</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The real prayer is the Christ within praying to the Christ in heaven.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The real prayer is God passing through you and praying out of you.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>All spiritual experiences are a matter of God coming in and going out of you.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The real prayer is not a matter of kneeling down or saying the right words, but of praying according to the inner feeling.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>If the Lord wants you to pray, you should pray.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>You should pray to the extent that you are filled with God and that God passes through you.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>This is the real prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>It is right that we pray for the brothers and sisters, and sometimes God does give us the burden to pray for others; the more we pray that kind of prayer, the more burden we will have.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>But many times when others ask me to pray for them, I would not answer anything.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>It does not mean that it is wrong for others to ask me to pray for them.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>It means that I have to go before God and see what His mind is.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>We are not praying according to man's need, but according to the inner feeling.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>In other words, we pray according to God's need.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>The same is true with our reading of the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>For example, when we read Matthew 1, we should not right away look up the meaning of the word Abraham.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Rather, whenever we come to some words that we are touched with, we should immediately pray.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>In this way, our reading of the Word will cause us to touch God and be filled with Him.</S>
