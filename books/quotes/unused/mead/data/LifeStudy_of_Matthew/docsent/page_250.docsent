   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>LIFE-STUDY OF MATTHEW MESSAGE SIXTY-NINE PRESSED IN GETHSEMANE,</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>ARRESTED BY THE JEWS,</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>JUDGED BY THE SANHEDRIN,</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>AND DENIED BY PETER</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>In this message we come to 26:31-75, a long section in the Gospel of Matthew that is also related to the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The verses in this chapter regarding the Lord s table indicate that the Lord s death and resurrection have a great deal to do with the kingdom of the heavens.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>In these verses, however, we cannot find the resurrection, although we do have a clear reference to the Lord s death in the breaking of the bread, which signifies the breaking of the Lord s body.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The Lord s word about the pouring out of His blood v. 28 is also an obvious reference to His death.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Although there is no explicit mention of it, resurrection is implied by the fact that the bread signifies the Lord as our bread for our enjoyment.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>His death accomplished redemption for us, but He becomes our enjoyment through redemption in resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>When we come to the Lord s table, we see on the table a symbol of the Lord s death, but we remember Him, not in death, but in resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>In this remembrance we display His death.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Both the Lord s crucifixion and resurrection are for the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Apart from Christ s crucifixion and resurrection, it is impossible for the kingdom to be established.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>By our natural life it is not possible for us to be the kingdom people.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>This fact is made abundantly clear in 26:31-75.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Here we have a picture of the arrest and judgment of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>This record reveals that no one can follow Christ on the pathway of the cross by the natural life.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The King can take this pathway, but we in our natural life cannot.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Therefore, the Lord must die for us and enter into resurrection for us.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Through His death our negative situation is settled, and by His resurrection He is able to be taken in by us and even become us.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Years ago, I could not understand why in the record of the Lord s arrest and judgment Matthew includes a long story about Peter s denial of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>I used to think that a few verses would have been sufficient to describe how Peter denied the Lord three times.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>But Matthew presents this in detail.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>It is important for us to see the significance of Peter s denial.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>In chapter twenty-six the Lord Jesus and Peter stand in absolute contrast to each other.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>In every respect Jesus was able to pass through the pathway of the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>But in every respect Peter was defeated in taking this pathway.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>All the other disciples, of course, were the same as Peter.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>If we see this matter clearly, we shall pay careful attention to Peter s denial as well as to Christ s victory.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>What was Matthew s main intention in 26:31-75 to unveil the victory of Christ or to expose the defeat of Peter?</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>I believe that his intention was to present both each in vivid contrast to the other.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>When we look at the Lord Jesus, we see complete success, but when we look at Peter, we see total defeat.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>For the establishment of the kingdom, Christ s victory is necessary.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>He had to be victorious in every respect.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>At the same time, we must come to realize that we, as fallen human beings, are not able to be the kingdom people.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Do not have any trust in yourself.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Peter is our representative.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>As far as our natural life is concerned, we are all Peter.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>For the kingdom of the heavens to be established, there was the need of a man like Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Throughout chapter twenty-six, the Lord Jesus stood in the position of a man, not in the position of the Son of God.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>In order for the kingdom of the heavens to be established, He stood as a man, a successful man, a victorious man, as a man that could withstand any hardship, defeat, opposition, and attack.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>As we consider this picture of the Lord Jesus, we should receive the clear impression that in our human life it is impossible for us to be the kingdom people.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The twelve disciples had been under the Lord s teaching and training for three and a half years.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>During this period of time, they were with the Lord constantly.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Peter, a fisherman, was called in chapter four, and he began from that time onward to follow the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The Lord took special care to train Peter in a particular way.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Peter heard the decree of the constitution of the kingdom of the heavens, and he heard all the mysteries concerning the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>He was trained concerning Christ s being the Son of God, concerning the building up of the church, and concerning the pathway of the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>He was dealt with on the Mount of Transfiguration and corrected regarding the paying of the poll tax.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Time and time again, Peter was adjusted.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>It is difficult to believe that such a qualified and trained person could take the lead in denying the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>If Peter could not succeed in following the Lord, then who can?</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>If Peter had denied the Lord in chapter four, I would not have been surprised.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>But it is hard for me to believe that in chapter twenty-six, after being with the Lord for three and a half years, Peter could deny Him.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Not even Peter himself believed that he would do this.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>In verse 33 Peter said boldly to the Lord, If all shall be stumbled in You, I will never be stumbled, and in verse 35 he said, Even if I must die with You, I will by no means deny You.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Peter was confident that he would follow the Lord to the uttermost.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>But, as this picture makes clear, all he could do was to deny the Lord to the uttermost.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>This proves that no human being can succeed in living the kingdom life.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Perhaps after reading these messages, you have been stirred up for the kingdom and desire to be today s kingdom people.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>But we must realize that none of us can make it.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Therefore, we need to humble ourselves, bow down, and say, Lord, I simply can t make it.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>I am a Peter.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>If Peter could not make it, then who am I to think that I can make it?</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Lord, I can t do it.</S>
