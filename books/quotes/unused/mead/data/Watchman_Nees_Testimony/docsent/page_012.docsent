   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER TWO THE SECOND TESTIMONY</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>GIVEN ON OCTOBER 20, 1936</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Today I want to testify concerning four things: 1 learning the lesson of the cross, 2 leading in the work, 3 receiving healing to my sickness and experiencing God as my Healer, and 4 four aspects of work entrusted by the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>LEARNING THE LESSON OF THE CROSS</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>A believer may read, study, or expound a teaching concerning the cross, while at the same time not necessarily receive the lesson of the cross or know the way of the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>When I was being tempered together in the service with my co-workers, the Lord ordered many crosses for me.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Many times I felt embarrassed.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>I would not accept the dealing of the cross and found it difficult to submit.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Inwardly, however, I knew that if the cross were ordered by the Lord, it would be the right thing, though it would still be difficult to obey and accept it.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>While the Lord was on the earth, He learned obedience by the cross which He suffered Heb 5:8; Phil 2:8 .</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>How could I be an exception?</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>In the first eight or nine months, when the lesson of the cross began to come, I would not obey.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>I knew that I should yield without resistance to the cross ordered by the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>When I would make up my mind to obey, my determination would last only a short time.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>When some event would arise where I should obey, I found it difficult to obey and was full of rebellious thoughts.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>This made me very uneasy.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Once I recognized the cross which the Lord had ordered for me, I found it very beneficial.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Among my co-workers, five had been my schoolmates since childhood.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Another one came from a different city and was five years older than I. The five always sided with him and opposed me.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>No matter what I did, they would invariably condemn me.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>They received the credit for many things I did.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Sometimes when they rejected my views, I went to a lonely hill to cry before God.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>At these times I wrote some hymns on bearing the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>For the first time I experienced the significance of "the fellowship of His sufferings" Phil 3:10 .</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>When I could not have fellowship with the world, I could enjoy heavenly fellowship.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The first two years after my salvation, I did not know what the cross was.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>But at this time I was beginning to learn its lesson.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>I was always ranked first in my class as well as in my school.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>I also wanted to be first in serving the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>For this reason, when I was made second, I disobeyed.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>I told God repeatedly that it was too much for me to bear; I was receiving too little honor and authority, and everyone sided with my elder co-worker.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>But today I worship God and thank Him from the depths of my heart that this all happened to me.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>It has been the best training.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>God wished me to learn obedience, so He arranged for me to encounter many difficulties.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Eventually, I told Him I was willing to be placed second.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>When I became willing to yield, the joy I experienced differed from the joy I experienced at the time of my salvation; it was not a broad joy but a deep one.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>After another eight or nine months, on many occasions I was willing to be broken and did not do what I wished.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>On my spiritual path I was filled with joy and peace.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The Lord submitted to the hand of God, and I was willing to do the same.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The Lord, existing in the form of God, did not consider being equal with God a treasure to be grasped, but emptied Himself Phil 2:6-7 .</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>How dare I rank myself above the Lord?</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>When I first began to learn obedience it was difficult, but as time went on I found it easier and easier.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Eventually, I told God that I would choose the cross, accept its breaking, and put aside my own ideas.</S>
