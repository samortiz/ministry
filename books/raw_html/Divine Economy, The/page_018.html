<H2 CLASS=HEAD1>CHRIST'S INCARNATION WITH THE FATHER</H2><P>Jesus as the Son of God came in the name of the Father (John 5:43a). A person named Mr. Smith may have a large bank account. If I go to the bank in Mr. Smith's name, the people at the bank will call me Mr. Smith. According to the bank account, Mr. Smith is there. But according to the actual person, I am there at the bank. I am there in Mr. Smith's name. When the Son comes in the name of the Father, who comes? Isaiah 9:6 says that a Son is given to us whose name is called the eternal Father. Because I went to the bank in Mr. Smith's name, my name is called Mr. Smith. Because the Son came in the name of the Father, His name is called the eternal Father. Do not forget John 5:43a where the Lord Jesus said, "I have come in the name of My Father."</P><P>John 1:1 tells us that the Word was God, and John 1:14 tells us that this Word became flesh. God became flesh, that is, a man, and this Man is the embodiment of God. God is no longer mysterious. Now God is embodied because He became a man. We have to ask whether this God-man is the Son or the Father. We have to say that He is the Son with the Father. God became flesh, and this God is the Son with the Father. When God the Son became flesh, He became flesh with God the Father. God the Son with God the Father became flesh. We may have been told in the past that when the Son came to be born as a man, He left the Father on the throne in heaven. But the Bible tells us that when the Son came, He came with the Father.</P><P>John 6:46 says, "Not that anyone has seen the Father, except Him who is from God, He has seen the Father." The Greek preposition for "from" in this verse is para, which means "along with" or "by the side of." John Nelson Darby points out in his New Translation that the sense of para in this verse is "from with." The Son came from with the Father. He came not only from the Father but also with the Father. John 7:29 says, "I know Him, because I am from Him, and He sent Me." In John 16:27 the Lord Jesus said, "I came out from God." Again, the word from in these verses is para, and its sense is from with. The Father sent the Son, and the Son came from the Father. But He also came with the Father.</P><P>John 6:46; 7:29; and 16:27 tell us that when the Son came from the Father, He came with the Father. When the Son came, He did not come alone; He did not leave the Father in the heavens. In the day that Jesus was in the house of Simon the leper and Mary poured the precious ointment on Him (Matt. 26:6-7), He was the Son with the Father. God was embodied in Jesus because Jesus was the Son with the Father. If He were merely the Son and left the Father in the heavens when He came, He would not be the embodiment of God. But the Son was there with the Father as the embodiment of the Father, as the embodiment of God. He is the Son, He is the Father, and He is God.</P>
