<h1 class="msg">CHAPTER ONE HUNDRED SIXTY-TWO</h1><h1 class="title">SPIRITUAL REALITY&mdash;THREE VIEWS</h1><p class="indent1">(Editor's Note: This article is similar to the first part of "The Holy Spirit and Reality" in Volume 36 of The Collected Works. We have included this chapter in this volume because it contains some additional utterance.)</p><h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: John 4:23; 16:13; 3:5; 6:51-54; Matt. 26:26-29; 16:18-19; 18:17-18; Acts 13:2-4; Rom. 6:3-5; 1 Cor. 10:16-17; 11:24-25; Col. 2:11-12</h1><p>Christianity is not a combination of externalities. It is "the truth," that is, the reality. So much that is merely external has become associated with Christianity that it is difficult to discern what truly is of God today. Let us consider this vital question: What is of God? What is reality?</p><p>The Word of God tells us that the Holy Spirit is the Spirit of reality, and that He will lead us into all reality. Anything which can separate us from the leading of the Spirit is not reality. God is Spirit, and those who worship Him must worship Him in spirit. Outside the sphere of the Spirit, which is the sphere of God, there is no reality. Only that which is spiritual is real, and spiritual things can only subsist in the realm of the Spirit. If something is separated from the Spirit, it is dead. If we are to be brought into any spiritual reality, it can only be through our dependence on the Spirit of reality. Whatever we can arrive at by thought and study, by the seeing of the eyes and the hearing of the ears, is outside the realm of eternal verity; it is not the truth. In this light, let us briefly examine baptism, the Lord's supper, and the church. There are three different viewpoints regarding these: the materialistic viewpoint, the intellectual viewpoint, and the spiritual viewpoint. In other words, we might refer to these viewpoints as Romish, Reformist, and Christian.</p><h2 class="head1">THE MATERIALISTIC VIEWPOINT</h2><h2 class="head2">Baptism</h2><p>The materialist fixes his gaze on the water and insists that without material water there is no new birth. This begets the Romish doctrine of baptismal regeneration.</p><h2 class="head2">The Lord's Supper</h2><p>The materialist notes the word, "This is My body" (Matt. 26:26), and looking at the material bread, he insists that a change must take place in the bread so that it may be truly called Christ's body, because the Word is true. The result is the Romish doctrine of transubstantiation.</p><h2 class="head2">The Church</h2><p>The materialist sees the outward form of the church and sees in the Word that there is only one church. The result is the Romish doctrine of the one true church.</p><h2 class="head1">THE INTELLECTUAL VIEWPOINT</h2><p>The intellectual man is puzzled by the seeming inconsistency between the Word of God and so-called Christianity, so he brings his mind to bear on the problems that arise.</p><h2 class="head2">Baptism</h2><p>He says there is the true and the false, the real and the unreal, the outward ceremony and the inward reality. However, God makes no such distinctions in His Word.</p><h2 class="head2">The Lord's Supper</h2><p>The reformist says, "This represents the Lord's body; it is a symbol of His body." But the Word of God speaks of nothing concerning representation or symbolism; it speaks of literal fact. It says, "This is My body."</p><h2 class="head2">The Church</h2><p>The reformist solves the inconsistency that he observes by using his interpretation of true and false, real and unreal. Or he says, "There is a church within the church."</p>
