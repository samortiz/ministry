The opposite of eternal life is perdition, but the Bible does not regard salvation as the opposite of perdition
If you are on the world's side, no matter what kind of person you are, you are opposed to God, and you are God's enemy
Salvation, however, is not just a personal matter; it has to do with the corporate body to which you formerly belonged
The receiving of eternal life speaks of what one has entered into; it does not speak of what one has come out of
Most people pay much attention to their personal salvation, but the question before us is what are they saved from
He said, 'My work will never grow, because once a person believes in the Lord, he has to be sent away immediately
You need to confess before God and before men that you have come out and have nothing to do with that corporate body
Be baptized upon the name of Jesus Christ for the forgiveness of your sins, and you will receive the gift of the Holy Spirit'
If a person believes in his heart but does not have any outward gesture, the world will still consider him to be part of it
Recently, when we baptized some people in Foochow, a brother said, 'We do not like to conduct the baptism meeting in such a messy way
If this is the case, John the Baptist would have to learn from this brother because John conducted baptisms that were not that orderly
Eternal life is something that our spirit gains before God, but salvation is an act of our separation from the world
When we step into the water of baptism or when we look back after being believers for many years we must remember that we are already dead
In the murder spoken of above, the murderer apparently killed only the mother; he did not kill the two children
As soon as this gospel is preached to us, we should learn to look from God's viewpoint and acknowledge that we have died in the Lord
Reckoning in Romans 6 involves both reckoning oneself dead in Christ Jesus and reckoning oneself alive in Him as well
