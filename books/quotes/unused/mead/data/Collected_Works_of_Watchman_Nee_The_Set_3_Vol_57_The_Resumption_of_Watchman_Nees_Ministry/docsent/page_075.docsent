   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>FIRST HANDING OURSELVES OVER</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>AND THEN OUR MONEY</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>What we want is first you, and then yours.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>I am a priest, and I live for God.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>We care only for the fact of handing ourselves over, not for argument.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>We are not here for money; we are here to help others to hand themselves over.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>If a man does not hand himself over, it is meaningless to receive a few dollars from him; it is better to return the money to him.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>God would not be pleased with such money.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>In God's eyes money is not the main problem.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>A man hands over his money because he has first handed over himself.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>As a person you are more important than your money.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>When a person comes, what he has will come along with him.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>It is difficult to say this kind of thing to all the brothers and sisters in general.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>If you do not want to hand yourselves over, I will not say such words.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>But if you have handed yourselves over and I have handed myself over, then we can say such words.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>What we were not able to say among the co-workers for the past twenty years, we can say today.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Today we are standing on the same ground, and we are working and serving together.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>We are all the same, and we are all serving God together.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>We have to look to the Lord to bring all the saints in Shanghai into this practice.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Otherwise, our words of the last few days will result only in a few more consecrations.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>In another five days things will cool down again.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>This is indeed a serious matter.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>If we can bring the brothers and sisters into this practice, many tremendous things will follow.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>PAYING A SERIOUS PRICE</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>AND COORDINATING TOGETHER</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>During the past years all of us have suffered many dealings, made many sacrifices, borne much hardship, and paid much price.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>But the Lord is asking us to pay a higher price today.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Only by paying a serious price can we obtain serious results.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The Lord has no intention that the co-workers be the only ones to go through dealings and that the other brothers and sisters be exempt from dealings.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>It is difficult for the co-workers to be coordinated together.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>It is likewise difficult for the working brothers and sisters to be coordinated together.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>When two or three brothers go into business together, at the beginning they invariably say that they are doing this to glorify the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>But in the end the result is often a shame to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>However, if you hand yourselves over today, things will be different.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>This is not just a combination of capital, but a coordination of persons.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>One person can bring forth results a thousandfold, and two persons can bring forth results ten thousandfold.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>If the brothers will be faithful to the Lord in their jobs and if they are coordinated together, there will be the blessings.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>With such a purpose, center, ground, and goal, we can bring in the Lord's blessing.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>When there is any hardship, we try to solve it in coordination.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>When the co-workers are not coordinated, they can do their own isolated works.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>But when they are coordinated together, there is no more room for individual freedom.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The same principle applies to the brothers and sisters who are holding jobs.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Personally, I am most reluctant to do such things.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>But looking ahead, the Lord has His works.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Therefore, we have to take this inconvenience upon us and have such a beginning.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The co-workers and the responsible brothers should not try to avoid such an inconvenience.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>When we are doing our isolated works, we can be very comfortable.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>But in order for the Lord to have a way, we must be coordinated together.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>In the coordination, we have to accept all the inconveniences.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>If we do not do this, it will be difficult for the Lord to have a way among us.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>During the past four evenings, my words have been coming out like water gushing from an open tap.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Once the tap is opened, there is no more thought of closing it again.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>We do not know how far this water will carry us.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>It is not an easy thing for me to speak about these four topics.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>To speak about them is more difficult than to speak about forty other topics.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>In 1942 we prayed much for the Lord to have a way among us.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>I do not know how much we prayed.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>However, although we prayed very much, every time we felt that something was blocking.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Because of that something, we did not get through.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Now we have broken through the small circle.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>We will see if we can break through the larger circle.</S>
