   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>FOUR LAYERS OF BUILDING</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>We need to have the proper understanding of the building up of the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>First, according to Matthew 16:18, the Lord builds.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Then He builds through the gifted persons, the apostles, prophets, evangelists, and shepherds and teachers Eph 4:11 .</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>He then builds the church through us, the perfected saints v. 12 . These are three layers of building.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Eventually, the Body builds itself up v. 16 . This is the fourth layer.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>This is all by ministering Christ as the daily supply, as food, water, and breath.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>We cannot build the church.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>We can only minister Christ to others.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>When they are nourished with Christ as their supply, a spiritual metabolism within them transforms them into His image and makes them just Him.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Such a metabolic transformation is both the growth and the building up.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>This is the way the Lord Jesus builds us into the church.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>DAVID'S HOUSE BECOMING HIS SEED</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>This is the proper teaching of the New Testament; this is the proper way to build the proper church; and this is the very thing that Jehovah prophesied to David in typology in 2 Samuel 7 when He said that He would build David a house.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>This house is the seed of David.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Humanly speaking, we cannot explain how David's house could become David's seed.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The only way David's house could become his seed was by God in Christ becoming a man, the God-man.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Christ is the house, the seed, the life, and the food.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>He is everything.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Today we are cooperating with Him to build up God's habitation and David's habitation, a mutual abode.</S>
