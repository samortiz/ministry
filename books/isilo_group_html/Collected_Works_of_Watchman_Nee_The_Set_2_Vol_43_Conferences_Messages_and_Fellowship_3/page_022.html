His way is through the blood of the Lord Jesus. He sent the Lord to the earth, who put on the human body, died on the cross, and shed His blood for the redemption of our sins before God. Through the blood our sins before God are taken away, and our conscience is at peace (Heb. 9:14).</p><p>Once I went with a friend to Kiukiang for some business. We met a Moslem missionary on the way. My friend asked him what hope his faith afforded him. He said, "If a person is sorry for his sins, Allah in heaven (i.e., God) will forgive him, and he will go to heaven one day." My friend asked, "What will happen if a person sins again after repenting? After he repents, what happens to his sins?" The man could only respond, "God is not that strict. Once He sees that I have truly repented, He will consider the matter closed." My friend said to him, "Is your God so loose? My God is not that loose."</p><p>Repentance is one thing, and sin is another thing. Suppose I beat up Mr. Tang and suppose he has bruises all over his body. I may regret it later and feel guilty about beating him up, but his body will still be swollen from my beating. The fact will remain; it will not have gone away. Suppose you borrow a thousand dollars from someone and afterward regret it. Does this mean that the matter is over? No. Having regret is one thing, but your debt will still exist no matter how much regret you have. Likewise, God cannot forgive us by brushing aside our sins casually. God must punish the sins. After the sins have been punished, then they can be forgiven. Let me give you another illustration. Suppose someone was arrested by the governor, and suppose the governor sympathized with the person because that person had an eighty-year-old mother and a three-year-old child at home, and therefore decided to let him go. If the governor sympathizes with others in this way, he eventually will not be the governor, because the whole city will be full of robbers. If a person has violated the law, he should come under the verdict of the law. Even the governor has to submit to the law. Although he has the power to release you, it would make him unlawful to do so.</p><p>God wants to forgive our sins, but He has to maintain His righteousness. I have a friend whose father was the magistrate of a county for many years. In that county there were many bandits, and he used some of the public funds from the county to clean up the bandits. He spent three hundred thousand dollars of public funds. He did not take this money home. He only redirected the money from one place to another. Soon after, the government issued a warrant to arrest him, and he was going to be executed. Any civil servant who commits a fraud involving ten thousand dollars or more will be executed. Since my friend's father had taken so much more, he surely would be executed. He was actually the father of one of my co-workers. The co-worker was very anxious because her father was about to die. Since I knew several officials in the government, I felt that I needed to help. I wrote several letters to his superior and followed up personally with eight or nine visits to the government office. I gave the officials the guarantee that the co-worker's father did not take any money home and that he had not spent it for his own personal use. But they said to me, "Mr. Nee, we know the situation very well. We also want to help, but we cannot. We could let him go; we have the authority to do so. But it would not be proper procedure if we released him like that. We have to think of a way which is procedurally proper before we can let him go. Only in this way will we not violate the law ourselves." God wants to forgive our sins. However, He cannot get Himself into trouble for forgiving us. God charges us to observe the law, so He should also observe the law. He said to Adam, "In the day that thou eatest thereof thou shalt surely die" (Gen. 2:17). After Adam and Eve ate the fruit of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, God would have become a liar if He had told them that they did not need to die. We are sinners, and we may care very little about which method God uses to save us as long as we are saved. We think that He can forgive our sins or He can just let us go; we think that any method is sufficient. We are not concerned with righteousness or with the law, but God cannot be like this. In order for God to forgive our sins and save us, He must find a way that does not come into conflict with His nature, His righteousness, or His law. God cannot just let us go. This would make Him unrighteous. God cannot create a problem for Himself in the process of saving us.</p><p>A year ago there was a sister in Shanghai who was a head nurse at a hospital. She controlled all the drugs and medicine in the hospital. One day another sister came and talked to me about this sister. When I commented on how good she was, the other sister replied, "I do not think so. She is only an ordinary sister." I said, "But she loves the Lord, and she also bears a very good testimony in the hospital." She said, "Yes, but she does not know anything about righteousness. Two days ago my child was sick, and I did not have enough money to take him to the doctor. I brought the child to see this sister. She was very eager to give us all the help she could. She applied medicine on my child's wound and bandaged the wound carefully. I asked her how much I had to pay for the medicine. She would not take my money. Instead, she told me that the hospital had a great deal of drugs. She insisted on not taking my money. Eventually, I gave up and went home. Although she helped me, I still feel uneasy because the bandages and supplies belonged to the hospital. She cannot steal things from the hospital just because she wants to help me."</p><p>Likewise, if God were loose in the way He saved us, we would say to ourselves, "Even though You have saved man, You have violated the law." If a policeman catches someone who has violated the law, he cannot let him go on the way to the police station. Once we sin, we need to be punished and judged. If God does not punish us, He will become unrighteous.</p><p>What then should we do? Suppose Mr. Tang is a rich man, and I borrow ten thousand dollars from him, agreeing to repay him in twenty years. After twenty years suppose I go to Mr. Tang, saying, "I am now very poor; I cannot repay the debt. Please have mercy on me. Please forgive my debt and return the contract to me." He will say, "Twenty years ago we made an agreement that you would repay the loan. This is our contract, and it was signed by both of us. Twenty years have passed. If you do not repay the loan, I can only resolve the matter legally." I may say, "Please be merciful to me because I cannot afford to pay. Please give me back the contract!" Brothers and sisters, would this be right? Please remember that my failure to repay the loan has breached the agreement. It would also be a breach of the agreement if he did not ask for the money. If the debt is not resolved according to the proper procedure, both the debtor and the loaner have violated the law. The only difference is that one has violated the law in a bad way, while the other has violated the law in a more noble way.</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_021.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_023.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Collected Works of Watchman Nee, The (Set 2) Vol. 43: Conferences, Messages, and Fellowship (3) &nbsp; pg 22</div><br></body></html>
