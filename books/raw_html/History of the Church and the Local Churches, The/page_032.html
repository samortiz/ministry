<H2 CLASS=HEAD2>40. Breathing the Lord</H2><P>We also saw that we need to breathe in the Lord as the holy pneuma, the holy breath, the Holy Spirit.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>41. The Universal Prophesying</H2><P>In 1968 we saw that everyone has to prophesy. We can all prophesy one by one (1 Cor. 14:31).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>42. The Sevenfold Intensified Spirit</H2><P>The Lord showed us the sevenfold intensified Spirit in 1969 in Erie, Pennsylvania.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>43. Christ versus Religion</H2><P>In 1970 we saw the revelation of Christ versus religion in an international conference in Los Angeles, California.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>44. The Church as the New Man</H2><P>The Lord showed us clearly in 1970 that the church is not only the Body of Christ but also the new man.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>45. Christ as the Person of the Church</H2><P>In 1971 we saw the truth concerning Christ as our person.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>46. The Abolishing of the Ordinances</H2><P>Later we saw the truth concerning Christ's abolishing all the ordinances on the cross.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>CHRIST AND THE CHURCH</H2><P>The totality of the items listed above is Christ and the church, the great mystery. Christ is the content, and the church is the expression. In other words, Christ is our life within, and the church is our living without. The church is our daily living.</P><P>(Editor's note: A list of ten major items recovered from 1958 to 1989 can be found in The Present Advance of the Lord's Recovery, pp. 8-9.)</P>
