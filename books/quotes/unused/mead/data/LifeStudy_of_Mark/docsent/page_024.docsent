   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>The Humanity and Deity of the Slave-Savior</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In this incident we see both the humanity and the deity of the Slave-Savior.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>When the Lord referred to the paralytic as a child, the Lord conducted Himself in a very human manner.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The Lord addressed him in an intimate way, in a way full of human kindness.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>But when the Lord told the paralytic to rise, take up his bed, and go home, He manifested His deity.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Therefore, the Lord s deity was manifested in His humanity.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>His humanity was full of virtue, and His deity was full of authority.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The Lord s glory seen here was the expression of His authority.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The Lord s word to the sick man to rise, pick up his bed, and go home was not a word of teaching; it was a word of authority.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>This word was confirmed by the fact that the paralytic then received the ability, the energy to rise, pick up his bed, and walk.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>All those gathered there saw the Lord s authority, glory, and honor.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Therefore, in this case we see the Lord s humanity displayed in its virtue and perfection and His deity manifested in its glory and honor.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>When the paralytic picked up his bed and walked away, the mouths of the opposers, the scribes and the Pharisees, were shut.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>They were put to silence by the Lord s authority in His deity and also by His kindness in His humanity.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Here we see a slave; yet in Him God is manifested.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Because many saw the Lord s deity manifested in His humanity, they followed Him.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>HELPING OTHERS HAVE THEIR SINS FORGIVEN</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>According to the incident in 2:1-12, the first thing we must learn in our preaching of the gospel is to help others have their sins forgiven.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>It is significant that the Lord did not say to the paralytic, I am sorry that you are sick.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>But I want you to know that this sickness comes from sin.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Because you are paralyzed, you must have sinned in some way.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>You know what sins you have committed.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>If the Lord had preached to the paralytic like this, he may have argued with Him, saying, No, I have always been a good person.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>I have been kind to others.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>But suddenly I became paralyzed.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>We should learn of the Lord Jesus not to argue with others concerning their sins.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>That will only stir up their anger and cause them not to care for what we have to say.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>We should follow the Lord Jesus to tell people that their sins are forgiven.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Of course, this does not mean that we should literally repeat the words, Your sins are forgiven.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>My point is that we need to follow the principle seen here.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>When we approach people for the preaching of the gospel, we need to be inwardly praying.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>However, we should not let them know that we are praying.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Then the Lord may lead us to say something like this: Dear friends, only the Lord Jesus, as the Son of God and our Redeemer, has the authority, power, and ability to forgive our sins.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Instead of saying your sins, we should say our sins.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The Lord could speak of your sins because He was not a sinner.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>We, however, must include ourselves, for we know that we too are sinners.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>This means that we should not tell people that they are sinful.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Instead, we should tell them that only the Lord has the ability to forgive us our sins.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>We may go on to say, In our human life, all troubles and problems come from our sins.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>We need to have our sins forgiven, and only the Lord Jesus has the authority to do this.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>If we present the gospel to others in the proper way, the Holy Spirit will honor our speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Then those who listen to us will be deeply impressed with the word that only the Lord Jesus can forgive our sins.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The result is that this word concerning forgiveness will be sown into them as the seed of the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Another way to help people experience the forgiveness of sins is to read Mark 2:1-12 with them in a living way.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>We may take out a pocket version of the Gospel of Mark and read it in a prevailing way in order to impress others with the fact that only the Lord Jesus can forgive a person s sins.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Then we may help them see that peace comes as the result of having our sins forgiven.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>According to the sequence of the cases in 2:1 3:6, the first way to carry out the preaching of the gospel is to help others have their sins forgiven.</S>
