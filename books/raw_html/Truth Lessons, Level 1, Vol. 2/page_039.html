<h2 class="head2">C. His Breathing into the Disciples<br />in Resurrection</h2><p>On the night of His resurrection the Lord Jesus came to the disciples and breathed Himself, the resurrected Christ, the pneumatic Christ, as breath into them (John 20:22). This breath was the holy breath, the Holy Spirit. He, as the Christ in resurrection, is the Spirit (2 Cor. 3:17), so He could breathe Himself as the life-giving Spirit (1 Cor. 15:45b) into the disciples as their divine life and essence. Such a Christ who passed through death, entered into resurrection, and became the Spirit as the ultimate consummation of the Triune God, breathed Himself into the disciples to be with them forever.</p><h2 class="head2">D. His Presence with the Disciples<br />in Resurrection</h2><p>After the Lord Jesus breathed Himself as the Spirit into the believers in resurrection, He was in them to be with them. This was His invisible presence with them, unlike His visible presence when He was in the flesh. After His resurrection, He appeared again and again to the disciples (Acts 1:3). His appearings and disappearings were to train them to know and experience His invisible presence. As the pneumatic Christ in them, His invisible presence was eternal (John 14:16).</p><h2 class="head1">II. HIS ASCENSION</h2><p>After His resurrection the Lord Jesus appeared to the disciples for forty days. Then, on Mount Olivet outside the city of Jerusalem, He was taken up in a cloud before the eyes of the disciples (Acts 1:9-11).</p><h2 class="head2">A. Ascending above All the Heavens</h2><p>In His ascension Christ ascended above all the heavens (Eph. 4:10) to the height of the universe (Eph. 4:8), far above all in the universe (Eph. 1:21) through the surpassingly great power of God (Eph. 1:19).</p><h2 class="head2">B. To Fill All Things</h2><p>Christ was God in heaven (John 3:13); then, He came to the earth as a God-man (1 Tim. 1:15; John 1:14), died in humanity with divinity, went down into Hades (Acts 2:31b), the depths of the earth (Eph. 4:9), was resurrected and came out of Hades with divinity and humanity, came back to the earth, and ascended above all the heavens that He might fill all things (Eph. 4:10) and be the One who fills all in all (Eph. 1:23). This shows that His breadth and length and height and depth are immeasurable (Eph. 3:18).</p><h2 class="head2">C. Sitting Down on the Right Hand<br />of the Majesty on High</h2><p>After Christ ascended to the heavens, He was seated on the right hand of God, the Majesty on high (Psa. 110:1a; Heb. 1:3b). This indicates that He has finished His redemptive work on the earth and can thus sit down (Heb. 10:11-12), and also that He has overcome His enemies and is now sitting, waiting for God to make His enemies the footstool for His feet (Psa. 110:1b; Heb. 10:13; 1 Cor. 15:24-25).</p><h2 class="head2">D. Enthroned and Crowned</h2><p>When Christ ascended above all the heavens and sat down on the right hand of the Majesty on high, He was given to sit on the throne of God&rsquo;s dominion (Rev. 3:21) to rule over and administrate the universe for God. Moreover, He was crowned with glory and honor (Heb. 2:9). Glory refers to the splendor related to Christ&rsquo;s person; honor refers to the preciousness of His worth and the dignity of His position.</p>
