   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>NO RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>RELIGIOUS FOUNDERS AND THEIR CREEDS</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The above cannot apply to all other religions.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>You can be a devotee of other religions, abiding by their every creed, without having anything to do with the founders themselves.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>In arithmetic, there is a table called the multiplication table.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>You can find the product of any two numbers from one to nine from the table.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Everything is arranged neatly.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Do you know who formulated this table?</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>I am afraid that millions who use this table never know who made it.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>But you can use this table without knowing the person who made it.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>All common religions are like this: you need not have anything to do with their founders, but you can apply their doctrines.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The doctrines and those who preached them have no relationship with each other.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>In Kaifeng I met a foreign missionary.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>He had heard my preaching.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>I discovered that he was related to the doctrines of Christ but not to Christ Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>He told one of my former classmates, who is also now my co-worker, how to practice the teachings of Christ and expound the theologies in the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>My co-worker asked him, "Can you touch people by these?</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Has anybody repented, forsaken his sins, and had his life changed by your preaching?</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Do you have such power?"</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>He was dumbfounded by my co-worker's words.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>THE GEM OF THE DOCTRINES IS CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The source of our faith is Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>If we have no relationship with Christ, we have no power.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The doctrines of Christ are absolutely joined to Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The gem of the doctrines lies in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>It is useless to merely infer and discuss in an outward way.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Let us now look at the book of Romans in the New Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>I will not give many explanations.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Rather, I will merely present the facts to you.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>We want to see what the Bible says.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Romans 3:22, 24: "Even the righteousness of God through the faith of Jesus Christ to all those who believe, for there is no distinction;...being justified freely by His grace through the redemption which is in Christ Jesus."</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>These verses say that a man receives forgiveness of sins and justification before God by the redemption of Christ Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>They are based on a relationship with Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Without redemption, the sins of man cannot be forgiven.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>THROUGH JESUS CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Romans 5:1: "Therefore having been justified out of faith, we have peace toward God through our Lord Jesus Christ."</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Verse 2: "Through whom also we have obtained access by faith into this grace in which we stand and boast because of the hope of the glory of God."</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Verse 10: "For if we, being enemies, were reconciled to God through the death of His Son, much more we will be saved in His life, having been reconciled."</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Verse 11: "And not only so, but also boasting in God through our Lord Jesus Christ, through whom we have now received the reconciliation."</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Everything that we have received, such as justification, reconciliation, standing in grace, salvation, joy in God, etc., is received through Jesus Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Simply by going through Him, we inherit all these.</S>
