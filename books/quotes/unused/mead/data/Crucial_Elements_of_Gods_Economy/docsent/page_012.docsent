   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Caring Only for Christ</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Rather Than Religion or Legality</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Some brothers and sisters are crazy lovers of Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>They do not care for movies, bars, or dancing; they care only for Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Day and night they do nothing but pursue Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>At home, at school, and everywhere they care only for Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>As branches in the vine, they do nothing but live the vine.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>As branches of Christ, we should do nothing but live Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Another Christian may try to discourage such crazy lovers of Jesus, saying, You do not need to be so religious, caring for nothing but Christ all the time.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>To go to the Lord s Day morning meeting every week is to be religious.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>It is better to stay in bed.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Such speaking has been heard even in some local churches.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Some even say, The more you sleep in the morning, the more spiritual you will become.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Others say, You do not need to be so legal.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>You are bound by a legality to not go to the movies.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Not all movies are bad; some movies are very good.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>You need to be liberated to go to the good movies.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>If someone speaks to us in this way, we need to be clear that this person is sent not by God but by God s enemy.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Both going to the Lord s Day morning meeting and not going may be legalities.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>We should not care for either legality; rather, we should care only for Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>However, it is doubtful that we can receive more of Christ by sleeping in on Lord s Day morning.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>If we care only for Christ, we will rise up early in the morning to contact the Lord and prepare to meet with His church.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Likewise, if we care only for Christ, we will see that we certainly cannot receive more of Christ by going to a movie.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Attending sporting events may not be sinful, but our experience tells us that we do not receive more of Christ by going to sporting events.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>We should not care for whether something is legal or not.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>We should not care for any particular ways or concepts.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>We should care only for Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>We need to go only where we can receive more of Christ, and we need to take only the way by which we will receive more of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Some young people recently asked me concerning a certain kind of speaking they heard.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Some saints told them not to go to movies, but others said, Do not be so legal; go to the movies.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Some also told them not to be religious by always coming to the Lord s Day morning meeting, but others told them that they needed to come.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>I explained to the young people, Religion is to serve or worship God without Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>In other words, anything we do for God apart from Christ is religion.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Anything that has Christ in it is not religion.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>To go to a Lord s Day morning meeting without Christ is religion, but to stay home on Lord s Day morning to try to be spiritual or liberated without Christ also is religion.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>What matters is not whether we go to the meeting or stay home but whether we do all things with Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>It is not a matter of what we should or should not do; it is a matter of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>When we contact Christ, live Christ, grow Christ, and produce Christ, Christ surely will not lead us to a theater, a bar, or a dancing club.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>However, we cannot assume that Christ is in a certain thing simply because it is practiced in the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>If we shout in the meetings without Christ, our shouting is not the Lord s recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>If our singing is void of Christ, our singing is only a musical activity, not the Lord s recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Every bit of everything in the Lord s recovery must be Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>We do not care for any way or any concept; we care only for Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>If a brother is weak, he may occasionally slip into a theater to see a movie, but he should not promote this activity.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>We should preach only Christ, not our private life and certainly not our weaknesses.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Going to movies is a sign of weakness in one s Christian life.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>I believe that a saint who is strong in life would refrain from going to a movie theater, even if only to avoid the appearance of sin.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>We may go to a movie out of weakness, but we should never promote this, make this a teaching, or bring this into the church as a practice, telling others that to go to the movies is a liberation.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>I know of many young people who have been influenced by this kind of teaching.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>In our conscience we know that this is not liberation but looseness.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>We need to realize that any kind of looseness may lead to the indulgence of lust.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Caring Only for Christ in Our Way of Meeting</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>A dissenting concept is held by some who say that the church should not meet in large general meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>They think that it is better to have small family-style meetings in the homes.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Concepts always damage.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>We should not care about the kind of meetings we have; we should care only for Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>If we would like to have some saints meet in our home, and if we have the assurance that Christ is in this, we should simply do it.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>However, we should not promote it.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>If we promote it, we will make trouble.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Everyone has different opinions.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Certain kinds of meetings suit certain people s personal preferences.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>To insist on meeting in a certain way is to mix Christ with our preference or taste.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>In a meeting that we have insisted on according our taste, our conscience will tell us that our enjoyment of Christ is not pure.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>If we would bring all things to the Lord and pray without insisting on anything, I believe that the Lord will tell us, You may have this kind of meeting, but do not insist on it.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>We need to consider whether our motive is pure.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>If our motive is purely for Christ without our preference, any kind of meeting is good.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>The Lord s recovery is not to recover big meetings or to recover small meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>All the ways and concepts must be buried.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>In the Lord s recovery we care only for Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>We care only for wherever, whenever, and however we can receive more of Christ and minister Christ to others, not for our concepts, opinions, or personal tastes.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Everything must be Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Everyone prefers his way, but no way is the right way.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Only Christ is right.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>Our purpose is not to recover a certain way of meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>We should not care for any way of meeting; we should care only for whether Christ is in our meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>This is the major object.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>If we drop our teachings, our concepts, our ways, and our activities, we will have the genuine oneness.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>If some insist on having a certain kind of meeting according to their concept, this will cause division.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>We should not hold on to any concept.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>If some brothers feel to meet in their homes, we should not oppose them, but neither should they impose or promote their kind of meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>To promote our concept only causes trouble.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>Caring Only for Christ in the Speaking and Singing in the Meetings</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>A brother may not be eloquent, but his awkward speaking in a meeting may be full of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>Another brother who is very eloquent may capture the attention of the whole congregation after only two sentences, but there may not be much of Christ in his speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>Rather, his speaking may be full of his personal influence and impact.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>Regrettably, many saints prefer the speaking of an eloquent brother because it is full of excitement.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>We need to see that such speaking without Christ is vanity.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>We may experience excitement during such speaking, but when we go home, nothing goes with us.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>However, after listening to an awkward brother speak for a few minutes, something of Christ may be wrought into us.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>Even if we shake our head at his poor words, we can never shake away the Christ he ministers into us.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>Years later, the Christ ministered through this awkward brother will still be in us.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>The Lord s recovery is not concepts, ways, doctrines, practices, eloquence, or activities, but only Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>I enjoy hearing beautiful singing in the meetings, but if we care mainly for the music in a meeting, we have fallen back to the condition of degraded Christianity.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>I would rather hear simple singing that is full of Christ, singing that is sincere and with the exercise of the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>The Lord s recovery is not the recovery of good singing, good meetings, shouting, or excitement.</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>The Lord s recovery is the recovery purely, wholly, and uniquely of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>Everything must be Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='98' RSNT='1' SNO='98'>We should not care for beautiful musical voices or instruments.</S>
   <S PAR='99' RSNT='1' SNO='99'>If we care for the proper singing from our spirit, even if our voices are off key, our singing is still precious to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='100' RSNT='1' SNO='100'>DROPPING EVERYTHING BUT CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='101' RSNT='1' SNO='101'>The Lord s recovery today is absolutely different from Christianity.</S>
   <S PAR='102' RSNT='1' SNO='102'>Christianity is composed of various concepts, ways, activities, and organizations.</S>
   <S PAR='103' RSNT='1' SNO='103'>In the Lord s recovery we do not have any concepts, ways, activities, or organizations; instead, all we have is Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='104' RSNT='1' SNO='104'>Every letter and every word of our language is Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='105' RSNT='1' SNO='105'>We have nothing but Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='106' RSNT='1' SNO='106'>We do not care for different ways of meeting, singing, or releasing our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='107' RSNT='1' SNO='107'>We care only for Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='108' RSNT='1' SNO='108'>In the church life Christ is all and in all Col 3:10-11 .</S>
   <S PAR='109' RSNT='1' SNO='109'>By the Lord s mercy and grace, we need to drop all our concepts.</S>
   <S PAR='110' RSNT='1' SNO='110'>We should not bring in any concept, whether good or bad, right or wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='111' RSNT='1' SNO='111'>We must keep only Christ so that we may come together to have the church life as a living testimony of Jesus shining in this dark society.</S>
   <S PAR='112' RSNT='1' SNO='112'>This is the Lord s recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='113' RSNT='1' SNO='113'>Throughout the past fifty years of the Lord s recovery, we have never promoted any way.</S>
   <S PAR='114' RSNT='1' SNO='114'>We care only for a living person, Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='115' RSNT='1' SNO='115'>Christ is our singing and our way to meet.</S>
   <S PAR='116' RSNT='1' SNO='116'>He is the gospel and also our way to preach the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='117' RSNT='1' SNO='117'>Christ is our life, our living, and our conversation.</S>
   <S PAR='118' RSNT='1' SNO='118'>Christ is everything in our Christian life and church life.</S>
   <S PAR='119' RSNT='1' SNO='119'>The Lord s recovery is the recovery of Christ as everything to us so that we may have the proper church life and the genuine oneness, both of which are simply Christ Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='120' RSNT='1' SNO='120'>Only when we live Christ and drop all the different teachings and concepts can we have the genuine oneness, which is the very Christ whom we are living.</S>
   <S PAR='121' RSNT='1' SNO='121'>I hope that this word will help us to be clear concerning the Lord s recovery.</S>
