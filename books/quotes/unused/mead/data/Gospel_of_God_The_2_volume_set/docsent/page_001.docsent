   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>As has become manifest to Christian readers throughout the earth, Brother Watchman Nee was especially entrusted by the Lord with the burden to help the believers in the truth of God's full salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In the spring of 1937 Watchman Nee delivered a series of twenty-six messages on the basic truths of the gospel of God to the church in Shanghai, China.</S>

   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The matters covered are comprehensive, ranging from man's sinful condition before salvation to his destiny in the coming age.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In the first volume, Watchman Nee presents the particulars of God's salvation, that is, man's sins; God's love, grace, and mercy; the nature of grace; the function of the law and God's righteousness; the work of Christ and of the Holy Spirit in God's salvation; and faith as the way of salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>In the second volume, he covers in detail the issues of eternal security of salvation and God's way of dealing with the believer's sins both in this age and in the age to come.</S>

   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>These messages demonstrate the Lord's commission to our brother and His equipping of him with the revelation in His Word.</S>
