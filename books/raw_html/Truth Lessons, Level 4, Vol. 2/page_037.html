	 <h2 class="head3">3. God&rsquo;s People Needing a Proper View</h2>
<p>All God&rsquo;s people need to see the controlling vision in the second chapter of Daniel and, in the light of this vision, have a clear view regarding human government. In the eyes of human beings, there are different kinds of governments; some are good, and others are bad. However, according to Daniel 2 and 7, in the eyes of God every human government is a beast. Babylon, Medo-Persia, Greece, and the Roman Empire are beasts. We need to see such a vision. If God&rsquo;s people see this controlling vision, they will be kept from the world and prepared for Christ&rsquo;s coming.</p>
<h2 class="head2">B. The Vision<br />
concerning the Four Beasts out of<br />
the Mediterranean Sea</h2>
<p>In Nebuchadnezzar&rsquo;s dream human government on the earth was signified by a great human image full of glory and splendor. In chapter 7, however, it was unveiled to God&rsquo;s prophet, Daniel, that the heads of human government on the earth, and the governments themselves, are signified by four great, fierce, cruel, and inhuman beasts.</p>
<h2 class="head3">1. The First Beast</h2>
<p>The first beast (v. 4) corresponds to the head of gold of the great human image in 2:36 through 38 and signifies Babylon with its founder and king, Nebuchadnezzar. The beast was like a lion&mdash;the king of the beasts, the most fierce and cruel beast. It had the wings of an eagle. The eagle is the king of the fowls. The eagle wings signify that the beast was in the air, which belongs to Satan, the ruler of the air, and that its move was swift.</p>
<h2 class="head3">2. The Second Beast</h2>
<p>The second beast (7:5) corresponds to the breast and arms of silver of the great human image in 2:32 and 39 and signifies Medo-Persia. This beast resembled a bear. This signifies that it was not as strong and swift as the lion but that it was still fierce and cruel. It raised up its body on one side, signifying that Media and Persia became one dominion. Three ribs were in its mouth between its teeth. This signifies that three kingdoms, Babylon, Assyria, and Egypt, were devoured by it. The second beast was commanded to arise and devour much flesh. This signifies that it would devour more nations.</p>
<h2 class="head3">3. The Third Beast</h2>
<p>The third beast (7:6) corresponds to the abdomen and thighs of bronze of the great human image in 2:32 and 39 and signifies Greece with its king, Alexander the Great. The third beast was like a leopard. This indicates that it was fierce, cruel, and swift. It had four wings of a bird on its back. This signifies that by means of his four generals, Alexander the Great was as swift as a bird with four wings. This beast had four heads, signifying that the four wings for swiftness became four heads, four generals who became the heads of four kingdoms. After the death of Alexander the Great, his four generals divided his empire into four kingdoms. The third beast was given dominion, signifying that it was given authority to rule over the nations.</p>
<h2 class="head3">4. The Fourth Beast</h2>
<p>The fourth beast (7:7-8) is the beast revealed in Revelation 13:1-2. This beast corresponds to the legs of iron and the feet, partly of iron and partly of clay, of the great human image in Daniel 2:40-43, signifying the Roman Empire. As signified by iron, the fourth beast was dreadful and frightful and exceedingly strong. It had large iron teeth and claws of bronze, and it devoured, crushed, and trampled under the remainder (7:19). This signifies that it had great power to devour and crush nations and trampled down the nations that remained. This beast had ten horns. A small horn came up among the ten horns, and three of them were uprooted from before it (vv. 8, 24). This signifies that a king will come up among the ten kings, and he will subdue three of the kings. This is a prophecy concerning the rising up of Antichrist.</p>
<p>Daniel said that this horn had eyes like the eyes of a man and a mouth speaking great things (vv. 8, 20, 25). This signifies that Antichrist will have sharp insight to perceive things and a mouth to speak great things against God (Rev. 13:5-6). Daniel prophesied that Antichrist will be slain and that his body will be destroyed and given to the burning fire (Dan. 7:11; Rev. 19:20). Antichrist will wage war with the saints. He will wear out the saints of the Most High for three and a half years and prevail against them (Dan. 7:21, 25; Rev. 13:7). His intention will even be to change the times and the law (Dan. 7:25). But he will be judged by God, and his dominion will be taken away, &ldquo;so as to annihilate and destroy it unto the end&rdquo; (v. 26). According to 7:22 and 27 the kingdom and the dominion and the greatness of the kingdoms under heaven will eventually be given to the saints of the Most High.</p>
