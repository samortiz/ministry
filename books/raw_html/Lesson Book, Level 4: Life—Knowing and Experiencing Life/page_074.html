<h2 class=head2>D. A City of Light</h2><p>The New Jerusalem is a city of light. God is the light and the Lamb is the lamp. The Triune God shines in this city. Everyone in this city lives and walks by the light of life from God. It exposes, leads, and guides. There is no darkness in this city.<h2 class=head2>E. A City of Fruit-bearing</h2><p>The New Jerusalem is a city of fruit-bearing. The tree of life bears twelve fruits. The tree of life is a very fruitful tree. It bears not only one fruit but twelve fruits, yielding its fruit each month. This indicates life in abundance.<h2 class=head2>F. A City of Oneness</h2><p>The New Jerusalem is a city of oneness. Although there are twelve gates, there is only one street, one river, one tree, one throne, and one nature—gold (the divine nature). People of different nations, tribes, and tongues from all four corners of the earth come into the city, and find only oneness there. All their backgrounds, cultures, and differences are forsaken for the oneness. There is no division, no confusion, and no separation. There is only oneness.<h2 class=head2>G. A City of Blessing</h2><p>The New Jerusalem is a city of blessing. In the New Jerusalem is the three-fold blessing of the Triune God. We enjoy the creating God, the redeeming Lamb and the regenerating Spirit.<h2 class=head2>H. A City of Transformed Men</h2><p>The New Jerusalem is a city of transformed men. Man was made of clay. After regeneration and transformation, man becomes precious stone, as a jasper stone, clear as crystal. Originally man was opaque; here man is clear as crystal, due to the transformation of the Spirit through His fellowship.<h2 class=head2>I. A City of the Expression of God</h2><p>The New Jerusalem is a city of the expression of God. Revelation 4:3 tells us that the One sitting on the throne has the appearance of jasper. The wall of the New Jerusalem also has the appearance of a jasper stone. The people of God have grown in life to full maturity; therefore, they have the expression of God.<h2 class=head2>J. A City of the Dominion of God</h2><p>The New Jerusalem is a city of the dominion of God. Not only is God reigning on His throne, all the people of God are reigning in life.<p>The New Jerusalem is the fulfillment of God’s eternal purpose accomplished through God’s economy. Through the dispensing of the processed Triune God as life into His chosen, created, fallen, redeemed, and regenerated people, they became mingled with Him and transformed to have His same image. They, together in oneness, express all that He is in life and reign with Him and for Him over the whole universe for eternity. Amen! Hallelujah! This is the ultimate consummation of the experience of life and growth of life. We rejoice that this is our eternal destiny!<h2 class=head2>Questions</h2><ol class="decimal"><li>What is God’s two-fold intention in creating man?</li><li>As Christians, what is the standard we need to reach? In your experience, have you reached this standard? If so, give an example; if not, pray to the Lord for His mercy and grace that you may reach it.</li><li>Give a summary of the three issues of life.</li><li>Make two lists:		<ol class="none">	<li>1) covering all the items related to the reward for the overcoming Christians;</li> 	<li>2) covering all the items related to the punishment of the defeated Christians. Memorize a verse that corresponds to the key items on each list.</li>	</ol></li><li>What is the final and ultimate issue of life, and what are its constituents?</li></ol><h2 class=head2>Quoted Portions from (Lee/LSM) Publications</h2><ol class="decimal"><li>The Experience of Life, pp. 348-350.</li></ol>
