   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>We need to contact people in the principle of incarnation.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>According to this principle, God and man live together, speak together, and do everything together as one.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>If we contact people in this kind of living way, they will see in us a living expression of the reality of God's New Testament economy.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Whenever we speak to people, we should always minister something real of Christ to them.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>We should never give them any impression of any kind of involvement with any kind of religious formality.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Many people today are seeking after God, but they do not want to be involved in organized Christianity.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>They want something real, something living, and something vital.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>If we minister something real of Christ to them, the seeking unbelievers and the seeking Christians will be attracted.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>They will be attracted and they will be gained by our vitality.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Today people will not be gained in any other way.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>This is the unique way for the Lord to gain people today.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>In our contacting of people, we should not expect to have a quick result.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Rather, we should set a definite goal with a strong determination to gain at least one remaining fruit yearly, with inexhaustible patience and unceasing intercession.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>In 1986 and 1987 thousands of people were saved and baptized in a quick way in Taipei and Orange County, but not many of them have remained to become living members of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>In recent years, because we still expected a quick result and did not see that kind of result, many of us became discouraged and dormant regarding the contacting of people.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>This shows that we do not have the proper concept concerning the way to gain the increase.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>To gain the proper increase through the practice of the vital groups, our concept needs to be revolutionized.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>We need to see and practice the way of fruit-bearing revealed in John 15.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The real fruit-bearing in the Christian life is just like the vine.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The vine does not bear fruit every day or many times a year.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The vine bears fruit only once a year and only in a particular season.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The fruit-bearing by the vine is both yearly and seasonal.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>As the living branches of Christ, the true vine, we should bear remaining fruit once a year.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>According to John 15:16, we have been chosen by the Lord and set by Him to go forth and bear remaining fruit.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Fruit-bearing is our destiny, and to bear remaining fruit every year must be our definite goal with a strong determination.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>However, in order to do this, we must not be loose or idle.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Before the season for fruit-bearing comes, the vine tree is not idle.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>On the contrary, it is producing the fruit.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>While we are waiting for the season to come, we need to produce the fruit.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>We need to live a certain kind of life.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>First, we need to abide in the Lord through unceasing prayer in intimate fellowship with Him vv.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>4-5 .</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>To abide in the Lord is to live in the Lord under all kinds of suffering.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The vine suffers for many months before the season comes to bear fruit.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Like the vine, we should expect to bear fruit only in season and through much suffering.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Second, in order to bear remaining fruit, we need to labor diligently and pray desperately and unceasingly.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>We should exercise ourselves to always have two or three persons under our care so that one of these could be remaining fruit at the end of a year.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>As we labor on these people, we should not be anxious or be in a hurry concerning their progress.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Instead, as we labor on them, we should enjoy Christ as our inexhaustible patience.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>We must keep in mind that the vital groups need to gain the proper increase through much prayer and labor.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>As we pray for people, we should not be discouraged or disappointed but should have the full assurance that at the proper time the Lord will answer our prayer and fulfill His word to us.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>If we live properly prior to the season of fruit-bearing, we can be assured that at the end of every year we will have one or two as remaining fruit.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>This is the God-ordained way of fruit-bearing.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>May the Lord carry this out fully in all the vital groups.</S>
