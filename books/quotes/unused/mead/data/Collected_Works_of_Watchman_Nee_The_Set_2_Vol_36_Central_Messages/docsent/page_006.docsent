   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>III.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>WHEN DID CHRIST BEGIN TO LIVE IN US?</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Only Christ has the overcoming life.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>When did Christ begin to live in us?</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>When we were saved, we received Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>"He who has the Son has the life" 1 John 5:12 .</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>"But as many as received Him, to them He gave the authority to become children of God, to those who believe into His name" John 1:12 .</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>At the time we believed, we received Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Second Corinthians 13:5 says, "Or do you not realize about yourselves that Jesus Christ is in you, unless you are disapproved?"</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Who are those who are not disapproved?</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>"Him who comes to Me I shall by no means cast out" John 6:37 .</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Have we come to the Lord?</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Yes.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Since we have come to the Lord, we are not disapproved.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>What do we have?</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>We have Jesus Christ in us.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>It is wrong if anyone says that, even though we have believed in the Lord, we do not have Christ within, and therefore, need to receive Christ again.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>If one is not saved, he should receive Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>But if he has been saved, Christ is already living in him.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>IV.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>HOW TO HAVE CHRIST LIVING HIS LIFE OUT OF US</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>We know that only Christ can overcome, we know that Christ lives in us, and we know that when we believe in the Lord we have Christ, but day after day we still remain the same.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Nothing changes at all.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>How can Christ live out His life in us?</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>There are two ways or two conditions:</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>A. We Must Surrender</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>It is true that Christ is in us, but if we do not allow Him to work, He will not do anything.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>We must submit to God.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>What does it mean to surrender?</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>To surrender is not promising God to do His will or doing good; it is not covenanting with God to do what we cannot.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>To surrender is to take our hands off our lives and to hand over both our good and evil, our capabilities and shortcomings, our past and future, our problems, our lives, and ourselves totally to God, and to solely allow Him to operate in us.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>If you do not take your hands off, God has no way to live His life out of you.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Suppose you give someone a book, but your hands do not let go of the book.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The person has no way to possess your book.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>You should come before God and say to Him, "I will give You all my good and evil, likes and dislikes, willingness and unwillingness, successes and failures."</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Are you willing to do this?</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>If you are not willing to do even this, God has no way to operate in you.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>It is your responsibility to hand over your failing self to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Today God only wants you to hand over your sinful self to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>To surrender does not mean that God wants you to do something you cannot do.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>He only wants you to hand over your good and evil and merits and defects to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>I read a story about a young man who said, "I am willing to do everything, but there is one thing that I am not willing to do.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>If God asks me to preach to a Catholic, I cannot do it."</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Brothers and sisters, are you willing to hand over your unwilling heart to Him?</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>There are two kinds of surrender: one is to consecrate to God for His use, and the other is to consecrate to God for His operation.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Many think that surrendering is just consecrating to God for His use.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Brothers and sisters, God requests one thing of us: to henceforth give ourselves to God.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>This is the meaning of putting the self to death and being delivered from our flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>We must hand over ourselves to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Are we willing to do this?</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>If we are willing, we will overcome.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>It is very difficult to take your hands off the persons or things that you love.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>I can say plainly that it is truly a very difficult thing to do.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Whenever a price is too high in your eyes, you become very unwilling to let go.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Suppose you always fail in the matter of friendship.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>It is very difficult to say to God, "No matter what will happen to my friends, I give them all to You.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Deliver me from this friendship."</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Let me give you another example.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Suppose you pray for a sick person who is not related to you.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>It is easy for you to believe that God will help him.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Even though no one helps him and no one comes to his aid, you are not concerned.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>But if your parents, wife, or husband is sick, it is very difficult for you to commit them to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>When no one comes to help them or cure them, you are afraid that they will die.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>This shows that those you love the most are the hardest for you to take your hands off of.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Today God does not want us to do good.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>He just wants us to give everything to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>We have already had enough failure to chill our heart.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>I had a sin which I was not able to overcome until a few months ago.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>I tried to hand it over to God but lacked the faith.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>I tried once, twice, three times, even many times, but everything remained the same.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Eventually, I simply gave the matter to God.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Today we do not need to care about anything else.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>We only need to ask if we are willing to commit ourselves completely into the hands of God.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>If there is anything that we cannot let go of, whether a person, the world, a sin, or a certain matter, all we have to do is say to the Lord, "Lord, I give You whatever I am not willing to let go of.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>I ask You to operate in me until I am willing to let go."</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>It does not worry me if you are not willing to let go of a person.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>It does not worry me if you are a hundred times weaker than you were before, and it does not worry me if you commit more sins.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>The only thing that worries me is that you may not be willing to give yourself to God's operation.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>Are you willing to commit to God your loved ones, a certain sin, a certain difficulty, or a certain matter that is not pleasing to God?</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>It does not matter if you have a thousand or a million weaknesses and failures.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>But are you willing to say to God, "God, I commit everything to You"?</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>To surrender is not a matter of taking some bitter pill and suffering to death.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>To surrender is just allowing God to operate in us until we become willing.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>To surrender does not require that we do what we cannot do.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>It only requires us to place ourselves in the hand of God, to let God work until we become submissive and are willing to forego everything.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>As long as we are willing, God will have a way.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>God does not worry how great our sin is and how corrupted we are; God is only concerned that we do not put our heart into His hand.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>In brief, surrender is just the submission of our will.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>It is to commit ourselves to God's hand, and to allow Him to work to His satisfaction.</S>
