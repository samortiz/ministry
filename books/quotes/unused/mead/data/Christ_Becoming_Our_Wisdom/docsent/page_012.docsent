   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Christ Becoming Our Redemption</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Not only has Christ become righteousness to us from God, and not only has He become sanctification to us from God, but He has become redemption to us from God.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The meaning of redemption is to buy back or to free by paying a ransom.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>There are three things which are indispensable in any act of redemption.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The first is the person redeemed, the second is the redeemer, and the third is the price of redemption.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>All the redeemed ones were formerly sold under sin Rom 7:14 ; they were the slaves of sin.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Now the Lord Jesus has paid the price of the blood Matt 20:28; Mark 10:45; 1 Tim 2:6 and has redeemed us out of the curse of the law Gal 3:13 .</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>This shows us that the Lord is our Redeemer.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>But we have to go on one step further.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The Lord Jesus is not only our Redeemer, but also our redemption.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>If the Lord Jesus is only our Redeemer, He is still separated from the redeemed ones, in spite of the close relationship between the two a relationship of grace, of saving our lives.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The Lord Jesus has not only become our Redeemer but has become our redemption.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>This means that when we are redeemed, we are not only joined to a thing, but to a person.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>When we are redeemed, the Lord Jesus becomes one with us; the two become one.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Our redemption is a person.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>When we have Him, we have redemption.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Without Him we do not have redemption.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>If we want redemption, we need Him.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Once we have Him, we have redemption because He is the redemption.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Our redemption is not just a thing.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Our redemption is a person who is joined to us.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Christ has become our redemption.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Therefore, all those who have been washed by the blood can come boldly to God.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>While God judges the sinners, He can righteously pass over all those who are under the blood of the Lamb Exo 12:12-13; Rom 3:25-26 .</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>All the redeemed ones have experienced a full redemption.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>In God's eyes, all He sees is Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>It is as if He does not see any person; all He sees is Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Christ is the slain Lamb; His blood removes man's sin-record before God.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>When a man comes to God through Christ, God will no longer condemn him, because Christ has satisfied God's righteous requirement on man's behalf.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>He has borne sin's punishment on man's behalf.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Once a man has Christ, he has redemption.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>When God sees Christ, He sees redemption.</S>
