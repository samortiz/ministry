If a Christian does not know his faults or his real condition, he will not pursue after what is new or go on in the way ahead
If one does not know himself, he will not judge himself and he will not have the spiritual blessings that come from self-judgment
Unconsciously we are filled with a heart of self-approval and self-confidence because of the shortage of self-knowledge
We consider ourselves trustworthy and fail to understand the meaning of the Lord's word, 'Apart from Me you can do nothing'
Because we do not know ourselves, we do not know how great is our lack and how complete and precious is the salvation in Christ
Self-knowledge is the first condition toward betterment, because only those who know themselves desire for the better-yes, even God's best
Those who do not know themselves will not have a hungry and thirsty heart, and they will not have the filling of the Holy Spirit
Griffith Thomas said that in the whole Bible there are only two places which mention self- examination, but both refer to something specific
We should examine ourselves to see if we confess that the bread and the cup are the Lord's body and the Lord's blood
We must examine ourselves to see if we remember its spiritual significance; otherwise, it will become a ritual
Rather, it is a particular case of a particular condition existing in Corinth-a self-examination of whether or not there was faith
Please take notice that it does not say that you must consider yourselves; rather, it says that you must examine your ways
When we read the context of the three portions mentioned above, we should realize that they are not talking about introspection
Because we are using a deceitful heart to examine ourselves, we cannot avoid being deceived by this deceitful heart
If the heart were proper, then it could be used as a standard; but, since the heart is deceitful, how can it be used as a standard?
A man was installing a chimney, and after he measured it with his ruler, he told the metal worker to make it ten feet long
In such a complicated condition, even though we can examine ourselves, self-examination will never give us accurate self-knowledge
While you are examining your feelings, you do not know how your feelings are affected by and connected with all the other areas
On the other hand, he is weak on another point, yet he does not realize it but considers himself to be very good on that point
According to his view he considered himself to have much love, but in his home he was not at peace with his wife
If we do not obey the command of the Bible to look unto Jesus but instead turn to look inside ourselves, we will suffer much spiritually
Griffith Thomas said, 'There is now a common saying that if you look at yourself once, you must then look at Christ ten times
When the centipede saw the rays, it became very happy and ran toward the sun, forgetting all about the stepping order of so many legs
If we turn to examine ourselves, we will see that we are in a fog; the more we examine, the more we become unclear
The Bible does not command Christians to examine themselves because selfexamination is not only unprofitable but it hinders progress as well
For this reason he thinks that refraining from examining oneself means that there is no need of knowing oneself
He does not realize that self-knowledge is still necessary, except that this self-knowledge must not come from self-examination
Psalm 139:23-24b says, 'Search me, O God, and know my heart: / Try me, and know my thoughts: / And see if there be any wicked way in me'
We do not need to strive in self-examination or ask ourselves how we feel about ourselves in order to know our inward parts and heart
These portions of the Scripture tell us that if we want the knowledge concerning ourselves we must ask God to tell us His knowledge about us
He sees and knows even the most hidden part of our heart, which we are not able to feel or analyze by ourselves
When you feel that you are good, do not consider that you are good; when you feel that you are no good, do not consider that you are no good
While God does not want us to examine ourselves, this does not mean that He does not want us to know ourselves or live carelessly
Maybe what He considers to be wrong, we think is good; what He considers as defilement, we think of merely as a little mistake
Many things which we have considered to be very good, when exposed one day under the light of God, we will realize are terrible
After Adam partook of the fruit of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, the first thing he saw was his shame --nakedness
After this enlightenment they will utterly feel that their sins are deplorable and that they need to seek deliverance
When we seek the will of God and do not find an answer, we should ask God to search us to see if there is any unwillingness within us
The shallow Christian sees his shortages on a certain point only when he is exposed by God at a particular time
He still does not know how difficult it is to be consecrated to God and what the result of that consecration will be in the future
When the light of God shines, then we know that in many matters of spiritual truth, all we are saying are just words
Only then will we desperately feel the pain of this weakness and only then will we have a heart that deplores this weakness
Rather, it causes him to reprove himself, repent of the past, hate the flesh, and beg in ashes for God to deliver him from his filthiness
It is possible for one to be full of biblical knowledge, yet at the same time, void of any of the light of God in his heart
If one has backslidden, he can still tell people about the Bible from his previous understanding, but he does not have the light of God
Knowledge has its place both in the Bible and in spiritual experiences, but knowledge apart from the power of the Holy Spirit is dead
We must have the boldness to be shined upon by God with His light so that He can reveal to us the real picture of ourselves
When we tell the Lord the facts of a situation, asking Him for enlightenment, we find to our surprise that everything is wrong
These two verses may be very familiar to us, but if we read them carefully before God we will know how deep these verses are
Put yourself in the Word of God, and let the Word of God judge, let the Word of God point out your real condition
In this condition no human words, explanation, exhortation, warning, or reproof can make them see their own fallen state
No man can progress in the spiritual path and no man can have an effective work without being shined upon by God
It is not a matter of telling a believer to be fervent, to do his duty, to read more of the Bible, or to pray more
When the light of God comes, a believer is able to see how filthy he is because he has seen the holiness of God
The feeling of decadence and corruption cannot deter his victory because it is Christ overcoming in him and not himself
Before he saw this vision, Isaiah's lips were unclean, and he was already dwelling in the midst of a people of unclean lips
He was also able to see his own real condition, how unclean his mouth was and how unworthy he was to be a mouthpiece for God
He considered that the Lord Jesus came into the world to save sinners and that among the sinners he was the chief
Not only so, he considered himself to be worse than the others; therefore, he needed the grace of the Lord even more than they
Humanly speaking then, if this disciple saw the light of God, he should not have been so fearful as many others
Of the persons that we are about to cite, who can deny that they are the most outstanding people in the church?
In his very last prayer, he said: 'This prayer is what I, John Knox, with my dying tongue and my whole mind, request of my God'
O Lord have mercy on me do not judge my innumerable sins amongst them may you forgive especially those sins which the world cannot reprove
Spurgeon said of him, 'In my view, the style of John Bunyan most resembles the style of the Lord Jesus; no man can come close to him'
In such a deep feeling of sins, he cried out: 'Unless He is such a great Savior, He surely cannot save such a great sinner as I'
He knew that he was dying that day, yet he preached to them until the candle burned out, and then he went upstairs to die
Whenever he preached, countless people wept for their sins, as if pricked in their hearts, and asked forgiveness of the Savior
These are the words of Jonathan Edwards at the burial of David Brainerd, who became his son through the gospel
When Brainerd was twenty-five years old, he labored among the poor Indians in the heart of the forest in America
These are men who drew close to God more than others; yet surprisingly, they had these kinds of feelings about themselves
Can ordinary believers, who are not as close to God as these and do not sense their own corruption, be more advanced than these men?
The reason that they can deceive themselves is because truth the truth that comes from the light of God --is not in their heart
The more we draw close to God, the higher our measure of holiness and the more we will know what is filthy, corrupt, and unrighteous
Many things which we considered right last year, we discovered were wrong this year because we have received more of the light of God
Perhaps many things which you now consider as acceptable will appear wrong when more of God and His intention is unfolded to you
We have to be careful and not be deceived by the flesh in thinking that we have now attained 'sinless perfection'
Whether or not we shall receive praise from God in the future depends on whether or not we have obeyed the will of God today
Whether or not we receive a reward is a small matter, but whether or not the Lord's heart is pleased and satisfied is a big question
It is not what we consider or believe that counts; rather, it is a matter of whether or not our work is really out of the will of God
Let us be assured that before God there is only one right or wrong, and there is only one standard of right and wrong
In the light of God, not only will it be impossible for anything to be hidden, but it will also be impossible for anything to be wrong
Let us be assured that the light of God we receive for work today will be the light which God will use to judge us in the future
We ought to thank and praise God because we do not have to wait until that day to see the light of God and know how He will judge us
The Holy Spirit comes to dwell in our heart to reveal the light of God; therefore, our responsibility is inexcusable
We must cry as David cried before God, 'Examine me, O Jehovah, and try me; / Test my inward parts and my heart'
There is no reason other than they have wicked ways in their hearts, which makes it impossible for God to lead them
They do not know how much inclination, how much opinion, how much fear, and how much lust are in their own hearts
If before God they would ask Him to shine upon them, grant them self-knowledge, and then remove their obstacles, God would surely lead them
