   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>E. Eternal Grace</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In 1:9-10a Paul says, speaking of God, "Who has saved us and called us with a holy calling, not according to our works, but according to His own purpose and grace, which was given to us in Christ Jesus before times eternal, but now has been manifested through the appearing of our Savior Christ Jesus."</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>God has not only saved us to enjoy His blessing, but also called us with a holy calling, a calling for a particular cause, to fulfill His purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The purpose here is God's plan according to His will to place us into Christ, making us one with Him to share His life and position that we may be His testimony.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Grace is God's provision in life for us to live out His purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The grace given to us in Christ was bestowed upon us before the world began.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The phrase "before times eternal" means before the world began.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>This is a sure and unshakable foundation, standing firmly against the waves of the downward current and exposing the total powerlessness of the enemy's efforts to counter the eternal purpose of God.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>In order to strengthen Timothy, the apostle identifies their ministry with this eternal grace, the sure foundation.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>In verse 9 Paul says that God's grace was given to us before times eternal; in verse 10 he says that this grace has been manifested through the appearing of our Savior Christ Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>God's grace was given to us in eternity, but was manifested and applied to us through our Lord's first coming to nullify death and bring life to us.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Because this grace was manifested through the appearing of Christ, Old Testament saints like Abraham and David did not experience it.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The grace destined to be given to us came with the appearing of the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>This grace is not merely a blessing; it is a Person, the Triune God Himself given to us to be our enjoyment.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>This grace came when the Lord Jesus appeared, and now it is with us today.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>F. The Incorruptible Life</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The last part of verse 10 says of Christ, "Who nullified death, and brought life and incorruption to light through the gospel."</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Christ nullified death, making it of none effect, through His Devil-destroying death Heb 2:14 and death-swallowing resurrection 1 Cor 15:52-54 .</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The eternal life of God is given to all believers in Christ 1 Tim 1:16 and is the main element of the divine grace given to us Rom 5:17, 21 .</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>This life has conquered death Acts 2:24 and will swallow up death 2 Cor 5:4 .</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>It was according to the promise of such a life that Paul was an apostle 2 Tim 1:1 .</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>This life and its consequent incorruption have been brought to light and made visible to men through the preaching of the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Life is the divine element, even God Himself, imparted into our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Incorruption is the consequence of life saturating our body Rom 8:11 .</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>This life and incorruption are able to counter the death and corruption of the decline among the churches.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Second Timothy 1:11 says, "For which I was appointed a herald, and an apostle, and a teacher."</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The relative pronoun "which" refers to the gospel of divine grace and eternal life.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>This corresponds to the gospel presented in grace and life by the Apostle John John 1:4, 15-17 .</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>For such a gospel Paul was appointed a herald, an apostle, and a teacher.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>A herald announces and proclaims the gospel, an apostle sets up and establishes the churches for God's administration, and a teacher gives instructions to the churches with all the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>In verse 12 Paul goes on to say, "For which cause also I suffer these things; but I am not ashamed, for I know Whom I have believed, and I am persuaded that He is able to guard my deposit unto that day."</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The apostle had a cause for his sufferings, a cause on the highest plane to proclaim the glad tidings of the gospel of grace and life, to establish the churches, and to instruct the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Such a cause should also be an encouragement and strengthening to Timothy in facing the deterioration of the declining churches.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Since Paul was not ashamed, Timothy should not be ashamed either.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>In verse 12 Paul says, "I know Whom I have believed."</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>What the apostle believed was not a thing or a matter, but a living Person, Christ, the Son of the living God, who is the embodiment of divine grace and eternal life.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The eternal life in Him is powerful; it is more than able to sustain to the end the one who suffers for His sake and also to preserve him for the inheritance of the coming glory.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The grace in Him is more than sufficient to provide His sent one with all he needs for finishing the course of his ministry unto a reward in glory 4:7-8 .</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Hence, He is able to guard that which the apostle has committed unto Him for the day of His return.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Such an assurance should also be an encouragement and strengthening to the weakened and sorrowful Timothy.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The words "my deposit" refer to that which Paul had committed to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The apostle had committed his entire being with his glorious future unto the One who is able, through His life and grace, to guard his deposit unto "that day," the day of Christ's second appearing.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>G. The Healthy Words</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>In verse 13 Paul continues, "Hold a pattern of healthy words which you heard from me, in faith and love which are in Christ Jesus."</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The preceding word in verse 12 is a pattern, an example, of healthy words.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The words of our Lord Jesus Christ are words of life John 6:63 ; hence, they are healthy words.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The word healthy here refers to the health of life.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>H. The Indwelling Spirit</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>In verse 14 Paul concludes, "Guard the good deposit through the Holy Spirit Who dwells in us."</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>The Holy Spirit dwells in our spirit Rom 8:16 .</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Hence, to guard the good deposit through the Holy Spirit requires us to exercise our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>We have pointed out that the Spirit is the ultimate consummation of the Triune God's contact with man.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Praise the Lord that today this Spirit dwells in our spirit!</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>We thank the Lord for all the divine provisions for the inoculation against the decline of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>The more we experience these provisions, the more we shall be inoculated against any kind of decline.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Having such a marvelous inoculation, we should be able to declare that in the Lord's recovery there is no decline.</S>
