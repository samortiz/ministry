[2]  2 And behold, a 1 leper, coming near, worshipped Him, saying, Lord, if You are willing, You can cleanse me.
[3]  14 And Jesus, coming into Peter's house, saw 1 his mother-in-law lying down and in a fever.
[4]  16 And when evening fell, they brought to Him 1 many who were demon possessed, and He cast out the spirits with a word, and 1 all those who were ill He healed,
[5]  18 Now when Jesus saw a crowd around Him, He gave orders to 1 depart to the other side.
[6]  19 And a scribe came near and said to Him, Teacher, I will follow You wherever You go.
[7]  Matthew 8:24-26, 28-29, 31-32; 9:2-3, 6
[8]  8:24 And behold, there arose a great tempest in the sea, so that the boat was covered by the waves; but He was sleeping.
[9]  25 And they came near and roused Him, saying, Lord, save us; we are perishing!
[10]  Have You come here before the time to torment us?" v. 29 . The King called Himself the Son of Man v. 20 , but the demons called Him the Son of God, tempting Him to deviate from His standing as the Son of Man.
[11]  "Some of the scribes said within themselves, This man blasphemes" v. 3 . The scribes, confident that they knew the Scriptures, thought that only God had authority to forgive sins and that Jesus, who in their eyes was only a man, had blasphemed God when He said, "Your sins are forgiven." This indicates that they did not realize that the Lord was God.
[12]  9 And as Jesus passed on from there, He saw a man sitting at the tax office, called Matthew, and He said to him, Follow Me. And he rose and followed Him.
[13]  10 And as He was reclining at table in the house, behold, many tax collectors and sinners came and reclined together with Jesus and His disciples.
[14]  After the King decreed the constitution of the kingdom of the heavens and after He manifested His authority as the King in many situations, in 9:9-13 we see Him feasting with sinners.
[15]  While the Lord Jesus was enjoying the feast with all the tax collectors and sinners, the Pharisees criticized and condemned Him, and they asked the disciples why their teacher ate with such people v. 11 . This question indicates that the self-righteous Pharisees did not know the grace of God.
[16]  14 Then the disciples of John came to Him, saying, Why do we and the Pharisees fast much, but Your disciples do not fast?
[17]  Christ first was the unfulled cloth for making a new garment, and then through His death and resurrection was made a new garment to cover us as our righteousness before God that we might be justified by God and be acceptable to Him Luke 15:22; Gal 3:27; 1 Cor 1:30 .
[18]  After decreeing the new law of the kingdom, the first things the new King did were to cleanse the unclean, heal the sick, and cast out the demons Matt 8:2-17 .
[19]  18 A ruler came and worshipped Him, saying, My daughter has just died, but come and lay Your hand on her, and she will live.
[20]  35 And Jesus went about all the cities and the villages, teaching in their synagogues and preaching the 1 gospel of the kingdom and healing 2 every disease and every sickness.
[21]  36 And seeing the crowds, He was moved with compassion for them, because they were 1 harassed and cast away like 2 sheep not having a 2 shepherd.
[22]  1 And He called His twelve disciples to Him and gave them authority over unclean spirits, so that they would cast them out and heal every disease and every sickness.
[23]  7 And as you go, proclaim, saying, The kingdom of the heavens has drawn near.
[24]  34 Do not think that I have come to bring peace on the earth; I have not come to bring peace, but a sword.
[25]  2 Now when John heard in the prison of the works of the Christ, he sent word through his disciples
[26]  In verses 37 through 39 we have the way to follow the heavenly King: 1 loving Him absolutely in our love nothing should be above Him; 2 taking the cross and following after Him, that is, taking the will of God by putting ourselves aside; and 3 losing our soul-life for His sake allowing our soul to suffer the loss of its enjoyment in this age, which will enable our soul to have its enjoyment in the coming kingdom age, that is, to share the King's joy in ruling over the earth 25:21, 23 .
[27]  25 At that time Jesus answered and said, I extol You, Father, Lord of heaven and of earth, because You have hidden these things from the wise and intelligent and have revealed them to infants.
[28]  And they asked Him, saying, Is it lawful to heal on the Sabbath? so that they might accuse Him.
[29]  Verse 18 indicates clearly that because of the Jew's rejection, the heavenly King with His heavenly kingdom would turn to the Gentiles, and the Gentiles would receive Him and trust in Him v. 21 .
[30]  22 Then there was brought to Him one possessed by a demon, blind and dumb, and He healed him, so that the dumb man spoke and saw.
[31]  25 But knowing their thoughts, He said to them, Every kingdom divided against itself becomes desolate, and every city or house divided against itself will not stand.
[32]  The Spirit of God is the power of the kingdom of God v. 28 . Where the Spirit of God is in power, there the kingdom of God is, and there the demons have no ground.
[33]  31 Therefore I say to you, Every sin and blasphemy will be forgiven men, but blasphemy against the Spirit will not be forgiven.
[34]  32 And whoever speaks a word against the Son of Man, it will be forgiven him; but whoever speaks against the Holy Spirit, it will not be forgiven him, neither in this age nor in the one to come.
[35]  Outline The King's ministry 4:12 11:30 The King's poise and attitude toward every situation 11:2-30 Appraising His forerunner vv.
[36]  38 Then some of the scribes and Pharisees answered Him, saying, Teacher, we want to see a sign from You.
[37]  39 But He answered and said to them, An evil and adulterous generation seeks after a sign, and a sign shall not be given to it except the sign of Jonah the prophet.
[38]  43 When the unclean spirit goes out from the man, it roams through waterless places, seeking rest, and does not find it.
[39]  10 And the disciples came and said to Him, Why do You speak in parables to them?
[40]  11 And He answered and said to them, Because to you it has been given to know the mysteries of the kingdom of the heavens, but to them it has not been given.
[41]  3 And He spoke many things to them in parables, saying, Behold, the sower went out to sow.
[42]  24, 31, 33, 44-45, 47 , at the beginning of this parable, the first of the seven parables concerning the mysteries of the kingdom, the Lord did not say, "The kingdom of the heavens is or, has become like ," because the kingdom of the heavens began with the second parable.
[43]  It is the word of the kingdom with the Lord being in this word as life v. 19 . The seed is also the sons, the people, of the kingdom v. 38 . If we check with our experience, we will realize that the seed sown by the Lord Jesus into our humanity is just Himself as life to make us the seed of the kingdom.
[44]  Matt 13:19 When anyone hears the word of the kingdom and does not understand, the evil one comes and snatches away that which has been sown in his heart.
[45]  23 But the one sown on the good earth, this is he who hears the word and understands, who by all means bears fruit and produces, one a hundredfold, and one sixtyfold, and one thirtyfold.
[46]  Outline The King's being rejected 12:1 27:66 The establishment of rejection 12:1-50 The sign to the rejecting generation vv.
[47]  And His disciples came to Him, saying, Make the parable of the tares of the field clear to us.
[48]  This parable discloses that not long after the kingdom was established with the sons of the kingdom, the wheat, that the sons of the evil one, the tares, grew up to alter the situation, having formed the outward appearance of the kingdom, which today is called Christendom.
[49]  31 Another parable He set before them, saying, The kingdom of the heavens is like a mustard seed, which a man took and sowed in his field,
[50]  This indicates that the kingdom people, the constituents of the kingdom and the church, should be like a crop that produces food for the satisfaction of God and man.
[51]  33 Another parable He spoke to them: The kingdom of the heavens is like leaven, which a woman took and hid in three measures of meal until the whole was leavened.
[52]  44 The kingdom of the heavens is like a treasure hidden in the field, which a man found and hid, and in his joy goes and sells all that he has, and buys that field.
[53]  The treasure hidden in the field v. 44 must consist of gold or precious stones, the materials for the building of the church and the New Jerusalem 1 Cor 3:12; Rev 21:18-20 . Since the church is the practical kingdom today, and the New Jerusalem will be the kingdom in manifestation in the coming age, the treasure hidden in the field must signify the kingdom hidden on God's created earth.
[54]  The man here in verse 44 is Christ, who found the kingdom of the heavens in 4:12 to 12:23, hid it in 12:24 to 13:43, and in His joy went to the cross in 16:21; 17:22-23; 20:18-19; and 26:1 to 27:52 to sell all He had and to buy the field that is, to redeem the created and lost earth for the kingdom because within the earth there was the kingdom, the treasure.
[55]  45 Again, the kingdom of the heavens is like a merchant seeking fine pearls;
[56]  The merchant in verse 45 is also Christ, who was seeking the church for His kingdom.
[57]  47 Again, the kingdom of the heavens is like a net cast into the sea and gathering from every species,
[58]  52 And He said to them, For this reason every scribe discipled to the kingdom of the heavens is like a householder who brings forth out of his treasure things new and old.
[59]  At the end of this chapter the Lord spoke an additional parable v. 52 . After giving the seven parables concerning the mysteries of the kingdom, the Lord likened the discipled scribe to a householder who has a treasure, a rich store of things new and old, signifying not only the new and old knowledge of the Scriptures but also the new and old experiences of life in the kingdom.
[60]  Outline The King's being rejected 12:1 27:66 The unveiling of the kingdom's mysteries 13:1-52 The abnormal development of the outward appearance of the kingdom vv.
[61]  31-32 The inward corruption of the outward appearance of the kingdom vv.
[62]  36-43 The kingdom hidden in the God-created earth v. 44 The church produced out of the Satan-corrupted world vv.
