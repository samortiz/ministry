   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>LIFE-STUDY OF GALATIANS MESSAGE TWENTY-NINE HOW TO RESTORE THE FALLEN ONE,</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>HOW TO FULFILL THE LAW OF CHRIST,</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>AND HOW TO SOW Scripture Reading: Gal 6:1-10</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Galatians 6:1-10 is a continuation of Paul s word at the end of chapter five.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>In 5:25 Paul charges us to walk by the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In 6:1-10 Paul develops this matter of walking by the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>In these verses he covers three things: how to restore one who has fallen, how to fulfill the law of Christ, and how to sow unto the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>For all three, we need to turn to our spirit and walk by the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>I. HOW TO RESTORE THE FALLEN ONE</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Galatians 6:1 says, Brothers, if ever a man is overtaken in some offense, you who are spiritual restore such a one in a spirit of meekness, considering yourself, lest you also are tempted.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Those who are spiritual are those who live and walk by the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>This is the only way to be genuinely spiritual.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Those who are spiritual should restore one who has fallen in a spirit of meekness.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>This is our regenerated spirit, indwelt by and mingled with the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Such a spirit is the issue of living and walking by the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Notice that Paul speaks of a spirit of meekness.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The meekness we need must be in our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The source of what we do should be our spirit, not simply our kind heart.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Therefore, this verse indicates that everything we do in our daily walk should be done in our spirit and from our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>II.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>HOW TO FULFILL THE LAW OF CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>In 6:2 Paul continues, Bear one another s burdens, and so you will fulfill the law of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Some expositors say that the law of Christ here refers to the Lord s commandment that we love one another.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>According to them, the law of Christ is the law of love.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>This is correct.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>However, we must go on to see that the law of Christ is the higher and better law of life which works through love Rom 8:2; John 13:34 .</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The law of love, which is the law of Christ, is the law of life.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Love is the expression, but life is the substance.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Real love is that which issues from the divine life.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The love described by Paul in 1 Corinthians 13 is the expression of the divine life.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Furthermore, the fact that love is a fruit of the Spirit indicates that the substance of love must be the Spirit Gal 5:22 .</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>In fact, all spiritual virtues must have the Spirit with the divine life as their substance.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The law of Christ, which is the law of love, must be substantiated by the divine life.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>This is the reason we say that the law of Christ in 6:2 denotes the law of life.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Expressed by the law of love, the law of life will cause us to bear one another s burdens.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>In this way we fulfill the law of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>In verse 3 Paul says, For if anyone thinks he is something, being nothing, he deceives himself.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Apparently there is no connection between verse 3 and verse 2; actually there is a very real and significant connection.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Those who think of themselves as something will not bear the burdens of others.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Only those who do not regard themselves as anything will bear others burdens.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Perhaps you would say that certain ones who consider themselves to be something seem to bear the burdens of others.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>However, this is merely an outward show, the exhibition of the self, not the genuine bearing of someone else s burden.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>In the eyes of the Lord, such a person does not actually bear anyone s burden.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Instead, thinking himself to be somebody, he takes advantage of an opportunity to display himself.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>No doubt, Paul wrote these verses according to his experience.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>From experience he realized that it is when we consider ourselves as nothing that we spontaneously, even unconsciously, bear the burdens of others.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>We do not place a high estimate on what we do.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>We simply do it because we are walking in the Spirit and by the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Walking by the Spirit, we are led of the Spirit to do certain things.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>The result is that we bear someone s burden without even realizing it.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Paul s word is simple and brief, but it is full of experience.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>In 6:6 Paul says, But let him who is instructed in the word share with him who instructs in all good things.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>The good things in this verse refer to things which are good for this life, the necessities of daily living.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Even in the matter of sharing such things, we may fulfill the law of Christ, fulfilling the law of love according to the law of life.</S>
