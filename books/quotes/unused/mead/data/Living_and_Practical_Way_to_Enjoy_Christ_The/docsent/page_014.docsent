   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CALLING ON THE LORD TO ENJOY HIS RICHES</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In Romans 10 Paul said, "Do not say in your heart, Who will ascend into heaven?' that is, to bring Christ down; or, Who will descend into the abyss?' that is, to bring Christ up from the dead" vv.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>6-7 .</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>You do not need someone to bring Christ down from the heavens for you or to bring Christ up from the abyss for you.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>As the last Adam, He has come down from the heavens and has risen up from the abyss.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>He was incarnated, coming down from the heavens.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>He was resurrected, rising up from the abyss.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>He has completed all of His traffic.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Now where is He?</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Christ, who is the end of the law, is not far from you.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Paul said that He is in your mouth v. 8 . Many say that we have to believe in the Lord Jesus in our heart.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>This is true but we also need to exercise our mouth.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Romans 10 says you have to confess, "Lord Jesus," with your mouth v. 9 . You should not merely exercise your heart; you also have to use your mouth.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Many of you have not used your mouth.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>You may say that you have prayed much, but have you ever shouted, calling on Jesus with your mouth?</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Use your mouth, not just to pray to the Lord Jesus, but to confess the Lord Jesus, to call upon His name.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>I hope that you all would underline the word mouth in Romans 10.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>You have to use your mouth to call on the name of the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Romans 10 does not say that the Lord is rich unto all that believe in Him, worship Him, meditate on Him, or pray to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>It says that the Lord is rich to all who call upon Him v. 12 . Have you ever called upon the Lord? I am sharing something with you that is missed by Christianity.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Many will tell you that you have to believe in the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Then you have to confess your failures and sins to the Lord and pray much.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>But in today's Christianity, the matter of calling on the name of the Lord has been and still is missed.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>I would like to illustrate the difference between calling and praying.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>If my house were on fire, I could come to someone and say, "Sir, my house is on fire, and we are short of water.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Please come to help us."</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>This is an illustration of what it is to pray by saying, "Lord Jesus, I am a sinner.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>You are my Redeemer.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>I need You."</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>But a person whose house is on fire can also cry out, "Fire!</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Fire!"</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>This is what it is to call on the Lord's name "O Lord Jesus!</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Lord Jesus!"</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>When Saul of Tarsus fell on the ground on his way to Damascus, he cried out, "Who are You, Lord?!"</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Later, the Lord went to Ananias and told him to visit Saul.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Ananias was concerned and told the Lord, "He has authority from the chief priests to bind all who call upon Your name" Acts 9:14 .</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>While Saul was on the way to Damascus, he wanted to bind all of the ones who called on the Lord Jesus day by day.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Suddenly he fell down to the earth and said, "Who are You, Lord?"</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Then the Lord said, "I am Jesus, whom you persecute" v. 5 . Without his being conscious of anything, Jesus came into him.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>If we call on a person who is real, true, and living, he will come to us.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Is Jesus real today?</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Is Jesus living?</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Surely He is.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>When we call, "O Lord Jesus," He comes to us with all of His riches.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The Lord is rich unto all that call upon Him.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Whosoever calls upon His name shall be saved Rom 10:12-13 .</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Do not consider that being saved is such a simple thing.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>When we believed in the Lord Jesus, we were saved, but we also need to be saved throughout our Christian life.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>To be saved is not merely to be delivered from hell, to be rescued from God's eternal judgment.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>That is too negative.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>To be saved is to get into the full enjoyment of all the riches of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Christ is so rich.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>He is everything to us.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>We can enter into the enjoyment of all the riches of Christ by calling on His name "O Lord Jesus."</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>On his way to Damascus, Saul of Tarsus did not know that when he called, "Lord," Jesus came into him.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Later in Galatians 1 he told us that it pleased God to reveal Christ into him vv.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>15-16 .</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>God revealed Christ into Saul when he fell to the earth and called, "Who are You, Lord?"</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>In a sense, he was stopped from keeping all laws.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>In another sense, from that time, Paul was brought into the riches of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>He began to be saved from many things into the riches of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Romans 8 tells us that Christ is the life-giving Spirit who is the very content to us.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Chapter nine tells us that we are the vessels to contain Him.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Then chapter ten tells us the way that we, the vessels, can take Christ, the content, into us.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>The way is to call on Him.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Today He is the life-giving Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>He was the last Adam.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>He came down from the heavens and came up from the abyss.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>He has completed His incarnation, crucifixion, and resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Now He is not merely the last Adam.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>He is the life-giving Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>He is the living Word, the living Logos, and He is in your mouth.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>The only thing that can be in your mouth all the time is the air.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>Christ today is the life-giving air.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>What you need is not to exercise your mind to understand, but to exercise your mouth.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>If you open up your mouth and call, "Lord Jesus," He will get into you.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>When you preach the gospel, you may talk a lot and try to convince people and change their concept.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>But the more you try to convince them, the more they will have something to reason about.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>That is the wrong way.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>You need to cause them to open up their mouth and call, "Lord Jesus!"</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>The way to take the Lord in is to call upon His name.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>Do not think that this is a small thing or that this is something new invented by us.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>This is an ancient thing which has been lost and missed by today's Christianity.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>By the Lord's mercy, He has recovered this with us.</S>
