   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>MAN SMALL YET LIKE GOD</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>We have a new message, vital though unusual, on the two trees in Genesis and the two laws in Romans.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Consider the universe God created.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Scientists today have learned something of how vast it is.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The universe is composed of perhaps forty billion galaxies.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>One galaxy is made up of two hundred forty million solar systems.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The distance from the earth to the moon is just a short length in one solar system.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Besides the vastness of the universe, there are the billions of items it contains, too numerous to mention.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>One of these items, the Bible, God's Word, tells us that God created man, another item, in a particular way.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Man was not God, but He was made in God's image and likeness.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Romans 11 tells us that we believers in Christ have been grafted into God.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Romans 6:5 has this thought also.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>For a branch from one tree to be grafted to another, the two trees must be close in nature.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Apples, for example, will not grow on peach trees.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>An almond branch, however, can be grafted to a peach tree because the two are quite close.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>If our human life were entirely different from God's, there would be no possibility for the two lives to be grafted together.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Man's life is not the divine life, but the two are close because man's life was made according to the image of God's life.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>A believing human being can be grafted into God because human life was made in the form of God's virtues.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>God has love; He made love for man.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>But His intention was to use this created love of man as a container for His own real love.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>When the divine love enters into man's love, they are grafted together.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Then the two love together.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>You and God love your wife or your neighbor.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>It is the love of a human being filled up with the love of God.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The almonds produced by the branch grafted to the peach tree result from the mingling of the two lives.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The love of Jesus was like this.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>When He was on this earth, He loved people as a man; yet in that human love was the love of God.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The love of God mingled with a man's love.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Was it a human or a divine love?</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>It was a fruit brought forth from the mingling of two lives.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>People were curious about the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Who was He?</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Was He not a carpenter?</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Was He not the son of Mary?</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Did they not know His brothers and sisters?</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>What was there about Him that was so unusual?</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>How could He be so different?</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>It was because God was in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>He was a God-man!</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The same can be said of all of us, the members of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Surely my love for you is not merely that of an elderly, Chinese man; in my love there is the sweet love of God.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>This is the Christian life.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>A Christian life is not the divine life; nor is it merely a human life.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>It is a mingled life.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>It is a human life redeemed, terminated, resurrected, uplifted, and indwelt by the divine virtue.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>To make tea, we add tea leaves to water.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The water indwelt by the tea becomes tea water.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>It is not tea alone, nor water alone; it is tea water.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>The two have been mingled together.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>The Christian life is a human life mingled with the divine life.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>When we read Genesis 1, it is not till we get to the last few verses that we find the greatest thing that was created.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>It was not the heavens nor the earth, but a small man.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>He was the greatest because he alone was made in the image and after the likeness of God.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Before the incarnation of Christ, God came to His people a few times in the form of a man.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>In Genesis 18 He came with two angels as a man.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>The Bible says three men came.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Abraham washed His feet and served Him a meal, which He ate.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>That was God.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Then in Daniel 3 when the three friends of Daniel were cast into the fiery furnace, there appeared with them a fourth person, whose form was like a son of God.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>God, then, took the form of a man even before He became a man.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>This we cannot explain, but it shows us that man resembles God.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>According to the biblical revelation, man closely resembles God.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>This is why man can be grafted into God and the two lives can live together as one life.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>When Paul said Gal 2:20 , "I have been crucified with Christ, and it is no longer I who live, but Christ lives in me," who was living?</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>It was Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Yet Paul went on to say, "And the life which I now live in the flesh I live in faith."</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>When Christ lived, Paul lived; when Paul lived, Christ lived.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>The Lord Jesus foretold this in John 14:19: "Because I live, you shall live also."</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>We live in His living; He lives in our living.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>In other words, we two live together.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>He who is joined to the Lord is one spirit 1 Cor 6:17 .</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>What a miracle!</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>What a mystery!</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>We cannot explain it, but we know it is so because the Bible tells us so.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>This is God's eternal intention and His economy.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>After reading the description in Genesis 1 of God's creating man, I was looking forward to reading the second chapter.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>My first reading of it disappointed me.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>It seemed quite ordinary.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>The man in chapter one seemed great.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>In chapter two, however, he was just a piece of clay molded by a potter.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>Even a little boy can fashion a toy figure out of clay!</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>Then God breathed into man's nostrils the breath of life, and that toy became a man.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>How simple!</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>To build an airplane is far more complicated.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>Several different departments have to be set up.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>Different kinds of people have to be hired some with doctoral degrees, some with other skills.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>It is a comprehensive undertaking.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>God used only the dust of the earth and made a little man.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>Was this the image of God?</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>Was this little figure according to God's likeness?</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>When I was growing up in China, we used to make toys like this out of clay.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>Some were shorter; some were taller.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>Sometimes we would make nostrils and breathe into them too.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>There was nothing great about it.</S>
