	 <h2 class="head1">PERSONAL SPIRITUALITY<br />
NOT ALLOWED IN THE LORD&rsquo;S WORK</h2>
<p>Paul&rsquo;s Epistles do not speak of his spirituality. Instead, they deal with the problems in the churches. Only the book of 2 Corinthians seems to speak of Paul&rsquo;s personal spirituality. Hence, we must read 2 Corinthians to know Paul. The emphasis of 2 Corinthians, however, deals with the problems in the church. Paul spoke of his spiritual life to solve the problems in the church. The person of Paul was totally for the church. He spoke of his spirituality for the church.</p>
<p>If we spoke concerning spirituality to Paul, he might say that he knows only a few things and that he does not understand us. He knows to save sinners, to build up the church, to labor for the Lord, to learn to live in the Lord&rsquo;s presence, and to enjoy the Lord. He does not know anything besides these things.</p>
<p>Recently, the Gospel Book Room reprinted <em>The Spiritual Man.</em> I was rather reluctant to agree with this suggestion. Brother Nee wrote this book, but he was later unwilling to reprint it. He did not want to reprint it, because it is about a &ldquo;spiritual man.&rdquo; God does not want spiritual men. Moreover, the book is too analytical and is prone to draw readers into self-analysis. This was the main reason that Brother Nee was not willing to reprint it. Brother Nee also pointed out another reason to me. <em>The Spiritual Man</em> does not give a vision; it merely focuses on analysis. A believer can become well-versed in <em>The Spiritual Man</em> but have no vision. He can have knowledge concerning the flesh and the spirit and know what is of the mind, the emotion, and the will, but have no vision, no revelation, and no experience.</p>
<h2 class="head1">GENUINE SPIRITUALITY<br />
BEING MAINTAINED BY A VISION</h2>
<p>Hudson Taylor had a vision. One day as he walked by the seashore in England, he looked over the Atlantic Ocean and saw a great imperial state by the shore of the Pacific Ocean. This state had thousands of souls who needed to be saved. That was when he received a burden. He forgot about his own spirituality and received this one burden from the Lord. If we asked him about his spirituality, he may have said that he did not know what it is to be spiritual. He only knew that he had a heavy burden. He wanted to preach the gospel to the thousands of souls who were perishing daily. It did not matter whether he was an evangelist or whether he knew how to preach the gospel. He received a vision, a burden, that was beyond his spiritual learning, and he followed it.</p>
<p>Every person who wants to be useful to the Lord must learn not to trust in what he has learned but to go beyond it. Our spirituality is a small matter. As long as we receive a vision from the Lord, the vision will keep us and make us spiritual. This is genuine spirituality. The vision will keep us living in God&rsquo;s presence. The vision will not let us go; it will keep us. In contrast, if we pursue spirituality but do not have a burden from God, the more we pursue, the less spiritual we will be.</p>
<p>When the book <em>Fragrant Myrrh</em> was first published, there was a group of brothers and sisters in northern China who imitated Madame Guyon. There was even a sister in Taiwan who was quite successful in imitating her. <em>Fragrant Myrrh</em> and <em>A Short and Easy Method of Prayer</em> have a particular flavor. This sister was so successful in imitating Madame Guyon that she had a particular walk and way of speaking. Whenever the saints saw her, they would say, &ldquo;Here comes the &lsquo;Fragrant Myrrh&rsquo;; here comes Madame Guyon.&rdquo; We have to be clear that this kind of imitated spirituality is useless. Please forgive me for saying that believers who engage in this type of spirituality have a tragic end. Mrs. Penn-Lewis, for instance, had a miserable ending, because she paid too much attention to being spiritual. This led her into spiritual warfare in her latter years, and she eventually focused on demons.</p>
<p>Without a commission from God, we cannot be protected. Without a vision from God, we cannot be saved. We cannot pursue spirituality without a commission and a vision from God. After following the Lord for more than thirty years, I can only say that I do not know what it is to be spiritual. Every believer who receives a burden has a glorious ending. Maybe D. L. Moody was not clear concerning the way of the church, but he was a person who received a burden. His burden was to preach the gospel. Hudson Taylor was not a gospel preacher, but he received a burden, and his end was glorious. However, the saints who paid attention to their own spirituality and desired to improve their spirituality did not have a good ending. The Lord does not honor our focusing on spirituality.</p>
