   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER TWO THE PRAYER THAT EXPRESSES GOD S WILL Scripture Reading: Matt 6:9-13 WHAT IS PRAYER?</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The Bible shows us what prayer is.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>First, God has a need; He has a purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Second, He puts this purpose within man through the Holy Spirit so that man feels this need as well.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Third, man responds by uttering this purpose back to God through prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Fourth, God does His work and accomplishes this purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>This is the meaning of prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Let us read a few passages.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Matthew 9:36 through 10:1 says, And seeing the crowds, He was moved with compassion for them, because they were harassed and cast away like sheep not having a shepherd.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Then He said to His disciples, The harvest is great, but the workers few; therefore beseech the Lord of the harvest that He would thrust out workers into His harvest.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>And He called His twelve disciples to Him and gave them authority over unclean spirits, so that they would cast them out and heal every disease and every sickness.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>According to this passage, 1 God is moved with compassion to save, 2 He wants man to pray, 3 man prays, and 4 God sends men to work and to save.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Ezekiel 36:37 says, Thus saith the Lord God; I will yet for this be inquired of by the house of Israel, to do it for them; I will increase them with men like a flock.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>According to this verse, 1 God will increase Israel with men, 2 God wants men to pray for this matter, 3 men pray for this matter, and 4 God accomplishes it.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Isaiah 62:6-7 says, Upon your walls, O Jerusalem, / I have appointed watchmen; / All day and all night / They will never keep silent.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>/ You who remind Jehovah, / Do not be dumb; / And do not give Him quiet / Until He establishes / And until He makes Jerusalem / A praise in the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>According to this verse, 1 God wants Jerusalem to become a praise in the earth, 2 He has appointed watchmen, 3 the watchmen pray, and 4 God fulfills their desire.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>From these passages we see that all proper prayers issue from God s heart and express God s desire.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Prayer implies that God has a desire.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>He wants to fulfill such a desire, yet He does not want to do it directly; He wants man to cooperate with Him on earth.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>For this reason He unveils His desire to man and charges man to pray.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Only after man prays will He fulfill His desire.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>This is the meaning of prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>THE SIGNIFICANCE OF MATTHEW 6:9-13</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The prayer the Lord taught the disciples in Matthew 6 touches God s will.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>God s eternal will is expressed through it.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>From this prayer, we can see God s heart s desire.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>We can also see what He wants to accomplish and how it is being accomplished.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>THE SECTIONS OF MATTHEW 6:9-13</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>We can divide Matthew 6:9-13 into three sections.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Verses 9 through 10 form the first section.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Verse 11 to the end of the first sentence of verse 13 forms the second section.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The second sentence of verse 13 to the end of the verse forms the third section.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The first section is related to God, the second section is related to man, and the third section again relates to God and points out the underlying basis.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>EXPOSITION OF MATTHEW 6:9-13 Section One</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Verse 9 says, Our Father who is in the heavens.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Our denotes something corporate.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>In this prayer the words our, us, and we are used nine times.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Although one prays this prayer alone in a private room v. 6 , its tone is not individual but corporate.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Who is in the heavens denotes that our prayers have to reach the Holy of Holies Heb 10:19 .</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>In order for our prayers to reach the Holy of Holies, we cannot trust in our feelings; we must trust in the precious blood of the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Furthermore, we must come to the Father in faith v. 22 . Father denotes that we have a life relationship with God.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>We pray in this way because we stand as sons.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Only when we stand in such a position can we fulfill God s heart s desire.</S>
