<h1 class="title">LEADING THE SAINTS TO PRAY<br />
BY EXERCISING THE SPIRIT AND<br />
ADVANCING IN THE TRUTH</h1>
<h2 class="head1">STRENGTHENING THE EXERCISE OF SINGING HYMNS</h2>
<p>We need to be strengthened in our exercise related to singing hymns. I hope that all the churches would provide opportunities for those who have this function to perfect the saints in the singing of hymns. In every message meeting we should set aside at least twenty minutes to practice singing. We have been short in leading the saints to sing hymns of praise to God. I hope that the responsible brothers in every place can pray about this matter so that some brothers can be perfected in leading the singing of hymns.</p>
<h2 class="head1">MATTERS REQUIRING OUR ATTENTION</h2>
<h2 class="head2">Emphasizing the Crucial Points in the Message</h2>
<p>In our &ldquo;classes&rdquo; we should emphasize the crucial points of the message. For example, if the message concerns our need to turn to the spirit to fellowship with God in the Holy of Holies and to pray according to the sense of the Spirit, we should encourage the saints to exercise to pray in their daily life. Furthermore, we should encourage them to fellowship about any difficulties that they have encountered or any insights that they have gained from their exercise. In this way, other saints will receive the benefit. Such a review will also emphasize the crucial points of the previous message.</p>
<p>In our present situation I have not seen this kind of leading and practice. After the message is over, there may be some further speaking and prayer when the saints meet in their &ldquo;classes,&rdquo; but the content does not necessarily correspond to the crucial points in the message. This gives the impression that the message and the subsequent fellowship are not related. The crucial points of the message should be the crucial points of the fellowship in the &ldquo;classes.&rdquo; Moreover, the speaking in this time of fellowship should be concise and not long.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Motivating Those Who Seldom Pray<br />
to Open Their Mouth</h2>
<p>After the crucial points have been reviewed, the saints who seldom open their mouths should be encouraged to pray and fellowship using one or two sentences, because one of the main purposes of these times is to enable the saints who rarely pray to break through in this matter. In the beginning of our pursuit, some saints may need to give a little demonstration of how to exercise. Every &ldquo;class&rdquo; needs some brothers and sisters who are lively and active and who do not deviate from the main subject of the message. There should be at least five or six saints who are lively and able to stir up the other saints; these saints should coordinate to help others. The lively saints should participate, respond, and pray. Their function will serve as a kind of demonstration and usher in an atmosphere for others to do the same. However, we need to be careful not to function so much that there is no ground for those who seldom pray to function. If this is the case, those who seldom pray will not pray. We must not lose sight of the burden that those who seldom pray, those who have not touched the key of prayer, those who have not tasted the sweetness of prayer, and those who have no desire to pray would be brought into this exercise. During our time together, we should focus specifically on motivating these ones. This requires skill.</p>
<p>In our &ldquo;classes&rdquo; we need to emphasize the crucial points so that everyone has a deep impression, and we need to motivate the saints to open their mouth and to exercise in the meeting and even when they return home. We should ask them to be prepared to fellowship at the next meeting about the difficulties they encountered or the experiences they enjoyed so that we can mutually encourage and motivate one another. During our time together, the saints can also pray. The active saints can pray in order to stir up others&rsquo; spirits, and the inactive saints can be encouraged to open their mouth and pray. This is similar to speaking to unbelievers in a gospel meeting. When we encounter some unresponsive ones, we can speak a little to strengthen the gospel message and lead them to gradually open their mouth to pray. It is always hard for a person to open his mouth for the first time, but once he does, it is easy for him to make progress.</p>
<p>This kind of contact is necessary because the weaker saints often need to be encouraged. When we see a saint with a particular need, we should be willing to fellowship with him as time allows. In this way, we can learn about his situation and avoid the need to visit with him at a later time, which may be an inconvenience to him. Since he has heard the message and received some help, he simply needs a little strengthening. Just a few minutes of contact will be a great benefit to him. We should not be focused on those who are more lively and who always open their mouths; we should pay attention to those who do not open their mouths so that they may rise up.</p>
