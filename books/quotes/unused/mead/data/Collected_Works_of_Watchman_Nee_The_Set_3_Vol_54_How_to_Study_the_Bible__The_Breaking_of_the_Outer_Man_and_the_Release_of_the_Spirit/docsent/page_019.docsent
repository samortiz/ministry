   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The Lord's Feeding of the Five Thousand</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>and Mary's Anointing of Him</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Two incidents are recorded in all four Gospels: the Lord's feeding of the five thousand with bread, and the anointing of the Lord by Mary.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>After the Lord fed the five thousand, He ordered the disciples to gather the broken pieces that nothing would be lost John 6:12 .</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>This is quite amazing.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The Lord performed a miracle to feed men with bread, yet He asked the disciples to gather the broken pieces lest they be wasted.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Later a woman came, broke the alabaster flask, and anointed the Lord's head with ointment.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Some disciples said, "Why has this waste of the ointment been made?"</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>But the Lord Jesus said, "She has done a noble deed on Me" Mark 14:3-7 .</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Here we see two contrasting things: the feeding of the bread and the anointing of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>In one case, nothing was wasted.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>In the other case, everything seemed to be wasted.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Nothing produced from a miracle was to be wasted, yet something worth over three hundred denarii could be poured on the Lord and not spared.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The ointment was worth three hundred denarii; it was not spent to feed five thousand but to be consumed by the Lord in an instant.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>It was not a gathering up but a breaking apart.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>It was not twelve baskets but one alabaster flask.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>All these are contrasts.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>In the case of God's Son performing a miracle, even the leftovers are to be gathered up.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>But He does not consider it too much to receive the consecration of something equivalent to three hundred denarii.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>All four Gospels record this story, and everywhere that men preach the gospel, they are to remember this story.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Consecration should go as far as the gospel goes.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Wherever the gospel goes, an absolute offering of consecration to the Lord has to follow.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The reaches of the gospel must be the reaches of man's consecration and ointment.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>We must have a solid impression of this fact.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>d.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The Judgment of the Lord and the Judgment of Paul</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Sometimes it is meaningful to compare the four Gospels with Acts.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>We can compare the judgment the Lord faced with the judgment that Paul faced.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>When Paul was judged, he said that he was a Pharisee and a son of Pharisees Acts 23:6 .</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>This was different from the case of the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>We treasure our brother Paul.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>But the best son that the world can produce is merely a son of man.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Jesus of Nazareth, however, is the only begotten Son of God!</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>When we compare the two, we find that one is God's only begotten Son, while the other is merely a child of God.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>One is the Master, while the other is the servant.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>One is the Teacher, while the other is the student.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Although Paul's attainment was high, he cannot be compared to his Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>We have to be fine and tender.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Only then will we come to know the Lord depicted in the Gospels and the apostles depicted in the Acts.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>If we are not tender, we will not be impressed with anything.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Even if the Lord wants to show us something, we will not be able to prostrate before Him and worship Him.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>A careless man treats the Bible as if it were just ordinary stories.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>He glosses over everything, and it is difficult for the Holy Spirit to impress him with anything.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>e. The Lord's "Passing Through" and</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Paul's Being "Let Down"</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Once the Lord Jesus was reading the Scriptures in the synagogue in Nazareth.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>After He finished, He spoke a little, but the crowd took Him to the brow of a hill so that they might throw Him down the cliff.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Yet He, passing through their midst, went away Luke 4:29-30 .</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>How solemn and dignified He was!</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>He was not like Paul, who had to be let down through the wall and lowered in a basket Acts 9:25 .</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>We are not saying that Paul was wrong in any sense.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>We are saying that there is a difference in nature.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>The Lord passed through the crowd and went away.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>These few words, "passing through their midst, went away" Luke 4:30 , should give us some kind of impression.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>When the Lord passed through those who wanted to kill Him, the crowd could only watch; they could do nothing.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>How dignified and noble is our Lord!</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>2.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Examples of Similarities a. Dissatisfactions with the Lord</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Many impressions in the Bible have to be studied by the way of contrast.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>This is the case with the five examples mentioned above.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Other examples show similarities, and one has to put them together to form an integrated picture.</S>
