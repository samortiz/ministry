   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE DIVINE DISPENSING OF THE DIVINE TRINITY</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>We know that the Gospel of John is a book in the Bible that specifically speaks of God as our life.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>There are mainly four kinds of life.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The first is the plant life, such as the flowering plants, the shrubs, and the trees.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The second is the animal life.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>It is higher than the plant life, and includes such things as the insects, the livestock, the beasts, the fish, and the birds.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>God created all these after their kind.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The third kind is the human life.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>It is higher than the animal life.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>According to the revelation of the Bible, man does not belong to the same kind as the other creatures; he is created in the image and likeness of God.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Hence, as far as his life is concerned, man is of God's kind.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Genesis 1 speaks of God's creation.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>God created all kinds of living creatures.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The lowest form is the plant life; next is the animal life.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Then comes the human life.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>This is a high form of life, yet it is not the highest.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>God spent six days to create.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>After all the other things were created, He created man, and then He entered into rest.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Hence, God worked, and man enjoyed His rest.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>In chapter two, we see another kind of life, which is the life of the tree of life.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>This is the uncreated life of God.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>It is a superior life and the highest kind of life.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Although human life is not the highest, yet it resembles God's life, and it is after God's kind.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The Gospel of John is a book specifically on life.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>But it is not on the plant life, or the animal life.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Neither is it on the human life.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Rather, it is on God coming to be man's life.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>God has given us His life.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>When we receive Him, He enters into us and becomes our life.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>To us, this is the gospel and salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Based on this, we can say that our former concept of the preaching of the gospel was not entirely correct.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>We thought that to preach the gospel was to speak of the cleansing of sins, redemption, justification, and reconciliation.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>When a person became clear and understood these matters, then after he prayed he was saved.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>But after this there was still the need of a pre-baptism oral examination.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>If this person passed the examination, then he could be baptized, and only then could he be considered to have completed the process.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Today, we are much clearer concerning the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>We realize that the way we took was wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>As a result, we have changed.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Consider the Samaritan woman in John chapter four.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>We see that the Lord did not speak to her about the cleansing of sin, redemption, or justification.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>He did not speak of crucifixion or resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The Lord only told her that He was able to give to her the living water.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The woman believed, and she recognized the Lord as the coming Messiah.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>She left her waterpot and went into the city, testifying to all the people.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>This proves that she had believed and had received.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Although her knowledge of salvation was limited, she was genuinely saved.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>We can consider another example, that of Zaccheus' salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>He was a chief tax collector, and he had often taken from others by false accusation.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>One day, the Lord came expressly to Jericho to seek after him.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>He told him, "Today I must stay in your house."</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Zaccheus gladly received Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>The Lord said, "Today salvation has come to this house" Luke 19:1-10 .</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Hence, a man is not saved through the understanding of some doctrines.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Rather, man obtains God's salvation through receiving the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>My subject in this chapter is the divine dispensing and the union and mingling of the Triune God with the believers.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>The divine dispensing refers to God's distribution of Himself into all the believers as their life.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>How can this be done?</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>This is a mystery.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>I cannot describe it, but I know definitely that the complete God is in me.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>He is also in you.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>The same God is at the same time in all of us.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Moreover, with this divine dispensing, there is the union and mingling of the Triune God with the believers.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Union is outward, whereas mingling is inward.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>When we put on our clothing, we have a union with it.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>When we eat our food, we are mingled with it.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>We the believers have, on the one hand, put on Christ Gal 3:27 as our righteous garment for our covering.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>This is our union with Him through believing and baptism into Him.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>On the other hand, He is also our living water for us to drink of Him.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>He is also our spiritual food for us to eat Him.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>When we eat and drink of Him, He enters into us and is mingled with us to become our constitution and our element.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Every time we break the bread, there are two symbols on the table.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>One is the bread as a symbol of the Lord's body, and the other is the cup as a symbol of the Lord's blood.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>For us to eat, drink, and receive Him is our true remembrance of Him.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>Hence, the divine dispensing is simply God working Himself into all of us to be joined to us and mingled with us.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>The whole book of John shows us this matter clearly.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>God has not separated Himself from His life.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>Rather, He has dispensed Himself as life, righteousness, sanctification, redemption 1 Cor 1:30 , and everything to us.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>Whether or not we understand this matter, as long as we receive God into us, we have everything.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>Hence, it is not a matter of understanding, but a matter of receiving.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>If there are gospel friends here, all you need to do is to open up yourself, call on the Lord Jesus, and receive Him.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>Whether or not you understand redemption or justification is secondary.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>As long as you receive Him, you will gradually understand everything.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>Eat Him first, then talk about everything else later.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>This can be compared to the food that we eat every day.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>We do not understand all the nutrition contained in it.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>But when we eat all the different foods, we receive all the nutrition.</S>
