   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>The following words by Sister Ruth Lee in her open letter published in the sixth issue of The Present Testimony, dated December 24, 1928, testifies how Watchman Nee labored in his work by living an overcoming life:</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>________________________________________________________________________________________________________</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In the last issue's open letter, our brother Watchman Nee told how he completed the work on that issue even though he was being stretched out in different ways.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In spite of the situation he was in, he proceeded to prepare the current issue of The Present Testimony for publication.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>This period of our brother's life has been filled with fierce conflicts and perilous fightings.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>While writing The Spiritual Man, his days were spent in the crevices of Satan's teeth.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Since its completion Satan has been fighting even more with all the power of hell, attempting to completely wipe our brother out and make void the testimony of his book.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>This kind of warfare has occupied us and made us inactive for many days.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>These have been days of chanting lamentations.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>But at this very hazardous moment, our loving Father, our victorious Savior, has led our brother to the ascended position in the heavenlies to overcome Satan's fierce attack.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>With tears of joy we thank the Lord today that He has enabled us to put out this issue of The Present Testimony in His victory.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>________________________________________________________________________________________________________</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Watchman Nee lived an overcoming life, worked by such a life, and ministered such a life to the saints and to the churches.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>One of the burdens of his ministry was to hold a number of overcomer conferences.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The goal of the messages given in these conferences was to sound the call for overcomers.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>His intention was to help the saints to become overcomers in this age for the recovery of the Lord's testimony by living an overcoming life, which is the living of a crucified and resurrected life.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>All through the years of his life and ministry, Watchman Nee so cleaved to the crucified and resurrected Christ that he lived in the reality of an overcoming life.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>In the final period of his life, to all appearances he was taken away from his ministry by a change in the political situation.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Actually, however, he was sovereignly put into an environment which afforded him a long period of twenty years to live an overcoming life.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>He did live such a life, overcoming even unto death.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>This is a strong testimony of the Lord, not only to us who are his followers, but also to all the children of God in this age.</S>
