	 <h2 class="head1">THE SERVICE OF THE CHURCH EMPHASIZING<br />
BEING MULTIFACETED&mdash;<br />
HAVING CHRIST AS THE CENTER</h2>
<p>When we serve in the church, we must remember the word <em>multifaceted.</em> This is what we have gained from our experience and from our observation. Our leading is multifaceted. We are not teaching the saints only to be a lion with the face of a lion. We need to have the head of an eagle and the backbone of an ox. Of course, most importantly, we have to be a man. The man, the lion, the ox, and the eagle are all present, but they do not have any problems, because Christ is the center. This is being multifaceted. In the trainings that began in 1952, our leading was always multifaceted. If you read the outlines of the trainings, you will see four main points: truth, life, the church, and the gospel. This can be compared to each of the four living creatures having four faces. The four items&mdash;truth, life, the church, and the gospel&mdash;may be likened to a man, a lion, an ox, and an eagle, and Christ is their center. To have four sides is to be multifaceted.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE OLDER SAINTS AND THE YOUNGER SAINTS<br />
COORDINATING TOGETHER</h2>
<p>There is a problem with the character of the Chinese, which is that they seem very soft, but they are very hard. Sometimes even dynamite cannot open the hard Chinese character. This outwardly soft and inwardly hard character causes problems in our coordination. Such a character causes the older ones to look down on the younger ones. This is even difficult to avoid in the church. The younger ones like to be with the other young ones. They like to listen to young people, and they dislike listening to those who are older. When such a situation is brought into the church, it affects the coordination. Sometimes the older saints can imperceptibly form one group, and the younger saints form another group. When the older ones come together, they may say that there is nothing that they can do with the young people because they are so young. And when the young people get together, they may complain that there is nothing they can do with the older saints because they are so old. The older saints have no way with the younger ones, and the younger saints will not go to fellowship with the older ones. At the Lord&rsquo;s table meeting, everyone has the instant grace to shout, &ldquo;O Lord, we are one in Christ. Lord, we are one!&rdquo; We are bold to shout the word <em>one,</em> but we may not have the reality. After the meeting, the older saints gather with other older saints, and the younger saints want to be with other young saints. The older and younger saints are no longer one. As long as we remain in ourselves without Christ, we cannot be one.</p>
<p>For the Lord&rsquo;s recovery to spread and gain people, we must be in coordination. The Christ revealed in the New Testament does not have only one aspect; He has many aspects. In this message we have mentioned at least four aspects. Hence, we should not wish that there would be only older saints in the church and no young people; neither should we wish that there would be only young saints in the church and no older ones. In other words, we should not wish that the saints would be the same as we are. Regardless of how gifted a person is or how rich his ministry may be, as long as he insists that others be the same as he is, he will not last very long. He will not remain in the church for a long time. Those who can remain with their gifts and ministries must be multifaceted.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE NORMAL SITUATION&mdash;<br />
INDIVIDUALS, FAMILIES, AND CHURCHES<br />
BEING MULTIFACETED</h2>
<h2 class="head2">The Example of the Human Body</h2>
<p>God created man as a multifaceted being because he has a spirit, a soul and also a body. The human body needs at least four things: to breathe, to eat, to sleep, and to exercise. It is easy for the young people to pay attention to their souls while neglecting their bodies. The older ones, however, know that they have to take good care of their bodies. They know that in addition to breathing, eating, and sleeping, they need sufficient exercise. When they exercise, their body is stronger. When I was young, I did not waste any time; I spent all my time reading the Bible and writing. But I have learned the lesson: I must take care of my spirit, soul, and body; I must be multifaceted. Hence, no matter how busy I am, I usually walk for at least an hour a day. I would rather sleep less than not walk. If I do not exercise, my body will suffer. Thus, we must spend the time to exercise and thus take care of our body. However, we must not only take care of our body; we must also care for our soul and our spirit. If we do not fellowship with the Lord, open to the Lord, or spend time with Him, we will suffer a great loss. God does not want the man whom He created to be idle. He wants man to take care of his soul, his body, and most of all of his spirit.</p>
<p>The developed countries in the world try to ensure that their citizens have a life of abundance and that they can obtain all kinds of things for their bodies. Governments also open schools to teach people many things, thereby developing their souls. But the greatest shortcoming is negligence in caring for people&rsquo;s spirits. We preach the gospel and teach the truth in order to care for people&rsquo;s spirits and to fill up this great lack. If we want to be a normal person, we must have a healthy body, a prosperous soul, and a strong spirit. By taking such multifaceted care of ourselves, we will become healthy people.</p>
<p>Likewise, the church cannot be single-sided; it must be multifaceted. In the Lord&rsquo;s recovery, the churches in Taiwan have a history of more than thirty years. They have a good foundation, and they have been blessed much by the Lord. However, the Lord&rsquo;s recovery must advance. Many saints in the churches must come forward to serve, even to serve full time, but we are concerned that in the future problems will arise in the churches. It may be that there will be problems in the localities between the elders and the young people. Or the young people who come out to serve full time may question the leading of the elders. Thus, even though the young people have a heart to serve full time, they must pay attention to being multifaceted in their practice. Only then can they avoid complaints about the leading brothers. Likewise, the elders who take the lead must remember to be multifaceted in their leading. This is the only way for the church to be strong. The older saints as well as the younger saints must all exercise to be multifaceted.</p>
