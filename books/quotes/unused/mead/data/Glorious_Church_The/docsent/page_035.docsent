   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In Jerusalem there were some who were continually looking for the consolation of Israel.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>This is why the Lord was born.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Although the purpose of God is to bring in His kingdom, His part alone is not sufficient.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>He needs the church to work with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Through prayer, the church must release the power of the kingdom of God upon the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>When the Lord comes, the kingdom of the world will become the kingdom of our Lord and of His Christ Rev 11:15 .</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Since the work of the church is to stand for God and not give any ground to Satan, what manner of living should we have to accomplish this task?</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>All our sins and unrighteousness must be dealt with, our consecration to God must be thorough, our soul-life must be put to death, and our natural man must be abandoned.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The ability of the flesh is absolutely useless in spiritual warfare.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>"I" cannot resist Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>"I" must go!</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Whenever "I" goes out, the Lord Jesus will come in. Whenever "I" enters, there is failure.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Whenever the Lord comes in, there is victory.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Satan recognizes only one person the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>We cannot resist Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The fiery darts of Satan can penetrate our flesh, but, praise God, we can put on Christ who has won the victory.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>We believe that Christ is going to come again.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>But do not think that the Lord Jesus will automatically come if we sit and passively wait.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>No, there is a work which the church must do.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>As the Body of Christ, we must learn to work together with God.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>We should never think that it is enough just to be saved.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>It is not.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>We must be concerned with God's need.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>There are two consequences of man's fall: one is the problem of man's moral responsibility, and the other is Satan's usurping of authority over the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>On the one hand, man suffered loss, but on the other hand, God also suffered loss.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Redemption solves the problem of man's moral responsibility and man's loss, but the loss which God suffered has not been solved.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>God's loss cannot be restored through redemption; it can only be restored by the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Man's moral responsibility has been dealt with by the cross, but the problem of Satan's authority must be dealt with by the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The direct purpose of redemption is for man, while the direct purpose of the kingdom is to deal with Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Redemption gained what man lost; the kingdom will destroy what Satan gained.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Man was originally given the responsibility to overthrow the authority of Satan, but instead man fell, leaving the authority to Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Man himself even became subject to him.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Satan became the strong man, and man became his goods Matt 12:29 .</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>This situation demands the kingdom to deal with it.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>If there is no kingdom, then due to man's fall the work of Satan cannot be overthrown.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The new heaven and the new earth did not appear immediately after redemption was accomplished because the problem of Satan had not yet been dealt with.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Before the new heaven and new earth come, there must first be the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Revelation 11:15 says, "The kingdom of the world has become the kingdom of our Lord and of His Christ, and He will reign forever and ever."</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Once the kingdom comes, eternity is ushered in. The kingdom connects with eternity.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>We may say that the kingdom is the introduction to the new heaven and the new earth.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Revelation 21 and 22 show us that the new heaven and new earth appear after the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Isaiah 65 even describes the kingdom as the new heaven and new earth.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>This means that Isaiah viewed the kingdom as the introduction to the new heaven and the new earth.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Thus, when the kingdom begins, the new heaven and the new earth begin also.</S>
