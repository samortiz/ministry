   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>The Peerless Christ</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Christ is incomparable, Paul said.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>He is in a class apart.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Who is Christ?</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>He is the mystery of God.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>He is the embodiment of all the fullness of the Godhead.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Who or what can be ranked with Him?</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>This peerless One is our life.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>He is within us a mystery, the hope of glory.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>He is the component of the new man, the church.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>In the church there is no room for anyone but Him.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>In this new creation all others are excluded, both "Greek and Jew, circumcision and uncircumcision, barbarian, Scythian, slave, freeman" Col 3:11 .</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>In this new man Christ is all and in all; that is, He is every member and He is in every member.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Can anything or anyone be compared with such a Christ?</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>To value any other thing above Him is to be buried in a seven-layered tomb!</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>These seven layers are implied in the religion, law, tradition, and philosophy which Paul condemns so strongly.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The fall, the natural life, culture, religion, ethics, morality, virtues, and spiritual seeking we need to be snatched out of all of these.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>They are burying us, even those of us who are Christians.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>We must be freed from these layers in which we are wrapped.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Frustrations to Experiencing Christ</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>From Galatians we know that to live Christ has nothing to do with religion.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>From Colossians we know that to live Christ is entirely apart from philosophy.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>These two matters, religion and philosophy, are highly esteemed in society and are closely related to each other.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Both are enemies of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Both are frustrations to our experiencing Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Do you realize that you must be out of religion, out of philosophy, and out of culture?</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>This is not a doctrine for you to understand, but a reality for you to experience.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>If you still consider yourself as an American, you are still in your culture.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The Bible says there is no room in the new man for any nationality, whether American, Chinese, or German.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>All the national and cultural distinctions have been buried.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Now your status is Christ!</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>He is all.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>I trust that we have all gotten the message of these two books.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>We, as those who are living Christ, have nothing to do with religion, the law, its traditions, and regulations; nor have we anything to do with philosophy and culture.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>PHILIPPIANS</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Philippians again brings up the matter of religion.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Paul describes himself as "circumcised the eighth day, of the stock of Israel, of the tribe of Benjamin, a Hebrew of the Hebrews; as touching the law, a Pharisee; concerning zeal, persecuting the church; touching the righteousness which is in the law, blameless" Phil 3:5-6 .</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The word translated persecute here is the same as the word pursue.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Before Paul was snatched out of religion, he was pursuing Christ in a negative way.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>After he got saved, his pursuit of Christ was positive.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Because Paul, in his pursuit of Christ, rejected religion, this book tells of sufferings, afflictions, and trials that came to him 1:12-13 .</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Are troubles desirable?</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>In nature they are not, but in function they are.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The difficulties became golden opportunities for Paul not only to live Christ, but also to magnify Him.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Whether he lived or died mattered little.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>What concerned this follower of Christ was to live Him and to magnify Him in his body.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>He wanted Christ to be expressed through him.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>In speaking of his suffering, Paul says, "For I know that this shall turn to my salvation through your prayer, and the bountiful supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ" 1:19, Gk.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>. The all-inclusive Spirit renders us the bountiful supply, while the suffering turns out to be a salvation for us.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>By this bountiful supply, Paul magnified Christ and lived Him out 1:20-21 .</S>
