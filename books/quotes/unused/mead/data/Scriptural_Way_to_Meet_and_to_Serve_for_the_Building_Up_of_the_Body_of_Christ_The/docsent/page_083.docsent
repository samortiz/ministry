   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER TWENTY-SEVEN THE BUILDING UP OF THE CHURCH</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>AS AN ORGANIZATION AND</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>THE BUILDING UP OF THE CHURCH</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>AS AN ORGANISM Scripture Reading: 1 Pet 1:23; Rom 12:2; 2 Cor 3:18; 1 Cor 14:26; Heb 10:25; 2 Pet 1:3-8; Eph 4:15-16; 1 Cor 14:5, 12</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>In the previous chapters, we have seen various aspects of the building up of the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In this chapter we want to see a comparison between the building up of the church as an organization and the building up of the church as an organism.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Organization refers to Christianity, including Catholicism and all the denominations, which constitute the church.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Organism refers to the proper church on the way of God s economy.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>THE BUILDING UP OF THE CHURCH</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>AS AN ORGANIZATION</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The church as an organization is built firstly with the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Many so-called denominational churches build themselves up by preaching the gospel to, as they would say, win souls.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>This point is good, right, and absolutely scriptural.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The church as an organization is also built up with the teachings of the Scriptures.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Many of the fundamental denominations use scriptural teachings.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>This is also good and right.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>But they also attempt to build up their situation by meetings according to the traditional way.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Here is a problem that we are still fighting today.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The denominations render spiritual help to people in their salvation and edification, but they annul, instead of develop, the organic functions of the believers as the living members of the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>This problem is altogether due to the traditional way of meeting, which renders spiritual help but at the same time annuls and kills the organic function of the members of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>This traditional way of meeting renders the help for people to be saved and edified, but then it kills those who have been edified.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Here is the subtlety of the traditional way.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Millions of Christians have been helped to receive Christ as their Savior, and some spiritual help has been rendered to them.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>But while this help is being rendered their organic function is being hiddenly annulled.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The believers do receive some edification, but the traditional way of meeting unconsciously and hiddenly annuls and nullifies all the spiritual organs.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Many believers attend these traditional services for years; the longer they remain there, the more they are killed, robbed, and stripped of their organic ability to function.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Therefore, out of millions of Christians, only a small percentage are useful; most of these are members of the so-called clergy.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>I was in that traditional way for about the first seven years of my Christian life, and I received some help.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>But the more help I received, the more I was annulled and disabled.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Then I began to know the church as an organism, and I was brought into the church.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>From that year in 1932, I began to be equipped in the Lord s ministry in His recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The longer a believer stays under the traditional way of meeting of one speaking and the rest listening, the more he is disabled and his spiritual ability and organic function are annulled.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>In the traditional way of meeting, not only are the functions of the believers nullified, but also the living members of the Body of Christ are bound even to the extent of spiritual death.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>When we were in that way, we did not sense this because along with the spiritual help we received, we were unconsciously drugged.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>We lost our organic function, yet we had no consciousness, no awareness, of it.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>We did not become aware of this until we came out of that drugging situation.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The church as an organization does not fully care for the building up of the church as the Body of Christ with the adequate growth in life of the living members.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>They care for the building up of the church to some degree but not fully.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Thus, their care becomes a tearing down and a frustration to the real building.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Eventually, what is built up is not an organism in life but a religious organization.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Look at today s denominations.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Which one is not an organization?</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>If organization were taken away from the Christian groups in Christianity, they would collapse.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>In contrast, the churches in the Lord s recovery are not dependent upon organization.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Without organization, the churches in the Lord s recovery would still stand because they are not built upon organization.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>They are built upon Christ as the very life that produces an organism.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>We have to come fully out of the old, traditional way because this way leads in the direction of organization.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>If one speaker is always assigned to take care of the meetings of the church, this is a strong organization.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>We must take away this old way of meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>To do this is to tear down that particular organization.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>If this organization is replaced by the many members of Christ coming together without any arrangement or assignment but with the living Christ in them and having the freedom to follow Christ to speak something, this is an organism.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>To change from the traditional way to the scriptural way is to change from an organization to an organism, to have something organic replace something organized.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>As the living, functioning members of the living Body of Christ, we should be happy about this.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Sometimes when I attended a church meeting, I had a burden to speak for about fifteen minutes, but the speaking was altogether occupied by the assigned speaker.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>The situation would not allow me to release my burden.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>The organizational way not only annuls the functions of the members but also kills the opportunities for the saints to function by annulling the time.</S>
