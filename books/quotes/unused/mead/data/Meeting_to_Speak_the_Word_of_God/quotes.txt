[1]  CHAPTER ONE MEETING TO SPEAK THE WORD OF GOD Scripture Reading: Acts 5:42; 1 Cor 14:23-24, 26; Heb 10:25; 1 Cor 12:8, 10 OUTLINE The proof of the Scripture and the manifestation of the Spirit: The proof of the Scripture Acts 5:42; 1 Cor 14:23-24, 26; Heb 10:25.
[2]  The manifestation of the Spirit 1 Cor 12:8, 10.
[3]  I would like all of you to know that this training is not just to train the elders, or the co-workers, or the full-timers, but this training is to train all the brothers and sisters.
[4]  Those who translated the Bible into Chinese translated 1 Corinthians 14:31 as, For you can all be prophets to teach.
[5]  First Corinthians 14:23-25 says, If therefore the whole church comes together in one place...But if all prophesy and some unbeliever or unlearned person enters, he is convicted by all...and so falling on his face, he will worship God, reporting that God is really among you.
[6]  I do not like to speak unpleasant words, but I speak in this way because I love you and not only because I love you, but because I have a burden within me.
[7]  We do not meet merely to speak, but we meet to speak the word of God.
[8]  Although the Lord s word is rich in His recovery, we cannot say that the Lord s word has been propagated through us nor that the word of the Lord is growing and is strong or prevailing.
[9]  The reason that it is not prevailing is that you do not speak the word of God and others do not speak the word of God.
[10]  From now on I hope that all the churches in the Lord s recovery on the island of Taiwan would practice this, that is, that everyone would speak the word of God as soon as he arrives at the meeting.
[11]  I would like to ask, Which do you have first, the Spirit or the word?
[12]  I tell you that first you have the word, and then you have the Spirit.
[13]  I ask you, Do you first have electricity, or do you first have the cables?
[14]  To say this seems reasonable, but you need to know that if you do not speak, the Spirit will not move.
[15]  Remember the Chinese sayings: Sickness comes from what you eat; calamities come from what you speak, Don t embarrass yourself if you have no goods, and For a person like you, to speak is just to lose face.
[16]  OF A MEETING OF THE BELIEVERS Scripture Reading: Matt 18:20; Eph 5:19; Heb 10:25; 1 Cor 14:26; Acts 5:42 OUTLINE The particular nature and characteristic of a meeting of the believers: The particular nature Matt 18:20: Being gathered together out of everything other than Christ.
[17]  In 1966 I felt that this number was not adequate; therefore, I added two hundred more, most of them emphasizing six categories: the Spirit, life, Christ, the church, prayer, and the reading of the Word.
[18]  The brothers in the West thought that I, as a well-known evangelist, had friends all over the world, and therefore that I must have been receiving financial support.
[19]  At such a time, either some brothers or sisters may call you on the telephone to remind you of the meeting, or some saints may come to your house to invite you to the meeting.
[20]  The fact that you come to the meeting is actually not your own doing but the Lord s. In this evil generation, who would want to go out in the evening? Who would not want to stay home and watch television? Who would want to come from a distance for a meeting and sit for one to two hours? Who brought us here? It is the Lord.
[21]  DWELL IN US RICHLY Scripture Reading: Col 3:16; Eph 5:18; 2 Cor 4:11, 13, 9 OUTLINE Letting the word of Christ dwell in us richly, that we may be ready to speak in the meetings Col 3:16.
[22]  Being filled in spirit, speaking the word of God Eph 5:18-19.
[23]  I do not know what kind of response the brothers and sisters have had to the previous two messages concerning the matter of speaking for the Lord.
[24]  We ought to speak for the Lord to the extent that we speak everywhere: at home, at school, in the office, and even the more in the meetings.
[25]  When you hear the knocking, you let him in. To let the word of Christ dwell in us richly means that this word is living, waiting outside the door of our heart for us to welcome Him and to let Him in. If we let Him in, the word of Christ will make home in us.
[26]  We all love the Lord and are willing to let the Lord make His home in us.
[27]  You need to exercise all wisdom to open your whole being to let the word of the Lord as a living person dwell in every inward part comfortably and freely.
[28]  Then, when you want to speak for Him, this word in you will be living, rich, and available.
[29]  I hope that each of you will learn to speak the word of the Lord, using all wisdom to receive the word of the Lord into you as you would receive a living person, that He may feel at ease and richly dwell in you.
[30]  I hope that the church in Taipei will become such a church where every saint, whether old or young, will speak the word of the Lord everywhere in a logical, meaningful, valuable, and skillful manner, speaking until others are attracted, until everyone has heard the word of the Lord.
[31]  Following the word Let the word of Christ dwell in you richly is teaching and admonishing one another in psalms, hymns, and spiritual songs.
[32]  For example, if you speak Romans 8:2 to people all the time, The law of the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus has freed me from the law of sin and of death, repeating it again and again, eventually a short song will be composed and you will spontaneously sing it.
[33]  When you sing to me Romans 8:2, you are teaching me; then when I sing to you Genesis 1:26, I am also teaching you.
[34]  This means that from the time that you let the word of Christ dwell in you richly, you need to learn to exercise your spirit; you need to stay in your spirit.
[35]  I hope that from today you will prepare yourselves according to these two verses, opening yourselves to the living word of the Lord, letting Him dwell in you richly, and then exercising your spirit to pray, sing, and be filled in spirit with the Holy Spirit.
[36]  WITH ONE ANOTHER Scripture Reading: Eph 5:19; Col 3:16; 1 Cor 14:26 OUTLINE Learning to coordinate with one another: Speaking to one another in psalms and hymns and spiritual songs, singing and psalming with your heart to the Lord Eph 5:19.
[37]  Letting the word of Christ dwell in you richly, in all wisdom teaching and admonishing one another in psalms, hymns, and spiritual songs, singing with grace in your hearts to God Col 3:16.
[38]  Tonight we want to say that, when we speak God s word in the meetings, we must learn a basic skill, that is, to coordinate with each other.
[39]  THE NEED TO EXERCISE OUR SPIRIT, SOUL, AND BODY
[40]  The reasons that our meetings do not interest people are because, on the one hand, we speak little and our experience is poor and, on the other hand, when we do stand up to speak the truth, we do not know how to change direction.
[41]  Perhaps you think that it is very difficult to be a believer in the local church.
[42]  We all have responsibilities at home, yet we are not only required to come to the meeting, but also to practice meeting at home.
[43]  AND ATMOSPHERE OF THE MEETING OUTLINE Following the flow and atmosphere the Spirit of the meeting: Not being insensitive to the feeling of the meeting nor acting independently.
[44]  Caring for the need of those attending the meeting, ministering the word according to the need, and if unbelievers are present, being flexible to make changes and minister the word of the gospel according to the situation in the meeting.
[45]  In this message we have come to the conclusion of the matter of meeting to speak the word of God, that is, to follow the flow and atmosphere of the meeting.
[46]  Although there is no clear evidence for this in the Bible, in our experience we can surely sense that there is a flow in the meeting.
[47]  When a person comes into a meeting, he should have a high regard for that meeting, realizing that it is a meeting in the Lord s presence and that in that meeting there is a certain atmosphere.
[48]  If there is no flow in our meetings, there either must be a problem with our meetings or our condition is not acceptable to the Lord, causing us all to sense that the Lord s presence is not manifested among us.
[49]  After we have touched the spirit of the meeting and have realized what the flow of the meeting is, the first thing we should take care of is not to act independently.
