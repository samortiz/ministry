   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE HOLY CITY DESCENDING FROM HEAVEN</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Now let us see the details of the holy city, the New Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Revelation 21:9-10 says, "And one of the seven angels who had the seven bowls full of the seven last plagues came and spoke with me, saying, Come here; I will show you the bride, the wife of the Lamb.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>And he carried me away in spirit onto a great and high mountain and showed me the holy city, Jerusalem, coming down out of heaven from God."</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>When the angel wanted to show John the great harlot in Revelation 17:1-3, he led him into the wilderness.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In God's eyes and in the eyes of those who are inspired by the Holy Spirit, the harlot is one who dwells in the wilderness.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>She lives in a place where there is no life and no fruit a barren land.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Men today can behold high church buildings, they can take part in well-prepared Sunday services, and they can admire the ability of man, but in the sight of God, everything that has its origin in Babylon is in the wilderness; it is deserted.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>When the angel showed John the wife of the Lamb, he brought him up to a great and high mountain.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>There he showed him the holy city, Jerusalem, coming down out of heaven from God.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>It was from a great and high mountain that John beheld this sight.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>This reveals that if we desire to see the eternal vision of God, we must be brought by Him to a great and high mountain.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>If we are not standing spiritually on a high mountain, we will not see those who are living on the plain, we will not see the New Jerusalem, nor will we see the ultimate work of God.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>When Moses reached the Jordan with the children of Israel, what did God tell him to do?</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>He commanded him to go up to the top of Mount Pisgah and lift up his eyes to behold the land which He had promised.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>This also tells us that in order to receive vision and revelation and to behold the plan of God, we must be upon the height.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Never think that just being an ordinary Christian day by day, not committing any great sin, is good enough.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>We must realize that whenever we take this position, God's eternal plan is nothing more to us than doctrine and knowledge.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>We must hope to do some spiritual climbing and have some spiritual attainment.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>We should expect to climb a high mountain.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Only when we do this will we be able to see the New Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>What God desires to do, He will accomplish.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>What God has purposed in eternity past, He will obtain in eternity future.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>First, there must be overcomers to bring in the kingdom, and then there must be overcomers to bring in the new heaven and new earth.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>But the problem is, who will be the overcomers?</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>To be an overcomer, we must have revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>If there is no revelation, it is easy to receive anything as a teaching.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>But we must remember that knowledge can never produce fruit; only revelation is fruitful.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>However, in order to have revelation we must go up to the high mountain; we cannot dwell in the plain.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>There is some difficulty in climbing a mountain because we must exercise our strength to climb.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>We cannot reach the peak unless we make some effort.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>May God grant us this spiritual attainment and deliver us from the low plain.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>We should not think that just being saved and not wanting anything more is enough.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>God must save us from this low level of living and show us His heart's desire.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Only when we are on the high mountain will we receive revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>After John saw the New Jerusalem, he did a very foolish thing he fell down to worship before the feet of the angel.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>This action of his, though foolish, is quite meaningful.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>John was the last among the twelve disciples to leave this world.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>His knowledge, his deeds, his love, and his experience were far beyond ours; yet in the book of Revelation, we see that he did this foolish thing twice.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>There were two instances in which he wanted to worship the angels once in 19:10 and again in 22:8.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Although this act of John's was unlawful and he was told, "Do not do this," yet it still reveals what a wholehearted person John was and how greatly he appreciated God's plan and work.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>In such a situation he was not able to restrain himself; he did something foolishly.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>His deed was wrong, but his heart was revealed to be right.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>This shows us the attitude we should have when we see God's vision.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>May the Lord also grant us to see such a vision.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>May He enable us to go up to the height to see the New Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Oh, that everything within us would be for the success of this vision and for nothing else!</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The angel said to John, "I will show you the bride, the wife of the Lamb" 21:9 .</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>The angel said that he would show him the wife of the Lamb, but John saw "the holy city, Jerusalem, coming down out of heaven from God" v. 10 . The wife of the Lamb whom John saw was the holy city, Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Therefore, the description of the city is also the description of the wife of the Lamb.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>The city is a figure, describing the characteristics and spiritual condition of the corporate Body whom God chose before creation.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>This city comes down out of heaven from God.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>This means that God not only is concerned about the destination of this corporate man, but also about the place from which this corporate man comes.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>It is not just a matter of the future, but a matter of the source.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>The wife of the Lamb comes down out of heaven.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>The New Jerusalem is from heaven, not from earth.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>God is not showing us a man with a history of sin, who was later saved.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>This is not to say that we do not have a history of sin and that we do not need to repent and be saved by grace.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Rather, this passage shows us only that portion which is out from God.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>It shows us the glorious church of Ephesians 5 which is to be presented to Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>In the Old Testament, one woman represents in a special way the church which is to be offered to Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>She is Rebecca.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Abraham said to his old servant, "Thou shalt not take a wife unto my son of the daughters of the Canaanites, among whom I dwell: but thou shalt go unto my country, and to my kindred, and take a wife unto my son Isaac" Gen 24:3-4 .</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Rebecca was not an inhabitant of the land west of the Euphrates, nor an inhabitant of the land west of the Jordan, but she was of the kindred of Isaac.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>God desires to have a corporate man of the kindred of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Since Christ is from heaven, the church too must come from heaven.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Thus Hebrews 2:11 says, "For both He who sanctifies and those who are being sanctified are all of One, for which cause He is not ashamed to call them brothers."</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>What are brothers?</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Brothers are those who have been born of the same mother and father.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>How we thank God that on one hand we were purchased with the precious blood of the Lord, and on the other hand, we were truly born of God.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>There are two aspects to the history of every Christian: one is that we were outwardly purchased of God, and the other is that we were inwardly born of God.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>From the standpoint of our history with sin, we were outwardly purchased; but from the standpoint of our history apart from sin, we were born of God, for whoever is born of God cannot sin.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>This portion has no beginning of sin nor history of sin.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>The fact that the New Jerusalem comes down from God implies that the church has never been on this earth.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>It appears that the church is coming down to earth for the first time.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>This is not to say that we did not come to God as sinners, but that there is a portion in us which is from God and is entirely of God.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>How we must thank the Lord that the New Jerusalem descends out of heaven from God!</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>This city is completely different from the city recorded in chapter seventeen.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>That city is called the great city, and this city is called the holy city.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>The characteristic of Babylon is its greatness, and the characteristic of the New Jerusalem is its holiness.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>Among Christians there are some who are taken up with greatness, but there are some who pay attention to holiness.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>Those who concentrate on greatness are in the principle of Babylon, while those who pay attention to holiness are in the principle of the New Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>What is the meaning of holiness?</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>Since God alone is holy, anything which issues from Him must also be holy.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>Saying that "both He who sanctifies and those who are being sanctified are all of One" means that Christ is holy because He is of the One and that we also are holy because we also are of the One.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>Only those who are of the One are holy.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>Only that which issues from God is of value; that which comes out from God, and only that, is the New Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>Everything that is of man must be left aside.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>The matter of the rapture is based upon this.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>Why will some be left out?</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>It is because they have so many things which are not of Christ, and anything that is not of Christ cannot be brought to heaven.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>Nothing which is not of heaven can return to heaven.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>Everything that is of earth must be left on earth; while everything that is of heaven can return to heaven.</S>
