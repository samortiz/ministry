   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>AFTER GOD S KIND</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Genesis 1:26 says that God created man in His image and after His likeness.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>God created man in this way because it is His intention that He be expressed by man.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Genesis 1 indicates that every living thing was created according to its kind.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Man, however, was made not after his own kind, but after God s kind.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Do you have the boldness to proclaim that, as a human being you are after God s kind?</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>If we realize that we were made in God s image and after God s likeness, we should have the boldness to say that we were created after God s kind.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>However, to say that we are after God s kind does not mean that we are God or that we shall ever become God.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>But according to Genesis 1:26-28, we human beings are after God s kind.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Adam in Genesis 1 had the image of God and the likeness of God, but he did not have the life and nature of God.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Therefore, according to Genesis 2, God placed man in front of the tree of life.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>This indicates that Adam needed to partake of God s life with the divine nature.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Even though Adam had been created in God s image and after His likeness, he still needed to eat of the fruit of the tree of life in order to have eternal life.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>In the first two chapters of Genesis we thus have a complete record of God s creation of man.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>REDEMPTION AND REGENERATION</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Adam in Genesis 1 and 2 did not have eternal life.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Rather, he simply had the human life as a vessel to contain the divine life.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Romans 9 indicates clearly that man is a vessel.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Our human life is a vessel to contain the divine life.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>But before man received the eternal life, he fell.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Therefore, God sent His Son to be a man with blood and flesh to accomplish redemption and to bring fallen man back to God s original purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Redemption thus recovers man to God s purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Hallelujah, through the blood of Christ shed on the cross, we, fallen sinners, have been redeemed!</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Both Romans 3 and Galatians 3 speak of God s marvelous redemption.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Redemption, however, is not an end in itself.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>It is a procedure, part of a process, to reach God s goal of sonship.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>For this reason, both Romans and Galatians indicate that Christ redeemed us that the divine life could be imparted into us for our regeneration.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>We had been created by God, but we still needed to be regenerated.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Although we were created with the human life, we needed to be regenerated with another life, the divine life.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Thus, redemption issues in the impartation of divine life.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>This is regeneration.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>By the regeneration of the Spirit, we become sons of God.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>GOD S CREATURES AND GOD S SONS</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Man in Genesis 1 was only a creature of God.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>He was not yet a son of God.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>According to Genesis 1:26, God created man in His image and after His likeness, but He did not beget man with the divine life at that time.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>There in Genesis 1 God was our Creator, and we were His creatures.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>But after Christ came to accomplish redemption and we believed in Him, His blood made it possible for the divine life to be imparted into us.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>In this way, we were regenerated, and God became our Father.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>In creation God was our Creator, but in regeneration He becomes our Father.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Now, having been regenerated, we are not merely creatures of God we are sons of God.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Hallelujah, God is both our Creator and our Father!</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>As the Creator, He created us, and as the Father, He begot us.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Now we can declare boldly that we not only have the image and likeness of God outwardly, but that we have the life and nature of God inwardly.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>We are living sons of God!</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>God s economy is to impart His very life and nature into us to make us His sons.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>A CREATURE LIFE OR A SON LIFE?</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Now we must come to a crucial point and ask an important question: Since we are sons of God, should we live as God s creatures or as God s sons?</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>In other words, does God want us to live a creature life or a son life?</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>There can be no doubt that God s desire is that we live as sons, not as creatures.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>But how can we live as sons of God?</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>First, to live as a son of God, we must become a son of God.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>The only way to become a son of God is to believe in the Lord Jesus and receive Him.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>John 1:12 says that those who receive Christ have the authority to become children of God.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>As children of God, we have been born not of blood, nor of the will of the flesh, nor of the will of man, but of God John 1:13 .</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Hallelujah, we have become sons of God by believing in the Lord Jesus!</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Now that we have become sons of God we need to realize that we are more than creatures.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>As those who are sons and not merely creatures, we should not live a creature life but a son life.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>There is a great difference between living the life of God s creatures and living the life of God s sons.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>For example, both the Bible and Confucius teach submission.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>But Confucius teaching concerning submission is merely ethical.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>The Bible s teaching about submission is related to our living as sons of God.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>The teaching regarding submission found in the classical writings of Confucius only helps us to live as creatures of God.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>It has nothing to do with living as sons of God.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>No matter to what degree a Chinese person may practice submission according to the teachings of Confucius, he is still living as a creature of God, not as a son of God.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>In one of his writings called The Highest Learning, Confucius speaks of developing and cultivating the bright virtue.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>To him, the highest attainment in ethics was to cultivate this bright virtue.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Nevertheless, no matter how much we may develop this bright virtue according to the teachings of Confucius, we are still creatures of God.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>What Confucius called the bright virtue is actually the conscience.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Thus, to develop the bright virtue is to develop the conscience.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>But even if one develops his conscience to a very high degree, he is still merely a creature of God, because he does not have the life of God.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>However, we who believe in Christ have the divine life and the divine nature.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Now that we are sons of God, it should not be our goal to develop our bright virtue.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>To do this is simply to improve our living as God s creatures.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>Instead of teaching us to improve our living as creatures, the Bible charges us to live as sons of God.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>Ethics improves the human virtues of God s creatures from one angle, and religion develops them from another.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>Both with religion and ethics the principle is the same.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>However, in contrast to both ethics and religion, it is not the goal of God s salvation to develop the virtues of God s creatures.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>First, God s goal in His salvation is to make us sons.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>Second, His goal is to supply us with the divine life that we may grow.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>Third, God Himself as the life-giving Spirit dwells in us to live, move, and work in us.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>The disciples of Confucius may boast in their bright virtue.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>They may be proud of the fact that they have cultivated and developed this virtue.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>However, our boast is not in our bright virtue.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>Our boast is that we have God Himself living in us.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>Due to the influence of our religious background and environment, we Christians may not realize how wealthy we are.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>Our wealth is the Triune God, the Father, the Son, and the Spirit.</S>
