   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE CONCLUSION OF THE NEW TESTAMENT MESSAGE EIGHTY-SEVEN THE SPIRIT HIS WORK 2</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>We have covered the Spirit's work on John the Baptist, on the saints in the transitional period, and in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Next we shall consider the work of the Spirit to convict the world.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Then we shall go on to the many aspects of the Spirit's work in the believers.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>D. TO CONVICT THE WORLD</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>John 16:8-11 reveals that the Spirit works to convict the world, mankind, concerning sin, righteousness, and judgment: "Having come, He will convict the world concerning sin, and concerning righteousness, and concerning judgment: concerning sin, because they do not believe in Me; and concerning righteousness, because I go to the Father and you no longer behold Me; and concerning judgment, because the ruler of this world has been judged."</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The Spirit always convicts the world concerning the three matters of sin, righteousness, and judgment.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Sin entered through Adam Rom 5:12 , righteousness is the resurrected Christ 1 Cor 1:30 , and judgment is for Satan, who is the author and source of sin John 8:44 .</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>We were born of sin in Adam.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The only way to be freed from sin is to believe in Christ, the Son of God.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>If we believe in Him, He will be righteousness to us, and we shall be justified in Him Rom 3:24; 4:25 .</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>If we do not repent of the sin in Adam and believe in Christ the Son of God, we shall remain in sin and share the judgment of Satan for eternity Matt 25:41 .</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>In John 16:8-11 the convicting work of the Spirit is related to three persons: Adam, Christ, and Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>We all became fallen in Adam, but we may believe in Christ and be justified.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Because Christ was accepted by God in His death, God raised Him up from among the dead, and now He becomes righteousness to all who believe in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Satan, the source of death, has been judged and destroyed through Christ's death Heb 2:14 .</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The three main items in these three verses are related to these three persons: sin is related to Adam, righteousness is related to Christ, and judgment is related to Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>We were born of Adam, but we have believed in Christ and have received Him as our righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>However, all those who do not believe in Christ will suffer the judgment of Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Because they remain followers of Satan, they will have the same destiny as Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>When the Spirit comes, He convicts unbelievers, fallen sinners, of sin, righteousness, and judgment.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Sinners, who are born in Adam, must believe in the resurrected Christ so that they may have Him as their righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>If they do not believe, they will be judged by God as Satan is.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>When the gospel is preached in a proper way, those who hear should have the desire not to remain in Adam but to be transferred into Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>These people will then be regenerated and saved.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>To them the convicting Spirit will become the regenerating Spirit John 3:6 , the Spirit of life Rom 8:2 , and the Spirit of reality, dwelling within them John 14:17 .</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The Spirit came to us to convict us of sin, righteousness, and judgment.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>We repented, believed in the Lord Jesus, and escaped the judgment that is upon Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>We have been transferred out of Adam and into Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>We have also become children of God and members of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Now we can be filled and saturated with the Triune God, who is dispensing Himself into us and mingling Himself with us.</S>
