   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>RESURRECTION AND REGENERATION Issue No. 15</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>We must realize that to be resurrected together with the Lord is not an experience which only takes place after regeneration.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Actually, our regeneration is our resurrection together with the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>This is because the death of the Lord, i.e., our dying with Him solved the problem of our sinful life.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>When the Lord resurrected i.e., when we were resurrected with Him , He gave us a new life to commence as Christians.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>For this reason, the Bible says, "God..has regenerated us unto a living hope through the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead" 1 Pet 1:3 .</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Thus, every regenerated Christian is one who has been resurrected with the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>However, the apostle told us in Philippians 3 that a Christian should pursue to "know Him and the power of His resurrection" v. 10 . Many Christians have been regenerated and resurrected together with the Lord, but they lack the manifestation of the power of resurrection.</S>
