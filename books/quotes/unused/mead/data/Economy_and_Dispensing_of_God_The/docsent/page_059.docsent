   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>By the Members' Direct</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Building of the Organic Body of Christ Holding to Truth in Love, Growing Up into</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>the Head, Christ, in All Things</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The perfecting by the gifted persons is for the direct building of the organic Body of Christ by the members of the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>In order to be built up, first we must grow into the Head, Christ, in all things v. 15 . Although some of us may love the Lord very much, we may still hold on to many things that the Lord does not want.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>As we are being perfected, and while we contact the Lord day after day, He will require that we give up some of these things.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>It may be a certain pair of shoes, a certain haircut, or make-up that He requires us to give up.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>If we want to have a part in the work of the New Testament ministry, we must grow up into Him in these things.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Before we go to the barber shop, put on a dress, make any decision, or do anything, we need to pray to the Lord first.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>In this way, we will grow into Christ in all things.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Out from the Head, in the Divine Dispensing,</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>All the Body Joined Closely Together</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>through Every Joint of the Rich Supply,</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>and Knit Together, Interwoven, through</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>the Operation in Measure of Each One Part,</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>in the Divine Dispensing</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>After we have grown up into Christ, something out from Him will be produced.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>This rich supply out from Him will be dispensed into us and will make us either a joint of the rich supply or a particular functioning part in the Body v. 16 . Our human body needs many joints.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>We can stretch our arms and legs in a flexible way because of the many joints in our arms, hands, fingers, legs, feet, and toes.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>In addition, there are the many parts between the joints to function together according to their own measure.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Although the arm may have a large measure, and the little finger may have a small measure, every member functions according to its own measure.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>In the same way, in the Body of Christ, there are many joints of the rich supply who are joined closely together.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>There are also many operating parts who are knit and interwoven together.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Causing the Growth of the Body,</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>in the Dispensing of the Divine Trinity,</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>unto the Building Up of the Body Itself</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>in the Divine Love</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>While the joints are supplying and the different parts are functioning, there will be the growth of the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>This growth of the Body equals the building up of the Body directly by itself.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The Body is not built up directly by the Head, nor is it built up directly by the gifted persons.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>It is built up directly by the perfected and functioning members.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The work of the Head and the work of the gifted persons are indirect; the direct work is done by the members.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>As these members function, the Body grows, and this growth is the building up.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>It is by the way of dispensing that the church as the organic Body of Christ is built up.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The Father is dispensing, the Son is dispensing, and the Spirit is dispensing.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Furthermore, all the gifted ones are dispensing, and all the perfected ones also are dispensing.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>It is through this dispensing of the divine life that the Body grows and builds up itself.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>A message given by Brother Witness Lee in Berkeley, California, on September 1, 1990</S>
