   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Every day there was the newness of manna, the freshness of manna Exo 16:13-15, 21-22 .</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Many people do their grocery shopping once a week.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>They buy their food and put it into the refrigerator for one week.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>But God didn't give manna once a week.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The children of Israel didn't come out of their tents on Monday morning, gather manna, and then put it into the refrigerator to enjoy for one week.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>God sent the manna day by day, early in the morning.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>If you love your bed, you miss the manna.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>You have to rise up every morning to contact the fresh dew since the manna always came down with the dew Exo 16:13-14 .</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>You have to rise early to gather manna every morning.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Every morning it is the same, yet every morning it is fresh.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>I do believe that what was in the heart of the Lord was that His people had to rise up early in the morning to contact Him.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>We have the same Bible every morning, the same manna, but every morning it should be fresh under the fresh dew.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>It all depends on your contacting God.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>If, in your reading of the Bible, there is no contact with God, the same book becomes old.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>If there is the contact with God, the same book becomes new.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>To serve God today is not a matter of oldness, but a matter of newness.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Newness is just God Himself!</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Newness is in God!</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>If you contact God, if you are in God, if you are one with God, whatever you say is new.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>For forty years the same manna came down again and again, but every morning it was new.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>To be new means to be in the presence of God, to be in God.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>We serve God today in the newness of His presence.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>I hate to see the oldness in the church meetings.</S>

   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Whatever we do we must have God in it.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Then we have the newness.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>WALKING ACCORDING TO SPIRIT</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>In Romans 8:4 we are told to walk, not according to the flesh, but according to the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The spirit here in Romans 8:4 is the mingled spirit, our spirit mingled with the Holy Spirit Rom 8:16; 1 Cor 6:17 .</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>We have to walk according to our spirit because today the Holy Spirit is within our spirit and is even one with our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>When we walk according to our spirit, spontaneously we walk according to the Holy Spirit, because the two spirits are one.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Most people walk and do things according to the mind, according to what they think, and according to what they like.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Some who walk according to the flesh are doing sinful things, while others are doing good things according to their mind, their thinking, and their likes and dislikes.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>But we Christians should walk according to the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>It is easy to discern the spirit from the flesh, but sometimes it is not easy to discern the spirit from the mind.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Perhaps, for example, you may be thinking about visiting a brother, but deep within something is bothering you.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>You should walk not according to your thinking or your likes and dislikes, but just according to the "inner red light" or the "inner green light."</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>This is to walk according to your spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The flesh is our fallen body Rom 7:18, 24; 8:13 , and the mind, the thinking organ, is a part of our fallen soul Psa 13:2; 139:14; Lam 3:20 .</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Most people walk according to these two things.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>When they walk in a better way, they walk according to their thinking.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>When they walk in a worse way, they walk according to their flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>We Christians, however, shouldn't walk according to either of these two, but according to spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>We shouldn't care merely for what is good or bad, right or wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>We just care for the inner green or the inner red light.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>We just care for the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>We walk according to spirit.</S>
