   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Everything Being Arranged</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>for the Purpose of God Mingling Himself into Us</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The mind of today's Christian is too far away from God's heart.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>We should not obey the inner feeling merely for the sake of being a proper man or to please God, but we should do it to allow God to mingle Himself with us.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>God is exercising His multifarious wisdom to work Himself into us.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>God loves us.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>This is why He arranges everything, and He uses our husbands, wives, and children as the means to mingle Himself into us.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Real Grace Being to Possess God</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>One sister said that God loved her so much that He gave her a lovely little baby.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>After fifteen years, the lovely baby became a sore mischief.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>God's greatest love in the universe is His giving Himself to us.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Children are not the real grace.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Money is not the real grace.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The Bible says that everything is vanity, and it is dung.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>If God gives us these vain things as grace, is He not deceiving us?</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Some have said that God has blessed them and has given them so much money at the end of the year: what immense grace God has bestowed upon them.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>How can anyone say that it is grace when his hands are filled with so much dung?</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The real grace is God.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Jesus is the real grace.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>True grace is when a person gains more of God through his relationship with his wife and when he gains more knowledge about God through his job.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Not a Question of Good and Evil,</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>but a Question of God Working Himself into Man</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Luke 14:26 says, "If anyone...does not hate his own father and mother and wife and children and brothers and sisters...."</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>This shows us that God wants us to hate.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>He has a heart to hate.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>How many people have you ever hated?</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Have you ever hated your daughter-in-law?</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Have you ever hated your sons?</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>God cannot come into you because you have loved your sons too much.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>If you would hate a little, God would come in. Your hatred will allow God to gain something in you.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>In order for God to come into man, it is right sometimes even to hate.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>God created everything.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>He spoke, and things came into being.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>How beautiful are the flowers in the field.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Man does not need to add anything to them.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Man can only produce artificial flowers.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>I am not speaking heresy here.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Nor am I joking here.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>I know what I am saying.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The New Jerusalem in eternity does not come out all of a sudden.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>It is the cumulative masterpiece of God throughout the ages.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>By nature we are clay.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>But after God has passed through us, we become gold, pearl, and precious stones.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>God's presence is within us.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>His element is in our minds and our emotions.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Today, our Savior in heaven still bears His humanity.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>When the Word became flesh, He brought in a mingling of God with man.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Now as the flesh becoming the Word again, He mingled man with God.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>The result of this is gold and precious stones.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>If I merely teach others to be good wives and good husbands, my work is surely wood, grass, and stubble.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Gold signifies God's nature.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Precious stones signify God's glorious image.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>God is doing only one thing today: to cause the man of clay to become gold and precious stones.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>God does not try to teach man to be good, in the same way that He does not try to teach man to be evil.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>All these things belong to the tree of good and evil; they do not belong to the tree of life.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>To honor one's parents is the good of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, and to dishonor one's parents is the evil of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>To love is the good of that tree, and to hate is the evil of that tree.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>The fruit of the date tree is good, but the branches have offensive thorns.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>The dates can be compared to the good, and the thorns can be compared to the evil; they all come from the same tree.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>God is not pleased with either good or evil.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>From the day that we are saved, God begins to work in us.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>He continues to work in us all the way until we are glorified and raptured.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>By that time we will not see our good, in the same way that we will not see our evil.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>By that time we will see only the gold and the precious stones, which are simply God Himself.</S>
