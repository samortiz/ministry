<h2 class="head2">Supplying the Truth concerning the Son</h2>
<p>The bread-breaking meeting needs a spiritual supply that comes from our knowledge of Christ the Son and our knowledge of the Father. In regard to our knowledge of the Son, many essential points need to be presented, spanning from eternity past to eternity future. Many details are involved in this chronology, but we can look only at the main points. For example, the Lord is the Word of God, the light, the Creator, the seed of the woman, and so on. The book of Isaiah speaks of Him as Immanuel who was born of a virgin (7:14), and also as a child born to us, a Son given to us, the Mighty God, and the Eternal Father (9:6). Many saints lack a thorough knowledge of these verses concerning the Lord Jesus; therefore, we need to present these verses point by point so that the Spirit can work in the saints to bring them into a richer knowing of the Lord.</p>
<h2 class="head3">The Lord Being the Eternal God</h2>
<p>We need a series of messages that begin by focusing on the eternal nature of the Lord. The Lord is eternal; He is the eternal Lord. This truth can be presented in five verse portions, including Micah 5:2; John 1:1 and 14; Isaiah 9:6; Hebrews 1:10-12; and 7:3.</p>
<p>Micah 5:2 says, &ldquo;You, O Bethlehem Ephrathah, / So little to be among the thousands of Judah, / From you there will come forth to Me / He who is to be Ruler in Israel; / And His goings forth are from ancient times, / From the days of eternity.&rdquo; According to Matthew 2:1-6, this verse in Micah refers to the coming Christ, that is, the Lord Jesus. There are three main points in Micah 5:2: first, His place of birth; second, His coming to be the Ruler for God; and third, His source being from ancient times, from the days of eternity. We will focus on the third point, the eternal nature of the Lord. The verse says that the Lord&rsquo;s goings forth are from ancient times. This means that His source is in eternity. Although He was born in time at a certain place, in a definite point of time and space, He is from ancient times, and the source of His existence is from eternity.</p>
<p>There are two phrases in this verse that speak of the Lord&rsquo;s eternal nature. The first phrase is <em>ancient times,</em> which denotes eternity. Psalm 90:2 says, &ldquo;From eternity to eternity, You are God.&rdquo; This means that the Lord is outside of time and space. In the Bible the expression <em>eternity</em> has the connotation of infinity, fullness, and completeness. The Lord is not limited by time or space. Although He was born as a man in time and space in the small town of Bethlehem, His source is infinite and eternal, transcending time and space. The second phrase <em>days of eternity</em> refers to the period before time began, a state that has no beginning. The Savior, who was born in the small town of Bethlehem, is the eternal One. He exists in eternity without beginning, before time even began. His source is without beginning; it is eternal.</p>
<p>John 1:1 and 14 also speak of the eternal nature of the Lord. Verse 1 says, &ldquo;In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God,&rdquo; and verse 14 says, &ldquo;The Word became flesh and tabernacled among us.&rdquo; Although these verses present a contrast in terms of time, both refer to the Son. Verse 1 says that the Son, as the Word, was in the beginning, that He is God Himself. The Son is God in eternity without beginning and before the beginning of time. Verse 14 says that the Word became flesh; He became a man and dwelt among us. Even though He is the Word, the eternal God Himself, He became flesh in time and came among us as a man. On one hand, He is a man, and on the other hand, He is the Word, God Himself. Although He became flesh and was born in time, He is the God who exists in eternity.</p>
<p>Isaiah 9:6 says, &ldquo;A child is born to us, / A Son is given to us; / And the government / Is upon His shoulder; / And His name will be called / Wonderful Counselor, / Mighty God, / Eternal Father.&rdquo; There are parallel contrasts in this verse. The verse begins by speaking of the Lord as a child and a Son, and it ends by speaking of Him as the Mighty God and Eternal Father. <em>Mighty God</em> is in parallel contrast to the word <em>child,</em> and <em>Eternal Father</em> is in parallel contrast to the word <em>Son.</em> This is wonderful. This verse speaks of the Lord Jesus as the Son and as the Father. He is a child and the Mighty God. When speaking of the Father, there is also emphasis on <em>Eternal,</em> which shows that the Lord&rsquo;s source is eternal. The Lord Jesus, who was manifested as the Son, is the Father in eternity; His source is in eternity. Although He is the Son given to us, He is also the Father in eternity.</p>
<p>In John 14:9 the Lord said, &ldquo;He who has seen Me has seen the Father.&rdquo; He also said, &ldquo;I and the Father are one&rdquo; (10:30). This is the fulfillment of the prophecy in Isaiah 9:6. The Son who was manifested in time is the Eternal Father. The Son who was given to us in time is the Father in eternity, which has no beginning. When He came into time and was given to us, He was revealed as the Son. The Son given to us in time is the Father in eternity. This shows that the Lord is eternal; He is not only the Son but also the Father.</p>
<p>Hebrews 1:10-12, which is a quotation of Psalm 102:25-27, says, &ldquo;You in the beginning, Lord, laid the foundation of the earth, and the heavens are the works of Your hands; they will perish, but You remain perpetually; and they all will become old like a garment, and like a mantle You will roll them up; like a garment they will also be changed; but You are the same, and Your years will not fail.&rdquo; In the first part of these verses <em>Lord</em> refers to the Lord Jesus, who laid the foundation of the earth and made the heavens through the works of His hands. This proves that before the heavens and the earth came into being, He existed; He created the heavens and the earth. Moreover, the heavens and the earth will perish, but He will remain perpetually. The first part of these verses speaks of His existence before the heavens and the earth came into being, and the second part speaks of His existence after the heavens and the earth pass away. Thus, both His existence in eternity past and His existence in eternity future are mentioned. He is the One who exists from eternity to eternity, without beginning or end. The heavens and the earth will change, but He is the same; His years will not fail. This proves that He is the eternal Lord.</p>
<p>Hebrews 7:3 says, &ldquo;Having neither beginning of days nor end of life, but likened to the Son of God.&rdquo; <em>Having neither beginning of days nor end of life</em> confirms that the Lord is without beginning or end, existing from eternity to eternity.</p>
<p>Simply presenting these verses without much explanation is sufficient. The brothers and sisters need to realize that even though our Lord was born in a small town, His source was from ancient times, from the days of eternity. He is the Word who was in the beginning before time, but He became a man in time and dwelt among us. Although He is the Son given to us in time, He is also the Eternal Father. Before the heavens and the earth came into being, He existed, and when the heavens and the earth pass away, He will remain perpetually. He has neither beginning of days nor end of life; He is without beginning or ending. We should memorize these verses about the Lord&rsquo;s eternal nature.</p>
