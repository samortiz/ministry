   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>He is also the shadow of a massive rock in a wasted land v.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>2 .</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>A wasted land is a desert, but not a natural desert.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>A natural desert was not made that way by human hands, but a wasted land has been touched by some, wasted by some.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Because this wasted land is full of heat, there is the need of a shadow.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>This shadow in a land full of heat functions like today's air conditioner.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>We need Christ as such a shadow to be a canopy over us.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Our Christ is wonderful!</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>As the man Jesus, He is our King, our refuge, our covering, our streams of water, and our shadow, our shade.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>He is so practical to us in our daily life.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Isaiah 33:22 says that He is our Judge, our Lawmaker, and our King to save us.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>In His divine government, He is such a person of three aspects.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The United States government is divided into three sections in a similar way.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>This government has three branches: the executive, legislative, and judicial branches.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>In the past I thought that the United States invented such a marvelous government with the balance of powers.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Eventually, I found out that according to Isaiah 33:22, God had already practiced this.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Christ as the King is the executive branch of the divine government.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>He is also the Lawmaker, the Legislator, as the legislative branch.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Finally, He is our Judge as the judicial branch.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>He is in these three aspects to exercise His divine government in saving His people.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>In the United States government these three branches are always balancing one another, but many times they fight against one another.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The Lord Jesus in His divine government, however, is perfectly balanced in every way.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The three sections of the divine government are one person.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Our Jesus is the executive, legislative, and judicial branches in His divine government.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Whatever is in the Bible is much superior to man's invention.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The system of communism was formulated by Karl Marx according to the biblical practice in Acts 2 of the believers having all things common v. 44 . But history has shown that the practice of communism does not work.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>God gave the children of Israel a way to balance the wealth in the Old Testament, and He does this in a spiritual way in the New Testament 2 Cor 8:14-15 , but fallen man has no way of practicing this in the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Nothing in human culture can exceed what is mentioned in the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Nothing can compete with the divine revelation in the Bible because the Bible is the writing of our God, who knows everything.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The Bible shows us all the riches of the all-inclusive Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Isaiah tells us that our Savior, Christ, is a King to reign according to righteousness and to rule according to justice.</S>

   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Furthermore, He is the judicial, legislative, and executive branches in His divine government.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>He is everything.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>In addition to these items, He is the stone.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>He is also our glory as a crown and our beauty as a diadem.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>He is our wonderful, all-inclusive Christ.</S>
