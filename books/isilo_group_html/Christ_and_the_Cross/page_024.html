<p>Christ went to God to receive the kingdom, but He will not remain there; He went &ldquo;to receive...a kingdom and to return&rdquo; (Luke 19:12). When the time comes, that is, at the blowing of the seventh trumpet, Christ will go forth from heaven with His dominion, glory, and kingdom and will return to the earth to be manifested as the King of kings. He will break and shatter the nations on the earth with His might and destroy all rebellious powers (Rev. 19:11-16). Thus, the kingdom of the world will become His kingdom (11:15). Then His kingdom and dominion will be fully manifested on the earth (12:10).</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE KINGDOM EXPRESSING<br />
CHRIST&rsquo;S DOMINION AND GLORY</h2>
<p>Daniel 7:14 says, &ldquo;To Him was given dominion, glory, and a kingdom, / That all the peoples, nations, and languages might serve Him. / His dominion is an eternal dominion, which will not pass away; / And His kingdom is one that will not be destroyed.&rdquo; This verse connects dominion, glory, and kingdom, indicating that they have a special relationship. In order for glory to be expressed, someone must reign, and in order to reign, there must be a kingdom. This is logical. A kingdom is a realm in which someone reigns, and glory is expressed through reigning in such a realm. Hence, the kingdom refers to the realm in which Christ&rsquo;s dominion and glory are expressed. Although to a small degree Christ&rsquo;s dominion and glory are now expressed in the church, this expression is weak, spiritual, and hidden; it is not visible to the physical eye. In the future the expression of Christ&rsquo;s dominion and glory through the kingdom will be strong, solid, and visible. On that day people will see and know Christ&rsquo;s dominion and glory.</p>
<p>The church is the Body of Christ (Col. 1:24); it is an organism that expresses the life of Christ. Although the church has the glory of Christ, this glory is mysterious and hidden. The kingdom is a realm in which Christ&rsquo;s dominion is expressed. The glory of Christ is not only in the kingdom; His glory is openly manifested in the kingdom. When the church is mentioned, we are reminded of Christ&rsquo;s life, but when the kingdom is mentioned, we should be reminded of Christ&rsquo;s dominion and glory.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE KINGDOM FOCUSING ON CHRIST AS THE KING</h2>
<p>When the kingdom is manifested, Christ will be &ldquo;the King of glory&rdquo; (Psa. 24:7-10). When He judges all the nations living on the earth, He will be the King sitting on &ldquo;the throne of His glory&rdquo; (Matt. 25:31-34). In the kingdom He will sit on &ldquo;the throne of His glory&rdquo; (19:28) and reign for a thousand years over the nations on the earth, with the divine and heavenly authority that God has given to Him (Rev. 2:27). He will also execute justice and righteousness in the land (Jer. 23:5). At that time the overcoming believers will be His companions reigning with Him (Rev. 20:4, 6). The remnant of the Jews saved in the future will be priests on earth, teaching the nations on His behalf (Isa. 2:2-3; Zech. 8:20-23). These nations are the sheep, those who heard the eternal gospel to fear God and who treated the Christians and Jews well during the great tribulation (Matt. 25:31-40; Rev. 14:6-7). These nations will be the people on the earth and will be guided by the Jews to obey and serve Christ. In the age of the kingdom, the time of the restoration of all things (Acts 3:21), Christ as the King of glory will be the center of everything, and His glory will be expressed through His dominion (Matt. 6:13).</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE KINGDOM USHERING IN ETERNITY FOR CHRIST</h2>
<p>The expression of Christ among men began with His incarnation and will consummate in eternity. As the Word, He became flesh and accomplished redemption on the cross. The cross produces the church, the church brings in the kingdom, and the kingdom ushers in eternity. Although Christ was expressed in His incarnation, this expression is not as adequate as His expression in the church. However, the church cannot express Him as adequately as the kingdom, nor can the kingdom express Him as adequately as eternity. In other words, in relation to Christ, the church cannot match the kingdom, nor can the kingdom match eternity future. Christ needs incarnation, the church, the kingdom, and eternity future. The kingdom expresses His dominion and glory in a fuller way than the church, but this expression is still not sufficient. His expression needs a realm that is larger and better than the kingdom. He needs eternity future, infinity, in order to have the fullest expression. This expression will be ushered in by the coming kingdom.</p>
<p>In the last days of the kingdom Christ will deal with Satan and the last rebellion of mankind to clear up all powers in the universe that oppose God (Rev. 20:7-10). Then He will deliver up the kingdom to God (1 Cor. 15:24). The kingdom will thus be ended, eternity will begin, and Christ will enter into His fullest and ultimate expression.</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_023.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_025.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Christ and the Cross &nbsp; pg 24</div><br></body></html>
