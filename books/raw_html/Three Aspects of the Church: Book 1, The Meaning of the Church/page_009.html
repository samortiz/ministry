	 <h2 class="head3">Becoming Holy</h2>
<p>In the Chinese Union Version, the expression <em>to be holy</em> in Ephesians 1:4 is translated &ldquo;to be holy and clean.&rdquo; Most people in Christianity have the concept that holiness is cleanness. But the meaning of the word <em>holy</em> in the original languages of the Bible, both in the Hebrew of the Old Testament and in the Greek of the New Testament, focuses more on the aspect of being holy than on being clean or pure. The Chinese translators of the Bible, for the sake of convenience, added the character for <em>clean</em> to the character for <em>holy</em> to coin a new expression <em>holy and clean.</em> Strictly speaking, the character for <em>clean</em> should be replaced by the character for <em>separated.</em> The phrase <em>holy and separated</em> is closer to the original meaning of <em>holiness</em> because holiness does not have the sense of cleanness but of separation. A person who is holy is not merely clean but also separated. Because of the presence of the word <em>clean</em> in the Chinese Union Version, people according to their natural concept think of cleanness when they hear of being &ldquo;holy and clean.&rdquo; This is an inaccurate expression. We should use <em>holy and separated</em> rather than <em>holy and clean.</em></p>
<p>God Himself is holy. He is absolutely holy and distinct from everything else. God&rsquo;s heart is love, and God&rsquo;s nature is holy. God&rsquo;s nature is related to His essence. Just as the nature of a wooden table is wood and the nature of an iron rod is iron, so also God&rsquo;s nature is holiness. To be holy is to be different and distinct from everything else. Holiness is not only different from filthiness, but it is also different from cleanness. Being holy is not merely different from being evil, but it is also different from being good. For instance, the nature of gold is distinct from any other thing; it is distinct from the filthy things in us, and it is also distinct from the cleanest thing in us. It is distinct from the evil things, as well as from the best thing. The word <em>holiness</em> is used altogether in terms of the nature of God. The Bible always uses pure gold to represent God&rsquo;s nature because gold is different in essence from that of all other created things and is distinct from everything else. Thus, the distinct nature of gold symbolizes God&rsquo;s holy nature. Hence, holiness refers to God Himself, God&rsquo;s nature. For us to become holy involves the following two points.</p>
<h2 class="head4">Its First Significance&mdash;<em>Being Separated unto God</h2>
<p>God in His eternal plan desires the church to be made holy, to be sanctified, to be separated. In a shallow sense, this means that the church is to be separated unto God. In the Old Testament whenever the word <em>holy</em> is mentioned, it bears the meaning of being separated unto God. For example, tens of thousands of oxen and lambs were in the hands of the secular people and were used by them. Then one day an ox or a lamb would be brought into the tabernacle of God and put on the altar of God; the ox or lamb would then become separated and sanctified unto God. In God&rsquo;s plan He wants the church to be holy, meaning that He wants to separate the church from all the created things unto Himself. This superficial aspect is the first meaning of being made holy.</p>
<h2 class="head4">Its Second Significance&mdash;Being Mingled with God</h2>
<p>Ephesians 2 and 3 show that there is a deeper significance to being made holy, that is, God desires to be mingled with man. God desires that men of clay would be changed into pure gold. Whatever is made of clay is common; however, whatever is made of gold is holy. We were once of clay and thus common, but God desires to make us pure gold, to make us holy. Genesis 2 illustrates this thought. God created man out of clay and placed this man of clay in front of the tree of life. From the tree of life flowed a river in which there was an abundance of pure gold. This implies that God desires to transform a man of clay into pure gold by means of His life. In Revelation 21 we see a city of pure gold&mdash;the New Jerusalem. The New Jerusalem is a city made entirely of pure gold, while its wall is of precious stones, and its gates are pearls. The city proper is pure gold, and the street in the city is also pure gold. This indicates that when God&rsquo;s work is complete, the entire church will be pure gold, that is, it will be completely holy. At that time we will know that the entire church has been transformed from clay into gold; in other words, the entire church will be entirely transformed with the element of God into the element of God.</p>
<p>The Bible reveals that the sanctification recorded in Genesis is completed in Revelation. The &ldquo;treasure in earthen vessels&rdquo; in 2 Corinthians 4:7 refers to the process that is carried out between Genesis and Revelation. We, the created earthen vessels, are gradually being transformed in nature, and eventually, we will fully become the treasure, the gold. It is not enough for us merely to be distinct from other people. We still must ask ourselves how much we have been transformed inwardly. The significance of sanctification is not merely that we have been separated outwardly and that we serve God; rather, it is that God lives in us and is transforming us. Sanctification is the result of God transforming us through His life in us. This is the sanctification that takes place in our living, a practical sanctification, an inward sanctification, and a complete sanctification.</p>
<p>Hence, the first significance of sanctification is to be separated unto God, and the second significance is to be mingled with God to become the image of God. However, this is not merely a doctrine that is applied spiritually; instead, it is a reality. It begins with separation and is completed with a change in nature; this is an inward transformation of life (2 Cor. 3:18). In terms of separation, we are all sanctified, but in terms of a change in our nature, our &ldquo;flavor of clay&rdquo; is still strong. For example, a brother may be well behaved, pure in actions, and impeccable in his dealings with others, but when we contact him, we sense a flavor of clay and commonness in him. His humility, meekness, considerateness towards others, and blamelessness are earthly, human, and full of the flavor of commonness. Secular people may praise this kind of person, but those who have a spiritual nose can smell that he is altogether of clay, not proper or holy.</p>
<p>We may not be able to easily find good points in another brother. We may find it difficult to say that he is humble or meek, but when we contact him, we sense that he has the flavor of God, and we sense the presence of God. This person is different from other people. He is not ordinary but extraordinary. This kind of condition is holiness. This person has been mingled with God. The degree to which a person has been mingled with God is the degree to which he has been sanctified. When we contact a person who knows God and allows God to work in him, we can sense the flavor of God even though we may not be able to speak with certainty of his good points. Nevertheless, there is something special in him. We cannot say whether it is humility, meekness, or another virtue; however, we touch and sense God in him. This is to be holy, and this is God Himself.</p>
<p>The church must attain to the goal of sanctification in God&rsquo;s plan. One day the church will be extraordinary and distinct from all other things in the entire universe; the church will be pure gold. The New Jerusalem is also called the holy city (Rev. 21:2), because the city is built up through the transformation work of God, and its inward element is God Himself. Such a condition is sanctification; in the New Jerusalem there is no flavor of clay. If we have this vision, we will see that today in Christianity too many things have been brought in that are of clay, are common, and are not of God. The church is holy and cannot be mingled with anything common. For this reason, all our conduct, work, administration, and leading in the church must not be carried out with worldly methods. The church is holy, not common. The church is not a pile of clay bricks but a transformed city of pure gold.</p>
