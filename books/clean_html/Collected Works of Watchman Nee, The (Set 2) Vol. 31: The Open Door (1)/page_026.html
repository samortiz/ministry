<h2 class="head1">A WORD ON BEHALF OF THE EDITOR</h2><p>(1) Mr. Watchman Nee has been busy in various places for the work. Presently, he is traveling between Hankow, Canton, Hong Kong, and Shanghai. In the near future he may go to K'un-ming or England. Therefore, beginning with Issue No. 3, I will take his place as the editor. Although Mr. Nee still bears the responsibility of this publication, I cannot shrink from any blame for any imperfections that may appear during this period of substitution.</p><p>(2) Since I have to take charge of this publication, and since the war has made conditions so critical, I will try my best to publish news about the work and about the church, beginning with Issue No. 3. We can only wait for a later date to publish articles on the principles of the work. The "Question and Answer" column will have to be postponed. If we receive any questions, we will save the answers for these questions for later issues.</p><p>(3) Beginning with Issue No. 2, we have used #5 characters. If anyone cannot read it because of poor eyesight, we hope that others can read it to him and update him this way.</p><p>(4) The whereabouts of the co-workers are limited to what we know. We advise the co-workers to tell us ahead of time or as they travel concerning their itinerary so that we may publish them accordingly.</p><p>(5) Please note that we have published the correspondence address of each writer at the end of almost every letter in order to facilitate communication and to help those who are seeking refuge to find the meeting places easily.</p><p>(6) The war zone is so wide and conditions change day by day. We therefore ask the brothers and sisters to pay attention to a few things:</p><p class="indent1">(a) The co-workers, as well as many other saints, are very concerned and are very interested in knowing about the condition of individual brothers and sisters in and around the war zones! Please do your best to communicate your news to us. Letters are often delayed. It would be better if you could send us your report by express mail or airmail.</p><p class="indent1">(b) In your letter you should clearly mark the date and the month. The address must be clearly legible. If you are in another province, clearly mark the name of the province where you are.</p><p class="indent1">(c) As soon as you know of any change of address of any brother or sister, please inform us immediately, because we have no idea where the brothers and sisters have fled when fighting erupts. Once the news is cut off, we become very concerned. We also do not want to lose the mail by sending it to a wrong address.</p><p>(7) Presently, this publication is being compiled as we move around. It is still being printed and mailed out from Hankow. Those who want to subscribe to it should write directly to Hankow. Any news concerning the work or the churches should be sent to The Gospel Book Room, P. O. Box 84, Hankow. For the present time, if you send anything by airmail, you can send it to Mrs. Yuen in Chungking, who will transfer it to me.</p><p>(8) This issue was compiled at the end of December 1937. It will probably be published by the middle of January. All the dates and months, therefore, refer to the previous year. If possible, we hope to put out one issue per month this year.</p><p>Ruth Lee,<br />New Year of 1938 in Chungking</p><h2 class="head1">ANNOUNCEMENTS</h2><p>(1) This publication is temporarily published in Hankow. We have reserved a post office box. In the future any news of the work or the churches or any subscription or questions should be sent directly to: Gospel Book Room, P. O. Box 84, Hankow.</p><p>(2) Presently, the post offices in Shanghai and Hankow do not accept bulky, printed material. No book or magazine can be mailed out as is. Furthermore, mail takes a great deal of time and can sometimes be lost. We hope that the brothers and sisters will accommodate this inconvenience!</p><p>(3) Although Issue Nos. 13 and 14 of The Christian are ready, we are still considering whether or not we should print them now because mail service is so unreliable and because many readers of The Christian have moved. As soon as the address of a reader changes, you should inform the Gospel Book Room in Shanghai, and when the magazine is published, we will send it to the correct address.</p><p>(4) Concerning the relief offering for the brothers and sisters who are in need due to the war, these funds are for all the places, not for Shanghai alone. The monies received in the past from all the churches have been distributed by Brother Watchman Nee and the co-workers. Although the amounts were not significant, they were better than nothing. Now the war zone has spread, and there are even more unemployed or dispossessed saints. We pray that the Lord will grant us more grace to care for the brothers and sisters in tribulation. If you want to send any money, please send it to Miss Ruth Lee, P. O. Box 84, Hankow.</p><h1 class="series">* * *</h1><p>The emphasis of The Open Door is on the gospel work in all the places. In this publication, we publish:</p><p>(1) Articles on the principle of the work</p><p>(2) News of the work</p><p>(3) News of the churches</p><p>Temporarily we are situated in Hankow.
