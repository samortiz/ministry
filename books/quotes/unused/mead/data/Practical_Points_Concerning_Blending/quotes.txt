[1]  CONTENTS The Purpose of the Blending The Need of the Blending The Significance of the Blending The Reality of the Body of Christ 1 The Reality of the Body of Christ 2
[2]  This book is composed of messages given by Brother Witness Lee in Anaheim, California on May 27-30, 1994.
[3]  Hymns: #837, #840 OUTLINE The eternal economy of God: To produce an organic Body to be an organism to God for His increase and expression.
[4]  In this message my burden is to fellowship with you concerning the purpose of the blending.
[5]  We may speak much about the Body of Christ, but if we are asked what the Body of Christ is, we may be able to answer only that the Body of Christ is the church.
[6]  It is easy to know the church because it is visible.
[7]  But to know the Body of Christ is not easy.
[8]  At that time I heard the term the Body of Christ and I came to know the doctrine of the Body of Christ, but I did not see the reality of the Body of Christ.
[9]  Hymns: #501, #841 OUTLINE The regular procedures of the church work in the Lord's recovery today: Begetting to have sinners saved and regenerated to become the members of Christ 1 Cor 4:15b; Matt 28:19.
[10]  The need of the blending for the building up of the Body of Christ: To blend all the local churches together as one, as many as possible, in the processed Triune God, the pneumatic Christ, and the consummated Spirit.
[11]  My burden in this message concerns the need of the blending.
[12]  Even among us who are in the recovery, not many have the realization that we need the blending, and we need it desperately.
[13]  I said, "Lord, I must confess to You and admit that although I saw the Body of Christ and I preached and taught the Body of Christ for years, even I myself am not very much in the reality of the Body of Christ."
[14]  In today's education the goal is not merely to finish elementary school and junior high school and then to graduate from high school.
[15]  The thought of blending is very strong in the Bible.
[16]  Scripture Reading: Gal 1:4, 13-14; Phil 3:3-8, 10; 2 Cor 3:6 Hymns: #541, #539, #976 OUTLINE Not an organization of any nature.
[17]  But an organic building of the God-men who are perfected in life as the representatives of a local church, as Zion within Jerusalem, and who live the reality of the Body of Christ.
[18]  The British Brethren stressed very much that the seven local churches in Asia, spoken of in Revelation 2 and 3, were different, independent, and autonomous.
[19]  Some even said that there is not only the local church but also the local Body.
[20]  We need to see that there is something on this earth structured as a kind of organic constitution which is called the Body of Christ, and this Body of Christ is the organism of the unseen God.
[21]  This is not an exchange, because Paul went on to say, "And the life which I now live in the flesh I live in faith, the faith in the Son of God " v. 20b . Paul was a person living not by himself but by the pneumatic Christ, and this pneumatic Christ is the all-inclusive Spirit, who is the consummation of the processed and consummated Triune God.
[22]  CHAPTER FOUR THE REALITY OF THE BODY OF CHRIST 1
[23]  Now, what is the reality of the Body of Christ?
[24]  In brief, the reality of the Body of Christ is a kind of corporate living, not a living by any individual.
[25]  A CORPORATE LIVING OF THE CONFORMITY TO THE DEATH OF CHRIST THROUGH THE POWER OF THE RESURRECTION OF CHRIST
[26]  In Philippians 3 Paul said that he lived a life conformed to the death of Christ v. 10 . The death of Christ is a mold, and Paul put himself into that death-mold to be conformed there.
[27]  CHAPTER FIVE THE REALITY OF THE BODY OF CHRIST 2 OUTLINE The corporate living by the perfected God-men, who are genuine men but are not living by their life, but by the life of the processed God, whose attributes have been expressed through their virtues.
[28]  The mingling living, in the eternal union, of the regenerated, transformed, and glorified tripartite God-men with the Triune God who is the pneumatic Christ as the embodiment of the processed and consummated Triune God, who is the all-inclusive Spirit as the reality of the pneumatic Christ and the consummation of the processed Triune God in the resurrection of Christ, of which the life-giving Spirit is the reality and which imparts the consummated God and releases the death-overcoming life into the believers.
[29]  The apostle Paul told us in the Epistles that Christ as the Spirit indwells us, and he went on to tell us that He not only indwells us but also makes His home in our hearts Eph 3:17 .
[30]  A MUTUAL LIVING WITH CHRIST WHO LIVES IN US
[31]  We need to live a life with Christ who lives in us, to have a mutual abiding, a mutual building, a mutual living.
[32]  Paul said, "I am crucified with Christ; and it is no longer I who live, but it is Christ who lives in me."
[33]  By that time all the God-redeemed people will be transformed, not only to be the same as God in life and nature, but also to be the same in God's appearance.
[34]  Revelation 4 tells us that God looks like jasper v. 3 . Then Revelation 21 says that the entire New Jerusalem has the appearance of jasper v. 11 . Thus, God's redeemed people have become absolutely the very God in life, in nature, and in appearance, but not in His Godhead.
