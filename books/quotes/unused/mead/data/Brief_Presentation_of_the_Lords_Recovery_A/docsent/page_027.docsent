   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>C. The Fellowship</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>for the Lord's Unique Recovery</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>We always need to remember that we are in the Lord's recovery and that His recovery is unique.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>There is not another recovery, just as there is not another Body of Christ or another New Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The fellowship of the apostles is the fellowship for this unique recovery of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>When we see something going on in the recovery which is not so good, we need to have this kind of fellowship and a proper attitude.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>When a man marries someone, he is bound to her for as long as he lives.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>If he is unhappy with her, he cannot divorce her.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>He should try the best to help his wife by fellowshipping to improve in a nice and living way.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>He should not charge her to improve but help her to improve.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>This is the right way.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>When we see something wrong in the recovery or in any of the local churches, we should try the best to help the situation by fellowshipping so that it can be improved and corrected.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>If there is anything wrong, we can and should fellowship and pray together and seek the Lord's leading to improve the situation for the benefit of all the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>This will be a real help to the Lord's recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>We should not have the thought that we can do a particular work according to our way in the recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>We may be very gifted and have a large capacity to work out something.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>But what we work out may be the same as worldly people carrying out a certain enterprise.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>We have to realize that in the Lord's recovery there is only one work.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>When I came into the recovery, I realized what the recovery was and that it was uniquely one.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The one who brought the recovery to China among us was Brother Watchman Nee.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>If I would not have taken the way of the recovery, I could have had a work in northern China, but I gave that up.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>I fully realized that the Lord has only one Body, one work, one Bible, one revelation, and one current, one flow, in one fellowship.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>At that time Brother Nee was being used by the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>I never tried to speak anything different from his teaching.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>This does not mean that I did not have any other teachings, but my speaking always followed Brother Nee's speaking in order to keep the unique fellowship in the Lord's unique recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>I felt that it was a glory to participate in the Lord's recovery in such a subjective way with Brother Nee.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>I thank the Lord that He had mercy upon me in helping me to have the best choice.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>In Moses' blessing in Deuteronomy 33, there is the term "the choicest things" vv.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>13-16 .</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>I realize that the Lord has been giving me the choicest things throughout my years in the recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>This is due to His mercy in placing me and keeping me all the time in His recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>As long as we are preserved in the Lord's way, we are preserved in the oneness in the unique fellowship.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>There is only one Lord, one Body, one Bible, one divine revelation, one speaking, one recovery, one fellowship, and one way to practice the recovery.</S>
