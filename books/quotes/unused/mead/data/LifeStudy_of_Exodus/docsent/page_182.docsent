   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>3.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>A Process of Divine Conception</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Because the truths in the Bible are so profound, we cannot understand them unless we use illustrations and parables.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>This is true of what the Bible says about how the life of God enters into us.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>God s life does not come into us like water poured into a glass.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>We receive God s life through a process of divine conception.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The fact that we are born of God John 1:12-13 indicates that God s life comes into us through conception.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Birth always involves the conceiving of life.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>I have been condemned for teaching the mingling of God with man.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Let me ask, how could we be conceived of God and born of God without being mingled with God?</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>John 3:6 says, That which is born of the flesh is flesh, and that which is born of the Spirit is spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Our physical life is a portrait of spiritual life.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>In principle, spiritual birth is the same as physical birth.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Both kinds of birth involve the conceiving of life.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Through conception and birth, we have received the life of God.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>In the Lord s recovery we emphasize the subjective aspects of the truth in the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Many religious ones are offended by this.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Pointing to the fact that Christ is great, that He has been glorified and enthroned in the heavens, they ask how such an exalted Christ could be our food.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Some even mock us, asking what is our basis for saying that Christ is edible.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>In their blindness, they ignore the subjective truth that Christ, the bread of life, is indeed edible.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>He Himself said, He who eats Me shall also live because of Me John 6:57 .</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Eating Christ and living because of Him certainly are very subjective matters.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>C. Two Illustrations of Oneness 1.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Grafting</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>We have seen that it is God s life which makes us one with God.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>This oneness in life can be illustrated by the grafting of a branch from one tree into another tree.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Grafting involves a metabolic process.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Dead sticks can be nailed together, glued together, or tied together, but they cannot be grafted together.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Only living things can be grafted.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Two substances that are to be grafted together must be similar in life.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>We know that our natural human life is not the same as the divine life.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>It is a principle according to Genesis 1 that each life is according to its kind.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>But even though the human life is not the divine life, it was created according to the divine life, for man was made in God s image and according to His likeness.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Only the human life, not any other kind of life, was made according to God.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Because the human life and the divine life are similar in certain respects, they can be grafted together.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Once this grafting takes place, the life juice of the divine life flows into the human life and produces a marvelous oneness between God and man.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>How, then, can we be one with God and God one with us?</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>This oneness comes by the grafting of the human life into the divine life and the divine life to the human life.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>John 15 says clearly that we are branches in Christ, who is the vine.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>According to the illustration used by Paul in Romans 11, we are branches grafted into Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Now as we abide in Christ and He abides in us, we and He, He and we, share one life and one living.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>This oneness in life and living makes us truly one.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>2.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Husband and Wife</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Our oneness with the Lord is also illustrated in Scripture by the oneness between a man and his wife.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>A husband and his wife are one both in nature and in life.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Eventually, after many years, a man and woman who have enjoyed a genuine married life will become one even in expression.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>During the honeymoon, a husband and wife are one in love.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>With more time, they become one in life.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>But ultimately those who develop a proper married life become one in expression.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>This is a picture of our relationship with the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>First we are one with Him in love; then we become one with Him in life and nature; and finally we shall be one with Him in expression.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>When we are one with Him in love, we experience His life and enjoy His nature.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>When we live His life and walk according to His nature, we become His expression.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>We pointed out in a foregoing message that the law is a description of what God is.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>This means that the law is the expression of God.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>If we become one with God in love, life, nature, and expression, we shall automatically keep His law.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>There will be no need for us to make up our mind to keep it, for we shall spontaneously live according to God s law.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>D. The Law Uplifted, Not Changed</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>It is important to see that in the New Testament the Ten Commandments are repeated, developed, and uplifted.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>In fact, the teaching in the New Testament goes beyond the Ten Commandments.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Anyone who rejects God s law must also reject the entire New Testament, which reiterates in an expanded way the law decreed in the Old Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>In Matthew 5 the Lord Jesus complemented the law and uplifted it.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>More than once He said, You have heard that it was said...but I say to you...</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Matt 5:21-22, 27-28, 31-32, 33-34, 43-44 .</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>The Lord Jesus came with no intention of abolishing the law.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>He Himself said, Do not think that I came to abolish the law or the prophets; I did not come to abolish, but to fulfill Matt 5:17 .</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Concerning the law, the teaching of the New Testament is thus essentially the same as that of the Ten Commandments.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>When some read this, they may wonder about the fourth commandment, concerning keeping the Sabbath.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Even with respect to the Sabbath, the New Testament does not change in principle.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>In the Old Testament, the seventh day was a memorial, a mark of God s creation.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>But because we, the saints in the church, have been regenerated in Christ s resurrection 1 Pet 1:3 , we are not merely of God s creation, but also of His re-creation.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Unlike Adam, we are not those living in God s creation; we are the ones living in Christ s resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>Hence, our memorial day is no longer the seventh day; it is the eighth day, the first day of the week, the day of resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>According to Acts 20:7, the disciples came together on this day, not on the seventh day, to have the Lord s table.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>According to 1 Corinthians 16:2, also on this day material things were set apart for God s use.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>Furthermore, in Revelation 1:10 John says that he was in spirit on the Lord s day, which was the first day of the week.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>Since there is a memorial day both in the Old Testament and in the New, it is correct to say that concerning the fourth commandment there is no change in principle.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>Because the Old Testament saints lived in God s creation, their memorial day was the seventh day.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>But because we, the New Testament saints, are in resurrection, our memorial day is the eighth day.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>The actual day has changed from the seventh day to the eighth day.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>However, God has not annulled the principle of setting apart a day unto the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>Again we see that, in principle, the whole Bible, the Old Testament as well as the New, is the same concerning the law.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>E. God s Ultimate Goal</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>God s ultimate goal is to make us one with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>The way for us to become one with Him is by love, life, nature, and expression.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>Our love for God should be like that of a woman for her husband, the very love portrayed in Song of Songs.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>Loving the Lord in this way, we receive His life supply.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>We have given a number of messages on life and building based on Song of Songs see Life and Building in the Song of Songs .</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>Through our affectionate love for the Lord Jesus, we are supplied with life.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>As this life grows, the building takes place.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>Actually, the growth of life is the building.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>Loving the Lord as our Husband and experiencing and enjoying His life and nature, we shall become His expression.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>Song of Songs depicts this sequence.</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>Eventually, in a very real sense, the seeking one in Song of Songs becomes her beloved.</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>The two, the man and the woman, become one absolutely, even in expression, living as if they were one person.</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>In the oneness between man and wife we see the proper way to keep the law.</S>
   <S PAR='98' RSNT='1' SNO='98'>We do not keep the law through the exercise of our mind and will.</S>
   <S PAR='99' RSNT='1' SNO='99'>We keep it by loving the Lord as our Husband.</S>
   <S PAR='100' RSNT='1' SNO='100'>We all need such a sweet, intimate, affectionate love between us and the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='101' RSNT='1' SNO='101'>We should love Him as a woman loves her husband.</S>
   <S PAR='102' RSNT='1' SNO='102'>We all, young and old alike, need this kind of love.</S>
   <S PAR='103' RSNT='1' SNO='103'>The more we love the Lord in this way, the more we shall partake of His life and spontaneously live Him in accordance with His nature.</S>
   <S PAR='104' RSNT='1' SNO='104'>Then our living will automatically become the keeping of His law.</S>
   <S PAR='105' RSNT='1' SNO='105'>What we live out will be according to the law as His description, definition, and expression.</S>
   <S PAR='106' RSNT='1' SNO='106'>As we shall see in a later message, if we try to keep God s law without having such an affectionate love for Him, we shall be in darkness, condemned, exposed, and even slain by the law of God.</S>
   <S PAR='107' RSNT='1' SNO='107'>That is the dark aspect of the law, the night aspect.</S>
   <S PAR='108' RSNT='1' SNO='108'>In this message our concern has been to consider the bright aspect, the day aspect.</S>
   <S PAR='109' RSNT='1' SNO='109'>Considering this aspect, we see that we can keep the law of God only by loving Him and becoming one with Him.</S>
