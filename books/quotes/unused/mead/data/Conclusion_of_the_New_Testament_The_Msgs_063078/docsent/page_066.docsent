   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>They all will be the last stage of human nations on the old earth, and they all will become the kingdom of God's Christ Rev 11:15 , and Christ and His overcomers shall be the kings over them.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Such a reigning will be the unique work of Christ in the millennium to show, for one thousand years, to the entire universe His kingship with His divine and heavenly authority for the shame of Satan, the defeated enemy of God, who will then be bound and imprisoned in the abyss, the bottomless pit Rev 20:2-3 .</S>

   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Verse 13 continues, "The sea gave up the dead which were in it, and death and Hades gave up the dead which were in them; and they were judged everyone according to their works."</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Because the dead unbelievers who were drowned in the sea are included among those in Hades, the dead given up by the sea should not be any unbelieving human beings.</S>

   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>But they will be cast into the lake of fire according to the book of life.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>This indicates that they are condemned by the Lord because of their evil deeds, but they perish because of their unbelief, not having their names written in the book of life.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Not believing in the Lord Jesus is the unique sin that causes people to perish John 16:9 .</S>
