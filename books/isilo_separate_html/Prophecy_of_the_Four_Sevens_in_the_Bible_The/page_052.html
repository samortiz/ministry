All the overcomers and all the defeated believers have to pass this "exam." The Lord Jesus was appointed to judge the living and the dead (2 Tim. 4:1). He will judge the living on His throne of glory at His second appearing (Matt. 25:31-46). This will be the judgment of the nations, the sheep and the goats, before the millennium. Then He will judge the dead on the great white throne after the millennium (Rev. 20:11-15). In addition to these judgments, there will be the judgment at Christ's judgment seat to judge the believers, not for eternal salvation or eternal perdition, but for reward or punishment. In the last three and a half years of this age, the Lord will clear away all the dirt from the universe. Then He will bring all the nations and the believers into their proper posts for a new start in the kingdom of a thousand years.</P><P>Question: We have seen that the temple will be rebuilt and the priestly service will begin again with the offering of sacrifices. Then during the tribulation, Antichrist will defile the temple. When the Lord returns at the end of the twelve hundred sixty days of the great tribulation, He will destroy Antichrist. Then it will take an additional thirty days to cleanse the temple (Dan. 12:11) and another forty-five days to set up the priestly service again with the offerings (Dan. 12:12). How do these offerings relate to the Lord's death on the cross?</P><P>Answer: In the Old Testament, the offerings were types of Christ, pointing to the Lord's coming to die for us. After the cross, in the millennium and even in eternity, the offerings will be a memorial, pointing back to what Christ did on the cross. Before the cross, the offerings are a type. After the cross, they will be a memorial. Isaiah 66 tells us that even in the new heaven and new earth, there will still be offerings in remembrance of what the Lord did for us in the age of grace (vv. 20-22).</P><P>Question: We have seen that the remaining believers during the three and a half years of the great tribulation, typified by the woman in Revelation 12:6, are taken to the wilderness where they will bear the Lord's testimony. Does that mean that some during the great tribulation will receive their testimony and receive salvation by grace?</P><P>Answer: It is likely that this will happen. We should not forget that these three and a half years will be a transitory period of time. On the one hand, the believers who remain on this earth during that time will surely be preaching the gospel of the Lord Jesus. While they are being nourished in the wilderness, they will surely preach Jesus. On the other hand, an angel will be announcing the eternal gospel from the air (Rev. 14:6-7), warning those who are under Antichrist's persecution not to worship him.</P><P>Question: You mentioned that the two witnesses would be raptured on the same day as the majority of the saints, which will be the last day of the twelve hundred sixty days of the great tribulation. Revelation 11 says that the two witnesses prophesy for twelve hundred and sixty days (v. 3). It also says that they are killed, that their corpses lie in the street of Jerusalem, and that after three and a half days they are raptured. Are the two witnesses raptured after twelve hundred sixty days or after twelve hundred sixty-three and a half days?</P><P>Answer: They will be raptured after twelve hundred sixty days. The three and a half days that their corpses lie on the street are included in these twelve hundred sixty days. Their being killed, their corpses' lying on the street, and their resurrection should be also considered as a part of their prophesying, a witnessing.</P><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_051.html">Prev</a> | Next </body></html>
