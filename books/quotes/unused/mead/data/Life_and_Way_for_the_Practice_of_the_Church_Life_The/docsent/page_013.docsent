   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER FOUR WHAT CHRIST IS</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Christ is the life and reality of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Now we need to know the right way, even the best way, for us to apply and experience Christ as life to us.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>However, before we get into this matter, we need to find out what Christ is.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>If we want to apply Christ as life to our experience in our daily life, we need to know what kind of Christ He is.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Of course, it is impossible to know Christ in a thorough way.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>We can never exhaust the knowledge of Christ because He is all-inclusive and His riches are unsearchable Eph 3:8 .</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Nevertheless, we have to try our best to know what He is.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>THE NEED TO KNOW CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>WITH THE CHURCH</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>At the end of the first chapter, we pointed out that in Ezekiel 1 there is a big wheel moving all the time on the earth vv.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>15-21 .</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>If you consider this matter in the light of the whole Scripture, you will realize that this wheel is the move of God in the universe.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>This wheel as the means by which God acts and moves in this universe must be Christ with the church.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Christ is the center, the hub, and the church is the circumference, the rim.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>If we want to practice the church life, the Body life, we need to know the church and where the church is in God's economy.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Even more, we need to know what Christ is.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Christ and the church are the great mystery in the universe Eph 5:32 .</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Where the church is, there is Christ, and where Christ is, there is the church.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>You can never separate Christ from the church.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Whenever we speak about the church, we must know what Christ is and how He is related to the church.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>CHRIST BEING THE MIGHTY GOD</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>We all know that Christ has many names, and I believe that among these many names the first must be the Son of God.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Then we have to ask, "Who is the Son?"</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Let us read Isaiah 9:6: "For a child is born to us,/A son is given to us;/And the government/Is upon His shoulders;/And His name will be called/Wonderful Counselor,/Mighty God,/Eternal Father,/Prince of Peace."</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The little child is the Mighty God.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>This is the difference between the very God in whom we believe and the God in whom the Jewish people believe.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The Jewish people believe the only God, who is the Mighty God, but they do not believe that this Mighty God became a child.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>CHRIST BEING BOTH THE SON AND THE FATHER</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Then there is another name the Eternal Father.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>He is the Son, yet He is called the Eternal Father.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Some people try to argue by saying that the Son is called the Father, but the Son is not the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>I cannot understand how the Son can be called the Father yet not be the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>It is foolish to say that a person is called John Clark, yet he is not John Clark.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>If the Son is called the Father, He must be the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>If He is not the Father, how can He be called the Father?</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The clear and definite prophecy in Isaiah 9:6 tells us that the very child born in the manger in Bethlehem is the Mighty God and that the Son given to us is the Eternal Father.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>A Son is given, yet His name is called the Eternal Father.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The very Son who has been given to us is the very Father.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>This is confirmed by John 14:8-11.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Now let us read this portion carefully: "Philip said to Him, Lord, show us the Father and it is sufficient for us.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Jesus said to him, Have I been so long a time with you, and you have not known Me, Philip?</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>He who has seen Me has seen the Father; how is it that you say, Show us the Father?</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Do you not believe that I am in the Father and the Father is in Me?</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The words that I say to you I do not speak from Myself, but the Father who abides in Me does His works.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Believe Me that I am in the Father and the Father is in Me; but if not, believe because of the works themselves."</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Here again we see that the Son and the Father are one.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Some would say, "How could the Son pray to the Father if the Son is the Father?"</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>This is not a problem.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Andrew Murray once said that the best prayer is the Christ who dwells in us praying to the Christ who is in heaven.</S>
