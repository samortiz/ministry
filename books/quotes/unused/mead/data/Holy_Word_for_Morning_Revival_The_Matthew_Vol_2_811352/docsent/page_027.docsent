   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>WEEK 9 DAY 5</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Scripture Reading</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Matt 13:19 When anyone hears the word of the kingdom and does not understand, the evil one comes and snatches away that which has been sown in his heart.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>23 But the one sown on the good earth, this is he who hears the word and understands, who by all means bears fruit and produces, one a hundredfold, and one sixtyfold, and one thirtyfold.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Ezek.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>36:26 I will also give you a new heart, and a new spirit I will put within you; and I will take away the heart of stone out of your flesh, and I will give you a heart of flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Matt 5:3 Blessed are the poor in spirit, for theirs is the kingdom of the heavens.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>8 Blessed are the pure in heart, for they shall see God.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Portions from Life-study Messages</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>In this first parable, the parable of the sower , we see that the establishment of the kingdom of the heavens is absolutely a matter of growth in life.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The kingdom is not established by outward working, but by inward growing.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Because many Christian workers have not seen this, they still think that the church is built up by work and labor.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>But the church can be produced only by sowing Christ as the seed into humanity.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>If we see this vision, we would no longer trust in what we do because we would know that the kingdom is a matter of life, that the church is a matter of growth in the life seed sown into our humanity.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Those who have been with us for a number of years can testify that I do not teach others what they should do.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>I do not give them instructions regarding their behavior.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>But in meeting after meeting, conference after conference, and training after training, I have ministered Christ as the all-inclusive, life-giving Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>It has always been a matter of Christ, life, the Spirit, and the church.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The young people who are burdened for the campuses must see this vision.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Young people, if you go to the campuses to do a work, that will mean nothing.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>You should not go there to work, but to sow the seed, to be a sower.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>During the years I was with Brother Nee in China, I saw that he was not working; he was sowing Christ as a seed.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>He told me that Miss M. E. Barber did not come to China to work.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>She was in China sowing Christ, even sowing herself in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>She was a seed sown into that district in China.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Eventually, something grew out of that seed.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The Lord's recovery today is the produce of the seed sown by Sister Barber and Brother Nee.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>According to this parable and the Lord's own interpretation of it, this seed is sown into our heart v. 19 . In the past we have pointed out that our heart is not the receiving organ but the loving organ, and that our receiving organ is our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>We say this based upon Ezekiel 36, where God promises to give us a new spirit and a new heart, a new spirit to receive God and a new heart to love Him.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>In 1 Peter 3:4 our spirit is called the inner man of our heart.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>This indicates that our spirit is surrounded by our heart.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>When we believed in the Lord Jesus we opened our heart.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The result, however, was that He came into our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>When we opened our heart to believe in Him, He came into our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>But our spirit is not the soil for growing Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The soil is our heart.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>This parable makes it perfectly clear that our heart is the earth, the very place where the seed is sown and where it grows.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The parable of the sower seems very simple, but it is actually deep and profound.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>It exposes the real condition of our heart in the presence of the heavenly King.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Whatever is in us is exposed.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>As long as you are either the wayside, the soil with hidden rocks, or the soil with thorns, the kingdom cannot grow in you.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>But the good earth signifies the good heart that grows Christ .The kingdom and the church are growing here.</S>
