<H2 CLASS=HEAD4>d. Moses and Aaron Falling<br>on Their Faces before the Whole<br>Congregation of the Assembly of Israel</H2><P>Moses and Aaron fell on their faces before the whole congregation of the assembly of Israel (v. 5). This shows their meekness. They did not fight against the people.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD4>e. Joshua and Caleb Rending Their Clothes<br>and Speaking to All the Assembly of Israel</H2><P>Joshua and Caleb rent their clothes and said to all the assembly of Israel, "The land, which we passed through to spy out, is an extremely good land. If Jehovah delights in us, He will bring us into this land and give it to us, a land which flows with milk and honey. Only do not rebel against Jehovah; and do not fear the people of the land, for they will be our bread; their defense has departed from them, and Jehovah is with us. Do not fear them" (vv. 6-9). It is difficult to say what "their defense" means; it may refer to the god who protected them. The words "Do not rebel against Jehovah" indicate that not to believe in the Lord is to rebel against Him.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD4>f. All the Assembly Saying to Stone Them with Stones</H2><P>All the assembly said to stone Joshua and Caleb with stones. Then the glory of Jehovah appeared at the tent of meeting to all the sons of Israel (v. 10).</P><P>At this point, I would like to speak a word concerning the spiritual significance of the good land, the land of Canaan. When I was first sent to this country with the Lord's recovery, at the first conference in Los Angeles, I gave a series of messages, based mainly on Deuteronomy 8:7-10, that were published in the book The All-inclusive Christ. In those messages I pointed out that the good land is a picture of the all-inclusive Christ. The good land was used by God to typify a person, who is the embodiment of God. This embodied God is the Triune God, who has been processed and consummated in one person, Jesus Christ.</P><P>The Bible is a marvelous book, and it contains many different kinds of writings and subjects. Actually, the entire Bible presents one matter&#151;that God desires to be embodied in one person, who is the unique One in the universe. It is impossible to exhaust the telling of this wonderful person. God and man are in this person; He includes all the elements and attributes of the divine nature and all the virtues of the human nature. In Him we have the reality of both the divine nature and the human nature. In Him we also have life, light, and the Spirit. All the positive things in the universe are embodied, contained, and realized in this one person, the all-inclusive God-man, who is the center and meaning of the universe.</P><P>The religion of Christianity has been on earth for over nineteen hundred years. Nevertheless, since the time of the apostles, the wonderful person of Christ has not been presented to people in as full a way as He is revealed, somewhat hiddenly, in the Bible and as we see Him today. We thank the Lord for opening His holy Word to us, enabling us to see aspects of Christ which have been veiled for centuries.</P><P>Very soon after the first century, the Bible, the revelation of this wonderful person, became veiled and later was locked up by Catholicism. During the Reformation, the Bible was unlocked, but it was not yet unveiled. Since that time, the things Christians have seen in the Bible are related mainly to God's salvation. These things include God's creation, the divine attributes of faithfulness, righteousness, holiness, and love, man's fall and sinfulness, God's love for man, Christ's coming to save and redeem man through His vicarious death on the cross, His resurrection from among the dead, and the Holy Spirit's being poured out at Pentecost to make the believers the church. For the most part, Christians have not seen God's economy. What they teach, preach, and propagate is largely according to human thought, with only a little that is according to the divine thought. In their preaching they do not emphasize the impartation of life. Instead, they stress the matters of forgiveness, redemption, justification by faith, and sanctification, but they have not seen the dispensing of the Triune God into the tripartite man, that man may have the divine life and possess the divine nature to become part of the enlarged Christ. (Some of those who stressed the inner life saw that the believers are members of the enlarged Christ, but they saw this only vaguely, not clearly.)</P>
