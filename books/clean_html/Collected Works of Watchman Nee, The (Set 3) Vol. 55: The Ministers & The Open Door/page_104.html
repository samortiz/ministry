<h2 class="head2">The Past Year and a Half (Yuyao)</h2><p>We began to have prayer meetings in November 1948. We also had gospel meetings for a period of time. However, we were unable to start regular meetings because we did not have enough light. There was a long conference at Ninghai in December 1949, and one of the brothers among us attended. After he returned, we felt burdened to start meetings on the Lord's Day morning. By the Lord's mercy, we began on January 29, 1950. There were about twenty people in the meetings. Since then we have had two conferences by the brothers from Ningpo. More than thirty brothers and sisters were baptized. We started the Lord's table on June 18 (the Lord's Day) and began to break bread to remember the Lord.</p><p>As we look back on the past, we see that the Lord's mercy and leading have been with us until today. We must give honor and glory to our God! We truly feel weak and immature; indeed, we need the supply of prayers from the brothers and sisters in other places. We hope that we could be notified when the churches near us have conferences.</p><p>Mailing Address: Christian Meeting Hall, Xiao-An Street, Yuyao</p><h2 class="head2">Gradual Inward Enlightenment</h2><p>The Lord has shown me much mercy during this past year as I have been learning to serve God in coordination with the church. I am still studying at Tsinghua University. The word I received at Kuling has given me gradual, inward enlightenment, and I have begun to have some experiences. As I consider this, I feel that it is the Lord's great mercy! There are now more than twenty brothers and sisters in school. We have prayer, fellowship, edification of new believers, and sporadic gospel meetings. Although there are many difficulties, they just bring in more of God's grace. Increasingly, we feel the importance of the edification of the new believers. If these basic matters are not learned well, these new ones have no future. Therefore, the brothers and I are going over the lessons, and we are begging the Lord to bring us into the spiritual reality of these lessons. We have seen the Lord's blessing. After we spoke about rising early, I called the brothers the next morning and tried to get them up. Despite much encouragement, they could not do it. We prayed specifically about this matter in a prayer meeting and asked the Lord to save us. Everyone confessed, repented, and begged the Lord for mercy. The next day everyone made a turn and got up early. This really was the Lord's blessing.</p><p>Brother Caleb recently asked me to learn the science of farming and ranching, and to pick up some practical skills in preparation for migrating to the Northwest. If the Lord leads, I am willing to go to a spiritually strategic location with a large population where there is a future for the gospel. If I migrate, the edification of new believers will be an even more important subject in my service among the brothers and sisters. As long as a local church is able to, it should have such classes. I heard more than half of the messages concerning the edification of new believers at Kuling, and I was able to secure notes on the rest, but my notes are incomplete. Could you give me a printed copy of what was shared at Kuling?</p><p>A young member,<br />Sun Kai<br />August 3, 1950</p><p>Mailing Address: c/o 9 An Nei, Kuan Street, Peking</p>
