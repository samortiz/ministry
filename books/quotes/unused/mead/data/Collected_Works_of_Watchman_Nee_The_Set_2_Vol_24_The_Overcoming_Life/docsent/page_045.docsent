   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>I like 2 Peter 3:18 very much.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>It says, "But grow in the grace and knowledge of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ."</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>This is one of the few places in the Bible that speaks of growth.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>We grow in grace.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>What does growing in grace mean?</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>No one grows into grace; we all grow in grace.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>We cannot grow into grace; we can only grow in grace.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>What is grace?</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Grace is God doing something for us.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>For us to grow in grace means that we need God to do more things for us.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Suppose God has done five things for me already.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>But there are still three things which God has to do for me.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>My need has increased; therefore, I need God to do more for me.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Here lies the relationship between truth and grace: Truth exposes our need, while grace supplies our need.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Truth shows us where our lack is, while grace fills up that lack.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Hallelujah!</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>God has not only truth but also grace!</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>In the Old Testament, men failed repeatedly because they only had the truth; they did not have grace.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>They had the law, but they did not have the strength to keep the law.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>We thank and praise the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>"For the law was given through Moses; grace and reality came through Jesus Christ" John 1:17 .</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Thank the Lord that He has shown us the truth and supplied us with grace!</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Hallelujah!</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>I can say before God, "I am forever a beggar.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>I am forever a pauper.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>I have to come to You today, and I will come to You tomorrow and the day after."</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Thank God that I can ask of Him every day.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>I can ask of Him on Monday, and I can ask of Him on Tuesday.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>If we bother God this way and ask of Him in this way, He will say that we have grown in grace.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The more we see our failures, the more we will ask of God.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>We will ask all the more for Him to take responsibility of our case.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>We will say, "Lord, I am still helpless.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>I still need You to bear my responsibility."</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Once we see that we have done something wrong, the first thing to do is say to God, "I confess my sins.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>At such times, you must call sin by its proper name.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>You must call sin a sin.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>God, I will not change myself anymore.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>I have learned one more lesson.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>I can never change, and I do not intend to change.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>God, I thank You because this is another chance to boast in my weakness!</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>God, I thank You because You can make it!</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>I thank You because You can remove my weakness."</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Brothers and sisters, every time we boast in our weakness, the power of Christ will tabernacle over us.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Every time we say that we cannot make it, God will show us that He can make it.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>If we do this time after time, we will grow.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Tonight I will mention a few examples to show you the meaning of growth.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>There are many sins which we do not realize are sins.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>But once we know, we should say, "God, I have sinned!</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>I need Christ to live out His life!"</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>I can testify that once a man mistreated me and I said a few rash words to him.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>I knew that it was wrong to say rash words to others, but I argued that he was more wrong than I and that he had not apologized to me.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>I was only wrong a little.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Should I have apologized to him instead?</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Yet God wanted me to do this.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>The person had offended me, but I had forgiven him and was no longer angry with him.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Yet I still had to apologize.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>I thought I was doing quite good already, but I was still short of the standard of Matthew 5, which says that we have to love our enemies.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>If I could love that person, I would be able to love even a cat or a dog.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>I had written a letter acknowledging my rash words, but since I could not love him, I decided I would not send the letter.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>I decided that I would write another one when I could love him.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>I did not hate him, and I had forgiven him, but I could not love him.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Only God could love him.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>God says that loving is the truth and not loving is sin.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>I wanted to overcome, and I wanted to fight with faith.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>I said to the Lord, "If You do not cause me to love him, I cannot love him."</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>When I said that I could not love and that God is the only One who can love, I found myself loving him.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>On the one hand, the truth tells us that we should love.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>On the other hand, grace supplies us with the strength to love.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Such dealings sometimes take a few seconds and sometimes take a few days.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Miss Fischbacher had a co-worker who always gave her a hard time.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>The co-worker would always come up with some ideas which made her suffer.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>If Miss Fischbacher said that there was such-and-such a thing, the co-worker would deny that there was such a thing.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>If Miss Fischbacher said that there was no such thing, the co-worker would argue that there was such a thing.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>It seemed as if she was always trying to show others that Miss Fischbacher was dishonest.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>Miss Fischbacher tried to endure this but could do nothing about her behavior.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>Every time Miss Fischbacher saw this person, she would either pat her shoulder or shake her hand as an outward sign of love.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>Outwardly everything seemed to be well, but inwardly it was not well.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>One day Miss Fischbacher read 1 Peter 1:22, which says, "Love one another from a pure heart fervently."</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>She pondered and thought that it was impossible for her to love this person, much less to love her fervently.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>She told the Lord, "I cannot overcome in this matter.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>Lord, I have found that this is sin.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>You have said that we should love the brothers fervently, but I cannot do it.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>This certainly is sin."</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>She asked God to remove this sin from her.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>She did not hate that person, and she had spent time with her, but it was difficult for her to love this person.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>Every time she saw this person, she tried her best to love her, but it never worked.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>One day she locked herself in her room and prayed to God, saying, "I should love her, but I cannot love her.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>This is a sin.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>I will not let You go today until I can love this person."</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>She prayed for three hours.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>In the end, the Lord's love filled her up, and she felt that she could even die for this person.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>She not only loved her but also loved her fervently.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>Because she loved her fervently, she prayed for her the whole night.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>The next day after her routine work, she prayed for the person again.</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>She not only had the experience of victory but also the experience of power.</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>This is the meaning of the truth sanctifying us.</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>This is the meaning of growing in grace.</S>
   <S PAR='98' RSNT='1' SNO='98'>The truth enables us to see what sin is, and grace supplies us with the strength to overcome the sin.</S>
   <S PAR='99' RSNT='1' SNO='99'>Once we find out what sin is, we will not let go until we overcome.</S>
   <S PAR='100' RSNT='1' SNO='100'>This is the way we grow in grace day by day.</S>
   <S PAR='101' RSNT='1' SNO='101'>There were once three British sisters.</S>
   <S PAR='102' RSNT='1' SNO='102'>One was engaged, while the other two had decided to remain single.</S>
   <S PAR='103' RSNT='1' SNO='103'>All three were working for the Lord in inland China.</S>
   <S PAR='104' RSNT='1' SNO='104'>The sister who was engaged was the most unhappy one.</S>
   <S PAR='105' RSNT='1' SNO='105'>Although her fianc wrote often to comfort her, she was continually depressed.</S>
   <S PAR='106' RSNT='1' SNO='106'>One day while she was feeling lonely in her room, she wept.</S>
   <S PAR='107' RSNT='1' SNO='107'>The other two sisters asked, "Why are you feeling lonely?</S>
   <S PAR='108' RSNT='1' SNO='108'>You have a fianc who always writes to you!</S>
   <S PAR='109' RSNT='1' SNO='109'>It should be the two of us who feel lonely."</S>
   <S PAR='110' RSNT='1' SNO='110'>After the two said this, they went back to their rooms and suddenly felt lonely as well.</S>
   <S PAR='111' RSNT='1' SNO='111'>They thought about their work in the inland regions and their strange food and uncomfortable dwelling.</S>
   <S PAR='112' RSNT='1' SNO='112'>How lonely this was!</S>
   <S PAR='113' RSNT='1' SNO='113'>Indeed, sin is infectious.</S>
   <S PAR='114' RSNT='1' SNO='114'>While they were feeling sorry for themselves, they recalled the Lord's Word, "And behold, I am with you all the days until the consummation of the age" Matt 28:20 .</S>
   <S PAR='115' RSNT='1' SNO='115'>They also recalled Psalm 16:11 which says, "In Your presence is fullness of joy;/At Your right hand there are pleasures forever."</S>
   <S PAR='116' RSNT='1' SNO='116'>They told the Lord, "Loneliness is a sin.</S>
   <S PAR='117' RSNT='1' SNO='117'>You have said that You will be with us until the consummation of the age; therefore, we say that loneliness is a sin.</S>
   <S PAR='118' RSNT='1' SNO='118'>You have said that in Your presence there is fullness of joy, and at Your right hand there are pleasures forever; therefore, we say that loneliness is a sin."</S>
   <S PAR='119' RSNT='1' SNO='119'>They both knelt down and prayed, "Lord, we acknowledge that loneliness is a sin."</S>
   <S PAR='120' RSNT='1' SNO='120'>From the time that they dealt with their loneliness in such a specific way, their loneliness never came back to them.</S>
   <S PAR='121' RSNT='1' SNO='121'>Hallelujah!</S>
   <S PAR='122' RSNT='1' SNO='122'>Loneliness never came back to them.</S>
   <S PAR='123' RSNT='1' SNO='123'>Brothers and sisters, we can discover new sins every day, and we can find new failures every day.</S>
   <S PAR='124' RSNT='1' SNO='124'>Yet at the same time, there is the fresh supply of grace.</S>
   <S PAR='125' RSNT='1' SNO='125'>"For of His fullness we have all received, and grace upon grace" John 1:16 .</S>
   <S PAR='126' RSNT='1' SNO='126'>We have received it once, and we are receiving it again and again.</S>
   <S PAR='127' RSNT='1' SNO='127'>A sister worked in India, and she had many anxieties.</S>
   <S PAR='128' RSNT='1' SNO='128'>One day she read Philippians 4:6, which says, "In nothing be anxious, but in everything, by prayer and petition with thanksgiving, let your requests be made known to God."</S>
   <S PAR='129' RSNT='1' SNO='129'>She saw that anxiety was a sin and that failing to give thanks was also a sin.</S>
   <S PAR='130' RSNT='1' SNO='130'>Brothers and sisters, once we see a sin, we have to confess it before the Lord and also acknowledge that the Lord is living within us.</S>
   <S PAR='131' RSNT='1' SNO='131'>This is the meaning of growth.</S>
   <S PAR='132' RSNT='1' SNO='132'>Our victory in Christ is absolute in nature; there is no room for improvement.</S>
   <S PAR='133' RSNT='1' SNO='133'>However, the sphere of our overcoming is ever expanding.</S>
   <S PAR='134' RSNT='1' SNO='134'>Each person receives a different degree of light from the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='135' RSNT='1' SNO='135'>The more light that a man receives, the more he advances, and the less light that a man receives, the less he advances.</S>
   <S PAR='136' RSNT='1' SNO='136'>The more a person knows about sin, the more he receives the supply from God, and the less a person receives light from God, the less he receives the supply from God.</S>
   <S PAR='137' RSNT='1' SNO='137'>Brothers and sisters, we have to know the relationship that truth and grace have with us.</S>
   <S PAR='138' RSNT='1' SNO='138'>I hope that we would all say to God daily, "Lord, I cannot make it, and I do not intend to make it.</S>
   <S PAR='139' RSNT='1' SNO='139'>Lord, I thank and praise You that I cannot make it."</S>
   <S PAR='140' RSNT='1' SNO='140'>Every day we have to pray to God to give us light and grace.</S>
   <S PAR='141' RSNT='1' SNO='141'>We may fail accidentally, but we can be recovered within a second.</S>
   <S PAR='142' RSNT='1' SNO='142'>If we do this day by day, our growth will be beyond anyone's expectation because it will be the work of Christ alone.</S>
   <S PAR='143' RSNT='1' SNO='143'>Hallelujah, this is full salvation!</S>
   <S PAR='144' RSNT='1' SNO='144'>Hallelujah, He is leading us on!</S>
   <S PAR='145' RSNT='1' SNO='145'>Hallelujah, Satan can do nothing about us!</S>
   <S PAR='146' RSNT='1' SNO='146'>Hallelujah, Christ has overcome!</S>
