   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>PRAYING IN SPIRIT</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Finally, in chapter six of Ephesians, Paul says that we need to pray at every time in spirit v. 18 . This prayer is the prayer of a member of the Body identified with Christ on the throne, all the time claiming, proclaiming, giving command to the Lord, and binding the enemy.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>This is not the prayer of a beggar, not begging prayer, not the prayer of the poor sinner, not the prayer of the poor, weak saints pleading with the Lord, but the prayer of the Body, the prayer of members of the Body identified with the Head.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>We need to see the Body in the spirit, to be built up in the spirit, to be strengthened in the spirit, to be renewed in the spirit, to be filled unto the fullness of God in the spirit, and to pray in spirit as members of the Body, identified with the Head.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>If such is the case, spontaneously we will have the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>If not, it will be hard to have the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>We may have a lot of talk about the Body life and a lot of teachings about the church, but we will have no way at all to realize what the church life actually is.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>I urge you again and again to turn to the spirit because the church life is in your spirit.</S>
