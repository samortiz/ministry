They speak concerning the history of the foolish virgins. While on earth we cannot discern this foolishness. The bridegroom's delay in coming was intended as a test to see who is prudent and who is foolish. At first both the prudent and the foolish ones have the light. Perhaps the foolish would laugh at the prudent for unnecessarily taking an extra portion of oil. Many are qualified to be caught up in the beginning, but eventually they fail because of the Lord's tarrying. Those who consider the Lord to be tarrying are the evil slaves, and those who expect the Lord to return soon are the foolish ones. The parable of the evil slave instructs the believers to prepare themselves to meet the Lord today. The parable of the virgins teaches us to consider that the Lord will return no sooner than a few decades later. If the Lord comes back after fifty years, will you be prepared to meet Him? Take heed lest your lamp contains enough oil to burn only till midnight and not after. If you prepare only enough to last till midnight, the Lord will surely tarry until midnight is past. Do not underestimate the Lord's testing. The Lord's tarrying speaks of the need for the oil in the vessel. Whether our lamps will burn only till midnight or will burn throughout the night depends on whether or not we have oil in our vessels. The shining at the beginning is not so crucial here.</P><P>The bridegroom is the Lord. When the Lord tarried, the virgins all slumbered and slept. Parables should be interpreted, of course, spiritually. Sleep in the Scriptures has two meanings: (1) spiritual deadness (Rom. 13:11-14; 1 Thes. 5:6) and (2) physical death (1 Thes. 4:13; John 11:11). Sleep here must fall under one of the above two explanations. If sleep denotes spiritual deadness: (1) Why did the prudent not overcome the sleepiness? (2) Sleep here is not crucial because the prudent did not suffer any loss because of their sleep. (3) The Lord did not reprove them for their sleeping-He was not concerned for this matter at all. (4) Note the instruction in verse 13. The Lord tells us to follow the example of the five prudent virgins in their watchfulness; therefore, it is not reasonable to say that sleep implies spiritual deadness. Based on these reasons, we know that sleep is physical death and that slumber is to become seriously ill, to be at the juncture of life and death (Acts 9:37; 1 Cor. 11:30).</P><P>"At midnight there was a cry." The midnight cry refers to the shout of the archangel in 1 Thessalonians 4:16. This shout is to wake up the dead believers, whereas the trumpet in 1 Corinthians 15:52 is to gather them together. The hearers are the dead believers; the cry at midnight must refer to 1 Thessalonians 4:16. To be raised up refers to resurrection. The bridegroom has come, so go forth to meet Him. Thus both parties come together and meet in the air.</P><P>"All...arose" proves that all Christians are resurrected together. It seems that here there is time for some conversation. Yet in 1 Corinthians 15:52, "in the twinkling of an eye" does not seem to allow for such opportunity. Remember that this is a parable. Parables are always like this. In reality there is no time, yet there may appear to be time in the parable. In Matthew 20:11-12, in the beginning there is work; then comes the reward and the argument with the Lord. In reality the latter surely will not happen. The same is also true of Matthew 22:1-14. For this reason, in our study of the parables we pay our attention mainly to the teachings.</P><P>Why are not the dead ones caught up into the air immediately after resurrection? As revealed in 1 Thessalonians 4:16-17, the dead will rise first, then those who are living and left remaining. Since there is an order, there can be a period of time between the two. "The twinkling of an eye" in 1 Corinthians 15 refers to the resurrection and not to the rapture. Thus, it is neither surprising nor unlikely for the virgins to be able to trim their lamps after their resurrection. (A dying person in his last five minutes can also recall the things he did in his whole lifetime. It is thus quite natural for the resurrected ones to do the same immediately after they resurrected.)</P><P>Verses 8-9:"And the foolish said to the prudent, Give us some of your oil, for our lamps are going out. But the prudent answered, saying, Perhaps there will not be enough for us and for you; go rather to those who sell, and buy for yourselves." This shows the discovery of the lack. When the bridegroom tarried, the foolish ones found that they were lacking oil. The bridegroom's tarrying was a test to expose their prudence or foolishness. The foolish virgins might have thought that the five prudent virgins were over-cautious by taking oil with their vessels. Now they discover their need. "Give us some of your oil." This means, "Give us of the gift of the Holy Spirit." One should know that the gift of the Holy Spirit can be given, but not the fullness of the Holy Spirit (Acts 8:17; 19:6; 2 Tim. 1:6). To ask only for the gift of the Holy Spirit is useless. One must have both the gift and the fullness. We cannot borrow oil from others, whether they are our parents, brothers, sisters, or close relatives. Our spiritual fullness requires that we pay the price. Pretending to be spiritual can get us by today, but it will not be sufficient for that day. Obtaining the Holy Spirit requires fellowshipping with the Lord and paying the price to pursue Him. No matter how long you stay with other spiritual ones, it will not help you. Do not think we can borrow oil from others. To borrow light, yes; but to borrow oil, no.</P><P>"Perhaps there will not be enough." In other words, we cannot help you; it is not possible to help others in this matter. There are times when the Lord will permit certain kinds of "holy selfishness." Just because some are foolish, we should not allow ourselves also to become foolish for sympathy's sake. Although we should express our concern for others, we must reserve for ourselves a certain "sacred selfishness"; otherwise, there will not be enough. That is, both will suffer loss. The other party will not receive any help, and your effort will not improve the situation.</P><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_107.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_109.html">Next</a> </body></html>
