<h1 class=msg>CHAPTER SEVEN</h1><h1 class=msg>THE DIVINE DISPENSING IN THE BOOK OF EPHESIANS</h1><h2 class=head1>THE DIVINE TRINITY BEING THE CONSTITUENT OF THE BOOK OF EPHESIANS</h2><p>Ephesians is a wonderful book on the divine dispensing. In the entire Bible, Ephesians is the only book in which every chapter is structured with the Divine Trinity as its basic element. For example, chapter one speaks about the Father’s selection and predestination, the Son’s redemption, and the Spirit’s sealing and pledging. This is the basic element of the structure of Ephesians 1.<h2 class=head2>The Divine Trinity in Chapter One for the Accomplishment of God’s Economy</h2><p>Ephesians 1 reveals that the Father selected and predestinated us before the foundation of the world according to His plan. In time the Son redeemed us for accomplishing what the Father had planned, and after the Son accomplished redemption, the Spirit came to seal us and be a pledge to us for the application of what the Son accomplished. Hence, the Son accomplished all that the Father planned, and after the Son accomplished redemption, the Spirit applies all that the Son has accomplished to us. This is the constitution of chapter one, which is on the accomplishment of God’s economy. In other words, the accomplishment of God’s redemption and salvation depends entirely on the Divine Trinity—the Father, the Son, and the Spirit.<h2 class=head2>The Divine Trinity in Chapter Two for Leading Us into the Triune God</h2><p>In chapter two the Divine Trinity is not as clearly and distinctly referred to as in chapter one, but in 2:18 the Trinity is implied—“For through Him we both have access in one Spirit unto the Father.” This shows us that the Father as the source is the One who predestinates and plans. How do we have access to the Father? First, it is through the Son, who, by accomplishing redemption, became the means by which we have access unto the Father. Second, to have access to the Father we need to be in the Spirit. If we have the means but not the leading, we still cannot reach the goal. Therefore, this verse points out concisely and accurately that we have access unto the Father through the Son, who accomplished redemption, and in the Spirit, who is the sealing and leading; that is, through the Son we have access in one Spirit unto the Father. As a result we, the created, fallen, and redeemed human beings, have been brought together with the Triune God. In other words, we have been wrought into Him.<h2 class=head1>THE CHURCH—THE CORPORATE EXPRESSION OF GOD</h2><p>Ephesians chapter one speaks a great deal concerning the Triune God. The central thought is that the Triune God has wrought Himself into us through His selection, predestination, redemption, sealing, and pledging. Chapter two says that through the Son and in the Spirit we have access unto the Father, that is, we enter into the Father. Hence, chapter one reveals that God has come into us, while chapter two tells us that we have entered into the Father. Through this coming and going, the Triune God has wrought Himself into us and us into Him. Thus, we have the economy of God, the dispensing of God, and the union of God with us, resulting in the producing of the Body, the church. The church is the issue of God’s coming into us and our going back to Him. Through this coming and going the church as God’s corporate expression is produced.<p>This is a fundamental truth in the Lord’s recovery: the Triune God—the Father, the Son, and the Spirit—has wrought Himself into us through the Father’s predestination, the Son’s redemption, and the Spirit’s sealing and pledging. Since we were redeemed and have the Triune God in us, through the Son we have access in the Spirit unto the Father. Through this coming and going, the Triune God has entered into us, and we have also entered into Him; the result is that a corporate expression—the church, the Body of Christ—is produced.
