   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>LIFE-STUDY OF EXODUS MESSAGE ONE HUNDRED SIXTY-SEVEN THE INCENSE 1 Scripture Reading: Exo 30:34-38</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Toward the end of the section concerned with the revelation of the tabernacle two things are described: the anointing oil and the incense.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>I believe that in the foregoing messages we have considered thoroughly the matter of the anointing oil.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>We have seen that this oil is a fine and all-inclusive type of Christ being the all-inclusive life-giving Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>As the life-giving Spirit, Christ not only comes to us from God, but He is also God coming to us.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>His coming is not only from God but also with God, for Christ comes as God.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Eventually, this coming One passed through death and resurrection and has become the all-inclusive life-giving Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>There is a divine traffic in this universe that moves in two directions.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The coming of God to us in Christ is the first direction of this divine traffic.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>With the incense we have the other direction of this divine traffic, Christ going from us to God.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Therefore, the anointing oil is Christ as God coming to us from God, and the incense is Christ going from us to God.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>It is important that we all see this two-way traffic.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>This traffic has much to do with our Christian experience.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Do you know what our Christian experience is?</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>It is God coming to us in Christ and our going to God in Christ and with Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>God s coming to us is a matter of the anointing, and our going to God is a matter of prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>This divine traffic is the proper Christian experience.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>In particular, our going to God in Christ requires experience.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>THREE FRAGRANT SPICES</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Without adequate spiritual experience, we shall not be able to understand the type of the incense or interpret it.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>This type is actually very strange, more strange than that of the anointing oil.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The incense is strange because its three spices stacte, onycha, and galbanum are unusual.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Even the words themselves are not common.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Rather, they are peculiar words used to refer to unusual things.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>More than twenty years ago, I spent a good deal of time to study the incense and its ingredients.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Then I gave messages on the incense on at least two occasions.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Some of those messages were published in the book How to Meet.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Exodus 30:34 says, And Jehovah said to Moses, Take to yourself fragrant spices, stacte, and onycha, and galbanum fragrant spices, and pure frankincense; there shall be an equal part of each.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>In this verse the Lord twice speaks of fragrant spices.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Stacte, the first of these spices, is a resinous gum used as the purest myrrh, a myrrh that is edible.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Years ago I read that this kind of myrrh can be used as an expectorant.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>In particular, it can heal the throat and reduce excess saliva.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>It is an edible medicine.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>However, the other two spices, onycha and galbanum, are not edible.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Actually, they are poisonous.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Galbanum has a very disagreeable odor that is even poisonous.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Nevertheless, the Lord indicates that it also is a fragrant spice.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Later we shall see how this disagreeable and poisonous element can be fragrant.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>PRAYER ASCENDING TO GOD</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Most Christians, including those who have been in the Lord s recovery for many years, still do not have much knowledge of what genuine prayer is.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Furthermore, we may not have much experience of genuine prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>We thank the Lord that sometimes our prayer is genuine.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>But most of the time our prayers have not been genuine.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Only a small percentage of our prayers have been genuine.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>For the most part, our prayers have been natural.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Both in the Old Testament and in the New Testament incense signifies our prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>In the Psalms the saints prayer is likened to incense that is offered to God and ascends to Him Psa 141:2 .</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>However, incense is not actually for offering; it is for ascending.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>We often speak of a prayer being offered to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Strictly speaking, this understanding is not scriptural.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>According to the Bible, prayer is not an offering; it is an incense that ascends to God.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>We have seen that with the tabernacle there were two altars: the bronze altar in the outer court and the golden altar in the Holy Place.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>The bronze altar was for burning offerings, sacrifices.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>On that altar offerings were presented to God.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Of course, with the burning of the offerings on the bronze altar in the outer court something did ascend to God.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>The golden altar inside the tabernacle was close to the ark in the Holy of Holies.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>At this golden altar of incense no offerings were offered.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>The burnt offering, the meal offering, or any other kind of offering could not be presented there.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>This altar was only for the purpose of burning incense to God.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Therefore, the incense that was burned at the golden altar ascended to God.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>This is not an offering; it is an ascending.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>The incense that ascends to God typifies our prayer.</S>
