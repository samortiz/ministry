   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE UNITING SPIRIT</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>For through Him we both have access in one Spirit unto the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>2:18</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>We both have access unto the Father not by being inspired by the Spirit but by being in one Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The Jews and the Gentiles could not be one; there was a solid wall between them.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>However, the Spirit is in the Jewish brothers, and the same Spirit is also in the Gentile brothers.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Thus, in one Spirit they have become one.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Hence, this Spirit is the uniting Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Being diligent to keep the oneness of the Spirit in the uniting bond of peace.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>4:3</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>This oneness is in the Spirit, and this Spirit is the oneness.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The work He is doing in us is a revealing work and a uniting work.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The more we debate about doctrine, the more we are separated; the more we debate, the greater the distance between us.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>However, if we would turn to our spirit, the result will be oneness.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The fluorescent lamps in a room are separated outwardly, but they are joined in the electrical current to become one entity.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Likewise, in ourselves you are you, and I am I; however, in the Spirit we are one.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>THE BUILDING SPIRIT</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>In whom you also are being built together into a dwelling place of God in spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>2:22</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>God's dwelling place, God's building, is built by the Spirit in our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>When we live in this Spirit, we have revelation; when we live in this Spirit, we keep the oneness; and when we live in this Spirit, we are built together.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>One Body and one Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>4:4a</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The Spirit is in the Body; hence, there is one Body and there is one Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>If we do not live in the Spirit, building becomes a mere doctrine, and so does coordination.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Both the building and the coordination are in the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>It is for this reason that we need to learn to live in the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>THE STRENGTHENING SPIRIT</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>That He would grant you, according to the riches of His glory, to be strengthened with power through His Spirit into the inner man.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>3:16</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The inner man is our new man, our regenerated spirit, whereas the outer man is our soul.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Our self is our soul; the Lord is in our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Our soul is the outer man; our spirit is the inner man.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Many saved ones are very strong in their soul but very weak in their spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>In other words, their outer man is strong, but their inner man is weak.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Hence, they do not have much experience of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>For this reason the apostle Paul prayed that God would strengthen our spirit with His Spirit to make our spirit strong.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Hence, the Spirit who is in us is the strengthening Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>THE RENEWING SPIRIT</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>And that you be renewed in the spirit of your mind.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>4:23</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>At this stage the Spirit is no longer only in our spirit but has spread into our mind to become the spirit of the mind.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>For building we need transformation, and for transformation we need renewing.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Romans 12 also refers to our being transformed by the renewing of the mind.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>How do we have this transformation by renewing?</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>It is by having the Spirit in our mind.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Unless the Spirit spreads to our mind, we cannot be renewed.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Therefore, the Spirit must spread.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>If we frustrate the Spirit, there is no possibility for us to be transformed.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>God must spread to our mind so that our mind can become the spirit of the mind.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>It is in the spirit of the mind that we are renewed.</S>
