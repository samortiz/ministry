<H2 CLASS=HEAD2>In First John</H2><P>The tares are further developed in 1 John 2:18-19: "Little children, it is the last time: and as ye have heard that antichrist shall come, even now are there many antichrists; whereby we know that it is the last time. They went out from us, but they were not of us; for if they had been of us, they would no doubt have continued with us: but they went out, that they might be made manifest that they were not all of us." These are the people who are against Christ, so they are called antichrist. There is not only the Antichrist in the future, but also some little ones who were there already. Because they went out and did not remain with the early church, it proves they were the false ones, the tares. First John 4:1 says, "Beloved, believe not every spirit, but try the spirits whether they are of God: because many false prophets are gone out into the world." If there were many false prophets in the early days, how about today? Do you believe that today there are no false prophets? Surely there are more false prophets now than in the first century.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>In Second John</H2><P>Now let us read 2 John 7: "For many deceivers are entered into the world, who confess not that Jesus Christ has come in the flesh. This is a deceiver and an antichrist." Such persons did not confess that the Lord Jesus was God incarnated to be a man. Today there are also persons just like this. Verses 9-11 continue: "Whosoever goeth forward (lit.), and abideth not in the doctrine of Christ, hath not God. He that abideth in the doctrine of Christ, he hath both the Father and the Son. If there come any unto you, and bring not this doctrine, receive him not into your house, neither bid him God-speed: for he that biddeth him God-speed is partaker of his evil deeds." Today some go forth, abiding not in the teaching of Christ. This means they do not believe that the Lord Jesus is God, that He died on the cross for our redemption, that He was resurrected, and that today He is in the heavens. And, of course, they do not believe that He will come again a second time. This is very serious, and because they have gone so far, we are told we should not receive them into our houses to eat with them or even to greet them. This is quite serious before the Lord. We should not be indifferent concerning such people.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>In Jude</H2><P>The book of Jude also develops the seed of the tares. In verse 4 it says, "For there are certain men crept in unawares, who were before of old ordained to this condemnation, ungodly men, turning the grace of our God into lasciviousness, and denying the only Lord God, and our Lord Jesus Christ." Here the word "crept" is used. Certain men crept in. Today it is the same. Some creep into the church life with the intention of damaging the church. Surely these are the false ones.</P><P>Then let us continue in Jude with verses 8-16: "Likewise also these filthy dreamers defile the flesh, despise dominion, and speak evil of dignities. Yet Michael the archangel, when contending with the devil he disputed about the body of Moses, durst not bring against him a railing accusation, but said, The Lord rebuke thee. But these speak evil of those things which they know not: but what they know naturally, as brute beasts, in those things they corrupt themselves. Woe unto them! for they have gone in the way of Cain, and ran greedily after the error of Balaam for reward, and perished in the gainsaying of Korah. These are spots in your feasts of charity, when they feast with you feeding themselves without fear: clouds they are without water, carried about of winds; trees whose fruit withereth, without fruit, twice dead, plucked up by the roots; raging waves of the sea, foaming out their own shame; wandering stars, to whom is reserved the blackness of darkness for ever. And Enoch also, the seventh from Adam, prophesied of these, saying, Behold, the Lord cometh with ten thousands of His saints, to execute judgment upon all, and to convince all that are ungodly among them of all their ungodly deeds which they have ungodly committed, and of all their hard speeches which ungodly sinners have spoken against Him. These are murmurers, complainers, walking after their own lusts; and their mouth speaketh great swelling words, having men's persons in admiration because of advantage." Surely all of these are tares, and according to the prophecy of Enoch, the Lord will first deal with them.</P><P>Then continuing with verses 17-19: "But, beloved, remember ye the words which were spoken before of the apostles of our Lord Jesus Christ; how that they told you there should be mockers in the last time, who should walk after their own ungodly lusts. These be they who separate themselves, sensual, having not the Spirit." Again these are the false ones.</P>
