   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>RECEIVING THE SPIRIT</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>How is this life supplied to us?</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>To help our understanding, the Bible uses physical things to symbolize what is spiritual.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Eating and drinking symbolize our receiving the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The Lord said, "If anyone thirst, let him come to Me and drink.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>He who believes in Me, as the Scripture said, out of his innermost being shall flow rivers of living water" John 7:37-38 .</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The next verse explains that He was speaking about the Spirit, "Whom those who believed in Him were about to receive."</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>To receive the Spirit is like drinking water.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>To enjoy the Spirit is like eating food.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>When we eat properly, our body is nourished and we have the energy to carry on.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Even without understanding how it happens, we know that the food we eat somehow is digested and assimilated and supplies us with strength.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The spiritual nourishment that we take in does the same thing for our spirit John 6:57, 63 .</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>THE RICHES IN THE SPIRIT</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>How rich is this Spirit we have received!</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>There is both the element of God and the element of man.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>When Jesus lived on this earth, His humanity was of the highest quality.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>His character was without flaw.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>This humanity, in passing through death and resurrection, became yet more uplifted.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Now in the Spirit there is this uplifted human nature as well as the divine nature.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>There is also the power of endurance.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>All His earthly life the Lord suffered persecution, yet He endured.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Now this endurance is in the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Here also is the power of crucifixion.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The death of Jesus Christ terminated sin and Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>It bruised the Devil's head.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>It overcame the gates of Hades.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>It meant the end of the world and the end of Satan's kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Everything of the old creation was terminated in that death, which is now in the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Resurrection is also included in the Spirit, along with the power of resurrection, its life, its fragrance, and its riches.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Here also are ascension, glorification, enthronement, dominion, lordship, and headship.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>What we think of as life is poor.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Consider how rich is this life spoken of in the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The Spirit of life gives us life 2 Cor 3:6b , a life which includes all we have mentioned and more.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>As we fellowship with the Lord, the Spirit operates in us spontaneously and causes us to experience all these elements.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>We can sense the element of God within us.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>When we are at prayer and in fellowship with the Lord, we feel that there is something within us that exceeds man's measure.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>We sense that somehow we surpass others, including the angels!</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>An Uplifted Humanity</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Every saved one has experienced this sense at one time or other.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>If you think back, you will remember some occasion when you prayed and prayed until you reached holy ground.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>You felt you were greater than the president, higher than any earthly king.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>You were experiencing the divine nature, God in you.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Such prayer affects your thinking.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>It clarifies your mind.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Beforehand, you were foolish and confused, unable to differentiate between up and down.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>You could not figure out where you were headed.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>But that time when you prayed through, your thinking became clear.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Your will and your emotions also came into line.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Your stubborn insistence gave way, yet you did not become a jellyfish with no backbone.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Your will was firm, but the willfulness was gone.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Your emotions, usually so varying and unreliable, became steady.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>There was no more the irrational love toward what should not be loved, nor the groundless dislike of what should be appealing.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Your whole character was uplifted with your mind clear, your will firm, and your emotions proper.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Can you not recall having had such an experience?</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Teenage girls spend much of their time daydreaming.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>They often have a hard time concentrating.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Sometimes they are stubborn, but other times they are easily swayed.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>They can cry with little or no provocation.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>When they spend time to pray adequately, however, they are filled with the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Then the humanity they exhibit is of the highest caliber.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>They are able to give their attention to what needs to be done, their will becomes resolute, and their emotions are stable.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>If they have not had such an experience, their praying has not been thorough enough.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>When they succeed in praying through, they will find that in them there is not only God but also the proper humanity.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Consider the kind of person you were before you were saved.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>You lived in your imaginations, letting your thoughts wander at will.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>When something favorable happened to you, you were so happy you could not sleep.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>When a hardship came your way, you were so miserable you wanted to die.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>When you got mad, your rage knew no bounds.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>You were like someone playing the piano, but playing only the high notes!</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Now that you are saved, you are not the same.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>When you pray earnestly and thoroughly until you touch God, you find an uplifted humanity within you.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Your thoughts no longer zoom from the heights of the heavens to the depths of the seas.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>When you are happy, there is moderation in your joy.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>Even when you weep, there is a limit which you do not exceed.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>You may still lose your temper, but there is a restraint which keeps you from going too far.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>As you remain in fellowship with the Lord, your piano playing produces lovely music.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>When the notes should be high, they are high.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>When they should be low and soft, you play accordingly.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>The wildness and the imbalance are no longer heard.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>The humanity of Jesus has stabilized you.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>Jesus of Nazareth had the highest humanity.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>After He passed through death and resurrection, the element of His humanity entered into the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>This is the very Spirit that came into you when you received the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>His character is now your character.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>In the indwelling Spirit there is humanity as well as divinity.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>By Him you become a proper man.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>One who is filled with the Spirit can be firm and strong, even to the point of martyrdom.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>The threat of death does not terrify him.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>His will can be more steadfast than the mountains.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>However much stress he encounters, his inner supply is not exhausted.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>This is the humanity of Jesus Christ, experienced and expressed when one is filled with the Spirit.</S>
