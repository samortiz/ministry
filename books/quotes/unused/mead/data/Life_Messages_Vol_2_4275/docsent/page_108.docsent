   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>LIGHT AND LIFE</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>It is through prayer that you can be turned to your spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>When you pray, you pray yourself into the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Your quarreling leaves you in darkness, but after some time you calm down and begin to pray a little.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Then comes the shining.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>You see how wrong your arguing was.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>You realize that your thought was wrong, that you had a poor attitude, and that what you said should not have been said.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The more you pray, the more you are in your spirit, where the light shines.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Both the spirit of man and the Spirit of God are lamps, shining and enlightening our inward parts.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>As our spirit shines, the Spirit of God intensifies the shining sevenfold, till we find we have no place to hide.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Where this light shines, there the life supply goes.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Little by little, chamber by chamber, we are transformed into the Lord's image.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The gold in us takes shape.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Christ is formed in us.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>For us to live is Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>In all of us this shining, supplying, and transforming is going on, making us the golden lampstand.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Then we are truly the church, the practical expression of God, and His testimony.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The Father is in us, the Son has taken form, and the Spirit expresses this reality.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>BY MEANS OF ALL PRAYER</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>We can liken this golden lampstand to a complicated piece of machinery.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Without a certain small screw, the machinery will not operate.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The screw for this golden lampstand is that we must be in our spirit!</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Prayer is the key to our being able to stay in spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>"By means of all prayer and petition, praying at every time in spirit, and watching unto this in all perseverance and petition" Eph 6:18 .</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>"Pray without ceasing" 1 Thes 5:17 , because as soon as we stop praying, we leave our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>All around are things to distract us.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>We must keep our eyes shut and be in prayer!</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Sometimes we have to go shopping.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>If we really have a need to buy something, when we go into the department store, we must pay no attention to all the alluring things on display.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>It takes an effort, but we must stay in prayer so that we buy only what we came for.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>God keeps calling us back to our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>I remember in 1933 when I lived in Shanghai, I had to go from one end of town to the other for a meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>In those days it was an hour's ride by electric car.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The streets were bustling with activity, and gaudy signs tried to catch the eye.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Before I left, I spent time praying for the meeting that night.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>However, by the time I reached the meeting hall after that car ride, the spirit was gone.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>It was shaken off because of all the distracting things to be seen.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>I learned a lesson from that experience.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Afterwards, whenever I took the electric car, I would sit there with my eyes closed, praying, refusing to be enticed by the scenes outside.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Then when my ride was over, I would still be conscious of the spirit with me.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>When I went into the meetings, the spirit would come forth.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>With so much to turn you away, it is not easy to remain in spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>That is why you must heed this exhortation to pray at every time in spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Pray with all prayer and petition!</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Watch unto this in all perseverance!</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>"Quench not the Spirit" 1 Thes 5:19 !</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Walk according to spirit!</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Set your mind on the spirit Rom 8:6 !</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Then you will be kept in life.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>The two lamps inside you will be shining brightly.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>All your inner chambers will be transformed into the image of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Not only will you have the pure gold; it will take shape, and there will be the expression.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>The crucial point is that you must remain in, or turn back to your spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Then there will be a golden lampstand, the church, the practical expression of the Triune God.</S>
