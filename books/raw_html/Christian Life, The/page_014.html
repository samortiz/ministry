<H2 CLASS=HEAD1>II. ALL THE CONTENTS HAVING BEEN CONSUMMATED<br>TO BE THE ALL-INCLUSIVE SPIRIT OF LIFE<br>THROUGH CHRIST'S DEATH AND RESURRECTION</H2><P>All the contents, the elements, of the processed and consummated Triune God have been compounded together and consummated to be the all-inclusive Spirit. This all-inclusive Spirit is the consummated Triune God, the consummation of the Triune God, through Christ's death and resurrection (John 7:39; 1 Cor. 15:45b; 2 Cor. 3:17; Gal. 3:14; Rev. 2:7; 22:17). John 7:39 says that the Spirit was not yet, because Jesus had not yet been glorified. At that time in the Gospels, the Holy Spirit was there, the Spirit of God was there, but not the Spirit. This is because Christ had not yet been glorified. This means that Christ had not gone through His death and entered into His resurrection. Jesus was glorified when He was resurrected (Luke 24:26). First Corinthians 15:45b reveals that Christ as the last Adam became a life-giving Spirit in His resurrection. Second Corinthians 3:17 says that the Lord is the Spirit, and Galatians 3:14 says that this all-inclusive Spirit, the Spirit, is the blessing of the New Testament gospel. The blessing of the gospel is not merely redemption, the forgiveness of sins, justification, regeneration, or salvation. The blessing of the gospel is a person, and that person is the all-inclusive Spirit as the consummation of the processed and consummated Triune God.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>III. THE ALL-INCLUSIVE SPIRIT<br>AND CHRIST'S ALL-INCLUSIVE DEATH<br>AND HIS ALL-INCLUSIVE RESURRECTION<br>BECOMING THE THREE MAIN ELEMENTS OF THE LIFE<br>BY WHICH THE BELIEVERS OF CHRIST LIVE<br>THE CHRISTIAN LIFE FOR THE CHURCH LIFE</H2><P>The all-inclusive Spirit and Christ's all-inclusive death and His all-inclusive resurrection have become the three main elements of the life by which the believers of Christ live the Christian life for the church life. Therefore, to know the Christian life, we have to know these three elements.</P>
