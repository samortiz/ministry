   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>NO NEED TO WAIT</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Once I was invited to dinner at a missionary's home.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>We sat and talked for a long time concerning this matter.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>I asked him, "Can you say that you have overcome all your sins?"</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>He answered, "I have to wait and see if this will work or not."</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>What he meant was, "Paul said that he had died and was resurrected.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>But I cannot say the same because if I say it and then lose my temper, what am I going to do?</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Am I not still alive?</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Therefore, I must wait a few days to see if it works or not."</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>I told him, "God has put you into His Son; you are now dead with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>God has also put you into His resurrection that He may be your life within.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>What you should do is believe.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Instead you are just waiting.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Do you really believe?</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>You are not believing because if you were, you would praise God for Christ being your life.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>You would not even worry whether this would work or not.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>God is responsible for it, and He never fails.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>All His accomplished works become real when you exercise your faith.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>What are you waiting for?</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Are you doubting the Word of God?"</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>BELIEVING IN THE FACTS</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Once again it is a matter of faith.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Faith always concerns accomplished facts.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Anything for tomorrow is not faith.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Nor is anything in hope.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Many, after hearing such messages, say that they have faith.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>But whether or not they really possess it is an open question.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Let me illustrate my point by a real story.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>I have two co-workers.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>One is a brother by the name of Nee.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The other is a sister called Lee.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Both started in their Christian work recently and both are nearsighted.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Eventually, both had a pair of glasses.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Miss Lee went to the Lord and prayed, "Lord, You have healed the blind.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Can't You do the same for me?</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>It is very inconvenient for me to go around preaching in villages with this pair of glasses.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Lord, heal me."</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>She made this prayer on a little steamboat on her way to a village.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>After her prayer she knew that God had answered her request.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>She had the faith within her to throw her glasses into the river.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Her eyes were consequently healed.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>FAITH IS NOT FOR THE FUTURE</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The news came to Mr. Nee.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>One day he came to me, saying, "God has healed Miss Lee's eyes.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>I believe that He will do the same for me."</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>I answered, "You said that God will heal you.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>This proves that you do not have the faith yet.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>You will not be healed."</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>He insisted, however, that God would work a miracle and that he had such a faith.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>After two days he was on a steamboat.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>He took off his glasses and threw them into the water.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>A month afterward I saw him, and he told me that his eyes had not improved any.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>It seemed as if God had not healed him yet.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>I said, "If you are wise, you had better spend twelve dollars to buy another pair of glasses."</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>He said that he was going to preach in Ku-tien and would be back in four months.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>He had the faith that by then he would be healed.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>I said, "If you think that four months from now God will heal you, you are putting your faith in the future.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>This is not genuine faith."</S>
