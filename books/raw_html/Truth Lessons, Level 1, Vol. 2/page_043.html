<h2 class="head2">D. Binding and Imprisoning Satan</h2><p>After Christ in His second coming deals with the four groups of people on the earth, He will send an angel to bind Satan, cast him into the abyss, and shut him up for one thousand years (Rev. 20:1-3). Immediately after Satan&rsquo;s rebellion, God declared His judgment on him (Isa. 14:12-15). Since then God has been continuously executing His judgment (Luke 10:17-19; Heb. 2:14; Rev. 12:9, 12). Then in His second coming, Christ will further execute God&rsquo;s judgment pronounced on the rebellious Satan by binding and imprisoning him. After Christ removes God&rsquo;s rebel from the earth, He will clear up the rebellious earth that His kingdom, the kingdom of God, may come to the earth.</p><h2 class="head2">E. Setting up the Millennial Kingdom<br />on the Earth</h2><p>After Christ clears up the rebellious ones on the earth, He will set up the millennial kingdom, the kingdom of God and of Him, on the cleansed earth (Rev. 20:4-6; 11:15). The &ldquo;sheep&rdquo; who are justified and blessed will be the people in the earthly part of the millennium, that is, the kingdom of the Son of Man (Matt. 13:41). The saved Israelites will serve as priests in the earthly part to teach the people, &ldquo;the sheep,&rdquo; how to serve God (Zech. 8:20-23). The overcoming saints as Christ&rsquo;s bride will be in the heavenly part of the millennium, that is, the kingdom of the Father (Matt. 13:43), to reign with Christ and rule over the nations as the people for one thousand years (Rev. 2:26-27).</p><h2 class="head2">F. Purging the Last Rebellion of Mankind</h2><p>At the end of the millennium, Satan will be loosed out of his prison, the abyss. He will go out to deceive the nations, the people on the earth during the millennium, to follow him and to surround the camp pitched by the saints on earth and the city inhabited by the people of Israel, in his last struggle to rebel against God. Then fire will come down from heaven to devour them. The Devil who deceived the people will be cast into the lake of fire, where Antichrist and his false prophet also will be (Rev. 20:7-10). This is the last stage of Christ&rsquo;s execution of God&rsquo;s judgment on Satan; it is also the final clearing up of the rebellious poison which was injected into man by Satan. Thus, the purged nations may enter into the new heaven and new earth to be the blessed people of God forever.</p><h2 class="head2">G. Judging All the Dead in the Universe</h2><p>In Christ&rsquo;s second coming, the last thing He will do is to judge all the dead, including all the dead human beings imprisoned in Hades and all the dead demons confined in the sea (Rev. 20:11-15). Thus, Christ will sit on the great white throne to be the Judge of the dead human beings (Acts 10:42; 2 Tim. 4:1; 1 Pet. 4:5). At the same time, He will also judge the dead demons. After He has cast both the dead human beings and the dead demons into the lake of fire, the whole universe will be completely cleared up and the new heaven and new earth may be brought in.</p><h2 class="head1">IV. HIS ETERNITY FUTURE</h2><p>In His second coming Christ will use nearly one thousand years to thoroughly clean up the whole universe and put it in order. Then the new heaven and new earth will be brought in, and its center will be the New Jerusalem composed of all the people redeemed by God throughout all generations. Everything of Christ&rsquo;s eternal future is in the New Jerusalem.</p><h2 class="head2">A. Being the Entrance into the New Jerusalem</h2><p>The coming New Jerusalem is the ultimate crystallization of the mingling of the processed Triune God with men who have been redeemed and transformed by God with the divine elements of His divine Trinity in the different dispensations of the old creation, to be an organism to express Him in eternity future. The essence of the divine nature of God the Father, who is the origin and source of everything, like the precious and pure gold, is the very substance of the divine organism. The all-inclusive, glorious Christ as the embodiment of the divine Trinity, who has passed through an all-inclusive death and has entered into a resurrection which is rich in the divine life and the life-generating power to produce a result like pearls with glory and beauty, is the entrance into the divine organism. The saints, who are regenerated and transformed with all the divine elements by the Spirit, as the ultimate consummation of the processed Triune God, like the valuable and splendid precious stones, constitute the wall and the wall&rsquo;s foundation. Christ as the entrance into this divine organism is the key uniting factor of this divine organism. Christ as such an entrance will be completely and fully expressed in His eternity.</p>
