   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER EIGHT</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>THE SPIRIT IN REVELATION</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In this message we shall consider the Spirit in the book of Revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In Revelation we see that the Spirit of God is now the seven Spirits.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The term the seven Spirits is found four times in Revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Revelation 1:4 speaks of the seven Spirits who are before God's throne; 3:1, of the seven Spirits of God; 4:5, of seven lamps of fire burning before the throne, which are the seven Spirits of God; and 5:6, of the seven eyes of the Lamb, which are the seven Spirits of God, sent forth into all the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The seven Spirits of God are called the seven lamps of fire burning before the throne and also the seven eyes of the Lamb.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>They are the seven Spirits of God; yet these seven Spirits are the seven lamps of fire burning before God's administrative throne and also the seven eyes of the redeeming Lamb.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Before you came into the church life, you probably never heard a word about the seven Spirits of God being the seven lamps and the seven eyes.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Nevertheless, this is found in the book of Revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Hardly anything in the book of Revelation is new.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Revelation is not a book of new things; rather, it is the conclusion of the things revealed in the foregoing books of the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The book of Revelation is the consummation of all previous revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>It contains few new things, and the new things it does contain are related to the foregoing revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>This is true with respect to the seven lamps and the seven eyes.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Both are references to the Old Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The term the seven Spirits, however, is a new term; it cannot be found in the Old Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>But the seven lamps and the seven eyes are found in the Old Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>In Exodus chapter twenty-five, the first mention of the lampstand, we read of the seven lamps.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Hence, the term the seven lamps found in Revelation is a reference to the Old Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>GOD'S TESTIMONY AND GOD'S ADMINISTRATION</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The thought of seven lamps burning and shining before God is not new; it had already been presented in the Old Testament Exo 25:31-37 .</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The lampstand in the tabernacle had seven lamps burning before God.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The lampstand signified not only God's testimony, but also God's administration.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>God's administration cannot be separated from His testimony because God's testimony is for God's administration.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Most Christian teachers, however, have seen only that the lampstand is a testimony.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>They have not seen that the lampstand also refers to God's administration.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>God's administration is carried out through the shining of the lampstand.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>A PICTURE OF THE TRIUNE GOD</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>We need to consider this lampstand in more detail.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The lampstand with its branches is all-inclusive.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>It provides a clear picture of the Trinity.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>In the lampstand we have the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Firstly, the lampstand is solid gold, made of a talent of gold.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Thus, gold is the essence, the substance, of the lampstand.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>In typology gold signifies God's substance, God's nature.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>No doubt the gold of the lampstand signifies that the source of the lampstand is the Father in the Godhead with the divine substance.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Secondly, the stand itself is the embodiment of the gold.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Without the stand, the gold would not have any embodiment or form.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>But with the stand the gold has a form and an embodiment.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The stand as the embodiment of the gold signifies the Son, the second in the Trinity, who is the embodiment of God the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The Father is the substance, and the Son is the embodiment.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Thirdly, we have the seven lamps which refer to the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The seven lamps, obviously, are the expression.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The gold is the substance, the stand is the embodiment, and the lamps are the expression.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Therefore, in the lampstand we have the Father as the substance, the Son as the embodiment, and the Spirit as the expression.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>This is the Triune God: the substance, the embodiment, and the expression.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>In substance the lampstand is one, but in expression it is seven.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>At the bottom the lampstand is one, but at the top it is seven.</S>
