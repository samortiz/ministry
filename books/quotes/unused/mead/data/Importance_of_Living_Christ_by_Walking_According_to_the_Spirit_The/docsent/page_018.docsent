   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE BODY LIFE REVEALED</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>IN EPHESIANS 4 AND COLOSSIANS 2</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Ephesians 4:15-16 says, Holding to truth in love, we may grow up into Him in all things, who is the Head, Christ, out from whom all the Body, being joined together and being knit together through every joint of the rich supply and through the operation in the measure of each one part, causes the growth of the Body unto the building up of itself in love.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Thus, as we walk according to the spirit and drink of the Spirit, we grow up into Christ the Head.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Then out from the Head every member of the Body ministers something to the Body, which builds up the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>A supply comes out from the Head to the Body through the members for the building up of the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Colossians 2:19 indicates that the Body holds the Head, which means that the Body exalts the Head.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The ultimate issue of the Body life is the Body exalting the Head as everything.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Colossians reveals Christ as the all-inclusive One.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Thus, the all-inclusive Christ, who is the Head, is exalted by His Body.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Because Christ is everything, in the Body life there is nothing natural no natural life, strength, gimmicks, ways, skills, schemes, intentions, or desires.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The Body life is a high goal that requires many experiences to attain.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>However, we should not think that when we reach such a high stage of the Body life, there will be no weak or troublesome ones in the churches.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>There will always be such ones to test whether we are inclusive.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>In a proper family there are mature ones to maintain a proper family life, but there are also weak and troublesome ones.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Whether a family is proper or not depends on whether there are mature ones to maintain a proper family life.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>In a large family only a few may be the mature ones who maintain good order in the family; the rest may be weak, sick, dissenting, and rebellious.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The church should be such a normal, proper family.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>An army has age limits and physical requirements and does not accept those who are not qualified.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>However, the church is not an army but a family, which has no such requirements.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The members of a family may be of many different ages, sizes, and conditions.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>We should not expect that every member of a local church will be at the same stage in spiritual growth.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Neither should we expect that there will not be weak and troublesome ones.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Such a church does not exist.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>In the New Jerusalem we will all be fully transformed, but we cannot expect that today.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>In 1 Thessalonians 3:12 Paul writes, The Lord cause you to increase and abound in love to one another and to all.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>We should love everyone.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Question: To what extent has the Body life existed on the earth?</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Answer: Strictly speaking, the proper Body life has never existed, but I believe that it will exist.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>I do not think it existed at Paul s time.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>I even doubt that the original recipients of Paul s Epistles understood as much as we do today.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The seven epistles in Revelation depict a messy situation in many of the churches.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>However, they were still genuine churches, and there were overcomers in each church.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>This indicates that in a certain church some saints may be in the reality of the Body life, but others in the same church may not.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Again, this is like a family in which only a few members are mature and keep the family normal.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Question: Is there an outward difference in the experience and expression of believers who walk according to the spirit, drink of the Spirit, and live the Body life and of those who do not?</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Answer: There is a visible difference.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Every kind of life has an expression.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>If a brother walks according to the spirit, there will be a corresponding expression, or manifestation, in his living that others can see.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>A brother who may genuinely love the Lord but walks according to the flesh will be opinionated and quarrelsome.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Such a one is fleshly and natural, and the more he tries to do for the Lord, the more he damages the church.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>However, if we cast out such ones, we are no longer the church but only a sect.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>This is the practice in today s Christianity.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Thus, we have a great responsibility to tolerate and embrace every believer, and we also have to walk according to the spirit, drink the Spirit, and live the Body life.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Otherwise, the Lord will have no way.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>All these points are in Paul s fourteen Epistles.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>This was his spirit; he was such a person.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>To be in the Lord s recovery is not a matter of degree.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>However, we may be in the recovery only to a certain extent.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>This is a serious matter, and we need to be open to the Lord to see where we are.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>From the late 1820s the Brethren had a good start for about twenty-five years.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Then they gradually veered off, and today they are no longer part of the Lord s up-to-date recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Because their habit and tradition were to have strict requirements, they were divided again and again.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Now there are thousands of divisions among the Brethren.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>They emphasize biblical knowledge and doctrinal accuracy, but they have failed.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>It is possible for the churches in the Lord s recovery today to similarly err.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>The way to be saved from such failure is to walk according to the spirit, drink of the Spirit, and embrace all believers.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>We need to be inclusive, not exclusive, and an inclusive church is a messy church.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Most Christians today are accustomed to frequently leaving the group they meet with when they no longer like the meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>For believers or local churches to be exclusive is the same in principle.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>We should not try to exclude all the things that we do not like or agree with.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>The Lord allows many things that He does not like or agree with.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>The church is inclusive.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>If we are not inclusive, we are sectarian.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Paul was inclusive.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>In 1 and 2 Corinthians he was severe and strict in dealing with some of the Corinthians, but he forgave everyone.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>However, some of the Corinthian believers who were so holy would not forgive.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Therefore, Paul had to charge them to forgive 2 Cor 6:11, 13; 2:7, 10 .</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Question: I see now that I should not do anything for the Lord according to my intentions, but I fear that if I wait to be led by the Spirit, nothing will happen.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>What should I do?</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Answer: The definition, or analysis, of spiritual things may differ from the practice of such things, just as what is taught in a classroom may differ from what works in a laboratory.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>When we practice to walk according to the spirit, there will be a spontaneous issue, just as a tree that is living will spontaneously produce leaves, blossoms, and fruit.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>Daniel 11:32 says, The people who know their God will show strength and take action.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>Knowing God issues in our taking action.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>If we do not take action, this indicates that we do not have a living knowledge of God.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>If we walk according to the spirit, it will not be in vain.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>As we walk according to the spirit, we should show strength and take action but without politics or the intention to gain a personal kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>This is not easy.</S>
