I also feel the same. Of course, there are many reasons for this, and they may be quite complicated. But of all the reasons affecting the bread-breaking meeting, none is more serious than the one spoken of in Hebrews 13:15-16: "Through Him then let us offer up a sacrifice of praise continually to God, that is, the fruit of lips confessing His name. But do not forget doing good and sharing with others, for with such sacrifices God is well pleased." Here two sacrifices are spoken of. The first is the sacrifice of praise, and the second is that of doing good and sharing with others. A sacrifice is something that is a loss to oneself and a gain to God. A sacrifice of praise is a praise that is rendered to God at one's own loss. A sacrifice of sharing or giving is giving something to God at one's own expense.</p><p>We do not have adequate praise in the bread-breaking meeting because we fall short in sharing and giving. We must give to the extent that we "feel" our giving. In other words, we have to give to the extent that we can sense the loss. Only this kind of offering can be considered a sacrifice. When we do this, we will spontaneously offer up the sacrifice of praise. If we give in a casual way, our praise will not be high. If we do not have the sacrifice of giving, we will not have the sacrifice of praise. The apostle told us to offer up a sacrifice of praise. Then he spoke of the sacrifice of giving. The word "but" in verse 16 means that something will follow. In addition to the sacrifice of praise, there is still something that follows. The phrase "do not forget" refers to the fact that it is most easy for men to forget. What should we not forget? We should not forget doing good and sharing with others. Then the apostle explained, "For with such sacrifices God is well pleased." The apostle considered doing good and giving as a kind of sacrifice, and he pointed out that they are sacrifices that are well pleasing to God.</p><p>Praise and giving are like two legs. If one is shorter than the other, we cannot expect a person to walk properly. Praise and giving are also like two wings. If one is missing, a bird cannot fly. It may still have one wing, but the wing is useless. A bird with only one wing cannot fly. When we come to the meeting, we sometimes find superficial ones uttering a few words of praise, but their praise is never high.</p><h2 class="head1">THE HEART BEING WHERE THE TREASURE IS</h2><p>Our God is a rich God. He does not need our money. The cattle of a thousand hills and the goats of ten thousand mountains are His. All the gold and silver are His. Then why does He need our money? It is because where our treasure is, there will our heart be also (Matt. 6:21). Money is a material thing that belongs to the earth. Yet the Bible puts God and mammon together. This proves that man's heart is either touched by God or by money. God's test of a man's heart toward Him is in the way of man's giving.</p><p>I started working for the Lord sixteen years ago in 1922. Although I cannot say that my work has been perfect, I can say that all the shortages have been covered under the blood. Sometimes I gave one-tenth, sometimes two-tenths, and sometimes five-tenths of what I received. Because there was never a steady flow of income, it was difficult to determine ahead of time how much I should give. But I can say that the times when I felt the pain of giving the most were the times that my thanksgivings and praises were the loudest. Many brothers and sisters can testify of the same thing. I despise anyone who says that he is living by faith, but who knows only how to receive but not to give. Sometimes the best test of where a person stands is to consider his giving. A worker of the Lord must give at least one-tenth, because the Bible shows us that the Levites had to tithe the same way as the rest of the Israelites (Num. 18:25-29). If a worker only expects to receive from others, and if he considers money as being such a big thing, it is better for him to not be a preacher at all. Rather, he should go to the world and take up a money-making profession.</p><p>Someone told me that sisters generally give more than brothers do. The reason for this may be a failure on the part of the workers. One can speak on any subject comfortably; but when it comes to the subject of giving, many are hesitant to open their mouth. Tonight I am forced to speak about it. This is something I have wanted to say for many years but could not find the right opportunity. Tonight I will grasp the opportunity to say something because I will be away again very soon. The Bible records the case of brothers stealing money and sisters offering money (John 12:6; Luke 8:3). This is a shame to the brothers.</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_062.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_064.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Collected Works of Watchman Nee, The (Set 2) Vol. 43: Conferences, Messages, and Fellowship (3) &nbsp; pg 63</div><br></body></html>
