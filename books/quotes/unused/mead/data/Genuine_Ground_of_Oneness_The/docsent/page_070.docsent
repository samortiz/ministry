   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE RECOVERY OF THE CHURCH LIFE</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>This local oneness was damaged and altogether lost by the time the Catholic Church was formed.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The emperor Constantine the Great initiated the formation of the Catholic Church early in the fourth century.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In A.D. 325 he called a council at Nicaea to settle theological disputes which were a cause of strife throughout his empire.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>He used his political influence to bring about a certain kind of unity.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>By the end of the sixth century the Catholic Church was fully formed with the establishment of the papal system.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>At that time the local oneness was absolutely destroyed and lost.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>During the following centuries, a period known as the Dark Ages, the Bible was locked away from the people, and the truth of salvation was obscured.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Then with the Reformation the Bible was released in the language of the people, and the truth of justification by faith was recovered.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>In the matter of justification, Martin Luther was bold.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>However, in the matter of the church, he was cowardly.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>He was even instrumental in the formation of the state church in Germany.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The first state church was that formed in Germany through the assistance of Luther.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Luther not only made such a terrible blunder, but he persecuted those believers who emphasized the experience of life.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>For example, Schwenckfeld was called a devil.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>In the decades that followed many faithful ones were persecuted and even martyred for their faith, sometimes at the hand of the state churches that had been established in a number of European countries.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>THE RECOVERY IN THE EIGHTEENTH CENTURY</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Early in the eighteenth century, a number of believers fled to Bohemia to escape persecution.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Zinzendorf had both the love and the burden to care for these refugees.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>However, among them there were disputes over doctrine and practice.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>When these disputes made it impossible for the believers to go on together peacefully, Zinzendorf required all the leaders to sign a statement that they would set aside the differences and live together in oneness.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>During the next meeting for the Lord's table, they experienced a mighty outpouring of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>In this way the practice of the church life was recovered, at least in a beginning way.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>THE RECOVERY WITH THE BRETHREN</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Another kind of reaction to religious formality and deadness was that of mystics such as Madame Guyon and Fenelon.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Although this reaction took place in the seventeenth century, there was no recovery of the church life until the eighteenth century.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The practice of the church life under the leadership of Zinzendorf was very good, but it was not adequate.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Therefore, early in the nineteenth century the Lord took a further step toward the recovery of the church life with a group of believers in Great Britain, especially those with John Nelson Darby.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>For approximately twenty-five years, the Brethren under the leadership of Darby experienced a wonderful recovery of the church life, a recovery that was more complete and adequate than that under Zinzendorf a century earlier.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>However, due to debates over doctrine, the oneness was lost, and the Brethren were divided.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>As the years went by, they were divided into more than a hundred divisions.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Because the oneness was so seriously damaged, the presence of the Lord with them was greatly diminished.</S>
