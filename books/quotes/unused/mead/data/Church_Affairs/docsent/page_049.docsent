   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>The Decision Made by the Apostles and the Elders</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>and Endorsed by the Holy Spirit and the Church</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>It is quite strange to see how the matter was decided.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>After the brothers and sisters had all spoken, the apostles and elders had to make the decision.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The first one who stood up was Peter.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Peter stood up to state his personal opinion, relating to them what he had personally experienced, saying, Men, brothers, you know that from the early days God chose from among you that through my mouth the Gentiles should hear the word of the gospel and believe.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>And God, the Knower of hearts, bore witness to them, giving them the Holy Spirit even as also to us; and He made no distinction between us and them, cleansing their hearts by faith.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Therefore why are you now testing God by placing a yoke upon the neck of the disciples which neither our fathers nor we were able to bear? vv.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>7-10 .</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Later, they invited Barnabas to speak because Barnabas had gone out from Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>They asked him to relate the actual situation of the matter.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Then Paul spoke.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>You can see that here Peter spoke, Barnabas spoke, Paul spoke, and finally James stood up.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Verse 13 is the best part: And when they finished speaking, James answered, saying, Men, brothers, listen to me.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>He was the brother who was foremost in the church in Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The history of the church shows us that at that time he was acting somewhat like a chairman, although this may not be the right term for it.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Among the many brothers in Jerusalem at that time, James was the one who stood in the forefront.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Peter, Barnabas, and Paul had testified, and the three were one.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>These three brothers with spiritual weight shared the same feeling.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Let us see what James said: And when they finished speaking, James answered, saying, Men, brothers, listen to me.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Simeon has related how God first visited the Gentiles....Therefore I judge these were words of authority that we do not harass those from the Gentiles who are turning to God, but that we write to them to abstain from the contaminations of idols and fornication and what is strangled and blood.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>For Moses from ancient generations has in every city those who proclaim him in the synagogues, he being read every Sabbath.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>It then seemed good to the apostles and the elders with the whole church... vv.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>13-14, 19-22 .</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The matter was thus decided.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>This was the first, as well as the last, conference of the church recorded in the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>I want to show you that this is how matters are decided in the church; it is not as the worldly people practice.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The people of the world decide matters according to the opinion of the majority.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The church does not decide matters in the way of Thyatira either, where one or two persons at the top make a decision and that decision is final.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Rather, all the brothers have the opportunity not only to speak but even to discuss.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>First, everyone who wants to speak is allowed to speak.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>To do it this way does not mean that their words are taken but that the church waits on the mind of God.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Perhaps a very simple brother speaks forth God s mind.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Therefore, everyone may speak and discuss, but do not let the discussion continue the whole time.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>After much discussion and after many words have been spoken, let the responsible brothers, those who have spiritual weight before God, the elders and the apostles, speak forth their opinions.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>At the end God expresses His mind through the ones with the highest authority.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>You can see that the responsible brothers all had the same opinion.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>After hearing so much, with the opinions of all the responsible brothers being the same, they made the decision.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The other brothers then needed to learn to accept this opinion.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Thus, it says, It then seemed good to the apostles and the elders with the whole church v. 22 . This is how the affairs are handled in the church.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The church does not take care of its affairs by casting ballots.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The final decision in handling affairs in the church is left with those who have spiritual weight.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>All the arguments are to be listened to; all the arguments of the brothers need to be heard.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>This is the manner of handling church affairs.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Therefore, we need to learn to let them speak, to listen to all their arguments.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>I wish that every worker could listen patiently.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>If several brothers have opinions, let them speak and discuss.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Never consider this to be wrong; this is a proper way.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>But at the same time, ask God to give you proper judgment.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Eventually, the decision of the apostles was readily seen as God s decision.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Therefore, the words in verse 28 are very wonderful: For it seemed good to the Holy Spirit and to us.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>The anointing of the Holy Spirit was there.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>That decision was made by the Holy Spirit and us.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>A decision was made by the Holy Spirit and us to ask the apostles and the elders to write a letter.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Therefore, I hope you brothers can see that the way the church handles its affairs should neither be autocratic nor democratic.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Neither autocracy nor democracy is allowed.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>There should be neither the opinion of only one person nor the casting of ballots.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>When the church handles affairs, the final decision rests with those who have spiritual authority.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>However, everyone should be given the opportunity to speak.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>While they are speaking, you are observing and sensing how their spirit is.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>At the end you stand up and say, Brothers, concerning this matter, we few brothers have decided in this way.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>In the church there is neither the majority listening to the minority nor the minority listening to the majority.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>In the church there are only the brothers and sisters expressing opinions and the spiritual men making the decisions.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>After a decision, the church carries it out in one accord.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>This way is different from worldly organizations and methods.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>I hope that all the brothers and sisters can see this.</S>
