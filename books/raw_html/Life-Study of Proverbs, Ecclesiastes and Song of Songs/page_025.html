<H2 CLASS=HEAD3>3. Concerning Sin</H2><P>Who can say, I have made my heart clean; I am pure from my sin? (20:9). He who covers his transgressions will not prosper, but whoever confesses and forsakes them will obtain mercy (28:13). Proverbs 28:13 is a good verse. We should ask the Lord to help us not to cover our transgressions but to confess and forsake them. In 22:8 we are told that he who sows injustice will reap iniquity, and the rod of his wrath will fail.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>4. Concerning Falsehood and Perverseness</H2><P>Differing weights and differing measures, both of them are an abomination to Jehovah. Differing weights are an abomination to Jehovah, and false scales are not good (20:10, 23). Thorns and snares are in the way of the perverse; he who guards his soul will keep far from them (22:5). The bread of falsehood is sweet to a man, but afterward his mouth will be filled with gravel (20:17).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>5. Concerning Pride,<br>Self-trusting, Self-boasting, and Self-honoring</H2><P>Proverbs 21:24 says that Proud, Haughty, Scorner are the names of him who works in the arrogance of pride. A man's pride will bring him low, but he who is of a lowly spirit will obtain honor (29:23). He who trusts in his own heart is a fool, but he who walks wisely will be delivered (28:26). Do not boast about tomorrow, for you do not know what a day may bring forth. Let another praise you, and not your own mouth; a foreigner, and not your own lips (27:1-2). Do not claim honor for yourself in the presence of the king, and do not stand in the place of great men; for it is better that it is said to you, "Come up here," than that you should be put lower in the presence of the noble, whom your eyes have seen (25:6-7).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>6. Concerning Seeking One's Own Glory</H2><P>Have you found honey? Eat only what you need, lest you become filled up with it and vomit it. It is not good to eat much honey, nor is it glory for men to search out their own glory (vv. 16, 27).</P>
