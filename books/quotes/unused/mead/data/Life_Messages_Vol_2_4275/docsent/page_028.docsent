   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>A HELP TO UNDERSTANDING THE WORD</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>You can be saved from these snares by the books we have made available to you.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>If you use the Recovery Versions with the notes and the Life-study Messages, you will save much time and be kept on the right track.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>These are not necessary when you are doing your daily reading of three chapters in the Old Testament and one in the New.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>But when you are reading for nourishment or planning to study, use the Recovery Versions.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>We have done the studying for you!</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Many times I have spent a whole day researching a single word.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>In spite of my having studied for so many years, there are still cases when I have to delve into the meaning of a certain word.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>I check the concordance, the lexicons, and the expository books.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>I look up how the word is translated in the forty or more English versions which I have.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>There are many interpretations of the same word.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>It requires much prayer and much discernment to make a final decision as to how to translate that word in our Recovery Version.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>You can see how much labor is involved.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>When you want to study Romans, for example, you simply use the Recovery Version along with the notes and Life-studies.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>This will save you time and keep you from being side-tracked.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>It will probably be another five years before we finish all the New Testament books.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Meantime, study the ones we have already printed.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>USING YOUR SPARE TIME TO READ THE RECOVERY BOOKS</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>I was happy to hear that some of you have a plan of study.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>In addition to reading through the Bible every year, and studying it with the help of the translations and Life-study Messages that are available, I would encourage you to read the books written by Brother Nee; read the back issues of the Stream Magazine; and read the other books we have published.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>This is a good program for the young people to follow.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Build up a habit of reading.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Be sure you have all the recovery books in your home.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Whenever you have a few minutes, pick up one of the books and read.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The English is quite simple, so you can read quite a few pages in a short time.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>There is no need to study these books; even going over them quickly will benefit you.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The same is true of the Life-study Messages.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Simply read them in a smooth, flowing way; studying them may even be a frustration.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>As you take a few, spare minutes throughout the day to read even a few pages in a quick way, light will come.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>This reading is your entertainment; it is far better for you than television!</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Everyone of us must be taught and trained to be a spokesman for God.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Then we shall all be His sent ones, prophesying, evangelizing, shepherding and teaching.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The Lord's recovery is to rid us of the clergy-laity system, of hierarchy and rank, and of all the other traditions of today's Christianity.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Pray about this.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Make it your goal to be fresh in this heavenly vision.</S>
