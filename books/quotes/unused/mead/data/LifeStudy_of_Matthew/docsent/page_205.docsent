   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>E. The Householder s Answer Showing Grace according to His Desire</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Verse 13 says, But he answered and said to one of them, Friend, I am not wronging you, did you not agree with me for a denarius?</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>By one of them the Lord was no doubt referring to Peter.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The agreement mentioned in this verse was the agreement the Lord made with Peter in 19:27-29.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Here the Lord seemed to be saying, Peter, we signed an agreement.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>I don t owe you anything, for I have given you what I promised.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>However, I d like to show you that My reward is not a commercial matter, but a matter of grace.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Peter, you need to learn the lesson of grace.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The reward is a matter of grace according to My desire.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Out of grace, I desire to give those hired last the same reward that I promised to give you.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>What is wrong with this?</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Verse 14 continues, Take what is yours and go.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>I desire to give to this last one even as to you, This was a strong answer to Peter from the Lord, indicating that the Lord had given him what He thought he deserved.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>But the Lord has the right to give the same thing to the latest workmen according to His own wish, in the principle not of work but of grace.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>This shattered and corrected Peter s natural and commercial mind.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Verse 15 says, Is it not lawful for me to do what I wish with what is mine?</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Or is your eye evil because I am good?</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Peter s concept, in dealing with the Lord in 19:27, was altogether commercial, according to the principle of work, not of grace.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>In His answer to Peter, the Lord strongly indicated that His reward to His followers is not commercial, but according to His desire and grace.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>For the disciples to gain the kingdom of the heavens, they need to leave all and follow the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>But what He will give them as a reward is more than they deserve.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>It is not according to the principle of commerce, but according to the Lord s good pleasure.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>This is an incentive to His followers.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>F. Not a Legal Matter but a Matter of Grace</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>In verse 16 the Lord concludes this parable: Thus shall the last be first and the first last.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The last are the latest workmen, and the first are the earliest ones.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>In working, the earliest ones came first, but in receiving the reward, the last became the first.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>It is this way that the Lord makes the last first and the first last.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Therefore, the reward is not a legal matter, but a matter of grace.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>We should not have a commercial mind.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Salvation is based upon grace.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The Lord Jesus has done everything for us, and there is no need for us to work.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The kingdom reward, however, is according to our work, according to the price we pay.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>If we pay the price, then the Lord will give us a reward.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>It may seem that the reward is purchased by our work.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>If we think this, then we are like Peter with a commercial mentality.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>We need to be reeducated to see that even the reward is based upon grace.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The way to receive the reward is not to pay the price, but to enjoy grace.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>To be saved is to receive grace, and to gain the reward is to enjoy the grace we have received.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>When we believed in the Lord, we received grace and were saved.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>After receiving grace we must learn to enjoy grace.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>To leave all things behind and follow the Lord is not to pay a price; it is to enjoy the grace we have received.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Do not think that you have sacrificed anything.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>What you sacrifice is just dung; it is vanity of vanities.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Everything under the sun is vanity.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Your education, position, and future are all vanity.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Dung cannot be considered a price.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>To leave all things behind is to be unloaded and released.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>You have been under the heavy load of your position, wealth, and concern for your future.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Thus, you need to be unloaded, and the way to be unloaded is to enjoy grace.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Grace unloads us.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>To be unloaded through the enjoyment of grace, however, is not to pay a price.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>We are not here paying a price.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Rather, we are enjoying liberation.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Hallelujah, I have been liberated!</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>I have been liberated from my relatives, fame, position, future, and everything; I am completely free.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>I am not paying a price I am enjoying grace.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>We all need to give up the commercial mentality.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Some saints have said, I have left everything for the church.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>I have suffered very much, and now I have nothing.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Whenever I have heard this kind of complaint, deep within me I said, You cannot receive anything, because your giving up of all things and your suffering have not been done in the proper spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>If you were in the right spirit, you would be thankful, joyful, and praise the Lord that you are no longer burdened.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>If we have given up all things for the Lord in a proper spirit, we would say, O Lord, I thank You that I am not bearing the load of position, ambition, or concern for the future.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>All the worldlings are under a heavy load.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>But, Lord, I praise You that I have been unloaded and liberated.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>I am not paying a price I am daily enjoying grace.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Lord, whatever You give me is not a reimbursement, but a further enjoyment of Yourself.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>I believe that we are in the last group of workmen, those hired at five o clock in the afternoon.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>But we shall be the first to be rewarded, although we shall not work as long as Peter, James, John, and Paul, who have been working for nearly twenty centuries.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>They have labored the entire day, bearing the scorching heat.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>But we have labored for such a short time, at the most a number of years.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Perhaps as we are receiving the reward, Peter will say to John, Look, these people are receiving the reward before us.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>But that will be the fulfillment of the Lord s word that the last shall be the first and the first last.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>Perhaps John will say to Peter, Peter, be patient.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>If these last ones are receiving such a reward, we shall certainly receive much more.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>However, Peter and John may be surprised to receive the same reward as those hired last.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>But the Lord may say to Peter and to all those hired first, Didn t I make an agreement with you?</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>Was not My promise satisfactory?</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>Do not complain, but take your reward and go to the throne.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>Do I not have the right to do things according to My desire?</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>Am I wrong for being good?</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>One day, we shall receive the same reward as Peter, and we shall receive it first.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>Peter s reward will be a denarius, and ours will be the same.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>This denarius denotes the full enjoyment of the divine life in glory in the manifestation of the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>This will be our reward.</S>
