   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Matthew 17:2-5</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>2 And He was transfigured before them, and His face shone like the sun, and His garments became as white as the light.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>3 And behold, 1 Moses and Elijah appeared to them, conversing with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>4 And Peter answered and said to Jesus, Lord, it is good for us to be here; if You are willing, I will make 1 three tents here, one for You and one for Moses and one for Elijah.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>5 While he was still speaking, behold, a bright cloud overshadowed them, and behold, a voice out of the cloud, saying, 1 This is My Son, the Beloved, in whom I have found My delight.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Hear Him!</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Portions from Life-study Messages</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Not many Christians realize that Christ's transfiguration was His coming in His kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>In the past we pointed out that the Lord's coming will not take place suddenly; rather, it will come gradually.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>In a sense, the Lord will come back from heaven; but in another sense, He will come out of us.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>When He fully lives Himself out of us, that will be the time of His coming.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>According to Matthew 17:1-2 with 16:28, His coming was His transfiguration, and His transfiguration was His glorification.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>When He was transfigured, He was glorified.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Now we must see what it means to be glorified.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>When Christ, who is God, became a man, His divinity was incarnated in His humanity.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Outwardly, He was a man, but inwardly He was the very God.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The God hidden within the humanity of Jesus was the very glory.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Thus, the glorious divine element was concealed within the human element of Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>In Christ's transfiguration, His humanity was glorified; it was brought into God's glory.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Before that time, God was in Him, but His humanity was not in God's glory.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>In His transfiguration His humanity was thoroughly saturated with His glorious divinity.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>In the coming manifestation of the kingdom, Christ will be like this.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>He will be the very Christ with both divinity and humanity, but His humanity will be soaked with His divinity.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The day is coming when we shall not only see this, but also experience it ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Our humanity will be glorified by the glorious divinity within us.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>It is to be transfigured, not from without, but from within.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Second Thessalonians 1:10 says, "When He comes to be glorified in His saints and to be marveled at in all those who have believed."</S>

   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>3 1 Moses died and God hid his body Deut 34:5-6 ; Elijah was taken by God into heaven 2 Kings 2:11 .</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>God purposely did these two things that Moses and Elijah might appear with Christ on the mount of His transfiguration.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>They were preserved by God so that they could be the two witnesses in the great tribulation Rev 11:3-4 .</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Moses represented the law, and Elijah, the prophets; and the law and the prophets were the constituents of the Old Testament as a full testimony of Christ John 5:39 .</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Now Moses and Elijah appeared and conversed with Christ concerning His death Luke 9:31 , which had been spoken of in the Old Testament Luke 24:25-27, 44; 1 Cor 15:3 .</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>4 1 In his absurd proposal, Peter put Moses and Elijah on the same level as Christ; i.e., he made the law and the prophets equal with Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>This was absolutely against God's economy.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>In God's economy the law and the prophets are only a testimony of Christ; they should not be put on the same level with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>5 1 This declaration of the Father, given to vindicate the Son, was first spoken after Christ's rising from baptism, which signified His resurrection from the dead.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>This was the second time the Father made this declaration, this time to vindicate the Son in His transfiguration, which prefigures the coming kingdom.</S>
