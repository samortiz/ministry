BRINGING IN THE DISTINCTION OF LANGUAGES</h2>
<p>As a result of man&rsquo;s fall, differences gradually emerged among people in the old creation. The further man fell, the greater the differences became. In the garden of Eden the man created by God was pure, without the mixture of sin. But after man&rsquo;s fall in Genesis 3, complicated elements were gradually added into the human race, and man continued to fall step by step. Through every step of man&rsquo;s fall another complicated element was added. The further man fell, the more complications there were in the human race.</p>
<p>After man&rsquo;s fourth fall in Genesis 11 the complicated element of different languages was added into the human race. Language is the strongest element that divides mankind. Although skin color, race, and cultural background are also dividing factors, they are not as strong as language. There is a good example in Acts 6. Initially, the believers in Jerusalem were Jews, but among them there was a distinction based on speaking Hebrew and speaking Greek (v. 1). The disciples were all Jews, but there were problems among them: the Jews who spoke Greek murmured against the Jews who spoke Hebrew. We probably have the same feeling about the distinction of languages. The Chinese are mostly Han descendants but speak many different dialects. Some of the saints speak the Foochow dialect, some speak Shantungnese, and some speak Taiwanese. This is not a difference of race but a difference of language. From this example we can conclude that language is the strongest factor that divides mankind.</p>
<p>The difference of language is the issue of man&rsquo;s rebellion and fall at Babel. The descendants of Adam fell to the uttermost in Genesis 11. At that time they were united, and they built a city and a tower in order to make a name for themselves (v. 4). The entire Bible reveals that God&rsquo;s ultimate intention in the universe is to build a city, the New Jerusalem (Rev. 21&mdash;22). However, before God&rsquo;s building could be completed, Satan came in to produce a counterfeit. Satan not only entered into mankind but also mingled himself with mankind in order to build the city of Babel and the tower of Babel, whose top was in the heavens (Gen. 11:4), thus declaring that mankind and Satan were united to overthrow God&rsquo;s authority. This action was a great offense against God. Therefore, God came to judge men and confounded their language so that they would not be able to work together. As a result, they were scattered by God over all the earth, and the building of that city and tower was terminated (vv. 6-9). The issue of this fall was the confounding of languages. God judged them and confounded their language so that they would not be united together against Him.</p>
<p>Hence, language is altogether related to building. Satan took advantage of the original one language among men to build a city in order to oppose and rebel against God. God judged men and confounded their language so that they would not understand one another. From then on, every ethnic group developed its own language and even multiple languages. Although there are numerous dividing factors among men, the strongest dividing factor is language.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE BUILDING OF GOD ELIMINATING<br />
THE DISTINCTION OF LANGUAGES</h2>
<p>The building up of the church began on the day of Pentecost (Acts 2). The day of Pentecost is the fulfillment of Jacob&rsquo;s pouring oil upon the stone. Genesis 28:18-19 says, &ldquo;Jacob... took the stone that he had put under his head, and he set it up as a pillar and poured oil on top of it. And he called the name of that place Bethel.&rdquo; In verse 22 Jacob said that the stone would be God&rsquo;s house. On the day of Pentecost the Holy Spirit was poured out upon the believers. Oil signifies the Holy Spirit, and stones signify the believers. The living stones, which the Holy Spirit has been poured upon, are built up into the church of God, the house of God, which will consummate in the New Jerusalem.</p>
<p>In Genesis 11 Satan was united with man at Babel and built a city to oppose and rebel against God. In Acts 2, however, God was united with man on the day of Pentecost in order to build His holy city, the New Jerusalem. These two buildings are in direct opposition to one another. The issue of the building of Babel was God&rsquo;s judgment on man, which brought in the curse of the confounding of languages. As a result, different languages became the strongest factor that divides mankind. However, through the building on the day of Pentecost, God also eliminated the difference of languages. We can say that on the day of Pentecost the distinction of languages was done away with in the Holy Spirit (vv. 1-11).</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_021.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_023.html">Next</a> </body></html>
