<h1 class="scripture">Scripture: 1 John 1:5; 4:8</h1>
<ol class="upper-romanbd">
<li>God is light
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>Light is a matter of nature.</li>
	<li>Light has the function of shining.</li>
	<li>God as light denotes the function of that nature of God which is shining.</li>
	<li>Once man touches God, he receives light. He is no more in darkness.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>God is love
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>Love is a matter of sentiment.</li>
	<li>Love has the function of imparting warmth.</li>
	<li>God as love denotes the function of the sentiment of God which imparts warmth.</li>
	<li>Once man touches God, he receives warmth and departs from coldness.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>How God is expressed as light and love
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>He shows forth His light in His Son Jesus.</li>
	<li>He shows forth His love through the cross.</li>
	<li>God caused His Son to accomplish redemption through the cross to become man&rsquo;s Savior, that man may obtain Him as light and love.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>How to obtain God as light and love
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>Confess that you are in darkness and in coldness.</li>
	<li>Receive the Son of God, Jesus Christ, as your Savior.</li>
	<li>Have fellowship with God through Christ.</li>
	</ol></li>
