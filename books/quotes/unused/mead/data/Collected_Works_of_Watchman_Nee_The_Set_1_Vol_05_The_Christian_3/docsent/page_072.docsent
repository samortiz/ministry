   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>VERSE TWENTY</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>"Behold, I stand at the door and knock; if anyone hears My voice and opens the door, then I will come in to him and dine with him and he with Me" v. 20 .</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>"Behold, I stand at the door and knock."</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>This is what the Lord says to the entire church in Laodicea.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Regardless of whether it is the actual Laodicea of that day or the Laodicea of this age, all should listen to what the Lord says here.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>When the Lord says, "Behold," He is trying to get their attention.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>He is telling them that the situation now is a little bit strange.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Why?</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>"I stand at the door and knock."</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Why is He standing outside?</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Because there is no room for Him inside the door.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Why is He knocking?</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Because the door is tightly closed.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Christ is shut outside the door of Laodicea!</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>He has not shut out Laodicea; it is Laodicea that has shut Him outside the door.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>This is a corporate matter, not an individual matter.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The individual believers in Laodicea have received the Lord as the Savior, yet because of their self-contentment, in their walk they, as a corporate whole, have shut Him outside.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>There is no room for Christ to stand in their corporate organization, deeds, and ways.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>This is not a call for the world to repent but the Lord's speaking to His own church.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>We should know that now the Lord is outside of the church organization, or the organized church.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Once the opinion of the majority becomes the direction, the Lord has no more room except outside the door.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>No matter how much the believers act and work, if they deny the name of the Lord and do not keep His word, Christ will have no room to stand among them.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>This is not a matter of salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Salvation has never been mentioned in these seven letters.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>What is covered here is the matter of the corporate conduct of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>We must differentiate the presence of the Lord with the individual from the presence of the Lord with a corporate entity.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Every saved sinner has the presence of the Lord individually.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>But when a group of saved ones gather together, if they do things not according to the Lord's command, the Lord's presence, although felt individually, will not be with them corporately.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>There is no other prerequisite for having the presence of the Lord with an individual, other than being saved.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>However, regarding the corporate presence of the Lord, the prerequisite is the gathering together into the Lord's name Matt 18:20 .</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Laodicea is so full of self-opinion that they cannot fully submit to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>That is why we see the Lord outside their door.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Here is a question: Since the Lord is outside the church in Laodicea, why should those of us who are willing to follow the Lord stay inside the church in Laodicea?</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Should we stand with the Lord outside the door?</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Everyone who is willing to obey the Lord should know how to reply.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The church should be the habitation of God on earth in Spirit, but because of the abnormal condition of this church, the Lord is forced to stand outside the door.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The judgment is not yet executed, and the Lord has not yet spewed them out.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>However, He is already standing outside the door of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The same was true when He was on earth.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>After He had judged the Judaistic temple, He said, "Behold, your house is left to you desolate."</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>"Jesus came out" Matt 23:38; 24:1 .</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Similarly, the church in Laodicea has become a house of man and not of God.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>It is no longer the testimony of Christ but has become a manifestation of the importance and sufficiency of man.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The Lord's heart is grieved.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Yet He cannot tolerate seeing the degradation of their morality and the saturation by the world while advertising His name in public.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>For this reason He has forever withdrawn Himself from the nominal church.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Here we see the same condition as it was the day the glory of the Lord left the holy temple Ezek.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>10 11 .</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Please note that this is the way the Lord deals with the church in Laodicea of this age.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>If every individual church of this age is not completely consecrated to the Lord and does not give the Lord the headship over everything, they will be dealt with in the same way: the Lord will stand outside.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Even for those who are not part of the organized church, if they fall into human opinion, the Lord's presence will also be withheld, and the gathering of the saints there can no longer be considered as a meeting into His name.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Now the Lord is standing outside the door.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Because of love and mercy, He cannot rest outside the door or sit down there; He is standing and waiting.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>He is willing to suffer the tiredness from standing, hoping that some will receive Him as their Lord and King and will consecrate their whole being for Him to reign.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>He stands at the door and knocks.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>He uses thousands of ways to knock.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>He admonishes, warns, exhorts, rebukes, and chastens with a hope that those who have an ear would hear and those who have a heart would open the door.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>He does not want those who are His to live in the place where He is not.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>His knockings are not only once or twice.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>He is standing there and knocking.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>He has knocked and He will continue to knock.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Before He raptures the Philadelphian believers, He will keep on knocking with a hope that some of the Laodicean believers will become Philadelphian.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>There is still the chance for every believer in Laodicea to hear the Lord's knocking, but I am afraid that this knocking will not last too long.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>At any rate, the Lord today is still concerned about His rebellious children, and He is still waiting very patiently.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>The Lord wants the believers to pay attention to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>He wants them to receive Him.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>He had warned them ahead of time about their destination judgment and condemnation.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>However, before the judgment comes, He would like to give grace.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>It should be His rebellious children who come to seek after Him, but since they are indifferent, the Lord has to come to stir up their zeal.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>He knocks at the door instead of breaking it.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>To those who do not want Him, He rather stands at the door and waits.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>He wants the heart of the householder inside the door.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>The Lord's condition here is like that in the Song of Songs, chapter five.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>There the bride said, "I sleep, but my heart waketh: it is the voice of my beloved that knocketh, saying, Open to me, my sister, my love, my dove, my undefiled: for my head is filled with dew, and my locks with the drops of the night" 5:2 .</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>This is the suffering of standing outside the door.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>He was imploring for a willing heart to open the door.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>We should not be like the slothful bride, opening the door when it is already too late.</S>
