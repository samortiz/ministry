   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER TWENTY-FOUR THE TRUTH SHALL SET YOU FREE Scripture Reading: John 8:32</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Nineteen hundred years ago, Pilate asked, "What is truth?"</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>John 18:38 .</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Many people have also asked this question.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>We cannot explain the biblical meaning of truth according to our concept.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>We have to consider what truth is according to God's Word.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The word truth in Greek means "absolute reality."</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Hence, truth is not a theory but a reality.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>We do not know the theory behind many real things, yet we can touch the fact and the reality of them.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>According to John 1:17, the law was given through Moses, while grace and reality came by Jesus Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Grace is not an attitude of God, but a work of God.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Grace is the work that Jesus of Nazareth, the Son of God, has accomplished for us.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>God's Son has been crucified on the cross and shed His blood to accomplish God's work of redemption.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>There is no need for us to do anything by ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>By trusting in Him, we are saved.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Without the work of the cross, God had no way to dispense His grace to man.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Through Moses, He was only able to give man the law.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Grace comes to us only because of the work of the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Therefore, grace is the work of God.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Both grace and reality are in the same verse.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Grace came through Jesus Christ, and reality also came through Jesus Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>When God gave the world His only begotten Son, He intended that He be reality as much as grace.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Through the work of His Son, there was grace.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Through the work of His Son, there was also reality.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Without the work of the Lord Jesus, there could not be grace today.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The Lord Jesus had to accomplish grace before this grace could be dispensed to man; millions of Christians believe this.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The Lord Jesus also had to accomplish the reality before this reality could be dispensed to man.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Ephesians 4:21 says, "The reality is in Jesus."</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>God has accomplished the truth in the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The truth is in Him; it is His work.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The Lord Jesus said, "I am...the reality" John 14:6 .</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The truth mentioned in the Bible refers to nothing other than the reality.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>What is reality?</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>It is what we really are before God as a result of the Lord Jesus' accomplished work.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>This is truth, and this is reality.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The Lord Jesus has shed His blood to redeem all those who belong to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>This is a fact.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Because of Him, I am a redeemed person before the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>This is the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The truth is what I am as a result of the facts accomplished in the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>I can only have the truth through the work that the Lord Jesus has accomplished.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>If the Lord Jesus had not worked, I would not have any truth or any reality before the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>I was a dead man and a sinner before God; I did not have any standing or anything before Him.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>But now, thank the Lord, through the work of the Lord Jesus, I have the reality before God; I have gained something solid and real.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>This real and solid thing is the fact that I am now a redeemed person.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>We must remember that the truth mentioned in the Bible is not doctrines preached on a platform, but a fact before the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>A doctrine is man's explanation of something, while the truth is what we have become in the eyes of God through the accomplishments of the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Through the work of the Lord Jesus, God has made me another person.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>This is a truth; it is a reality.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>We must remember that in God's eyes, the work of Jesus Christ is finished.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>The truth is what we have become as a result of this work.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Truth is Christ; it is the Lord Jesus Himself because all the realities are in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>All the facts that we have been speaking of are in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>We can say that two plus two equaling four is a truth, but it is not the truth that we are speaking of here.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>The truth that we are speaking of here is just Christ Himself.</S>
