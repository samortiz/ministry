   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>STAYING WITH THE LORD</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>We have to practice putting to death the practices of our mortal body.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Then we are led.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>If He is staying, we stay.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>If He is drinking, we drink.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>If He is eating, we eat.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>We don t ask, and we don t pray, and we don t read His Word to create a leading.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>It is so strange that the Lord did not answer Martha and Mary s prayer, and the Lord did not tell Peter and John and James what to do.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>When He wanted to go, He simply said, Let us go John 11:7 .</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>When He goes we have to go also.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>This is to be led.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>THE LORD S SUBJECTIVE STAY WITHIN US</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>I have the burden to show you how much we have been deceived in the past.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Don t put the blame altogether upon the enemy, Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>We have been self-deceived.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>We have built up many leadings in the past just by our preferences.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The leading is here within us.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>His stay in us today is very close and very subjective; it is very dear, very precious, very real, and very practical.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Yet in our daily life, it seems He is not with us.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>You behave, you walk, you do things, you see things, you talk.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>You do not have the deep sensation that the Lord is with you.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>A Person is with you who is more real and more practical than you are, yet you don t have such a sensation.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>If my wife and I are together, mostly I don t have the sensation that another One was there already.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>My wife and I were not the first ones there.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>We were the second and the third.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The first One is He.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>We don t have this sensation.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>So when we want to do certain things, we pray for the Lord s leading.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Many of us could testify that the more we prayed in this way, the more we were distracted, the more we didn t know what was the leading.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The more we prayed for the leading, the more the leading was gone.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>So we all learned the skill of how to build up a leading by reading the Scriptures, by praying and waiting, by checking with the circumstances, and sometimes by asking the Lord for a sign.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>THE ALL-INCLUSIVE INDWELLING</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>LIFE-GIVING SPIRIT AS THE LEADING</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>This shows us where we have been and perhaps where we still are.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>It also describes the genuine leading which is the processed Triune God to be the all-inclusive indwelling life-giving Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>With Him is the divine life.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>With the divine life is the law of the Spirit of life.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>These three things can never be divided.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>They remain simultaneously within you.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>They are the leading.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>All the time they are leading.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>You don t need to seek after the leading.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>As long as you, by His grace, put to death all the practices of your mortal body, you are led by the Spirit.</S>
