<H1 CLASS=SERIES>LIFE-STUDY OF FIRST AND SECOND KINGS</H1><H1 CLASS=MSG>MESSAGE TWENTY-TWO</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>THE REIGNS OF JEHOAHAZ, JEHOIAKIM,<br>JEHOIACHIN, AND ZEDEKIAH OVER JUDAH<br>AND<br>THE GOVERNING OF GEDALIAH</H1><H1 CLASS=SCRIPTURE>Scripture Reading: 2 Kings 23:31&#151;25:30</H1><P>Second Kings 23:31&#151;25:30, which covers the reigns of Jehoahaz, Jehoiakim, Jehoiachin, and Zedekiah and the governing of Gedaliah, tells us of the tragedy of the rottenness of the children of Israel. The kingdoms of Israel and Judah became totally corrupted, forcing God to terminate them. First, God sent the Assyrians to take over the northern kingdom of Israel. On the one hand, many of the people were taken as captives to Assyria. On the other hand, the Assyrians brought in heathens, who settled in the vacant land. This produced a mixture and a confusion. The southern kingdom of Judah should have been warned by what had happened to Israel, but the people continued in their evil way more than ever. This forced God to take action through the Babylonians. The temple was burned; the walls of Jerusalem, the holy city, were torn down; the holy land was devastated; and the holy people were taken captive.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>I. THE REIGN OF JEHOAHAZ</H2><P>In 23:31-34 we have an account of the reign of Jehoahaz.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>A.

Pharaoh Neco Imprisoning Him</H2><P>Pharaoh Neco imprisoned Jehoahaz so that he might not reign in Jerusalem. He also imposed on the land of Judah a fine of one hundred talents of silver and a talent of gold (v. 33).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>D. Jehoahaz Dying in Egypt</H2><P>Pharaoh Neco made Eliakim son of Josiah king in the place of Josiah and changed his name to Jehoiakim. Pharaoh Neco then brought Jehoahaz to Egypt, and Jehoahaz died there (v. 34).</P>
