<h2 class="head3">3. The Lacking of the Word of Jehovah</h2>
<p>Verses 11 through 13 indicate that there will be the lacking of the word of Jehovah. Our lacking of the word of Jehovah is a kind of punishment from Jehovah. For example, after Abraham took Hagar to produce Ishmael, God did not speak to him for thirteen years (Gen. 16:15&mdash;17:1). In the northern kingdom of Israel, the same thing happened. Because of their sins against the Lord, He would not speak to them.</p>
<h2 class="head3">4. The Worshippers of the Calf of Samaria<br />
and of the Idols in Dan and Beer-sheba<br />
Falling and Not Rising Up Again</h2>
<p>Amos 7:14 says that the worshippers of the calf of Samaria and of the idols in Dan and Beer-sheba would fall and not rise up again.</p>
<h2 class="head2">G. The Plague of the Fifth Sign&mdash;<br />
the Lord Standing upon the Altar</h2>
<p>The plague of the first sign was the locusts; the plague of the second, fire; the plague of the third, the plumb line; and the plague of the fourth, the summer fruit. Now the fifth sign is the Lord standing upon the altar (9:1-10), signifying that the Lord is ready to destroy Israel.</p>
<h2 class="head3">1. The Shaking and Slaying</h2>
<p>Verses 1 through 4 speak concerning the shaking and slaying.</p>
<h2 class="head3">2. The Judging One</h2>
<p>In verses 5 and 6 we see Jehovah as the judging One.</p>
<h2 class="head3">3. The Lord&rsquo;s Destruction of Israel<br />
Not an Utter Destruction of the House of Jacob</h2>
<p>Verses 7 through 10 reveal that the Lord&rsquo;s destruction of Israel the sinful kingdom would not be an utter destruction of the house of Jacob. The Lord would cause them to suffer but would not allow them to be utterly consumed because He has a purpose. If there had been no Israel left on earth, how could Christ have been born of them? For the purpose of incarnation God had to preserve a remnant of Israel.</p>
<h2 class="head1">III. THE RESTORATION OF THE HOUSE OF ISRAEL<br />
WITH THE REBUILDING OF THE FALLEN TABERNACLE<br />
OF DAVID FOR THE KINGDOM OF CHRIST</h2>
<p>The restoration of the house of Israel with the rebuilding of the fallen tabernacle of David is covered in verses 11 through 15.</p>
<h2 class="head2">A. Raising Up the Fallen Tabernacle<br />
of David That Israel May Possess<br />
the Remnant of Edom and All the Nations<br />
Which Are Called by the Name of Jehovah</h2>
<p>&ldquo;In that day I will raise up / The fallen tabernacle of David, / And I will wall up its breaches / And raise up its ruins / And build it up as it was in the days of old; / That they may possess the remnant of Edom and all the nations which are called by My name, declares Jehovah who does this&rdquo; (vv. 11-12). This portion of Amos is quoted by James in Acts 15, when the apostles and the elders were gathered together to solve the problem of circumcision.</p>
<p>The tabernacle of David is the kingdom and the royal family of David. In ancient times it was hard to separate the royal family from the kingdom. Actually these two things are one. David&rsquo;s kingdom was David&rsquo;s royal family. That kingdom, that royal family, fell when Nebuchadnezzar came to capture the nation of Israel, devastate the land, burn the city, destroy the temple, and carry off the king. That was the fall of the kingdom of David and the royal family of David. However, in Amos God came in to promise that some day He would come back to restore the fallen kingdom of David. In that day the kingdom of David and the family of David will be restored, and all the nations will be called by the name of Jehovah.</p>
<p>This prophecy in Amos indicates that one day Christ will come back to be the real David. When Christ comes back, in His last appearing He will be the real David to restore His kingdom and His royal family. That will be the millennial kingdom, in which all the nations will be called by the name of Jehovah, that is, all the nations will belong to God. It was based on this that in Acts 15 James told the Jewish believers not to be bothered by Peter&rsquo;s and Paul&rsquo;s going to the Gentiles, because in the restoration all the Gentiles will belong to God, just like the Jews.</p>
<p>Christ will come and restore the fallen kingdom of David to set up His kingdom for the restoration of the entire universe. At that time all the nations will become God&rsquo;s people. This is a great item in Amos&rsquo;s prophecy.</p>
<h2 class="head2">B. The Plowman Overtaking the Reaper,<br />
and the Grape Treader, Him Who Sows the Seed</h2>
<p>Amos 9:13 says that days are coming when the plowman will overtake the reaper, and the grape treader, him who sows the seed. The mountains will drip sweet wine, and all the hills will melt (cf. Joel 3:18a). This indicates that in the restoration the produce from the earth will be abundant. There will be plenty of food for everyone.</p>
<h2 class="head2">C. Jehovah Turning the Captivity of His People</h2>
<p>Amos 9:14 tells us that Jehovah will turn the captivity of His people Israel. They will build the desolated cities and inhabit them. Also, they will plant vineyards and drink the wine from them, and make gardens and eat the fruit from them.</p>
<h2 class="head2">D. Jehovah Planting<br />
the People of Israel upon Their Land</h2>
<p>Amos concludes his prophecy by saying that Jehovah will plant the people of Israel upon their land, and they will not be plucked up again from their land, which He has given to them (v. 15).</p>
