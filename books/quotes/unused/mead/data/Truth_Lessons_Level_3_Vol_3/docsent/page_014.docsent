   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>In this lesson we will consider three matters related to transformation and then continue with the matter of being conformed to the image of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>G. By the Renewing of the Mind</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Human beings have three parts spirit, soul, and body; therefore, God uses three steps to deal with us in His salvation: regeneration of our spirit, transformation of our soul, and transfiguration of our body.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The Lord begins His salvation from the center by regenerating us in our spirit John 3:6 .</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>When we receive Christ, the Spirit of the Lord enters into our spirit, dispensing Christ as life into our spirit to regenerate us.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Through this divine operation, not only is our deadened spirit enlivened, but God s life with its divine nature is put into our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>As a result, a change in life begins from the center of our being.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The Lord desires that this change in life would continue to spread into our soul so that our mind, emotion, and will would be transformed.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Our spirit is regenerated, but our mind, emotion, and will still need to be transformed.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Even though we have Christ as life in our spirit, we still need Christ in our soul.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>He needs to spread continually from our spirit to our soul until every part of our soul is transformed into His image.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>When this occurs, we will think as He thinks, love as He loves, and choose as He chooses.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>We will have the Lord s image in our practical living because our soul will be completely permeated by His divine element.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Therefore, we need the renewing and the transformation of the soul.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Romans 12:2 says, Do not be fashioned according to this age, but be transformed by the renewing of the mind.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>To be fashioned according to this age means to follow the modern fashion in our outward expression; to be transformed is to have an organic element wrought into our whole being to produce a metabolic change.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>We need to be transformed by the renewing of our mind.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The mind in Romans 12 is different from the mind in Romans 7 and 8.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>In Romans 7 the mind is individualistic, acting independently.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>In Romans 8 the mind is dependent, set on the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>However, the mind needs to be renewed in addition to being dependent.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>We need a renewed mind.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>This is not merely a matter of receiving outward teaching but a matter of the addition of Christ s element.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>When the Lord Jesus spreads from our spirit into our mind, our mind is renewed and our soul undergoes a metabolic change.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>In this way we experience the transformation of the soul.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>We may be regenerated in our spirit and yet be old in our mind, emotion, and will.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>If our mind remains old, our soul will not be transformed, and we will remain unchanged in our mind, emotion, and will just like unbelievers.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>However, when our mind is renewed, our soul will be transformed.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>When our mind is subject to the spirit, we are subject to Christ because Christ is in our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>This gives Him opportunity to spread from our spirit to our mind and also to permeate, fill, and renew our mind with Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Our soul is thus transformed by the renewing of the mind.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Once the mind is renewed, the emotion and the will are subsequently renewed because the mind regulates the emotion and influences the will.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>When the mind is open to the Lord, the emotion and the will surely follow.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>If our mind is permeated and occupied by the Lord, the Lord will take over our emotion and occupy our will.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>This is the reason Romans 12:2 speaks of the transformation of the soul by the renewing of the mind.</S>
