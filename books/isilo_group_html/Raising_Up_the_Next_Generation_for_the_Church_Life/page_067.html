<p>We must use the young sisters to lead the children&rsquo;s meetings. Two or three other sisters can assist them in teaching the children to sing. The church should train the teachers so that the young sisters learn to teach and lead the children. Some brothers also need to collect and write material for the children&rsquo;s meetings. They should prepare material for the youngest group of children, for the children in the middle grades, and for the older children. (<em>The Collected Works of Witness Lee, 1967,</em> vol. 1, p. 305)</p>

<p>Many of the sisters love the Lord, but they need to find the way to do something for the Lord, not by themselves but by abiding in the vine to impart life into others. If we bear the little ones as fruit, the Lord will add them to our account. Only eternity will reveal the result of this. Perhaps out of a group of children for whom we are caring, some will become apostles. Therefore, I encourage the sisters to do this good work. All the housewives can bring children to the meetings, and the younger sisters can be trained to cooperate with them to bear these little ones as fruit. (<em>The Collected Works of Witness Lee, 1967,</em> vol. 1, p. 550)</p>
<h2 class="head1">MOTHERS IN THE CHURCH LIFE</h2>
<p>To have the practical church life to the uttermost, in the local church there should be some real sisters and some real mothers. In an earlier message it was my burden to share with you that you need to be a serving sister, but now I am burdened to share with you that you need to be a mother. As long as there is a shortage of sisters like Phoebe among us, the church life is not practical. Yet the serving of that sister is at the beginning of Romans 16, in the first verse. When the church life in practicality reaches a peak, in every church there should be some real mothers. (<em>Loving Mothers in the Church Life,</em> pp. 7-8)</p>
<h2 class="head1">USING THE YOUNG PEOPLE<br />
TO STRENGTHEN THE CHILDREN&rsquo;S WORK</h2>
<p>We also need the help of the young people in the children&rsquo;s work. This matter must be developed. There are twenty to thirty thousand children between five and twelve years of age in the homes of the saints in Taiwan. If we can care for these children, in six years they will become gospel seeds. If the children&rsquo;s work progresses well, even dormant saints will send their children to us, and we will be able to regain the dormant ones.</p>
<p>I believe that there is quite a large number of children in every locality. As soon as we begin the children&rsquo;s work, the young people will begin to function. They can all take part in serving the children. For a class of twenty children, we will need two teachers. If there are two thousand children in Taipei, we should have one hundred classes, and we will need two hundred young people to coordinate and serve. The young people need to give themselves to this work, and this will give everyone an opportunity to practice speaking. (<em>The Collected Works of Witness Lee, 1967,</em> vol. 1, p. 326)</p>

<p>When I returned to Taiwan in 1966 and in 1967, there were four thousand children in the children&rsquo;s meetings, and I told the brothers to set a goal of having ten thousand children in the meetings. I also asked the brothers to perfect the junior high and high school brothers and sisters to assist in teaching the children. These children would be gospel seeds in junior high school, they would be gospel seeds in high school, and they would be gospel seeds in college. They would be seeds the entire time that they are in school. (<em>Crucial Words of Leading in the Lord&rsquo;s Recovery, Book 3: The Future of the Lord&rsquo;s Recovery and the Building Up of the Organic Service,</em> p. 36)</p>

<p>In the future the full-time co-workers will encourage preaching the gospel on the campuses, in the homes, to the children, and in the community. Full-timers are needed for the gospel on the campuses and in the schools; otherwise, it will be difficult to maintain the gospel work. With regard to the children&rsquo;s work, even though the junior high and high school students can teach in the children&rsquo;s meetings, the children&rsquo;s work will be carried forward by the full-timers, because they will prepare teaching materials and make a schedule. (<em>Crucial Words of Leading in the Lord&rsquo;s Recovery, Book 3: The Future of the Lord&rsquo;s Recovery and the Building Up of the Organic Service,</em> p. 160)</p>

<p>In the past the children&rsquo;s meeting was always held in the meeting hall and was mostly led by the young people. Now the gospel work on the college campuses and at the junior high and high schools is very active, and the young people all have specific services in this work. Thus, they cannot take care of the children anymore. Hence, we need to rely on the elderly saints to spend the time and effort to teach the children...The elderly saints may use their homes. After the children get off from school, the elderly saints may open their homes and prepare some snacks to welcome them. Then they may sing with the children, tell them stories, and lead them to know God.</p>
<p>Every one of us should be able to do these three things&mdash;pray every day, join the small group meetings, and go door-knocking and have home meetings every week. The fourth matter is taking care of the children. I hope that more people will receive the burden to open their homes to take care of the children. Twenty years ago I said that we should have ten thousand children in Taipei, and then ten years later we would have ten thousand young brothers and sisters. If the saints had taken this word and practiced it, we would have twenty to thirty thousand young people today. Moreover, gaining people in this way is very safe, because they are taught by us and receive the gospel from us from their youth. Thus, they should be very solid. If this were the case, many young saints would not need to put aside their gospel work at school to do the children&rsquo;s work. I hope that from now on the elderly saints would pick up the burden and take the lead to do this in their homes. The effect will be very promising in the long run. (<em>Being Up-to-date for the Rebuilding of the Temple,</em> pp. 46-47)</p>

<p>When the entire church is mobilized in this way, all the brothers and sisters will have an opportunity to serve. Some can open their homes, others can bring the children to the meetings, and still others can teach the children. When all the saints endeavor in one accord for the Lord&rsquo;s heart&rsquo;s desire, the profit will be immeasurable. This will impress the children that we are all for the Lord and are caring for them without compensation. Those who open their homes do not ask for money, those who teach do not ask for money, and those who transport the children do not ask for money. Instead of asking for money, the saints spend their own money to pay the expenses of carrying out the children&rsquo;s service. As a result, everyone will be full of joy. Our conducting children&rsquo;s meetings in this way will deeply impress the children from their youth. They will see people who live for Christ and who sacrifice for Christ, not caring for themselves. This is the ultimate benefit. Furthermore, the impact will unconsciously influence the relatives of the children in such a way that it will be easy to invite them to a gospel meeting. Hence, the children&rsquo;s work is a major service. (<em>The Collected Works of Witness Lee, 1967,</em> vol. 1, p. 306)</p>

<p>We should take action immediately. All the churches should encourage the saints in this matter, and we should pray for this matter. All the saints want their children to receive spiritual help. Even dormant saints want their children to receive spiritual guidance. Once we begin this work, the saints will respond. This will result in multiple benefits; the profit cannot be underestimated.
