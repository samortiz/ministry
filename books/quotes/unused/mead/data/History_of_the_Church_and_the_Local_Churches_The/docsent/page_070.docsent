   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Later this young brother was being transferred by his company from Chefoo to Shanghai.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>He asked me where he should meet in Shanghai.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>I told him that the booklet I had given him on the assurance of salvation had something in it concerning where a meeting of Christians was.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>I told him that he had better go there.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>He went to that meeting of the church in Shanghai.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Eventually, he became one of the first three elders in Shanghai.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>At the end of 1927, my denomination elected me to be one of the board members.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>By that time I was forced to tell them that I could not stay in that denomination anymore.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>That was the year I left them to go to a Brethren assembly.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>I went to Brethren assembly meetings faithfully every week.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>I picked up many good teachings there concerning typology and prophecy.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Years later in August 1931, the Lord impressed me that I had received so much biblical knowledge, yet I was cold and dead.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>There was a real repentance within me.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Thank the Lord that after I was saved, I never went back to the world.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>But by that time, although I attended so many Brethren meetings each week, I was cold.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>When the Lord convicted me concerning my coldness, I rose early the next day.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>My home was at the foothill of a small mountain.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>I went to the top of this mountain and wept before the Lord with repentance.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>I was desperate.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>From that day I went there each morning to have a time with the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>I continued to pray in this way for a few months.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>During that time when I was seeking the Lord, Brother Nee held a victory conference in Shanghai in 1931.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>I attempted to go to Shanghai to this conference, but Japan had invaded Manchuria, and I was advised not to go.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>If I went, I ran the risk of being cut off from my home, so I canceled my trip.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The young brother in my denomination who had gone to Shanghai returned to Chefoo the next year, and he told me about all the good meetings there.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>He and I went to our former denomination, and we proposed that they should invite Brother Nee to come to speak to them.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Although we had left that denomination, we left them with a very good impression of us.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>They still appreciated us as young men.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>They agreed to our proposal and invited Brother Nee.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>At the same time, the Southern Baptist seminary in a county close to Chefoo also invited him to speak to them.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>In the summer of 1932, Brother Nee came to Chefoo, and I joined those who went to his boat to greet him.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>I attended all the meetings in which he spoke.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>I went with him to the Southern Baptist seminary, which by that time had become involved with the Pentecostal movement.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>In those years the Pentecostal movement was prevailing in northern China.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>This was the first time I had seen the practice of the Pentecostals.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>In the meeting some were jumping, others were rolling on the floor, some were laughing, and others were shouting.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>This went on for a time.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Then the pastor called the meeting to order, and Brother Nee spoke.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>After the meeting, Brother Nee and I walked together.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>I remarked to him about the strange practices in their meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>He said to me, "In the New Testament, there are no forms."</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Later he stayed in my home for two or three days.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>During this time we had long periods of fellowship.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>That was in July 1932.</S>
