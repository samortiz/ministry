   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>There are two entirely different approaches to edification.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>One way is outward, involving thoughts, doctrines, and expositions of the Scriptures.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Some can claim that they have received help in this way.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The other way is entirely different, involving the touching of spirit with spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>When spirits touch, spiritual help is found.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>We only touch true Christianity as we touch the second way.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>This is true edification.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>If all we know is to listen to sermons, we may hear a good message today.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>If we happen to hear the same brother preaching on the same message the next Sunday, we will be bored and will want to leave.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>We think we need to listen to a message only once.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>As far as we are concerned, Christianity involves doctrines.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>We keep doctrines in our head.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>However, we must realize that edification has nothing to do with doctrines; it has to do with the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>If a brother preaches the first time with the release of his spirit, he will touch and change our entire being; we will be washed and revived.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>If we listen to him a second time and he releases his spirit again, we will receive help once again.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The subject may be old and the doctrines may be the same, but we will receive a cleansing and washing every time his spirit is released.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>We have to remember that edification is a contact of spirit with spirit; it is not the increase of thoughts.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Edification is an exchange between spirits.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>It has nothing to do with receiving some doctrines and teachings from the outer man.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The best that can be said of doctrines and teachings that are not vitally linked with the spirit is that they are dead.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>After our outer man is broken, it will become easy for us to receive edification; in fact, we will receive much edification.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>When others ask us a question, we will receive edification from their asking.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>When a sinner comes to us seeking the Lord, we will receive edification as we pray with him.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>A brother may be in gross error, and the Lord may want us to speak a strong word to him.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>When we touch his spirit, we will be edified once again.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>We can receive edification and supply from many directions.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>We will feel that the whole Body is supplying us.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Any member, whoever he may be, can render us supply.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>We will always receive help, and we will become persons who are good at receiving.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The whole church will become our supply.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>What riches we will find!</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>We truly will be able to say that God's riches have now become the riches of the Body, and the riches of the Body have now become our riches.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>How different is this from the increase of thoughts and doctrines!</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The difference is too great.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The more help a person can receive and the broader the scope of supply he draws, the more we can say that he is a broken man.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Those who hardly receive any help from anyone are not wiser than others.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>It only proves that their outer shell is harder than others' and that nothing can arouse them.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>If the Lord grants them mercy and deals with them in strong and multifarious ways, they will receive supply from the whole church.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>We have to check with ourselves: Can we receive help from others?</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>If we have a hard shell around us, we will not sense the spirit even when the Holy Spirit is released through other brothers.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>If we are broken by God, however, we will receive help whenever others' spirits move.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Even though the move may be very small, what matters is not whether the move is big or small but whether or not we have touched the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>As soon as we touch the spirit, we are revived and edified.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Brothers and sisters, may we all realize that the breaking of the outer man has a great deal to do with receiving help and edification from God.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>It is the fundamental qualification for working for God.</S>
