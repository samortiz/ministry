<H1 CLASS=TITLE>A BELIEVER'S WORTH BEFORE GOD</H1><H2 CLASS=HEAD4>(A Message Given in Shanghai on December 8, 1930)<br>Issue No. 12</H2><H1 CLASS=SCRIPTURE>Scripture Reading: Exo. 30:11-16; Lev. 27:1-8</H1><P>Every time the life of a person is remembered before God, he will suffer a plague if he does not have a sin offering. "And the Lord spake unto Moses, saying...then shall they give every man a ransom for his soul unto the Lord, when thou numberest them; that there be no plague among them, when thou numberest them" (Exo. 30:11-12). When David sent Joab to number Israel, God was displeased and sent pestilence upon Israel (1 Chron. 21). A man without the blood will be judged right away.</P><P>Now, we shall first outline the main points of the two passages recorded in Exodus 30 and Leviticus 27; then we will point out the meaning of these two passages.</P><P>Exodus records:</P><P>(1) "And the Lord spake unto Moses, saying, When thou takest the sum of the children of Israel after their number, then shall they give every man a ransom for his soul unto the Lord, when thou numberest them; that there be no plague among them, when thou numberest them" (vv. 11-12).</P><P>(2) "This they shall give, every one that passeth among them that are numbered, half a shekel after the shekel of the sanctuary...a half shekel shall be the offering of the Lord" (v. 13).</P><P>(3) "Every one that passeth among them that are numbered, from twenty years old and above, shall give an offering unto the Lord" (v. 14).</P><P>(4) "The rich shall not give more, and the poor shall not give less, than half a shekel" (v. 15).</P><P>Leviticus records:</P><P>(1) "And Jehovah spoke to Moses, saying, Speak to the sons of Israel and say to them, When a man makes a special vow to Jehovah involving the valuation of persons" (vv. 1-2).</P><P>(2) "Then the valuation of a male from twenty years old up to sixty years old shall be fifty shekels of silver, according to the shekel of the sanctuary. And if it is a female, the valuation shall be thirty shekels. If the person is from five years old up to twenty years old, the valuation for the male shall be twenty shekels, and for the female ten shekels. And if the person is from a month old up to five years old, the valuation of the male shall be five shekels of silver, and for the female the valuation shall be three shekels of silver. If the person is from sixty years old and upward, if it is a male, the valuation shall be fifteen shekels, and for the female ten shekels" (vv. 3-7).</P><P>(3) "But if he is poorer than the valuation, then he shall be presented before the priest, and the priest shall value him; according to the means of him who vowed, the priest shall value him" (v. 8).</P><P>We can see a big difference in these two passages. In the book of Exodus, whoever is numbered, whether male or female, rich or poor, must offer half a shekel and half a shekel only as long as he is twenty years old and above. But it is different in Leviticus. There the offering differs according to sex and according to whether one is rich or poor. Why is there such a difference? It is because Exodus speaks of the worth of the ransom of life, and Leviticus speaks of the valuation of the special vow.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE WORTH OF SALVATION</H2><P>Since Exodus speaks of the worth of the ransom of life, half a shekel is required of a person who is twenty years of age and older, whether male or female because this is a matter of salvation. This half shekel is required of every man. If anyone fails to offer it, he will suffer a plague. Every person must have the Son of God in order to be saved. As to the position of the salvation of sinners, we all have the same worth before God.</P><P>"Half a shekel" is equivalent to the two denarii mentioned in Luke 10:35. These two denarii have been paid by the Lord Jesus for us. These two denarii are sufficient for us to live in the inn (temporal life in the world) until the second coming of our Savior.</P><P>"Twenty years old" is the age when a person is able to take responsibility for himself. The teaching here is that whoever is responsible for himself must have the Son of God. For the Israelites, responsibility was determined on the basis of their physical age, but for us in the dispensation of the grace of salvation, no one knows when a person can be responsible for himself. It is possible that some people have reached this age of responsibility at seven or eight years of age.</P><P>"The rich shall not give more, and the poor shall not give less." Because the precious blood is the price, there is no difference between the poor and rich. Poverty and riches can be compared to the deeds of men. Those who do not have good deeds cannot save themselves; likewise, those who have good deeds cannot save themselves. They all have to offer half a shekel. Man cannot add anything to or deduct anything from the salvation accomplished by the Lord. Man can only be saved by the precious blood. This blood is called the precious blood because it is indeed "precious," and is full of worth (1 Pet. 1:19). The precious blood is a high price!</P>
