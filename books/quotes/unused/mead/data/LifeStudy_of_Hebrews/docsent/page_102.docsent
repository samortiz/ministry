   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>LIFE-STUDY OF HEBREWS MESSAGE THIRTY-ONE THE HEAVENLY MINISTRY</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>OF THE HEAVENLY CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The book of Hebrews has two main sections, and these two sections are based upon the two aspects of Christ s priesthood.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Firstly, Christ is the High Priest of God typified by Aaron, and secondly He is the High Priest according to the order of Melchisedec.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Christ s ministry is of two main aspects, the one typified by Aaron on earth and the other according to the order of Melchisedec in heaven.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>I. A TURN IN THE BOOK OF HEBREWS</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>According to the work and ministry of Christ, this book has a turn at 7:1, a turn from earth to heaven.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>To the end of chapter six, what is mainly revealed is Christ s work on earth typified by the priesthood of Aaron.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>That section is the word of foundation.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>From 7:1, Christ s ministry in heaven according to the order of Melchisedec is unveiled.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>This section is the word of perfection, which shows us how the heavenly Christ ministers in the heavenly tabernacle.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>His purification of sins is typified by the work of Aaron, while His sitting down on the right hand of the Majesty on high 1:3 is according to the order of Melchisedec Psa 110:1, 4 .</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>His work on the cross on earth typified by the work of Aaron affords us forgiveness of sin.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>His ministry on the throne in heaven ministers to us the overcoming of sin.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>His cross delivered us out of Egypt; His throne brings us into Canaan.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Although the Hebrew believers had participated in His work on the cross, they had to press on to enter into the enjoyment of His ministry on the throne.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>We may say that the forgiveness of sin is on the ground floor and that the overcoming of sin is on the second floor.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>During the past centuries, a great many Christians have sought for the overcoming of sin.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>However, not many of them ever succeeded in this matter because they were seeking something that is on the second floor while they were on the ground floor.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>How could you ever have the things on the second floor while seeking for them on the ground floor?</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The forgiveness of sin is on the ground floor.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Every saved Christian can testify that he has fully, successfully, absolutely, and thoroughly experienced the forgiveness of sin.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>But we must be on the second floor in order to experience the overcoming of sin.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The forgiveness of sin is related to Christ s work on earth typified by the work of Aaron.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>This is on the ground floor.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The overcoming of sin is related to Christ s work today in heaven according to the order of Melchisedec.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>This is on the second floor.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Are you on the ground floor or on the second floor?</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>I am quite sure that I am on the second floor.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>How wonderful it is to be on the second floor enjoying not only the forgiveness of sin but also the overcoming of sin!</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Sin is beneath our feet!</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>If you are going to overcome a certain thing, that thing must be underneath you.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Although in terminology it sounds like a small thing to speak of the overcoming of sin, in experience it is tremendous.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>How good it is to enjoy the overcoming of sin!</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>If you want to have the overcoming of sin, you must come to the second floor to experience the heavenly ministry of the heavenly Christ according to the order of Melchisedec.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>As I have already mentioned, Christ s cross delivers us out of Egypt and His throne brings us into Canaan.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Where are you in Egypt or in Canaan?</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>How do you know that you are in Canaan?</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>It is easy to tell.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>I know that I am in Canaan because I am no longer around the cross but around the throne.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The sermons, messages, conversations, and fellowship of most Christians is around the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>I hardly ever heard of a group of Christians fellowshipping around the throne.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Is your Christ today on the cross or on the throne?</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>I can testify to you that my Christ today is on the throne.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>I am not seeking Him at the cross; I am enjoying Him on the throne.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>This is marvelous.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Today our Christ is no longer on the cross but on the throne.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The Passover in Egypt signified Christ on the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>But today our Christ is on the throne, and where the throne is, there is Canaan.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>We are in Canaan.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>We are in the Sabbath rest because our Christ is on the throne.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Although we have participated in Christ s work on the cross, we must now press on to enter into the enjoyment of His ministry on the throne.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>The Christ who is with me in the present ministry is the Christ on the throne.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Oh, may the fact that Christ is now on the throne be experienced by us!</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>We need to see all the details concerning this enthroned Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>When we enjoy such a Christ, we are on the second floor, in Canaan, and around the throne.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>This message is on the heavenly ministry of the heavenly Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>As we have seen, the book of Hebrews makes a great turn at 7:1.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Not many readers of Hebrews have seen this point clearly, but by God s mercy and grace He has shown us this turn.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>My burden in this message simply is to impress you with this turn.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>May the Holy Spirit inscribe this turn deeply into your spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>This turn is not merely a doctrinal turn; it is a turn in our experience of Christ in an active way, even in a subjectively objective way.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>In the next message I shall explain what I mean by subjectively objective.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>For the time being, I ask you to keep in mind that at 7:1 we must make a turn so that we may experience Christ in a subjectively objective way.</S>
