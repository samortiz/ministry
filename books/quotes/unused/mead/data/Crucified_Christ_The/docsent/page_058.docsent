   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>SPIRITUAL PROGRESS BEING THE ADDITION OF THE ELEMENT OF CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>I hope we can see that our spiritual life is Christ, our spiritual living is Christ, and our spiritual progress is also Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Do not think that spiritual progress is merely a change in our outward expression.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Genuine spiritual progress is the increase of the element of Christ within us.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>We all agree that we should take away the handkerchief, but the water inside the cup must also increase.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The worst case is that neither the water increases nor is the handkerchief removed.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Some had a bad temper a few years ago and still have a bad temper today.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Others have changed their bad temper to a good one, have gotten rid of their bad habits, and have become well-behaved; however, the Christ in them has still not increased.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>A Christian's progress should not be only outward improvement but should be an inward increase of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>A Christian's progress should not be only an outward deliverance from bad habits and bad behavior but should also be an inward increase of the element of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Some people improve their outward behavior but do not have more of Christ in them.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>This is not spiritual progress but religious progress.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>This is not the growth of Christ but the growth of morality.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Today very few Christians are able to discern between morality and Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>They often regard a certain Christian's morality to have its source in Christ and are not able to discern whether the change in a Christian is merely an ethical change or a change due to the increase of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Ephesians 4:13 and Galatians 4:19 clearly show us what Christian progress is.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>When Christ grows and is formed in a Christian so that there is the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ within him, this is Christian progress.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>When Christ is formed in a Christian, and the measure of his stature is increased within him, this is Christian progress.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The revelation in the Bible is very clear concerning Christian progress.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Unfortunately, however, it is difficult for us to change our concept.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>When we notice that someone has an improvement in his behavior, we say that he has made some spiritual progress.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>For instance, a person used to quarrel with his wife whereas he no longer quarrels with his wife.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>He becomes diligent whereas he was once slothful, and he no longer has any opinions or things to say but works quietly whereas he used to be talkative and opinionated.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>We praise him, saying that he has made spiritual progress.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>This shows that we are still too natural and that we do not know what spirituality and spiritual progress are.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>What is real spirituality?</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Spirituality is Christ Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>What is spiritual progress?</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Spiritual progress is the increase of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Whenever Christ increases in the saints, their speaking will be reduced; whenever Christ increases in them, their bad temper will diminish.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>This is a sure thing.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>However, if a person's bad temper is reduced, yet there is no increase of Christ, then his change is merely something ethical.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The improvement of his temper and behavior is the result of his own effort, his own cultivation.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>It is something moral but does not come from the increase of Christ in him.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>He may have entirely changed his living by his own effort, but he has not touched Christ, contacted Christ, or had any inward increase of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>He has changed outwardly but not inwardly because Christ has not increased in him.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>If we want to have spiritual progress and spiritual growth, we must turn our mind to God to see the light and the revelation that this is not a matter of morality but of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The point is not that since we used to be unethical, we should now be ethical; rather, though formerly we did many things by our own life, now we should do everything by Christ's life.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>God wants us to deny our life and live by Christ's life.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Hence, we have to see clearly that Christ is our life and our living.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Once we have seen this clearly, we will spontaneously have a change in our mind to turn from ethics, good deeds, and proper behavior to Christ Himself.</S>
