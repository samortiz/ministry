   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER FOUR THE WORK OF CHRIST 2 Scripture Reading: Acts 3:15; 5:30-31; Rom 4:25; Acts 13:33; Rom 8:29; John 12:24; 1 Pet 1:3; John 12:28; 13:31-32; 17:1; Luke 24:26; 1 Cor 15:45b; John 20:22; Acts 2:36; Eph 1:22, 10; Acts 2:33; 1 Cor 12:13; Heb 7:22; 8:6; 9:15-17; 4:15; 7:26; Rev 1:13; 2:1; 1:5; 5:5-6</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In the three foregoing chapters we pointed out that in order to experience Christ, we first need to receive revelation concerning the Person and work of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In the last chapter we covered what Christ accomplished in His life on earth and in His death.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>We pointed out that there are eight main points concerning His work on the earth, two points in each of the four Gospels.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Then we covered seven main things which the Lord accomplished through His death.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Thus, in the previous chapters we have seen fifteen items of Christ's work.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>In this chapter we shall consider another fifteen items accomplished by Christ, seven items in His resurrection and eight in His ascension.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Many Christians today do not have an accurate and adequate view concerning Christ's resurrection and ascension.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Because of this lack, their experience of Christ is inadequate.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Believers today often speak about Christ's death, but they do not speak as much about His resurrection and ascension.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Many Christians see very little concerning Christ's ascension.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>They only know that Christ went to the heavens and is waiting there until the time of His return.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>However, the New Testament tells us very much about what Christ is doing now in the heavens.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>In one sense, He is doing more in the heavens than He did on the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Those who read the four Gospels can easily see that while Jesus was on the earth, He did many things such as working miracles and preaching the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>But when they read the Acts, the Epistles, and Revelation, few realize what Christ is doing now in the heavens.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Not only is Christ doing many things in the heavens today, but He also accomplished many things before He ascended.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>We need to be impressed with all the crucial and wonderful things Christ has done in His resurrection and ascension.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>HIS RESURRECTION To Prove That God Has Accepted</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>His All-inclusive Redemptive Work</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The resurrection of Christ was a great proof that God had accepted His all-inclusive redemptive work Acts 3:15 .</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>After Christ had finished His work on earth, He died on the cross to accomplish God's redemption.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>His redemptive work was exceedingly great.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>However, in the eyes of the Jews, Christ was rejected by God.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>They would not believe that God was one with Christ, that God would accept what Christ had done.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Their thought was that Christ had blasphemed God and was against God Matt 26:65 .</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>So they rejected Him by crucifying Him and putting Him into a tomb.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The Jews thought that to put Christ into the tomb was to do a marvelous work for God.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>But, to their great surprise, God raised Him up.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>God did this in order to tell the Jews that He accepted what they rejected.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>God seemed to be saying, "You Jews should know that although you rejected Christ, put Him to death, and even put Him into a tomb, I, the very God whom you serve, raised this Man out of death."</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>This is also confirmed by the word in Acts 2:23-24.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Such a resurrection was a great and strong proof that God accepted, sealed, and vindicated all that Christ had done.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The resurrection of Christ proved that God was very happy with all that Christ had done.</S>
