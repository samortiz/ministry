   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>WHAT TO DO?</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>When Christ was on the earth, a young Israelite came to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>This man was a very noble and refined person.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>He asked, "What shall I do to inherit eternal life?"</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Luke 18:18 .</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>On that day, the Lord did not tell him what we are used to hearing, that if he believed in Him he would have eternal life.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Rather, He said, "You know the commandments: Do not commit adultery, do not murder, do not steal, do not bear false witness, honor your father and mother'" v. 20 .</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>After the young man heard this, he said confidently, "All these things I have kept from my youth" v. 21 . The Lord knew that he did not know himself.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>He said, "Still you lack one thing."</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>It seems as if He was saying, "So you think you are perfect.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Let's see if this is the case or not."</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>He continued, "All that you have, sell and distribute to the poor, and you will have treasure in the heavens; and come, follow Me" v. 22 . How did the young man react to these words? He began to realize that what God requires he could never fulfill.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>This additional item was something he could not do.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>So he left sorrowfully.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>He needed to know himself; he needed to realize that he was unable.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>WITH MAN IT IS IMPOSSIBLE</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>What did Christ say?</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>He said, "How difficult it is for those who have riches to go into the kingdom of God.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>For it is easier for a camel to enter through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of God" vv.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>24-25 .</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Here is the purpose behind Christ's confounding of the young man.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>He wants us to realize that with men these things are impossible.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>I am not saying that the Lord demands everyone to sell all his possessions before he can be saved.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>He was making all those who thought that they were able realize their real situation.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>God only wants to show man that he is unable.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Man's life is an impotent one.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>There is no possibility for him to become able.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>If man would confess his inability and give up before God, everything would be all right.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>O young man!</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>O young ruler!</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Why do you have to depart sorrowfully?</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>It is right to recognize your inability.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>But it is wrong to leave sorrowfully.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>What you could have said was, "Lord, I cannot do this.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>I have no way.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Save me."</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>If you had said this, everything would be different.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The Lord's purpose is not for you to turn away, but to make you see that you are not able.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>When a man says, "I am able," God becomes unable in him.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>But whenever man becomes unable, God will become able.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>When we have exhausted our strength, God will manifest His power and glory.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>THE HISTORY OF THE ISRAELITES</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Let us look a little more into the history of the Israelites.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>After God gave the law, the children of Israel seemingly responded in a good way.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>They said that all the Lord commanded them, they would do Exo 19:8 .</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The first commandment that God gave was that there should be no other God besides Him 20:3 .</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Moses received this commandment on the mountain.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>But even before he came down, the children of Israel had already built themselves a golden calf, saying, "This is our God."</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>They promised easily that they would obey God's commandments.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>But God showed them that they were unable to do so.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>This happened to the children of Israel.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>It happened to the young ruler.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>It is also happening to us.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Over and over again, God is showing us that we are unable.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>WHO CAN KEEP GOD'S LAWS?</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Well, then, who can keep God's laws?</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>This is the second crucial question we have to ask.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Please remember that every commandment in the Bible is unreasonably demanding.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Every rich man has to sell all his possessions, give to the poor, and then follow Jesus of Nazareth.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>What is this?</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Is this not unreasonable?</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>The demands of Christ are so severe; they take your life!</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>He says that whoever loves his father, mother, or children more than Him is not worthy to be His disciple.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Neither is any worthy of Him who will not take up his cross to follow Him Matt 10:37-38 .</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Is this not asking for your life?</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>The clause concerning the bearing of the cross is especially so.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>The modern equivalent of the cross is to take a criminal to the execution ground with his hands and feet bound and then have him dragged through the streets for public ridicule.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>If you cannot be like that criminal, you are not worthy to be His disciple!</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Is not He demanding our life?</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Again, He says, "Love your enemies" 5:44 .</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Mere forgiveness is close to impossible for us.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Yet He talks about loving.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Hence, we have to see that all of God's commandments are impossible to keep.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>ONLY GOD HIMSELF</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>God Himself is the only able One.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>The commandments of Christ can only be fulfilled by Christ Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>Neither you nor I can do anything.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>Hence, the answer to our second question is that only the Son of God can fulfill the requirements of God.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>All of us are unable.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>God alone is able.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>Therefore, whenever a brother in the Lord tells me that he is hopeless, that he falls as soon as he rises, and that the more he tries the more he fails, I rejoice greatly.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>The more he weeps for his transgressions and failures, the more I laugh inside.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>I will say, "Today you know that you are a failure.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>This is something to be congratulated.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>Although you should have known this earlier, it is not too late to know it now."</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>We cannot obey God's will.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>God's will can only be done by God Himself, and the commandments of Christ can be fulfilled by none other than Christ.</S>
