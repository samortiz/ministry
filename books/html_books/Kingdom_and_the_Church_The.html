In our preaching we generally tell the gospel story from the human standpoint, seldom from the divine. For one thing, we preachers lack a lofty enough concept of the gospel; for another, it is easier to preach from the human angle, for then we can make a more personal appeal to our audience. If we preach the gospel from God's standpoint, our hearers are apt to consider it too remote, and because they feel it is of no immediate interest, it is difficult for us to touch their emotions; so we make salvation from sin the object, and offer our audience joy and peace. Occasionally, we raise the standard a little and present life as the goal. Our starting point is man's sin, man's unrest, man's misery, and man's dead condition. Our goal is pardon, peace, joy, and life. Because we stress man's need when we preach the gospel, our converts stress their gain when they accept the gospel. They will say, "I believed on the Lord Jesus, and I obtained forgiveness of sins; I obtained peace and joy and life."</P><P>But if we look carefully through the Bible, setting aside our own concepts, we see that the scriptural presentation is quite different from ours. It is this: "Repent, for the kingdom of heaven is at hand." It presents the kingdom as the object of the gospel. We should repent not merely to obtain pardon, not merely to obtain peace, not merely to obtain life, but because there is a heavenly kingdom that requires our repentance. We must repent in order to become partakers in this kingdom. We may be satisfied to have obtained pardon, peace, and life, but God is not satisfied with that.</P><P>It was not only John the Baptist who began his gospel preaching with the words, "Repent, for the kingdom of heaven is at hand." These same words were also spoken by the Lord Jesus when He began His ministry. In this New Testament dispensation, when presenting the gospel to man, God presents the kingdom as its one transcendent object. When in the New Testament He substitutes grace for law, He does it for the kingdom's sake, because the law was impotent to lead men into the kingdom. Once we see the kingdom, we realize how inadequate was our former apprehension of the gospel.</P><P>What a familiar topic the new birth is! How many have preached on the subject from the third chapter of John! But how many have seen the purpose of the new birth? Our Lord said, "Except a man be born anew, he cannot see the kingdom of God" (John 3:3). The object He presented was the kingdom! The purpose of the new birth is to enable us to enter the kingdom!</P><P>I fear that not many have this concept of the new birth&#151;that thereby God has given us His life so that we may be able to partake of His kingdom. If I am to live in the kingdom of God, I need to possess a life other than the life I have by nature. I must be born again. I must receive the life of God, for unless I possess His life, I cannot live in His kingdom.</P><P>What we have said makes it sufficiently clear that the gospel always has the kingdom of God in view; it is therefore called "the gospel of the kingdom." Matthew 24:14 says, "This gospel of the kingdom shall be preached in the whole world." But what is the kingdom?</P><P>The Christianity of today has made the matter of the kingdom largely a matter of prophecy, a matter related to the future. Many think "to enter the kingdom" is equivalent to "going to heaven." When I was a child I heard very much preaching of this kind&#151;setting forth "the kingdom of heaven" or "the kingdom of God" as a place of eternal happiness reserved for the future. This presentation is contrary to the Scriptures. The Scriptures show that the kingdom of God or the kingdom of heaven relates to our life in this present time. We acknowledge there is an aspect of the kingdom that is future, but the scriptural emphasis is on the present rather than the future. The kingdom touches our actual, everyday life.</P><P>The word "kingdom" used in the New Testament is a strong term in the Greek. Some translators have advocated the use of "sovereignty" as its equivalent. The idea is one of sovereign rule, of kingly authority. Do you recall the words of Revelation 20:4 and 6? Both verses speak of the resurrected saints reigning with Christ for a thousand years. The word "reign" used in both verses comes from the same root as the word "kingdom." The kingdom of God is the reign of God; the kingdom of heaven is the reign of heaven. But what does this imply? Surely it is not difficult for us to understand. Before we were saved we were under the dominion of Satan, and outwardly our lives were governed by men. As children we were under the authority of our parents; as students we were under the authority of our teachers; as citizens we were under the authority of the state; but there was no divine authority in our lives.</P><P>Look at the modern cities. What order prevails! A white line runs along the middle of the road and controls the comings and goings. No one crosses that white line. When someone is about to drive in a certain direction, and he sees a notice indicating one-way traffic, he does not go that way. Elsewhere he sees "No Parking," so he does not park there. How orderly! But remove the government, remove the police, remove the law-courts, and see what the cities would look like! There would be utter chaos. Why is it that today people are so orderly? It is because the government, the police, and the law-courts are exercising control over them. Are they under the authority of God? No! And neither were we before we were saved. We were not under the rule of God, which means that we were not in the kingdom of God.</P><P>But one day, through the gospel, God came to us and said, "You must repent!" Repent of what? Not just repent of certain wrongs; not just repent of certain sins; but repent radically&#151;repent of not being subject to the authority of heaven; repent of not submitting to the sovereignty of God.</P><P>The reason for our wrongdoing is primarily our nonacceptance of God's government. Men commit all kinds of sins because they will not let God exercise His authority over them. But how can He bring them under His authority? By means of the gospel! The gospel that the New Testament reveals is a gospel proclaimed to rebels&#151;to men who have resisted God's authority, to men who have rejected His rule, to men who would not have Him to reign over them. That gospel cleanses such men and puts God's life within them so they can accept God's government. That is the New Testament gospel!</P><P>You have heard the gospel, you have believed and you have been saved, but have you seen that the gospel has brought you under the rule of God? Have you seen that you have been saved for this specific purpose, that you might come under His control? Have you seen that your salvation is not merely a question of pardon, peace, and life, but that the very object of your being forgiven and having life imparted into you, is to bring you under the sovereign rule of God? That is the gospel! Revelation 1:5-6 reads, "To Him Who loves us and has loosed us from our sins by His blood, and made us a kingdom." The reason God washed us in the precious blood was that we might be brought under His government.</P><P>As I have preached the gospel in different places, I have had personal contact with numbers of people who have been clearly saved and who after their salvation have said something like this to me: "How is it that ever since I was saved I seem to be under some sort of control? It seems as though someone has taken over the management of my life, so that when I want to do this or that, something in me says, 'You can't!' And when I want to do that it says, 'No! No!' Formerly I was my own master; now I can no longer do as I please. What does it all mean?"</P><P>Is not that your story too? Yes, that is the story of every saved person. Yet at the time of our salvation we never thought that someone would come into our lives and take control. Many people, when they are first saved, do not understand this, and have asked me for an explanation. I have sought to explain it this way: How did you believe in the Lord? Did you not receive Him into your life? Then do you know that the Lord you received is not only Saviour, but also King? He is not only the Crucified One, He is also the One who has been exalted to the throne. He has received "all authority in heaven and on earth." "God has made Him both Lord and Christ." Today He is no longer the Savior on the cross. He is the Savior on the throne. It is as King that He has become your Savior, so His coming has brought His throne into your life. Every saved person is under an inner government, and this government is the government of the kingdom. Hitherto you have been aware of a restraint upon you, but you have not realized that there is a throne within your life. The kingdom of God is within you.</P><P>A few days ago I met someone who said with amazement: "My fellow students can enter heartily into all sorts of recreations, and I long to do the same. Yet when I want to take part in those amusements, there is a strong inner restraint. Why is there all this trouble inside?" We sometimes tell people that there is trouble inside because they have the life of the Lord inside. That is true enough, but it is not the whole truth. The question is not just one of a life within, but of an authority within.</P><P>Paul said, "The kingdom of God is not eating and drinking, but righteousness and peace and joy in the Holy Spirit" (Rom. 14:17). What are "eating and drinking"? Very practical matters of daily life. God's kingdom is likewise a practical matter of daily life&#151;as practical a matter as eating and drinking. God's kingdom is "righteousness and peace and joy in the Holy Spirit." When the authority of God's kingdom is allowed to operate within us, these three things will characterize our daily life&#151;toward ourselves we shall be strict in all matters of "righteousness"; in our relation to others we shall be characterized by "peace"; and in our walk with God we shall have "joy in the Holy Spirit." If we lack joy in the Holy Spirit, something has gone wrong with us. It is when we throw off the divine restraint that we are silent while others are praising. While they sing their hallelujahs, we cannot even produce an amen. Our spirits become weighted so that we cannot rejoice. When righteousness marks our personal walk, when we have peace in our relation with others, and when we have joy in the presence of God&#151;then the kingdom is manifesting itself in our everyday life.</P><P>Let us cease to think of the kingdom as a matter merely of prophecy. The New Testament reveals that as soon as we are saved, the throne of God is brought into our inner beings, so that thereafter our lives are lived in subjection to His kingdom.</P><H1 CLASS=MSG>CHAPTER TWO</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>LIFE AND THE KINGDOM</H1><H1 CLASS=SCRIPTURE>Scripture Reading: Matt. 5:20; Matt. 5:48; Matt. 7:21; Matt. 19:23-26; John 3:3; Rev. 22:1-2</H1><P>The Scriptures, from beginning to end, associate life with authority. When man is first mentioned, these two matters are both introduced. In the first chapter of Genesis the question of authority is brought up. When God created man He said, "Have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the air, and over every living thing that moveth upon the earth" (Gen. 1:28). As soon as God created Adam, He bestowed on him the right to govern the entire earth. But Genesis 1 does not tell us all that transpired between God and man when man was created, so Genesis 2 supplements the record. Genesis 1 tells us that God wanted man to exercise dominion over the earth on His behalf, and it tells us also what sort of man this man must be who is to wield authority for God. He must be "in the image of God." The man who is to rule the earth for God must be a man after God's "likeness"&#151;that is, like God&#151;so that when you have seen this man who is in dominion, you have, as it were, seen God Himself. The man who is to govern the earth for God is not merely one who wields authority; he is one who wields authority as God's representative. That is a tremendous thing. That is a transcendent thing and it demands a transcendent life for its accomplishment. A supernatural task requires a supernatural life. It is necessary for us to grasp this point&#151;that if man is to represent God and to exercise dominion for God on the earth, then man must possess a supernatural life. He cannot possibly bear so lofty a responsibility in the strength of his own natural life. If he is to wield divine authority and be a divine representative, he must possess the divine life.</P><P>Therefore, as soon as Genesis 1 has presented a man in the divine likeness and in the exercise of divine authority, Genesis 2 presents the tree of life. God was indicating that He would have man partake of the tree of life so that he might possess the divine life and thereby be enabled to fulfill the responsibilities of his ministry. If only the uncreated life of God could enter a human creature, then that human creature would be able to represent the Lord of creation, and that human creature would be able to rule the earth on behalf of the Lord of creation.</P><P>Do you see that at the very outset the Bible has linked authority and life? And at the end of the Bible these two are still linked. In the final two chapters of Revelation you see life issuing from the throne&#151;and the throne represents authority (Rev. 22:1-2). This matter of authority is entirely a matter of life. If you have the life, you have the authority. "Except a man be born anew, he cannot see the kingdom of God." "Except a man be born of water and the Spirit, he cannot enter into the kingdom of God" (John 3:3, 5). If we are to have part in the kingdom we must be born anew. We must become possessors of a life other than the life we have by nature. To use the Old Testament illustration, the Adam of Genesis 1 with his earthly life must receive the heavenly life of Genesis 2. Oh, do not think that we must be born again because we have sinned. We must be born again because we need to possess a life which we do not possess by natural birth. Of course sinners need to be born again, but if man had not fallen, the new birth would still be necessary. Our Lord told Nicodemus he needed to receive the life of God so that he might become a partaker in the kingdom of God. Do you see that here again life and the kingdom are linked together?</P><P>You may say: "Oh, it's all very good, but it's all beyond me! I truly want to submit to the authority of God, but I simply can't! I'm too weak." Yes, we are all too weak, for we are all children of Adam; we are all children of dust; we are all very earthy. And earthen things are so fragile. A little knock and they go to pieces. That is what we are like. And we are not just feeble creatures; we are fallen creatures. We are rebels by nature. We have no strength when it comes to submitting to God, but we have lots of strength when it comes to rebelling against Him. We have to confess that our natural life is a rebellious life, and it cannot possibly submit to God. The life we have by our natural birth is totally incapable of yielding to His authority. Our natural life is incapable, totally incapable, of coming under the government of God. When the disciples heard the Lord speaking about the kingdom, they heaved a sigh and said, "Who can?" And the Lord answered, "With men this is impossible."</P><P>Let me use an illustration here. A dog cannot fly To a dog, flight is a sheer impossibility. But what a dog cannot do, a bird can do with ease. It is the simplest thing for a bird to soar up into the sky. The life of a dog is a life that cannot fly; the life of a bird is a life that flies with ease. The bird has the kind of nature that flies, and it would suffer intensely if you did not let it fly. As for the dog, if you want it to crawl into a hole, it can do that; or if you want it to climb up a hill, it can do that too; but ask it to fly and it simply cannot. It is a matter of life. Our corrupt natural life cannot be subject to God. We need another life for that. We need the life of God. The new birth is the coming of God into man, so that what before was impossible to man now becomes possible. "With God all things are possible" (Matt. 19:26). Our problem of authority is no problem to God. When we have His life, it is the most natural thing to come under His authority. It is as spontaneous as for a bird to fly. If we suppress the divine life within us and do not let it submit to the divine authority, then we suffer as a caged bird suffers. But when we submit to the divine control we are wonderfully released. The more we submit, the more released we are until, as Isaiah puts it, we can "mount up with wings as eagles" (Isa. 40:31). Brothers and sisters, do you see that the whole question of the kingdom is a question of life?</P><P>The demands of the kingdom are terrific, but the provision of the divine life is equal to all its demands. A full gospel presents the kingdom with its requirements. It also presents the precious blood to cleanse from defilement and the life to supply the power which makes us partakers in the kingdom. The gospel presents these three things&#151;the kingdom, the blood, and the life. The kingdom makes its demands, but by virtue of the cleansing that comes through the precious blood and the power that comes through the divine life, even we who by nature are fallen creatures can live the kingdom life. Praise God, the very source of life is within us&#151;even God Himself! The God who from the throne issues His demands, Himself meets His demands. From the throne He requires that we be subject to Him, and from within He supplies the life that can be subject to Him. This takes no toll of our strength, but it does require our cooperation. There is no need for us to do, but there is the need for us to let Him do. Otherwise, how could the demands of the kingdom ever be met? Listen to these lofty demands! "Ye have heard that it was said, An eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth; but I say unto you: Resist not him that is evil; but whosoever smiteth thee on thy right cheek, turn to him the other also. And if any man would...take away thy coat, let him have thy cloak also" (Matt. 5:38-40). In my youth when I read those words I thought, "Oh, I could not possibly do that! And never in all my life shall I be able; so I'll have to give up being a Christian. I can't be a false Christian, and I can't be a true one, so I can't be one at all. There's no way out!" But a voice within me said: "You can't help being a Christian." I wanted to draw back, but I could not draw back; I wanted to go forward, but I could not go forward. Oh, the misery of it! For a long time I was in great perplexity, but one day God showed me that what I was trying to do was an utter impossibility, and He had never meant me to try. Imagine trying to attain to this: "Ye therefore shall be perfect, as your heavenly Father is perfect" (Matt. 5:48). That day light dawned, and I was able to praise God that He was my Father, and that the Father's life in me could enable even me to be perfect. The question is not one of our ability to do, but of giving our consent to His doing. He is impotent if we refuse consent. And that is where the trouble often lies&#151;He is willing, but we are unwilling.</P><P>Do you see? The requirements of the kingdom can never be met by man, and God never expected man to meet them. The demands He makes, He Himself meets&#151;and that is the grace revealed in the New Testament! In the Old Testament the law made its demands on man, but in the New Testament it is the kingdom that makes its demands. The demands of the kingdom are far more exacting than the demands of the law. The demands of the law proved how utterly impotent man was; now the demands of the kingdom prove, not how unable man is, but how able God is. There is no need for the demands of the kingdom to prove man's inability, for that has been conclusively proved by the demands of the law. Today the requirements of the kingdom serve to demonstrate the infinite ability of God. He has become our life that in us He may meet all the demands His kingdom makes upon us.</P><P>It is important to realize that God's life has been given for the sake of His kingdom. If we do not let Him set up His throne in our lives and assert His authority over us, His life cannot operate in us. God has put His life in us for the specific purpose of meeting the demands of His kingdom, and unless we allow Him to establish His kingdom in us, His life within us cannot function.</P><P>Let me use one or two illustrations. A sister came to me with her troubles and after talking awhile she said something like this: "I have really no problem except the problem of my own bad temper. I keep losing my temper with my husband and with my children. I have prayed and prayed about it, but the more I pray for victory, the more my temper gets the better of me. Why is it? I know the Lord is my Savior; why doesn't He save me from my bad temper? I know the Lord hears prayer; why doesn't He hear my prayers about my bad temper? I know His life is mighty; why can't His mighty life overcome this little temper of mine?" All that she said was very reasonable. The Lord's life within us is a mighty life, and the Lord is a hearer and answerer of prayer. Why then is that little temper not overcome? Please do not misunderstand me when I say that the life of the Lord has been put within you and me to meet the needs of God's great kingdom, not to meet the need of our little temper. So I said to that sister, "Who is Lord of your life, you or the Lord? Is the authority in your hands or in His?" And when she reasoned again about her temper, I asked again, "Who is on the throne of your life, you or God?" When I pressed the point and refused her a loop-hole to escape, at long last the answer came: "I am in charge of my own life." Then I said, "Sister, what need is there to say anything more? You are on the throne and you want the Lord to help you. If He is not in the place of authority in your life, how can He do anything for you?"</P><P>That is our whole trouble today. Why cannot God's mighty life deal with our little tempers? The question is not one of little problems or big problems; the question is this: Who is on the throne? You are always hoping God will confine Himself to the throne in heaven while you occupy the throne in your life. Then you are bothered by your weaknesses and sins, so you call upon Him to help you. You cry out to Him: "Are You not the Mighty One? Have You not promised to answer prayer? Can You bear to see Your child living a life of defeat?" Yes, He can bear to see you defeated, and He will let you go on being defeated until you realize that He has put His life within you in order to establish His kingdom within you.</P><P>You must let Him have the throne. Let Him take control. Let Him establish His kingdom in your life. Then every foe will be overcome. There will be no need then to pray about your weaknesses, for if He has His place on the throne of your life every foe will be vanquished. In the Old Testament days, when Jehovah had His place as King over His people, all their enemies were subject to them, but when they refused to let Him have dominion, the enemies gained the ascendancy. Then all their cries were unavailing. Their enemies took the holy city, destroyed the temple, carried off the ark, and took God's own people captive.</P><P>A brother once came to me and said something like this: "Why is it that my platform ministry is so weak? I pray a great deal about it. I sometimes fast and pray, and at times I spend a night in prayer before accepting a speaking invitation. Why am I still powerless?" My answer was the same as before: "Who is in control of your life?" That is the whole question. If you try to restrict God to the throne in heaven and refuse Him the throne in your life, all your cries for help will avail nothing. The question is not one of weakness or power; the question is one of the throne.</P><P>We read of the river of living water that "on this side of the river and on that was the tree of life, bearing twelve manner of fruits, yielding its fruit every month" (Rev. 22:2). Wherever this river flowed, every need was met. But where did the river come from? "And He showed me a river of water of life...proceeding out of the throne of God and of the Lamb" (Rev. 22:1). Life is always associated with the throne. When we yield to God's authority and let Him establish His kingdom in our lives, then we are maintained in victory and in fullness of life, for then we too are in authority.</P><H1 CLASS=MSG>CHAPTER THREE</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>THE RELATION BETWEEN<br>THE KINGDOM AND THE CHURCH</H1><H1 CLASS=SCRIPTURE>Scripture Reading: Matt. 16:18-19; Eph. 1:22-23; Eph. 4:15-16; Col. 2:19</H1><P>The opening proclamation of the New Testament is this: "The kingdom of heaven is at hand" (Matt. 3:2). The New Testament calls immediate attention to the matter of the kingdom. But after a while, when the disciples have come to know Him, the Lord raises the question of the church. The church was a mystery that had been hidden throughout all the generations of the past, and it was not until the Lord Jesus had brought His disciples to the point of recognizing Him as "the Christ, the Son of the living God," that He spoke openly of the church. When Peter said, "Thou art the Christ, the Son of the living God," the Lord came in at once with the word: "Upon this rock I will build my church" (Matt. 16:16-18). It was as though He was saying: "I am the Son of God, the Christ, for this purpose&#151;the building of My church. As the Son of God and as the Christ, I am a Rock, the Foundation Stone of a building that is to be built; and that building of which I am the foundation is the church."</P><P>Let us bear in mind that the first mention of the church is in Matthew 16, and Matthew is the book that proclaims the kingdom. The Lord's second mention of the church is still in the book of Matthew&#151;chapter 18. The four Gospels record only two occasions when our Lord on earth made reference to the church, and both of these are in the book which specifically proclaims the kingdom. From that fact we may know how intimately the kingdom and the church are related. Throughout the New Testament we find these two advancing together in the closest connection. When the Lord said, "Upon this rock I will build my church," He immediately added, "I will give unto thee the keys of the kingdom of heaven." The keys of the kingdom are given to make the building of the church possible. Where the authority of the kingdom is absent, there the building of the church will be lacking. Anyone who refuses to submit to the authority of the kingdom can at best be a saved person; he will never be built into the structure of the church.</P><P>The Bible first presents the kingdom and thereafter presents the church. Where the kingdom of heaven is in authority, there a church will be built up. A church comes into being where a company of people accept the government of heaven. So it would appear to be the presence of the kingdom that produces the church. But the New Testament goes beyond that. That is only one half of the New Testament revelation; the other half is this&#151;the church brings in the kingdom. The church which comes into being under the rule of heaven, by reason of her submission to the heavenly rule, deals with God's enemy. It is the presence of God's enemy that hinders God's will from being done on the earth, and it is the exercise of God's authority by the church that casts him out. Then the New Jerusalem appears, and in the New Jerusalem you see the kingdom and the church blending into one. The New Jerusalem is the Bride, which according to Ephesians 5 is the church. It is also a city, which speaks of government, and in this center of government there is the throne of God and of the Lamb. The New Jerusalem combines in itself both the church and the kingdom. And in saying this we have summed up in a sentence the entire content of the New Testament. We might express it in three phrases&#151;the kingdom produces the church, the church brings in the kingdom, and the ultimate issue is the kingdom and the church. The New Testament opens by presenting the kingdom and thereafter presenting the church. But how does the church become an actuality? It is through the exercise of kingdom authority. When the church has ceded to the kingdom the right to rule and has submitted to its sway, the church then brings the dominion of heaven to the earth. All the way through the New Testament we see the church blending with the kingdom and the kingdom blending with the church, until eventually this blending issues in the New Jerusalem. In the New Jerusalem, where you can detect the nature of the church and the conditions of the kingdom, God is able to express His sovereignty fully and can therefore execute His will and display His glory.</P><P>With that summary in mind let us now inquire: Why was the church needed? We can only indicate the answer in a few words. God has a purpose concerning the universe, but for its accomplishment it was necessary for Him to wield authority, because as we pointed out earlier, no plan can be carried into effect where authority is lacking. Whether or not God would be able to implement His purpose hinged on this matter of authority. So when God's enemy sought to frustrate God's purpose, he did a crucial thing&#151;he violated God's authority. How did God seek to meet the situation? He did so by securing another creation through which He could exercise authority. He sought a company of men who would give Him the right-of-way on the earth to carry His will into effect. If only He could secure a band of men on the earth who would let Him wield dominion over them, then He could accomplish His purpose concerning Christ in and through them. It was for this reason that God needed the church. He wanted to have the church in order to bring His kingdom from heaven to earth.</P><P>The question which now arises is this: How is the church secured? We might answer: "The Lord Jesus shed His blood for the remission of our sins and gave His life that we might be born again and thereby constitute the church." This is true enough, but it is a very superficial aspect of the truth. The Scriptures present this far more profound aspect&#151;that the church has been secured through the sovereign rule of heaven. Because the kingdom of heaven is able to assert its authority over a company of men, that company of men can be built up into a church. It is necessary at this point to recapitulate. Why was the church brought into being? For the purpose of bringing in the kingdom! How was the church brought into being? By means of the authority of the kingdom! God's purpose was to bring His heavenly dominion to the earth, and apart from the church, His goal could not be attained. He needed a people who would subject themselves to the dominion of heaven, so that under that dominion they might be built up into the church. That is what Matthew 16 reveals. Do not imagine that by our salvation alone we become the church. We who are saved are in the church, but our salvation alone does not constitute us the church. The church is a Body; therefore, there is need of relatedness and there is the need of building up.</P><P>Let me illustrate. Our body has very many bones, but do many bones constitute a body? Let the Old Testament book of Ezekiel supply the answer. Ezekiel says that the children of Israel were in the sight of God like a heap of dry bones. One day the breath of life came into them, and the bones were knit together, and they became one body (Ezek. 37).</P><P>To illustrate again, the church is a house. It is God's dwelling, God's temple. Now the Bible says that we who are saved are "living stones" and are built together into a "spiritual house" (1 Pet. 2:5). We admit that a house is built of stones, but a heap of stones is not a house. Brothers and sisters, do not take for granted that if a thousand brothers and sisters come together here, it means that the church is here. What is the church? It is the saved assembled together. But what kind of an assembling together is it? A great number of stones heaped up together is not a house. What then is a house? It is stone built upon stone&#151;this one set on top of that one, that one set beside the other one, above and beneath, to left and to right, before and behind, all perfectly placed in relation to one another. Apart from a building together of the stones there can be no house. There might be a thousand brothers and sisters together and all are saved, but we would still ask whether they have been built together or not. They are certainly church material, but whether they are the church or not depends on whether or not they have been built together. Without building there is no church.</P><P>Perhaps some would ask what it really means to be built. Unfortunately, while the word "built," as used in Matthew 16, is found very often in the New Testament, it is frequently rendered "edify." So we read of believers being "edified" and of the church being "edified." But the original language does not imply (as does the word "edify") to "improve morally," or to "benefit spiritually," but truly to "build." How do we build? Well, here is a stone! Along comes a workman, tool-in-hand, and applies that tool to the stone until its surface is perfectly even. But that stone has to fit into a certain space in the building. The stone is triangular. The space is rectangular. So the stone has to be chipped and chipped and chipped until the shape of the stone and the space in the building perfectly correspond. Then into the space the stone is fitted. The stone is not there to be ornamental; it is there to be part of the building. Oh, it is not a lot of ornamental stones that are needed. In many gatherings there is quite a display of beautiful stones, but I am afraid there has not been a building up of the stones into a house. What God wants is not a lot of precious stones; He wants a spiritual house.</P><P>We often meet brothers who are delightful Christians. Their lives are well ordered, they are careful about the early morning watch and earnest in evangelistic work; they have attended many meetings for spiritual "edification" and have become so truly "edified" that they call forth the commendation of others; yet they remain individualists who cannot be "built." They are precious stones, so precious they cannot be fitted together with common clay or stone. They are too beautiful to be built up into one building with others, so they remain individual Christians, lovely for display, but no good for building. What God desires is a house, not a lot of separate stones, however beautiful they may be. He wants a complete church, not numbers of scattered Christians.</P><P>One sister, speaking to me of another, said: "Oh, she's such a precious sister, so spiritual!" When I asked more about her, she said, "Oh, she's so humble, so quiet, so gentle; we have never known her to be irritated." And again she added, "She's so spiritual!" "Who is she spiritual with?" I asked. "Is she an isolated spiritual sister, or has her spirituality related her to others?" "Oh!" replied the sister, "singers who strike such high notes as she find few who can sing with them." Alas! that sister was so spiritual that no one could be her spiritual companion. Such a sister is all right for display purposes, but she is of no use for church building. The kind of sister needed in the church is one who can have another placed behind her and another in front, another to her left and another to her right, and one below her and one above. That is the kind of Christian God is seeking today.</P><P>During the past two thousand years one of the greatest hindrances to the purpose of God, and the main reason why our Lord has had to delay His return, is the lack of Christians who have been built together. You can find Christians all over the world, and you can find spiritual Christians too; but where in any one place has a spiritual house been built? There are lots of stones that have been wrought upon until they are very beautiful, but where is the building? May the Lord have mercy upon us!</P><P>Brothers and sisters, there is a condition to be fulfilled if there is to be a building. The one indispensable condition is submission to the authority of the kingdom. Our Savior has been exalted to be Head of the universe, and all authority has been given Him in heaven and on earth. God has put all things under His feet and has made Him Head over all things to the church. In the first place this implies that the church must come under His headship. What is headship? It is the government of the Head. Do realize that if the church is to be built up, we must submit to the authority of the Head. Where there is no Head there is no authority; and there the question of church building cannot even arise. In Ephesians 4:15-16, which speaks throughout of the building of the church, it is shown to be of primary importance that we "grow up into Him in all things, Who is the Head, Christ." In how many things are we really growing up into Him? Even our humility, even our love, and even many of our other good qualities, are not necessarily a growing up under His headship. We have not yet understood what it means to have our affections governed by Christ, and to have all those other desirable qualities developed under His headship. Where there is truly a growing up in all things into the Head, there will follow the building up of the Body as these two verses show. "All the Body, fitted and knit together...causes the growth of the Body unto the building up of itself in love." Colossians 2:19 speaks of "holding the Head." What does that mean? It means in all things submitting to the authority of the Head. Note that it does not say: "holding the Savior," nor does it say: "holding the life." It is when we submit to the government of the Head that there will be the building of which the same verse speaks&#151;"all the body, being supplied and knit together through the joints and bands, increaseth with the increase of God." Get subjection to the authority of the Head, and you get the building up of the Body. Where the government of heaven is secured, there the church is secured. The extent to which the church is built up in our midst will depend entirely upon the place given in our midst to the church's Head.</P><P>"All the Body, fitted and knit together"&#151;that is church building! But how does it happen? "Out from Whom all the Body, fitted and knit together." It happens as each member submits to the Head; it happens as each accepts the government of the kingdom of heaven. Only through those who come under the control of the Head can the building of the church be secured. So the question as to whether or not the church will be built up becomes a question of whether or not you and I can accept the authority of the kingdom.</P><H1 CLASS=MSG>CHAPTER FOUR</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>THE BUILDING OF THE CHURCH<br>IN RELATION TO THE KINGDOM</H1><H1 CLASS=SCRIPTURE>Scripture Reading: Matt. 16:16-19; Eph. 2:22; 1 Pet. 2:5; Eph. 4:11-12, 15-16; Col. 2:19</H1><P>The New Testament clearly reveals that in this universe God has focused all His activities on a building project. He has undertaken many other tasks, but the work that is central to all His other work, and the work that is the ultimate to which all His other work is directed, is the structure of which the Lord speaks in Matthew 16&#151;"I will build my church." All the divine activity in the universe is directed toward this, the building of the church.</P><P>The church is a mystery, a great mystery. If we know our Bibles, and if we know something of fellowship with God, then we will know that the church was a secret long hidden in the heart of God. To state it briefly, this mystery is God Himself wrought into humanity, God Himself wrought into the lives of His creatures&#151;and fallen creatures at that. But through redemption these creatures have become partakers of divine life and have thereby experienced two creations&#151;creation "in Adam" and creation "in Christ" (2 Pet. 1:4). By the first creation they have received created life; by the second creation they have received uncreated life. By the first creation they have become possessors of a human nature; by the second creation they have become possessors of a divine nature. Not only has man become possessed of two dispositions, the human and the divine, but God Himself has taken up His abode in man. Man in his outer being remains unchanged. He is still man, truly man but into his inner being has come the heavenly nature, for the God of heaven has come to dwell within him.</P><P>God is now working upon this humanity that men should not be separate units, but be coordinated into one. He wants many men to become one organic whole, one Body. He wants the many to be built up into one structure, one house. He wants them to be brought into such harmony with Himself that they may become His dwelling place. He wants them to be brought into such correspondence with Christ. that they shall become His Body. When the work of God is perfected, what we now see as Christ's Body, and what we now see as God's dwelling, we shall then see as the Bride of Christ and the city of God, which is His governmental center. Call this as you will&#151;the Body of Christ, or the house of God, or the family of God, or the kingdom of God&#151;it is here that all God's fullness dwells. This is what God planned in eternity past before the creation, and when in time God began His creative work, this was the goal He had in view. Though there was satanic interference, God did not suspend His activity, but brought in redemption that the work might continue. When His Son came to earth He plainly stated that His desire was this building (Matt. 16:16-19).</P><P>Brothers and sisters, I trust you have caught a vision of the church. I trust you see how sacred a thing the church is, how mysterious, how immense. God has laid hold of men and has imparted Himself into them. He is now working to make them one corporate whole, so that in and through them He may manifest Himself in all His glory. This is the task to which God has been bending all His energies, and it is in the light of this that we must read again the words of the Lord Jesus: "I will build my church."</P><P>Once, when I went to Hong Kong, a fellow-worker drew my attention to the high buildings everywhere. But what are those buildings compared to the church? They are mere worthless structures. God is putting up a great building in the universe, and He is using Himself and man as building material. He is putting Himself into the building; He is putting heaven into the building; and He is also putting into it numbers and numbers of men who have been saved through the generations; and He is building all that material together. He was referring to this when He said, "I will build my church."</P><P>But how did He set about this task of building the church? It was by sending the Holy Spirit, and by giving gifts to the church. "He gave some apostles, and some prophets, and some evangelists, and some shepherds and teachers...unto the building up of the Body of Christ" (Eph. 4:11-12). While much evangelistic work goes on, and much work for the edification of believers goes on, there is little evidence of church building, yet God has given evangelists, prophets, and teachers for the specific purpose of building up the church. I hope you realize that this is the one thing in the universe God is after, and all who are seeking to work for Him should have this goal before them.</P><P>But let us bring our consideration of this so lofty theme right down to everyday life and consider it in its practical aspect. What is the usual concept of building the church? You open a place of worship, you introduce people to Christianity, you have them baptized, you arrange a variety of meetings, you get things organized a bit&#151;and you have the church! I do not wish to enlarge on this line, but I long that the Lord's children might realize that what we have just described is not what the Bible means by building the church. The building of the church means first, the bringing of men under the authority of the church's Head. Before men are saved they are under the authority of Satan, and after they are saved they are delivered out of the authority of darkness and transferred into the kingdom of the Son of His love (Col. 1:13). To be saved is to be delivered out of Satan's authority and to be placed under the authority of Christ. It is a great grief to me to hear people explaining salvation as a matter of being saved from hell to heaven. Of course salvation brings us to heaven, but heaven is not the goal of our salvation. Salvation is not merely a matter of God in His compassion for men translating them from hell to heaven, but of delivering them "out of the authority of darkness" and transferring them "into the kingdom of the Son of His love." The objective here is not heaven, but the kingdom. God saves us that we may come into subjection to the Son of His love. The building up of the church has its beginning here&#151;the bringing of people under the sway of Christ who formerly had been under Satan's sway.</P><P>Oh, that you might realize that as soon as the question of church building arises, the question of the headship of Christ arises! When you meet that challenge, praise God! The building of the church begins in your life. If in any person, or in any company of believers, Christ is able to assert His authority, then He starts to build His church. That is why we have kept stressing the fact that there must be the sovereign rule of the kingdom if there is to be any building up of the church. Unless the kingdom is here, no church will be built up here.</P><P>If the mass of material that went into the building of a meeting hall were torn down until it all lay in a heap, what would be the good of it? It would be utterly useless. That all the material serves a purpose today, is because it has all been built up into an ordered structure. Brothers and sisters, there is an urgent need for the building up of believers! The need is not for the establishing of Christian groups, but for the building up of the church under the government of the church's Head. If you are to have a part in that, then you yourself will need to submit to the headship of Christ. When His authority becomes a settled issue in your life, an amazing thing will begin to take place&#151;you will find yourself most naturally being built together with others who are also in subjection to His authority. Such a company of believers will be a strong church, able to do battle for the kingdom of God. In the face of such a church Satan will be impotent. But if such a church is to come into being&#151;a church against which the gates of Hades cannot prevail&#151;then a building up must take place; and that cannot take place apart from a recognition of the church's Head and subjection to His authority.</P><P>You may ask what this means in practical terms. Let me illustrate. Two strangers meet, both believers. With delight each recognizes the other as a brother. They praise the Lord and are thrilled that they have found one another. They decide to preach the gospel together, and soon a score of people are saved&#151;twelve from the north and eight from the south. Those two brothers rejoice more heartily than ever. How they praise the Lord that they were able together to lead all those souls to Him! But this happy state of affairs does not last, for the northerners are rather strange characters, and the southerners too have their peculiar temperaments. At first praise is so easy, but soon it becomes hard work to produce a "Praise the Lord!" Before long criticisms begin to take the place of "hallelujahs," and discord increases, until one day the northerners and the southerners decide to part company and each rents a separate meeting place.</P><P>Is the church built that way? Far from it. That is the way the church is destroyed. What is the source of the trouble? It is the absence of the throne! In the book of Judges we read: "In those days there was no king in Israel: every man did that which was right in his own eyes" (Judg. 21:25). When there was no king in Israel, there was no authority, and the people just did as they pleased. At that time a certain family set up a place of worship in their own home, hired a Levite to be their household priest, and there they instituted a form of "divine worship" (Judg. 17). That is exactly the state of things in the present day! We think if we are just keen enough, we can gather some people together, and you can set up a church on this street, and I can set up a church on that street, and we can hire a preacher to preach for us. Brothers and sisters, what is the cause of all this confusion? The ultimate cause is that we have not subjected ourselves to the Head of the church.</P><P>But let us return to our illustration of the two brothers. If those two had both come into subjection to the church's Head, their problems would have been solved, for authority quells all rebellion. Oh, what rebel stuff there is in our make-up! I confess that my own nature is utterly antagonistic to the Lord, but His authority over me has brought me to love my brethren, so that I can truly serve Him together with them. Brothers and sisters, we talk about mutual love, but this love of ours one for the other is very transient. There is only one place where love is permanent, and that is under the Head of the church. Nowhere else is there true harmony or permanent relatedness. When we are willing to be broken under His authority, something tremendous happens&#151;a building process begins to take place. A constant acceptance of the discipline of His government makes way for the flow of His life, and so the building work goes on apace. Those brothers and sisters who have been our problems become our blessings, and it is not long before a company is built up in the life of Christ.</P><P>Brothers and sisters, this is what God desires today. It is not enough that we preach the gospel, bring people to a knowledge of salvation, and to a measure of spirituality. We must also bring them under the headship of Christ so that they may be built up. Under His headship we shall cease to reckon with difficulties, for we shall touch fullness of life. Then the specific spiritual function which belongs to each member of the Body will become apparent, and this local church will become a strong church in which, under the direction of the Head, every member, from the smallest to the greatest, will have a contribution to make to the whole.</P></body></html>
