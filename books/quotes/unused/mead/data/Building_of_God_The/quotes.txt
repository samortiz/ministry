[1]  CONTENTS The Mingling of God and Man The House of God in Jacob's Dream Life and Building in the Gospel of John The Building in the Teachings of the Epistles
[2]  This book is composed of messages given by Brother Witness Lee in a training in Altadena, California in the summer of 1963.
[3]  CHAPTER ONE THE MINGLING OF GOD AND MAN Scripture Reading: Gen 2:9-12; 6:14-16; Exo 25:8-9; 1 Kings 6:1; John 1:14; 2:19-21; Rev 21:2, 12, 14, 23; 22:1
[4]  In the Scriptures there are many lines of the truth related to many important matters.
[5]  There is the line of life, for example, from the beginning of the Scriptures to the end. There are also the lines of redemption, sin, and even the enemy of God, Satan, the devil.
[6]  THE NEW JERUSALEM AS THE ULTIMATE CONSUMMATION OF THE MINGLING OF DIVINITY WITH HUMANITY
[7]  After the church, God's building becomes the New Jerusalem Rev 21:2 .
[8]  Noah's ark, the tabernacle, the temple, Christ, the church, and the New Jerusalem are all God's building.
[9]  We do believe that there is a paradise prepared by God, but we must realize and remember well that the divine thought in the entire Scriptures is not that God is seeking a physical habitation.
[10]  CHAPTER TWO THE HOUSE OF GOD IN JACOB'S DREAM Scripture Reading: Gen 28:10-22; John 1:51; 14:2-6, 20; 1 Pet 2:5
[11]  In the Scriptures there is first the creation of God and then the building of God.
[12]  As we saw in the previous chapter, at the conclusion of the work of God's creation there was the garden of Eden, and at the conclusion of the work of God's building there is the holy city, the New Jerusalem.
[13]  Therefore, at the end of the Scriptures there is a city as the building of God, and that city is the mingling of God with all the redeemed persons, including the Old Testament and New Testament saints, composed together as a container to contain God and be mingled and permeated with God.
[14]  All the divine principles of God's building are in this picture.
[15]  The divine building is the opening of heaven to the earth so that heaven is joined to the earth and the earth is united to heaven by the heavenly ladder.
[16]  To see what this ladder is, we must refer to John 1:51, which says, "And He said to him, Truly, truly, I say to you, You shall see heaven opened and the angels of God ascending and descending on the Son of Man."
[17]  In Genesis 28 there is a ladder upon which the angels of God ascend and descend, while in John 1 this ladder is the Son of Man, upon whom the angels of God ascend and descend.
[18]  As we have seen, the Lord is the Son of Man as the heavenly ladder bringing God down to man and man up to God.
[19]  THE PRESENCE OF GOD, AN OPEN HEAVEN, BETHEL ON EARTH, AND THE HEAVENLY LADDER IN THE CHURCH MEETINGS
[20]  CHAPTER THREE LIFE AND BUILDING IN THE GOSPEL OF JOHN Scripture Reading: John 1:1, 4; 10:10; 1:14; 2:19; 15:4; 14:2, 20, 23; 17:21-23
[21]  As we have seen, God has two sections of His work according to His plan, the work of creation and the work of building.
[22]  In the second chapter of John there are two stories, the story of how the Lord made wine out of water, and the story of how He cleansed the temple, the house of God.
[23]  The way for the Lord to build up the house of God is to bring God into us and bring us into God to make us the abodes of God and to make God an abode for us, that is, to make God to dwell in us and us to dwell in Him so that God and we, we and God, become a mutual abode.
[24]  In this light, we can realize what "My Father's house" with many abodes is in 14:2.
[25]  CHAPTER FOUR THE BUILDING IN THE TEACHINGS OF THE EPISTLES Scripture Reading: 1 Cor 3:12; Eph 4:13-16; Col 2:19; 1 Pet 2:4-5; Heb 11:10, 16, 40; 12:22-24
[26]  From the entire Scriptures we can realize that after God's creation, God's intention is to work Himself into humanity and to work humanity into divinity.
[27]  After God's creation, what God has always been doing is to build Himself with man and to build man with Himself.
[28]  First Corinthians 3:12 says that silver is the second of the precious materials, but in Genesis 2:12 and Revelation 21:21 the second material is not silver but pearl, or bdellium.
[29]  To build up the church and the believers is simply to impart, to minister, Christ to them.
[30]  THE NEW JERUSALEM AS THE EMBODIMENT OF ALL THAT CHRIST IS
[31]  The New Jerusalem is the ultimate conclusion of the entire Scriptures.
[32]  In the Gospel of John we see the Lord Jesus as many items.
