 <h1 class="msg">CHAPTER TEN</h1>

<h1 class="title">THE MINISTRY OF THE RICHES OF CHRIST</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: 2 Cor. 3:7-9; Eph. 3:8; Rom. 12:5; Eph. 1:23; 3:3</h1>
<p>This chapter may be considered as the conclusion of all the foregoing chapters. The ministry of the New Testament is the ministry of the riches of Christ; this ministry ministers the riches of Christ. Strictly speaking, throughout all the dispensations in the Bible, God has had only two ministries, the Old Testament ministry and the New Testament ministry. The Old Testament ministry is the ministry of law, and the New Testament ministry is the ministry of grace; the ministry of the New Testament is versus the ministry of the Old Testament. The word <em>ministry</em> in Greek may also denote a service. The portion of the service to God which one renders is called his ministry. Everyone can render service to God; these services are our respective ministries. In the Bible, especially in the New Testament, there is the ministry in the singular number, denoting the unique ministry of God, and there are ministries in the plural, denoting the various services of the believers.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE MINISTRY OF THE NEW TESTAMENT<br />
VERSUS THE MINISTRY OF THE OLD TESTAMENT</h2>
<p>The ministry of the New Testament is the ministry of the Spirit, which is versus the ministry of death in the Old Testament (2 Cor. 3:8, 7). In 2 Corinthians 3, the Spirit is in contrast to death because the Spirit is the Spirit of life, and life is versus death. The Old Testament ministry was a ministry of death, but the New Testament ministry is a ministry of life, which is altogether realized in the Spirit.</p>
<p>The ministry of the New Testament is also the ministry of righteousness, which is versus the ministry of condemnation (2 Cor. 3:9). Because justification is in contrast to condemnation, righteousness here denotes justification. In the Old Testament there was one ministry which brought in condemnation. This condemnation issued in death. The New Testament brought in justification which is unto life. Romans 5:18 says that we have justification of life, that is, we are justified to receive the Spirit which is the very divine life. In the Bible are these two ministries: the ministry of condemnation unto death and the ministry of justification unto life, which is embodied in the Spirit.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE MINISTRY OF THE RICHES OF CHRIST</h2>
<p>The ministry of the New Testament is the ministry of the riches of Christ (Eph. 3:8). The ministry of the New Testament does not minister the law, but the riches of Christ. The riches of Christ are the riches of God, but because the riches of God today are in Christ, they are called the riches of Christ. The New Testament ministry is for ministering the riches of Christ to God&rsquo;s chosen people for the producing of the members of the Body of Christ (Rom. 12:5). The riches of Christ are ministered to us that we may be regenerated by the Spirit with the divine life. Through regeneration we become the living members of Christ for the constitution of the Body of Christ. This is not a matter of religion but a matter of life.</p>
<p>The riches of Christ are ministered that the Body of Christ might be formed (Eph. 1:23). All the riches ministered to us are for the Body of Christ, and the riches of Christ are the source and the elements of the Body of Christ. The church as the Body of Christ functions in a way to produce new and more members of the Body for the increase of the Body.</p>
<p>The increase of the Body of Christ is very much related to the church meetings. The church meeting is to dispense the Triune God, and the very processed Triune God in reality is all the riches of Christ. When we minister the riches of Christ to God&rsquo;s chosen people in the meeting, we minister, or dispense, the very Triune God to them. Then the recipients of this dispensing become the members of the Body of Christ. Eventually, the Body is formed. The Christian meeting should issue in the Body of Christ. The Body of Christ should come out of our meeting. We do not come together merely to serve God or receive grace or salvation; our meeting should issue in one thing&mdash;the Body of Christ. We come together to meet to dispense the Triune God into His chosen people, that is, to minister the riches of Christ to the believers that the Body may be formed. Every time we meet, the issue should be the increase of the Body of Christ. The church as the Body of Christ, the fullness of the One who fills all in all, comes out of the dispensing of the riches of Christ. The more we dispense the Triune God into people, the bigger the Body of Christ will be. This is a high concept.</p>
<p>The ministry of the riches of Christ is according to the revelation of the mystery of Christ (Eph. 3:3). The mystery of Christ is simply the church as the Body of Christ, which is constituted with all the divine elements which have been ministered into people by the church. These divine elements are the riches of Christ, and all the riches of Christ are the processed Triune God. We minister and dispense the Triune God to people by meeting together to speak. We all come to the meeting to speak. When you speak, you minister, and when you minister, you dispense the processed Triune God, who is all the riches of Christ.</p>
