By Exercising Our Spirit</H2><P>When we meet, we should always exercise our spirit. This is indicated in 1 Corinthians 14:32, which says, "The spirits of prophets are subject to prophets." In the meetings we do not need to exercise our emotion or mind that much. What is really needed is for us to exercise our spirit.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>C. With the Experience of Christ</H2><P>We should come to the church meetings with the experience of Christ. The New Testament does not say much concerning what we should bring to the meeting, but the New Testament always depends upon the pictures shown in the Old Testament. In the Old Testament, every gathering of God's people ordained by God at the very place chosen by God was for God's people to bring their rich surplus of the good land and offer this surplus to God. God charged them not to come empty-handed. They had to bring the rich surplus of the good land, and the good land typifies Christ. The rich produce of the rich surplus typifies our experience and our enjoyment of Christ. Therefore, we must come to the meeting with the experiences of Christ.</P><P>How much content the meeting has and how high the meeting is altogether depend upon how much we have experienced Christ. We must come to the meeting not with the objective, doctrinal Christ but with the subjective, experiential Christ. Many Christians do not have any experience of Christ in their daily walk, so when they come together they do not have anything of Christ to minister to one another. But in the Lord's recovery it should be absolutely different. Day by day we should have some experience of Christ. Then something will be accumulated in our being and we will have something of Christ to minister and impart to others. To get into the name of the Lord, to exercise our spirit, and to offer the Christ whom we have experienced are the basic ways of how we should come together.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>D. Ministering Christ</H2><P>If you come into the person of Christ, exercise your spirit, and have some experience of Christ, whenever you open up your mouth, whether you call a hymn, pray, praise, give a testimony, read a portion of the Word, or speak a short message, it will be the ministering of Christ. Christ will come out of you. This is the ministry, and this is the top service. You will become a steward serving people with Christ. You will become a divine waiter or waitress, waiting on many attendants and serving them with something of Christ.</P><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_005.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_007.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Basic Lessons on Service &nbsp; pg 6</div><br></body></html>
