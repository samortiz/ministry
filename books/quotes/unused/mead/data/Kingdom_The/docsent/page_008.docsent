   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE KINGDOM BEING IN THEIR MIDST</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In Luke 17:21 the Greek word rendered "within" by the King James Version means both "within" and "in the midst," and it is hard to determine the exact meaning in this verse.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>I believe that the Lord's word implies both aspects.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Since the Lord Jesus was present with them, the kingdom of God was in their midst.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Do not say, "Here is the kingdom" or "There is the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Behold, the kingdom of God is here in your midst."</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>What is this?</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>This is the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Where He is, there is the kingdom of God.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Let me ask you: Do you not believe that the Lord Jesus was observed at that time by all the Pharisees?</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Some said, "Is not this the carpenter's son?</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Is not his mother called Mary, and his brothers James and Joseph and Simon and Judas?</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>And his sisters, are they not all with us?"</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Matt 13:55-56 .</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>They knew all this and still were unable to observe the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The Lord Jesus was in their midst as the kingdom, but they were unable to observe Him because they were using the wrong organ.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>They needed to use the proper organ their spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>When the Lord Jesus was among them, He was not only a man, but also the embodiment of God.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>They needed to realize this in their spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Because they failed to realize this, He was in their midst, but He was unable to be in them.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>If they had observed God in their spirit, He would have immediately come inside of them as the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Since the kingdom is the Lord Jesus, and He was present with the Pharisees, why did they ask Him, "When shall the kingdom of God come?"</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>It was because they paid too much attention to the mental knowledge of the Bible in letters.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>They simply did not know how to exercise their inward part, that is, their human spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>By their outward man and by their natural ability they were unable to observe that the Lord Jesus was the reality of the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Although the Lord Jesus, the kingdom of God, was present, they could not observe Him.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>If they had observed Him by the exercise of their spirit, this wonderful One would have come inside of them immediately.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>He would not have been only in their midst, but also inside of them.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Whether the Lord Jesus was only in their midst or also inside of them depended on whether or not they exercised their spirit to observe Him.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>THE KINGDOM BEING THE LORD JESUS AS THE SPIRIT</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>We may say that the kingdom is the Lord Jesus, but it must be the Lord Jesus as the Spirit, not in the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The kingdom is the Lord Jesus as the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>He said to the Pharisees, "But if I by the Spirit of God cast out demons, then the kingdom of God is come upon you" Matt 12:28 .</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>This verse tells us that the kingdom is simply the reality of the Spirit of God.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>When the Spirit of God is made real, this realization is the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The Lord Jesus said that because He cast out demons by the power of the Spirit of God, this indicated that the kingdom of God was there.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The kingdom is the spiritual realization of the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>When we realize Him spiritually, we have the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The Spirit of God is the reality of the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The Spirit is His Person, and His Person is His reality.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Just as the reality of a man is his person, so the reality of the Lord Jesus is His Person, and His Person is the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>He had the Spirit with Him, and the Spirit was His Person.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>This Person, the Spirit, was the reality of the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>At that time, His reality was fully exercised by casting out demons.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Thus, that was the kingdom of God.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Now we can see that the kingdom is not merely a dispensation or sphere.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The kingdom is the realization of the reality of the Lord Jesus.</S>
