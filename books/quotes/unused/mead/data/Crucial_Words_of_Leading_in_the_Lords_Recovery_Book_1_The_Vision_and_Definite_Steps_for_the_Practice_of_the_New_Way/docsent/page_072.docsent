   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE TYPOLOGY OF GOD S BUILDING</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>IN THE OLD TESTAMENT</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>AND ITS RELATIONSHIP TO THE WARFARE</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The building in the Old Testament was the tabernacle and the temple as the house of God.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>After the Israelites left Egypt and arrived at Mount Sinai, Moses saw the vision of the building of God s tabernacle.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Following this, the people began their journey in the wilderness with Canaan as their goal.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>They did not travel to Canaan without a testimony and a goal.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>These two or three million people did not wander in the wilderness aimlessly, arriving in Canaan by chance.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Rather, their journey in the wilderness was orderly and disciplined, and it was always centered around God s tabernacle.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>From the book of Numbers we can see that when they set up their camp, the first thing they did was set up the tabernacle.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>After the tabernacle was established as the center, all the tribes settled around it according to a prescribed order.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>When they set out on their journey, they put the tabernacle on their shoulders and followed the ark.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The first four chapters of Numbers show that when God ordered the children of Israel to be numbered, He considered every numbered person as a soldier.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Those who were numbered were conscripts in the army.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The first group to be numbered were those twenty years of age and upward.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>They were all drafted into the service.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The Levites, however, were not numbered.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Since they were required to draw near to the tabernacle to serve the priests and to minister to the tabernacle, they needed to possess a higher level of life and more maturity in life.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Therefore, only those who were between thirty and fifty years old were numbered and drafted into the service of the tabernacle.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Numbers 4:3 says, From thirty years old and upward even to fifty years old, all who enter into the service to perform the skilled work in the Tent of Meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The word service here should be translated as warfare.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Verse 2 of chapter 26 says, Take the sum of the whole assembly of the children of Israel, from twenty years old and upward, by their fathers households, all who are able to go forth for military service in Israel.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The phrase go forth for military service is based on the same Hebrew word for service in 4:3.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>It refers to those who are able to serve in the army.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The first four chapters of Numbers show these matters, because in God s eyes, in order to maintain His central testimony, all the arrangements and services around the tabernacle are related to warfare.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>To be a priest is to be in the army.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>To be a Levite is to be in the army.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Even to be an ordinary citizen is to be in the army.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Hence, the move of the entire people of Israel in the wilderness was a military move.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>It was not the wandering of a nomadic tribe.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>These were not nomadic people.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>They were an organized and disciplined army.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>This is the reason that they were called the armies of Jehovah in the Old Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>On the way to the good land, they first defeated the Amalekites in a fierce battle.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>After leaving Mount Sinai, the people then fought battle after battle.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>While they were traveling, they were also fighting.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>This went on until they passed the Jordan River, completed the first war at Jericho, and marched into Canaan.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>From that time on, the Israelites never ceased to fight.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Their history is a history of warfare.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The book of Joshua records all the wars that went on in the conquest of Canaan.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The book of Judges is also about warfare.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Without warfare, how could they possess the promised land of God?</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Without the good land, how could God s temple be built, His city established, and His kingdom set up on earth?</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>This is the reason that the children of Israel waged war unceasingly from the time of Joshua.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>This went on until the time of David.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>David was a warrior.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>He was a warrior-king.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>He fought battles in the north and in the south, subduing all the enemies within the land and establishing peace.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>He left behind a land of peace for his son Solomon.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>At the same time, he prepared materials for the building of the temple, materials that he captured through his many battles.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Hence, David s warfare not only secured a foundation for the temple; it also secured all kinds of materials for its building as well.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>He left all these to his son Solomon.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>As soon as Solomon ascended to the throne, he ruled in peace.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>At that time the nation was rich, and the people lived in abundance.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>He ordered the work of building the temple to begin immediately, and in due time the temple was finished.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>However, Satan was not willing to be idle and allow the temple to be built.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>He stirred up the Egyptians to attack Jerusalem; the Assyrians and eventually the Babylonians were stirred up to destroy Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>These people captured and destroyed Jerusalem, destroyed the temple, and took the holy people away as captives.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>At that time, God s house was gone, His kingdom was gone, and His people were taken into captivity for seventy years.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>At the completion of the seventy years of captivity, God brought His people back once again.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>He brought them back for the purpose of rebuilding the temple and the city.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>During the first building of the temple, there did not seem to be much warfare, but during the rebuilding of the temple, Nehemiah 4:15-23 shows that the entire process was a warfare.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Verse 16 says, From that day half of my servants labored in the work, and half of them held the spears and the shields and the bows and the armor; and the rulers were behind all the house of Judah.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Half of the Israelites were working, and half of them were fighting.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>In addition verse 17 says, Those who built the wall and those who carried burdens took the loads with one hand doing the work and with the other holding a weapon.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Verse 21 says, So we labored in the work; and half of them held spears from the start of dawn until the stars came out.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>The second half of verse 23 says, Every one went with his weapon to the water ASV .</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Without warfare and without a spirit of fighting, there is no building.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>This matter is clearly revealed in the Old Testament.</S>
