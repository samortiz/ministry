<h2 class="head1">SPEAKING FOR THE LORD<br />
REQUIRING GRAVITY AND WEIGHTINESS</h2>
<p>When we exercise to speak for the Lord, we should avoid conducting ourselves lightly or frivolously. Once we are frivolous, we are worthless; thus, we must be solemn. One of the virtues of an elder is gravity, which refers to the weightiness of a person. Some among us, although they have an intelligent mind and strong comprehension, are too frivolous in their speaking. In contrast, often when saints in their sixties or seventies open their mouth, light shines forth. A person who constantly laughs and jokes gives people a light feeling. It is best if this kind of person does not stand up to speak for the Lord; otherwise, he sells himself cheaply. It may be acceptable, however, if he simply gives a testimony. Hence, if a person speaks for God and speaks God&rsquo;s word with a frivolous attitude, his speaking lacks significance; even if a saint is merely giving a testimony, he still should not be flippant. A Christian should be grave. To be grave means to be weighty. Weightiness is to be as steady and weighty as a precious stone, not light or easily tossed about like a feather in the air.</p>
<p>Gold, silver, and precious stones are weighty, whereas wood, grass, and stubble are light. Some people are at a disadvantage in that according to their natural disposition they give people a feeling of being frivolous. Their lightness causes them to lose the qualification to speak in the meetings. I have also seen the opposite situation. Some American young people, who are only fifteen or sixteen and have not yet graduated from high school, bear themselves in such a way that whenever they stand up in the meetings they give people a feeling of weightiness and gravity. People receive such an impression even before they open their mouths. In this regard, it is not proper for us to always be laughing and joking in the meetings. We should be free, released, fresh, and living in the meetings, yet we should not to be frivolous, casual, or reckless.</p>
<p>Our meetings should be high, yet they must also be weighty. This does not mean that we need to wear a long face all the time, as if someone has offended us. If we are always stiff and have a stern look when we speak in the meetings, people will be afraid. This also is not acceptable. We should smile, but we should also give people the feeling of weightiness when we smile. To speak according to this principle requires the proper exercise. The way we are according to our natural disposition, our old creation, must be terminated in the new creation. If we pursue in such a way, people will spontaneously respect us.</p>
<p>If we do not receive much spiritual training and education related to our speaking, our meetings will have an atmosphere of being &ldquo;rough.&rdquo; Our prayers and testimonies will give people a &ldquo;rough&rdquo; feeling. However, if we spend time in the Lord&rsquo;s word and pursue the spiritual life, after several months and years our condition will be completely different. The meetings in all the churches in Taiwan will be rich and sweet, because the level of spiritual education will have risen. In the past we had only the equivalent of an elementary school education or perhaps even no education at all. Now we not only have finished the equivalent of high school, but some who have made faster progress have already attained to the equivalent of a college education. By spending time in the Lord&rsquo;s Word and pursuing the spiritual life, a high level will spontaneously be expressed in our meetings, prayer, singing, and speaking without any special effort on our part.</p>
<h2 class="head1">LEADING THE CHURCH TO EXERCISE AND PRACTICE</h2>
<p>In the past, we did not have much heart to learn; we simply went to the meetings faithfully. We did not care who called hymns in the meetings, we sang casually, and it did not matter to us whether we sang at all. This was our condition in the meetings. Some time ago, I saw several people talking in a meeting; this was a big distraction. While the brothers were giving reports on different districts, conversations were going on in the audience. This was truly disturbing. This is against the regulation of the training and is impolite; it not only offends man but also offends the Holy Spirit. When everyone is paying their full attention to the meeting, allowing the Holy Spirit to speak to us, how could some talk among themselves? This is not proper. All the leading ones should pay attention to this matter in the meetings. It does not matter what kind of meeting or training we are conducting, we must pay attention to the weightiness and cannot be loose; otherwise, everything will be in vain, no matter how great our capability or how high our skill.</p>
<p>It is definitely not an easy or light matter for an elder to take the lead in a church. A brother is not capable of taking the lead simply because he has such a desire. As an elder, a brother cannot be late to the meetings; this is to take the lead. In one of the district meetings I noticed that most of the brothers and sisters were at the meeting before the elders arrived. This is to have no leading. When there is no leading, the meetings drag on. If the elders are three minutes late, others will be five minutes late, and some will even be ten minutes late; as a result, a meeting scheduled to begin at 9:30 A.M. will not be fully attended until 10:15 A.M. This shows a lack and unfaithfulness in leading.</p>
<p>If the president were to visit us, would we arrive late? I believe that we would all arrive early. If this is the case, we must consider the Lord Jesus to be inferior to the president. Since we are meeting with the Lord Jesus, how can we be late? All the leading ones must see the significance of taking the lead in the church. To take the lead in the church is to build up the saints day by day and little by little until a model is eventually established and a pattern is set before them. This is to take the lead. If the elders do not take the lead in small matters, it will be difficult for them to take the lead in big matters. Even in regard to the hymnals used in our meetings, there should be a proper arrangement; they should be kept properly, not in a manner that is disorderly. Likewise, waste paper should not be thrown away carelessly but should be disposed of properly. These are examples of taking the lead.</p>
<p>Today the new way is open to all of us and should be borne by all of us. If we do not bear the responsibility to carry out the new way, it will become an empty way, and we will not be able to proceed. Since we all need to bear the responsibility, everyone should be responsible to learn whatever he needs to learn and to exercise accordingly; in this way we will definitely succeed.</p>
<p>Our ground is accurate, and our way is straight. No matter how much opposition there is from people in Christianity, at least they understand in their heart that our ground and way are irreproachable and that our truth is rich. The Lord has brought us further to see this new way in the Bible; this is a great recovery. Our endeavor has a definite way. We have the ground, the way, the truth, and the goal; in other words, we are serving with a just cause. We will surely win a swift victory.</p>
<p>In regard to the matter of prophesying, if we rise up to pursue the truth, within three years more people will be speaking in the meetings, and every meeting will be enriched. We will become an &ldquo;educated&rdquo; spiritual family. Our meetings will be filled with spiritual learning because everyone learns and everyone teaches one another mutually; moreover, as everyone speaks, the riches will spontaneously flow out.</p>
<p>Some brothers and sisters have told me that although my messages are good, they are often repetitious. However, one sister has discovered the secret. She explained, saying, &ldquo;Do not overlook this kind of repetition. These messages are repeated over and over again because a few do not understand. This repetition is for them.&rdquo; This explanation is accurate. When we release a message, we do not fulfill our duty simply by speaking it; rather, our hope is that everyone who listens will be able to understand it. When I speak from the podium, I can clearly tell that some do not understand what I have spoken. At the same time, I am also aware that the message I have released contains some profound truths. Such a profound message cannot be understood simply by listening to it three or five times; it may require us to hear it eight or ten times in order to adequately apprehend it. Moreover, there is a sequence to my repetitions. I do not repeat myself exactly. The first time I may speak from one angle, and the second time, from another angle. I always try to speak from different angles so that the listeners will be able to understand. However, I also realize that even after this kind of repetition, some may still not understand or know how to enter into what I have spoken; this is the reason that we need to release some messages again and again.</p>
