ENDEAVORING IN THE CHILDREN&rsquo;S WORK</h2>
<p>Whether or not we succeed in the children&rsquo;s work depends partly on the teaching material and partly on the brothers and sisters who take the lead. The responsible brothers and the co-workers in every place must see the importance of the children&rsquo;s work in God&rsquo;s family. How can a family not take care of its children? This should be a great matter to us. No family will disregard its children; as a priority a family looks after its children, raises them, and teaches them. Hence, we must serve the many children in God&rsquo;s family.</p>
<p>From this time onward, the co-workers should give more thought to the way they lead people to know the Lord. They must pay attention to the sisters and the children. The co-workers should not say that they are not gifted for these two aspects of the work and therefore cannot do the work. If they cannot do it, they must learn how to do it; they should always learn. The co-workers do not need to be personally involved in doing the children&rsquo;s work. They can meet with the leading sisters in a locality and entrust the burden for the children&rsquo;s work to them, and they can encourage them. They must lead the church to receive a burden for the children&rsquo;s work. The church should concentrate its effort on this work.</p>
<p>The leading sisters in the churches must receive a burden for the children&rsquo;s work. Under the arrangement of the church and the leading of the elders, they should concentrate on the children&rsquo;s work and lead all the sisters to participate. The elders are too busy to take care of the details. Instead of waiting for the elders, the sisters should pray much and make plans. They can then present their plans for the children&rsquo;s work to the elders for their approval. This is just like a family in which the husband is busy with his job and cannot plan the details for the household. The wife can make plans and carry things out with the consent of the husband. In this way the wife does not do anything independently and will still be able to take care of the details of the household in a timely way. (<em>The Collected Works of Witness Lee, 1967,</em> vol. 1, pp. 313-314)</p>

<p>During these years, among a few churches, often I have emphatically charged the brothers and sisters that they must take care of the young people...The reason I purposely encourage young people is that I clearly realize one thing: if a church cannot raise up the young people, this church has no future...The church needs the second generation. The future of the church hinges on the young people. (<em>The Elders&rsquo; Management of the Church,</em> pp. 108-109)</p>

<p>The future of the Lord&rsquo;s recovery is very promising. At present, in the United States there are at least seven thousand seeking saints in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery. Over the next ten years, many of our children will become members of the church. When some of them are in their twenties, they will be quite useful to the Lord. Brother Nee, for example, was raised up by the Lord when he was only nineteen. (<em>Life-study of 1 Peter,</em> p. 285)</p>
<h2 class="head1">SEEING THE PRECIOUSNESS<br />
OF THE YOUNG PEOPLE</h2>
<p>In whatever a person does, the most important thing is to have a heart. Without a heart, a person will not want to do anything, and even if he does something, he will not be enthusiastic in doing it. Of course, this is also true with the young people&rsquo;s work. If you want to do this work, you must like the young people, care for them, and be concerned about their affairs. This may be considered the minimum &ldquo;capital&rdquo; required for the young people&rsquo;s work. If you have no interest in the young people and have no heart for them, doing the young people&rsquo;s work only out of reluctance, then it is useless.</p>
<p>Sometimes our heart may arise from our preference. When we like something, naturally we will have a heart to do it. Sometimes the heart we have may come from our knowledge. When we see the importance and value of a certain matter, we will spontaneously have a heart for it. According to my observation of the real situation among us concerning the young people&rsquo;s work, I see that some brothers and sisters are doing it out of their preference. Because they are naturally inclined to the young people and they enjoy contacting the young people, they come to do the young people&rsquo;s work. We cannot say that this is wrong. We have to admit that no matter how much grace we have received and how great the spirituality we possess, we are still human&mdash;we still have the part that is human. But here we have to say that it is not weighty enough to do the young people&rsquo;s work with such a heart. If we truly want to do the young people&rsquo;s work, and do it in a weighty manner, we must let God open our eyes to see the preciousness of the young people and their importance in God&rsquo;s hands. If we see this, we will appreciate this work, and spontaneously we will have a heart within us for it.</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_015.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_017.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Raising Up the Next Generation for the Church Life &nbsp; pg 16</div><br></body></html>
