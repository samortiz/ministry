   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>However, the believer should not lower God's purpose and his own expectation.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>It is possible for the believer to sin, but he must not sin.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The Lord Jesus has died for us and has crucified our flesh with Him on the cross, and the Holy Spirit has indwelt us in order to manifest in us the reality of what the Lord Jesus has accomplished.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>We have the absolute possibility of not being under the control of the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Its existence is to call us to be watchful but not to make us surrender.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The cross has completely crucified the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>If we are now willing to put to death the practices of our body by the Holy Spirit, we will experience the accomplishment of the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>"So then, brothers, we are debtors not to the flesh to live according to the flesh; for if you live according to the flesh, you must die, but if by the Spirit you put to death the practices of the body, you will live" Rom 8:12-13 .</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Since God has such grace and such a way of salvation, if we make the mistake of still living according to the flesh, it our responsibility.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Since we have such a salvation, it is no longer as though we are debtors to the flesh and are obliged to pay it.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Now we do not have to.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>If we still live according to the flesh, it is because we want to, not because we ought to.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Among many matured saints, there is a long period of complete victory.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The flesh exists, but its effect amounts to zero.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Its life, nature, and activity have been put to death by the believers with the Lord's death through the Holy Spirit so that the flesh is in the position of existing yet as if not existing.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Because the work of putting to death is so deep and so real and because the believer is so faithful in following the Holy Spirit in a lasting way, the flesh, although it exists, is made powerless to resist, and it even seems difficult to have it come again to excite the believer.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Such a complete victory over the flesh is attainable to every believer.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Now here is a warning: "For if you live according to the flesh, you must die, but if by the Spirit you put to death the practices of the body, you will live."</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Because salvation is complete, there is no excuse for rejecting this salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>All that matters here hinges on the two "ifs."</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>God, on His side, can no longer do anything; He has accomplished all.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Now it is only up to man, on his side, how he will deal with God's work.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Although you have been regenerated, "if you live according to the flesh, you must die."</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>You will lose your spiritual life; you will be living yet will be as dead.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>"If by the Spirit" you live, you also must die, but die in the death of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>If by the death of Christ you put to death all the practices of the flesh, that is real death.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>However, if you do not die in this way, you will die the other way.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Either way, you must die.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Which death, then, do you want?</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>When the flesh lives, the Holy Spirit in reality cannot live.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Which one, then, do you want to live?</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>What God has arranged for you is to put all the ability and activity of your flesh under the power of the death of the Lord Jesus' cross.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>What you are lacking now is nothing but death.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>You should talk less about life and talk first about death, because if there is no death, there is no resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Are you willing to obey the will of God?</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Are you willing to let the cross of Christ be experiential in your life?</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>If so, you should, through the Holy Spirit, put to death all the practices of the body.</S>
