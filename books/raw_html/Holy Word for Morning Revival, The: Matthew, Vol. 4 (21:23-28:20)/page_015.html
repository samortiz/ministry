On the Mount of Olives, the disciples came to the Lord privately, saying, “When will these things be?” The disciples’ question concerned three matters: (1) the time when “these things” (Matt. 24:3) would take place, including not only the destruction of the temple (v. 2) but also the things mentioned in 23:32-39; (2) the sign of Christ’s coming; and (3) the sign of the consummation of the age. The Lord’s word from 24:4—25:46 answered the disciples’ question concerning these three matters.</p><p>The Lord’s answer has three sections: the first section (vv. 4-31) concerns the Jews, who are the chosen; the second (v. 32—25:30) concerns the church; and the third (25:31-46) concerns the Gentiles (the nations). The first section, concerning the Jews, should be interpreted literally, whereas the second section, concerning the church, should be interpreted spiritually, because it is spoken in parables for the reason given in 13:11-13. The third section, concerning the Gentiles, also should be interpreted literally.</p><p>In Matthew 24:4-14 we see the actual history concerning the Jews from Christ’s ascension until the end of this age, the three and a half years of the great tribulation. Before the great tribulation comes, everything in these verses will transpire. The last item will be the preaching of the gospel of the kingdom. The gospel of the kingdom, which includes the gospel of grace (Acts 20:24), brings people not only into God’s salvation but also into the kingdom of the heavens (Rev. 1:9). This gospel of the kingdom will be preached in the whole earth for a testimony to all the nations before the end of this age.</p><p>The prophecy in Matthew 24:15-31, concerning the remnant of the Jews, definitely will be fulfilled in the last three and a half years of this age, the time of the great tribulation, the second half of the last week prophesied in Daniel 9:27, which will begin with the setting up of Antichrist’s image (the idol) in the temple (Matt. 24:15) and will end with Christ’s open coming (v. 30).</p><p>The second coming of Christ has two aspects: one is the secret aspect, related to His watchful believers; the other is the open aspect, related to the unbelieving Jews and Gentiles. The lightning (v. 27) signifies the open aspect, which will take place after the great tribulation (vv. 29-30), whereas the thief’s coming in verse 43 signifies the secret aspect, which will occur before the great tribulation.</p><p>Matthew 24:32—25:30 is concerned with the church. In chapter twenty-four watchfulness and readiness are covered in verses 32 through 44, and faithfulness and prudence in verses 45 through 51. All of this is related to us. We need to watch and be ready for the Lord’s coming back so that we may be raptured early. We also need to be faithful and prudent in serving the Lord so that we may receive the reward. Thus, watchfulness is for the early rapture, and faithfulness is for reward.</p><p>Composition for prophecy with main point and sub-points:</p>
