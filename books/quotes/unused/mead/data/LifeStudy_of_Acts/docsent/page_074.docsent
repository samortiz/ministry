   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>LIFE-STUDY OF ACTS MESSAGE TWENTY-SIX THE CONVERSION OF SAUL 2 Scripture Reading: Acts 9:1-19</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In this message we shall continue to consider the conversion of Saul 9:1-19 .</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>PRAYING FOR THREE DAYS</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>As Saul drew near to Damascus, suddenly a light from heaven shone around him; and he fell on the ground and heard a voice saying to him, Saul, Saul, why are you persecuting Me? vv.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>3-4 .</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>After he rose from the ground, he saw nothing, even though his eyes were opened v. 8 . For three days Saul was not able to see.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The Lord not only took away his sight; He also dealt with Saul s clever mind.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>We have seen that Saul was learned in Hebrew religion, Greek culture, and Roman politics.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>He was trained in the three basic elements of Western culture.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>In taking away Saul s sight, the Lord Jesus wanted Saul to think about Him.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Acts 9:9 says that Saul was three days without seeing, and neither ate nor drank.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>What did he do during those three days?</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The answer to this question is found in the Lord s word to Ananias recorded in verse 11: Rise up and go to the lane called Straight, and seek in the house of Judas a man from Tarsus named Saul; for behold, he is praying.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Here we see that in those three days Saul was praying.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>He did not see anything, and he did not eat or drink anything.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>All he could do was pray.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>I believe that as Saul prayed he tried to analyze Jesus, seeking to know who He is.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Saul may have said to himself, I know that Jesus was buried, yet He spoke to me from heaven.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>How can this be?</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Jesus said that I was persecuting Him.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>How could He have been among those I persecuted?</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>For three days Paul must have prayed about matters such as these.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>RECEIVING THE FULL MESSAGE OF THE GOSPEL</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>It is likely that as Saul was praying, vision after vision and revelation after revelation came to him concerning Christ and the church.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>His experience during those days may have been one of watching a heavenly television in which he saw many things concerning the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>As he saw these things, Saul may have said, Jesus the Nazarene is Jehovah.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>He is my Savior.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>No wonder that His followers testified strongly that He was resurrected.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>He surely has been resurrected, for He appeared to me from the heavens.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Saul may have gone on to consider the Lord s ascension, which implies His incarnation, human living, death, and resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Saul may have come to realize that as the One who is now in the heavens, the Lord passed through the process of incarnation, human living, death, resurrection, and ascension.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>We need to be impressed with the fact that for three days Saul did not eat or drink.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>All he did was pray.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>While he was praying, the revelation concerning Christ was televised into his being.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Saul beheld a wonderful view of the Lord on this heavenly television.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>No longer did Saul have any doubt concerning Christ s resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>He also came to believe in His incarnation and death.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Through the visions that he saw during those days, Saul received the full message of the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>JESUS AND THE CORPORATE ME</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Saul not only saw that Jesus is Jehovah, the Savior, who died and was resurrected; he also saw that the Lord Jesus is one with His followers.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Perhaps Saul said to himself, I did not persecute Jesus I persecuted His followers.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>But He told me that I persecuted Him.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>This must mean that He is one with His followers.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>In this way Saul came to see the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>He heard a message not only concerning Christ s salvation, but also concerning the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>When the Lord appeared to Saul, He asked him, Why are you persecuting Me?</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The Lord seemed to be saying, Saul, this Me includes Me personally and My Body corporately.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Personally I am in the heavens, but corporately the Body is on earth.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>When you persecuted My followers, you persecuted My Body.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>To persecute My Body is to persecute Me. Therefore, the Me in 9:4 is corporate, comprising the Lord Jesus and all His believers.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>According to 9:5, Saul said, Who are You, Lord?</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>And He said, I am Jesus, whom you are persecuting.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>The Me in verse 4 and the name Jesus in verse 5 are of great significance, and Paul must have considered much concerning Jesus and this corporate Me. During those three days he might have analyzed the two words Me and Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>When Paul said, Who are You, Lord? he must have gotten saved and received the essential Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Later, in the book of Romans, he said, Whoever calls upon the name of the Lord shall be saved Rom 10:13 .</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>In Acts 9:5 Saul called Jesus Lord even without knowing Him.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>No doubt, Saul was shocked by the Lord s appearing and speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>At that time the essential Spirit should have entered into his being.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Then he was able to pray for three days without eating and drinking.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Under the inspiration of the essential Spirit, his only interest was to pray in order to know the significance of what he had seen and heard.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>During those days, Paul received the full gospel concerning salvation and the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Saul s experience of the corporate Me, Christ and the Body, must have made a deep impression on him and affected his future ministry regarding Christ and the church.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>That experience laid the foundation for his ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Therefore, he was very strong in teaching the Body of Christ Rom 12:4-5; 1 Cor 12:12-27; Eph 1:22-23; 2:16; 4:4, 16 .</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>He is the only writer in the New Testament to use the term the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>He placed great emphasis on the Body because at the time of his conversion he heard a message concerning the corporate Me, a message concerning the Body of Christ.</S>
