<h1 class="msg">CHAPTER THREE</h1>
<h1 class="title">CHRIST AS THE LIFE AND PERSON OF THE CHURCH</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Eph. 1:23; 2:15-16, 18, 21-22; 3:2, 8-11, 16-17a, 19b; 4:3-4a, 11-16, 23-24</h1>
<p>Ephesians is a book that is familiar to many of us. In the past years I have given many messages on the verses listed in the Scripture Reading. We may wonder why we are coming back to these verses again. It is because these verses are the most profound words of God expressed in great terms. Can you explain the fullness of Christ, the fullness of God, the stewardship of the grace of God, the economy of the mystery, or what it means for Christ to make His home in our hearts? These are all great terms with a profound meaning. We have to spend more time on these verses in order to see how the Lord is going to fulfill His prophecy regarding the building up of the church.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE CHURCH BEING<br />
THE BODY OF CHRIST AND THE NEW MAN</h2>
<p>In these verses we are first told that the church is the Body of Christ and the new man in God&rsquo;s new creation (1:22-23; 2:15). We all have to know these two big terms&mdash;<em>the Body of Christ</em> and <em>the new man.</em> Some would say that the Body of Christ is just an illustration or a symbol. But we need to see that Christ&rsquo;s Body is a reality. Christ needs a Body just as we do. Our body is not a symbol but a reality.</p>
<p>Christ is a great person. He fills all in all. It is hard to say what <em>all in all</em> means. I have been considering these three words for years. To say that Christ fills all in all shows how vast He is. He is so great and so vast that He fills the whole universe. According to our human consideration, the distance from the earth to the moon is great, but that distance is just a little part of the solar system. Millions of solar systems are needed to form a galaxy, and countless galaxies constitute the universe. As the One who fills all in all, Christ fills the entire universe. Christ fills not only our little heart. Thank Him that He does fill our heart, but our heart is still so small. He fills all in all. <em>All</em> includes all the solar systems and all the galaxies.</p>
<p>This great, vast, and unlimited Christ, as such a person, needs a great Body to be His fullness for His complete expression. His small physical body was too limited. But after His resurrection and through His resurrection, He gained a mystical Body, and this mystical Body is universally vast. It is not a symbol; it is a Body! It is His Body, and this Body has many members. We are the members of this Body (Rom. 12:4-5). If the Body of Christ were just a symbol, then we would be the members of a symbol. That would mean nothing. The Body of Christ, however, is not a symbol. It is a living Body, and we are living members of this living Body.</p>
<p>The church is not only the Body of Christ but also a new person, the new man. As the Body, the church needs life. If there is no life in your body, it becomes a carcass, a corpse. The church as the Body is living because the church has life. As the new man the church needs not only the life but also a person. A man needs a person. The plants are living, but they need only life. They do not need a person, because they are not human beings. But the church is a great living being as the new man, so the church needs a person. The church as the Body of Christ has Christ as its life, and the church as the new man has Christ as its person. We all have to take Christ as our life and as our person. The church is not an organization but the living Body of Christ, having Christ as its life, and the new man, having Christ as its person.</p>
<p>A tree has life, but that life does not have any preferences, thoughts, and desires. The tree would never say, &ldquo;Be merciful to me. Today&rsquo;s weather is too cold. I need more clothing.&rdquo; A real, living person, on the other hand, has a very sensitive personality. We have our preferences, thoughts, and desires. When someone is unhappy with us, we know it because we are living persons. The church as the new man has Christ as the most wonderful person.</p>
<h2 class="head1">HOW CHRIST CAN BECOME OUR LIFE AND OUR PERSON</h2>
<p>Now we need to consider how Christ can become our life and our person. When I was young, I found out that Christ died on the cross for my sins. That was quite logical. He stood in my position and was put to death instead of me, so He died for me. Later, I came to know that Christ is my life. But I could never figure out how Christ could be my life. First, I asked, &ldquo;Where is Christ?&rdquo; I said to myself, &ldquo;How could the One in the third heavens, far away from me, be my life?&rdquo;</p>
