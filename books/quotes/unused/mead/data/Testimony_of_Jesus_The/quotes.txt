[1]  Being One in the Triune God for the Glorification of the Son and the Father
[2]  AS THE TESTIMONY OF JESUS Scripture Reading: Matt 16:18; Acts 4:11; Rev 1:1-2, 9-13, 20; 19:7; 21:2, 10
[3]  The Bible contains three great matters: God s creation, God s redemption, and God s building.
[4]  Concerning God s building, the New Testament contains the ministries of Peter, Paul, and John.
[5]  When Peter recognized that the Lord was the Christ, the Son of the living God, Jesus immediately said, I also say to you that you are Peter, and upon this rock I will build My church.
[6]  Soon after the day of Pentecost, Peter preached that Christ was not only the Savior but also the cornerstone for God s building Acts 4:11 .
[7]  When Peter said, You are the Christ, the Lord Jesus told him that he was a stone, and that He would build His church.
[8]  The building of the church began with Peter s ministry, and it ended with Paul s. Why then do we need John s ministry? It is because after Paul s time the building was damaged.
[9]  Revelation 1:1 begins, The revelation of Jesus Christ which God gave to Him to show to His slaves the things that must quickly take place; and He made it known by signs, sending it by His angel to His slave John.
[10]  A church yet to come cannot show Jesus to people, and a church in the heavens may show Jesus to the angels, but it cannot show Jesus to people on the earth.
[11]  Where is there a church today that truly bears the testimony of Jesus?
[12]  Today the Lord Jesus is seeking some people who will be for Him, some who will be bold and willing to say, Lord Jesus, I do not care merely for my salvation from the lake of fire.
[13]  Many of us can testify that before we came into the churches, we knew of Jesus, but we did not see much of Him.
[14]  In the churches we not only know of Jesus or hear of Him, but we see Him and meet with Him.
[15]  To some extent, those places are good for people to be saved, but we cannot honestly say that they are good for the Lord Jesus to build His church.
[16]  OF THE SON AND THE FATHER Scripture Reading: John 17:1, 21-23; Rev 1:11-12; Eph 4:13
[17]  The proper church, as the testimony of Jesus, testifies that Jesus is unique.
[18]  In our home, in our locality, in our country, and in the universe there is only one Jesus.
[19]  A bridegroom and a bride are a figure, a picture, showing that in the entire universe, according to God s economy, there is only one Christ and one church.
[20]  Verse 21 says, That they all may be one; even as You, Father, are in Me and I in You, that they also may be in Us; that the world may believe that You have sent Me. The genuine oneness is the oneness in the Triune God the Father in the Son and the Son in the Father according to Their divine life and nature.
[21]  Without believing in the Lord Jesus, we will perish, but by our believing in the Lord Jesus, our sins are forgiven and we have a new birth with the divine life; that is, we are regenerated.
[22]  Someone else may believe that the Lord Jesus is the Son of God, but that we are not saved by believing in Him; it is likely that such a person is also not saved.
[23]  If someone simply believes that the Holy Bible is the divine Word; that God is unique and triune; that the Lord Jesus as the Son of God became man, died on the cross for our sins, resurrected from the dead to be our Savior, and is in the heavens and within us; that if we believe in Him, our sins are forgiven and we have eternal life; and that we all need to come together as the church, then we should not make an issue of his beliefs about the rapture, foot-washing, or head covering.
[24]  John 17:22 says, The glory which You have given Me I have given to them, that they may be one, even as We are one.
[25]  As we have pointed out, glory is the expression of God.
[26]  Jesus seemed to be saying, Father, You have given Me the life, the right, and the position to be Your Son in order to express You.
[27]  CHAPTER THREE COMING OUT OF RELIGION TO BUILD UP
[28]  THE TESTIMONY OF JESUS Scripture Reading: Rev 1:1a; 12:1; 14:1, 4, 14-16; 19:7; 21:18-21; 2:9; 3:9; 2:20; 17:1-6; 2:13-14; 3:20; 18:4; Acts 2:40; Rom 11:3-4
[29]  We thank God for the book of Revelation, the last book of the New Testament and the concluding book of the entire Bible.
[30]  We all need to know what age we are in, what the present revelation is from God, where we should be, what we should do, and what flow we should enter into.
[31]  Time is short, and the day of the Lord s second coming is approaching.
[32]  In Matthew 16:16, Peter recognized the Lord Jesus as the Son of God, and the Lord Jesus praised him for that.
[33]  THE WAY OF THE LORD S RECOVERY TODAY The Lord Reserving a Remnant for Himself
[34]  Today there are millions of genuine Christians here, saved, washed with the blood, and regenerated in their spirit.
[35]  The church life is the recovery of the testimony of Jesus, which is the testimony that the Lord Jesus lived as a human being on this earth, not by Himself but by His Father.
[36]  FROM THE RELIGIOUS AGE Scripture Reading: John 15:19; Acts 2:40; Gal 1:4; 6:13-15; Phil 2:12-16
[37]  According to the revelation of the Gospels, the Lord Jesus was born not into a Gentile world but into a religious world.
[38]  His mother Mary was in the Jewish religion, He was raised near the center of that religion, and when He came out to minister, almost everyone He met was a member of that religion.
[39]  Because of this, while the Lord Jesus was on this earth, He had two categories of disciples.
[40]  The other category was those who believed in Him but remained in that religion, such as Nicodemus, an honest, faithful disciple of Jesus who did not follow Him out of the camp John 3:1; 7:50-52 .
[41]  The old prophetess Anna was also for the Lord Jesus, but she probably did not follow the Lord to leave the temple Luke 2:36-37 .
[42]  God has a purpose, but Satan is subtle, creeping in to utilize and usurp what God has done.
[43]  Then in the New Testament time, God used the church to fulfill His purpose, but the subtle one crept in again to utilize and usurp the New Testament, forming a Christian religion to hold back Christians from fulfilling God s purpose.
[44]  This shows that not only is it impossible to fulfill God s eternal purpose in religion, but religion is the top frustration to God s purpose, whether it is the Jewish religion or Christianity.
[45]  Religion is a system that teaches people to worship God and behave in a good way in order to please God, apart from Christ.
[46]  This is why the Lord Jesus tells us in Revelation 2 and 3 that we do not need the teachings, doctrines, regulations, rituals, and rites of degraded religion.
[47]  The significance of the Lord s table is that in our remembrance of the Lord we declare that we live and have our daily life by eating and drinking Jesus, who is our life and life supply.
[48]  AS THE GOLDEN LAMPSTANDS Scripture Reading: Rev 1:1-5, 9-13; 12:17; 19:10; 3:14; Exo 25:31-32, 37 THE BOOK OF REVELATION BEING
[49]  However, throughout these years the time was not right to minister fully concerning the testimony of Jesus.
[50]  I have spent much time to obtain the proper understanding of the testimony of Jesus, and for many years this was a mystery to me.
[51]  However, there is a man in this universe, who was even on the earth, by the name of Jesus, who was and still is the testimony of God.
[52]  What God is, is fully expressed in Jesus, and what Christ is must be fully expressed in the church.
[53]  However, the testimony of Jesus is not simply one piece of gold.
[54]  If we are not in the church, we are not the testimony of Jesus, regardless of how golden we are.
[55]  Someone may be more golden than others, but if he is not in the proper church life as a built-in part of the church, he is not in the testimony of Jesus.
[56]  We may love the Lord, be for the Lord, be spiritual, and know the Bible more than others, but if we are not the golden lampstands, we are not the testimony of Jesus.
[57]  Rather, we are saved for the church, we love the Lord for the church, we preach the gospel and win souls for the church, and we seek spirituality for the church.
[58]  What the Lord Jesus wants today is the testimony of Jesus, which is the local churches as the pure golden lampstands, the proper, recovered church life.
[59]  According to this goal, man was made in the image of God in order to be His testimony Gen 1:26 .
[60]  In the first chapter of the Bible, man is in the image of God to express God, and in the last two chapters of the Bible there is a building, the New Jerusalem, to express God.
[61]  From the first page through the last, the Bible as the Word of God is always consistent concerning the one God, one tabernacle, one temple, one Christ, one church, one local church in each locality, and one New Jerusalem.
[62]  To be the genuine testimony of Jesus will cost us everything.
[63]  Can we say that we are the testimony of Jesus?
[64]  If we were the testimony of Jesus, we would not be able to be worldly, and we would not be able to argue much with our husband or wife.
[65]  To not quarrel, in itself, does not constitute us to be the testimony of Jesus, but anyone who is a part of the testimony of Jesus cannot remain in a quarrel with his wife.
[66]  We must all realize that on the earth today there are four negative items: Judaism, Catholicism, Protestantism, and worldliness.
[67]  If this is my work, your work, or the work of a movement called the local churches, we can reject it without opposing the Lord Jesus, but if this is the Lord s governmental move, His economical administration, we must be careful.
[68]  BY THE ENJOYMENT OF CHRIST IN OUR SPIRIT Scripture Reading: Rev 2:7, 17; 3:12-13, 20-22; 12:1-5, 10-11, 17; Phil 2:12-13, 15-16a
[69]  The church as the testimony of Jesus is a testimony against this evil generation.
[70]  God s eternal purpose is to have a corporate expression of Himself.
[71]  However, man failed God in this matter, but the Lord Jesus came as the second man 1 Cor 15:45, 47 , who was successful in expressing God.
[72]  Therefore, Jesus is the testimony of God, signified by the golden lampstand in Exodus 25:31-40.
[73]  When man s nature was changed into that of a crooked and perverted generation, God s judgment came in. Under this judgment, God revealed to Noah the way for him to be saved out of that perverted generation, instructing him to build an ark, which would save him through water not only from God s judgment on the earth but also out of that perverted generation Gen 6:11-14; 1 Pet 3:20 . The water of the flood executed God s judgment upon the entire world, and it also separated Noah from the crooked and perverted generation.
[74]  On the day of Pentecost Peter condemned the Jews, saying, This man, delivered up by the determined counsel and foreknowledge of God, you, through the hands of lawless men, nailed to a cross and killed; whom God has raised up...Let all the house of Israel know assuredly that God has made Him both Lord and Christ, this Jesus whom you have crucified This word pricked their heart, and they asked, What should we do, brothers?
[75]  Then all these saved ones remained together, loving one another, and they became the church, the testimony of Jesus against the crooked generation.
[76]  Christ Being the Life-giving Spirit in Our Spirit
[77]  They do not agree that Christ is the life-giving Spirit, that we need to exercise our spirit by calling on the name of the Lord, or that we are mingled with God by eating Jesus.
[78]  However, they do not know Christ as the life-giving Spirit 1 Cor 15:45b; 2 Cor 3:17 , they do not know that Christ is now with our spirit Gal 6:18; 2 Tim 4:22 , and they do not know how to turn to their spirit and exercise their spirit to contact the Lord and enjoy Him by saying, O Lord Jesus Rom 10:12-13; 1 Cor 12:3 .
[79]  We only know to eat Jesus, and we have the assurance that the way to eat Jesus is to call on Him, saying, O Lord Jesus, Amen, Hallelujah!
[80]  Then verse 12 of chapter 3 says, He who overcomes, him I will make a pillar in the temple of My God, and he shall by no means go out anymore, and I will write upon him the name of My God and the name of the city of My God, the New Jerusalem, which descends out of heaven from My God, and My new name.
[81]  Eating Jesus, being transformed, and being built up is our experience in the local churches, and this is the testimony of Jesus against the nations, the denominations, and the crooked, perverted generation.
[82]  The purpose of God s salvation is not only that man be saved but also that he would be a testimony of God.
[83]  The Bible records that all the saved ones throughout the ages were not only for their salvation but for God s testimony.
[84]  Even more, it was, on the negative side, to save him out of that degraded, perverted generation, and, on the positive side, to usher him into a new age in order to carry out God s eternal plan, His testimony, on the earth.
[85]  Many at Noah s time may have been saved from eternal perdition, but only eight were rescued from their generation and put into the ark.
[86]  The church is the place where we can be saved from today s generation.
[87]  The New Testament tells us that after the Lord s resurrection, He showed Himself to five hundred brothers at one time, but on the day of Pentecost only one hundred twenty were meeting together 1 Cor 15:6; Acts 1:15 .
[88]  I realize that this religion put Jesus to death, but I myself believe in Jesus, I love Him, and I am for Him.
[89]  Apparently not many today love the Lord absolutely, but in actuality the Lord has reserved a certain number for His church life who are building the ark to be saved from today s generation, to save others also, and to have the church life.
[90]  Some people question us as to what we mean when we speak of the church, asking, Do you mean that only you are the church?
[91]  The Lord appeared after His resurrection to five hundred brothers at one time, but only one hundred twenty were in the practical church life.
[92]  We should not think that as long as we are Christians, we are in the church.
[93]  Yes, we are the church in our locality, but we take the way to fellowship and be one with all the churches; however, others are the local church in the way of cutting themselves off from the flow of the Lord s testimony today.
[94]  If we were born and lived in Noah s age, we would have needed to follow Noah, because he had God s revelation.
[95]  I strongly declare that when I was with Brother Watchman Nee, I respected him not because he was good but because he was the unique means of God s revelation in that time.
[96]  This ministry has only one burden, which is to build today s ark, not only to save the saints from God s eternal judgment but also to save them from the crooked and perverted generation of today so that they may express God in a corporate way, be ushered into the coming kingdom, and exercise His authority in the kingship.
[97]  CHAPTER NINE EIGHT ASPECTS OF THE TESTIMONY OF JESUS Scripture Reading: Rev 1:11-13, 20; 7:9-17; 12:1-2, 5-6, 9-11; 14:1-5, 14-16; 15:2-4; 19:7-10, 14-20; 17:14; 21:11, 18-19; 4:3a; 14:8; 17:1-5; 18:2a, 4; 19:1-6 THE SHINING GOLDEN LAMPSTANDS
[98]  The book of Revelation reveals eight aspects of the church as the testimony of Jesus.
[99]  Everything in the church as the testimony of Jesus must be in the divine nature.
[100]  Following this, chapter 12 reveals the third aspect of the testimony of Jesus.
[101]  Here the figure is not a lampstand but a wonderful, universal, heavenly woman vv.
[102]  The fourth aspect of the church as the testimony of Jesus is that it is God s farm to grow the divine crop.
[103]  This tells us that in the church life we all need to grow.
[104]  The church as the testimony of Jesus is composed of a group of saints who have been saved through water, just as Noah was saved from his evil generation through the water that flooded the earth Gen 6:11-14a and as the Israelites were saved through the water of the Red Sea not only from God s judgment but also from the evil power of Pharaoh Exo 14:22, 29 .
[105]  The sixth aspect is in chapter 19, where we see the bride prepared for a wedding by being clothed with fine linen, bright and clean vv.
[106]  Today as the testimony of Jesus the church must be clothed with fine linen, being righteous, bright, pure, clean, clear, and without mixture, spot, or any such thing Eph 5:26-27 .
[107]  Revelation 1:2 speaks of the word of God and the testimony of Jesus.
[108]  For many years I have considered this term the testimony of Jesus.
[109]  When I was young, I was taught that if we have good behavior, we will present the testimony of Jesus to people.
[110]  THE PRACTICAL WAY TO BE THE TESTIMONY OF JESUS
[111]  The church is a corporate expression of God in Christ.
[112]  In the seven epistles that the Lord spoke to the seven churches, we can find some secrets of how we can be the expression of God.
[113]  The church is the transformed humanity who loves Christ, eats Christ, enjoys Christ, and is transformed by the holy, divine element of Christ into something solid a white stone for God s building.
[114]  In the seven epistles to the churches, there are also negative matters.
[115]  On the one hand, the churches as the lampstands of Christ are the testimony of Jesus.
[116]  On the other hand, God s enemy never sleeps.
[117]  In the previous chapter we saw that Judaism is satanic, Catholicism is demonic, Protestantism is dead and Christless, and the world is devilish.
[118]  It was the Lord Jesus who pointed out these diabolic matters in His seven epistles to the churches in Revelation 2 and 3, and we are simply His small followers.
[119]  According to the context of 1 Corinthians, the word of wisdom is the word concerning Christ as the deeper things of God, predestined by God to be our portion 1:24, 30; 2:6-10 , and the word of knowledge is the word that imparts a general knowledge of things concerning God and the Lord 8:1-7 .
[120]  As we have seen, the testimony of Jesus is the church as the expression, testimony, and revelation of Jesus in a corporate way.
[121]  In order to see Jesus, we must see Him in the church, because Jesus is expressed and revealed in the proper church life.
[122]  As we have also seen, because the book of Revelation unveils Christ, in this sense it also is the testimony of Jesus 1:1-2; 19:10 .
[123]  The great multitude in Revelation 7:9-17 consists of the redeemed ones from the nations throughout all generations, who are innumerable and who constitute the church.
[124]  That they are standing before the throne indicates that they have been raptured to the heavens, to the presence of God.
[125]  In Revelation 15 the overcomers are standing on the glassy sea.
[126]  A sea should be of water, but the glassy sea is mingled with fire v. 2 . Water and fire together signify God s judgment throughout the entire Bible.
[127]  We must also have the reality of the testimony of Jesus as the shining lampstand, the multitude serving God in the heavenly temple, the wonderful woman to produce the man-child, the field that grows the firstfruits and harvest, the overcomers on the glassy sea, the bride expressing Christ as the white linen, the overcoming army to defeat Antichrist, and the New Jerusalem as the full expression and testimony of Jesus.
