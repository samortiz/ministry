   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Through this one complete step, faith and baptism, we are brought into the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Based on Matthew 28:19, we who have believed and have been baptized can boldly testify that we have been joined to the processed Triune God.</S>

   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>To be joined to God, man must first turn to Him from persons, affairs, and things other than God as well as from the authority of Satan.</S>

   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>We, therefore, who have turned to Him through repentance and have been baptized into Him have been joined to God the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>C. Being Born of Him</S>

   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>This is to be joined to God the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Hence, when we turn to Him through repentance, are baptized into Him, and are born of Him, we are joined to God the Father.</S>

   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>All the fullness of the Triune God dwells in Christ as One who has a human body.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Before His incarnation, the fullness of the Godhead dwelt in Him as the eternal Word, but not bodily.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Since He became incarnate, clothed with a human body, the fullness of the Godhead began to dwell in a bodily way.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>After His death and resurrection, all the fullness of the Godhead dwells even the more in His glorified body Phil 3:21 unto eternity.</S>
