<p>Third, we should focus on the preaching of the gospel. We not only need to sustain and retain our existing saints and recover dormant saints, we also need to preach the gospel. Concerning these three matters, we should not focus only on the first matter with the thought that it must be completed before we address the second matter. We must focus on all three matters at the same time. Retaining existing ones, recovering dormant ones, and preaching the gospel are three things that small groups should do at the same time.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE CONTENT OF<br />
THE SMALL GROUP GATHERINGS</h2>
<h2 class="head2">Mutual Fellowship</h2>
<h2 class="head3">The Flow of the Divine Life</h2>
<p>The content of the small group gatherings involves mutual fellowship. In Greek the word <em>fellowship</em> conveys the meaning of flowing, being in agreement, linking up, and communicating. Hence, fellowship is a flow. For example, the circulation of the blood in the body is a kind of fellowship. Likewise, the electric current in a lamp is a kind of fellowship. When there is no flow of electricity, a lamp stands alone. But once a lamp is connected to the electrical current, it is connected not only to the power plant but also to other lamps.</p>
<p>As believers, we have the Spirit of God and the life of God in us. Today the life of God and the Spirit of God are flowing within us continually. We have this flow, and even those who have not been meeting for a long time have this flow. Many dormant saints say, &ldquo;I have not been meeting for many years, and I am embarrassed to go back.&rdquo; This sense of embarrassment proves that they still have God&rsquo;s life in them; they are still breathing. It also proves that they have the sense of life within them. Hence, there is still hope for them. This hope is related to the flow of life, which is also the fellowship.</p>
<h2 class="head3">Being Gathered into the Lord&rsquo;s Name</h2>
<p>When we gather together in the groups, we should believe that the Lord is in our midst. From the day we were saved, He came into us with His life, and He has never left. Furthermore, we can also stand on His promise in Matthew 18:20: &ldquo;Where there are two or three gathered into My name, there am I in their midst.&rdquo; We must acknowledge and grasp this privilege.</p>
<p>The small groups are gathered into the Lord&rsquo;s name, not into my name or into your name. When we are gathered into the Lord&rsquo;s name, we have the position to say, &ldquo;Lord, You must be in our midst because this is Your word in Matthew 18:20.&rdquo; We need to learn to speak words based on the spiritual reality. For example, if only three people come to a small group gathering, we should not say, &ldquo;How pitiful! There are only three people in our small group gathering tonight.&rdquo; We must count the Lord Jesus and not forget Him. In doctrine, we know and believe that the Lord is in our midst when we meet. In practice, we need to count the Lord Jesus as one of the attendants. If we do not count Him, our understanding is based on doctrine rather than reality. From now on, when we report our numbers, we should include the Lord Jesus. If we have one hundred eighty people, we should add the Lord Jesus and report one hundred eighty-one. If there are two thousand six hundred eighty, we should add the Lord Jesus and report two thousand six hundred eighty-one. This is not a small matter; we must realize that counting the Lord Jesus makes a world of difference. This is not a matter of doctrine but of practice. When we gather together, He is listening as well as speaking because He is listening and speaking in us. Since He is with us, we should count Him among the number of attendants.</p>
<p>Each time we come to a gathering, it is not to conduct business, not to eat hot pot, and not to make friends or seek assistance. We come to seek the Lord Jesus, that is, to be gathered into the Lord&rsquo;s name. Once we have this faith, we can say, &ldquo;Lord, we thank and praise You. This small gathering is connected to heaven. You are on the throne, in our midst, and even in us.&rdquo; We must have this faith and make this declaration.</p>
<h2 class="head3">Being Enlightened and<br />
Supplied through Fellowship</h2>
<p>Once we make this declaration, we are in the fellowship, just as turning on a lamp switch causes the electrical current to flow and the light to shine in all directions. Once we are in this condition, we will be in the light and not engage in idle talk; rather, we will be able to speak of our real condition spontaneously. For example, a brother may testify, &ldquo;I am truly blessed to participate in this small group. The Lord is with me every day. In our last gathering, a brother said that we should have at least ten minutes of morning watch with five minutes of prayer and five minutes of reading the Bible. I went home and practiced this, and it was truly helpful. Throughout the day I had the Lord&rsquo;s presence, and the Lord&rsquo;s word was moving in me continuously. This fellowship has been a real enjoyment to me. In particular, after ten minutes of fellowship with the Lord this morning, I had no desire to argue with my wife. I was truly happy, so I hurried to come here tonight.&rdquo; This is fellowship. When the brother finishes speaking, we should not merely nod our head and smile, thinking that this testimony is good but not saying anything. We need to see that fellowship is not one-way traffic. Others should spontaneously continue to share. We need to learn in this matter. A young sister may offer a prayer: &ldquo;O Lord, may You give us grace so that, like this brother, we can all grow in life.&rdquo; This two-way traffic is fellowship; in this way everyone is supplied.</p>
<p>Mutual fellowship is truly better than merely listening to messages. Listening to messages is similar to eating only white rice during a meal; there is not much variety in flavor. When we have a meal, we always have other dishes in addition to white rice. The two-way traffic in fellowship is similar to pickled vegetables, which stimulate one&rsquo;s appetite during a meal. After the young sister has prayed, the Spirit may lead everyone to pray one after another, or another brother may say, &ldquo;I can testify that this is absolutely true. I have been practicing praying for five minutes and reading the Word for five minutes in the morning for several months. I feel very blessed, and now I want to begin to pray for ten minutes and read the Word for ten minutes.&rdquo; This testimony will be a strengthening. The fellowship that follows could be endless. There may be strengthening prayers or testimonies that follow one after another. Following this fellowship, the entire gathering will open up. After half an hour of fellowship, everyone will be full and satisfied, and when they part, they will yearn for the next meeting.</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_033.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_035.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Crucial Words of Leading in the Lord's Recovery, Book 4: The Increase and Spread of the Church &nbsp; pg 34</div><br></body></html>
