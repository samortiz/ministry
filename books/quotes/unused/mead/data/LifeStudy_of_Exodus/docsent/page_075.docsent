   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>LIFE-STUDY OF EXODUS MESSAGE TWENTY-THREE THE PASSOVER 1 Scripture Reading: Exo 12:1-10, 13, 23, 46b; 13:4; Luke 22:7-8, 14-15; John 19:33, 36; 1 Cor 5:7</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>God s revelation in the Bible is presented in a practical way, not in the way of doctrinal understanding.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Because the divine revelation comes in a practical way, it is always living.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>However, if it were given in a way of doctrine, the result would be death.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>In particular, the Passover is presented not as a doctrine, but in relation to a practical need.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The Passover portrayed in Exodus 12 is a clear, adequate, and even all-inclusive type of the redemption of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Nowhere else in the Scriptures is the redemption of Christ presented in such a full way.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>I. A TYPE OF CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>All Christians know that Christ is the Lamb of God who accomplished redemption for us John 1:29 .</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>However, not many have seen a clear picture of Christ as the redeeming Lamb of God.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>This picture is presented in Exodus 12.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>You may not understand the significance of certain details in this picture.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>For example, why was the blood put on the lintel and the doorposts 12:22 rather than on the roof?</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Why did God tell the children of Israel to use a bunch of hyssop to sprinkle the blood on the lintel and doorposts?</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>What was the reason for eating bitter herbs along with the flesh of the lamb?</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>We could ask question upon question.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Few Christians are able to answer questions such as these.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>We all need to see a clear picture of Christ s redemption.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Although the New Testament reveals the various aspects of redemption, these aspects are not systematized in a doctrinal way.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>John 1:29 says that Christ is the Lamb of God, and in 1 Corinthians 5:7 Paul speaks of Christ as the Passover.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Here and there in the New Testament we see aspects of Christ s redemption.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>In Exodus 12, however, we have a complete picture.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>We need to consider this picture carefully; then to interpret it properly, we need to turn to other portions of the Word, especially to the New Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The Passover is a type of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>In 1 Corinthians 5:7 Paul says that Our Passover, Christ, has been sacrificed.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Here Paul does not say that Christ is our lamb; he says that Christ is our Passover.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>But how could the Passover be sacrificed?</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The answer is that Christ is not only the Passover lamb, but also every aspect of the Passover.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The lamb, the bread, and the bitter herbs are all related to Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>In principle, therefore, Christ is not only the lamb of the Passover, but the very Passover itself.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The word Passover means that the judgment of God passes over us.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>In Exodus 12:13 the Lord says, When I see the blood, I will pass over you.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Eventually, the Passover became a proper noun in English.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The proper noun Passover has its source in the words pass over in 12:13.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>But why is Christ called our Passover?</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>According to Exodus 12, God passed over the children of Israel because the blood of the Passover lamb had been sprinkled on the lintel and the doorposts of their houses.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The children of Israel had been commanded to eat the flesh of the lamb in their houses.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>This indicates that the house was to be their covering under which and in which they could eat the flesh of the Passover lamb.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The house that covered them was to have blood sprinkled on the lintel and the doorposts.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>When God saw the blood, He passed over the children of Israel.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Hence, this passing over was due to the sprinkled blood.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>With Paul, however, we see that the Passover is related not only to the blood, but to Christ Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Are we today under the blood, or are we in Christ?</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Strictly speaking, to say that we are under the blood is not scriptural.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>This phrase is not found in the New Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>But the New Testament says repeatedly that we are in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>According to 1 Corinthians 1:30, it is of God that we are in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Because we are in Christ, He Himself becomes our Passover.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>This means that before Christ can be our Passover, He must first be our covering.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Our covering today is not the blood; it is Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>In Exodus 12 the Passover was based on the blood.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>But today our Passover is based on Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>This is the reason Paul could say that Christ is our Passover.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>If you were asked to list the items of the Passover in Exodus 12, you would probably mention the lamb, the flesh, the blood, the unleavened bread, and the herbs.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>But probably you would not include the house.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>The house in Exodus 12 is a type of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>At the end of Genesis 3, we see that God used skins to cover Adam and Eve v. 21 . In Genesis 4 Abel brought of the firstlings of his flock and of the fat thereof and presented them to the Lord v. 4 . Through this offering, Abel was accepted by God.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Later we read that Noah was charged to build an ark, which may be regarded as a floating house.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>This ark was a type of Christ into whom we have been placed by God.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Noah and his family entered into the ark and in it they were saved from the flood.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>These instances indicate that the revelation in the Bible is progressive.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>In Genesis 3:21 we have the coats of skins; in Genesis 4:4, the offering of the firstlings of the flock; and in Genesis 6 and 7, the ark made by Noah.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>In the lives of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob we do not have a clear record of redemption.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>For this, we must go to the experience of the children of Israel recorded in Exodus 12.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Here is the full development of God s redemption that is first indicated in Genesis 3.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>In Genesis 3 we have the skins, in Genesis 4 we have the offering, and in Genesis 6 and 7 we have the ark.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Now in Exodus 12 we have set before us the full development of God s redemption.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Here the ark becomes the house, a type of Christ, in which and by which the children of Israel were covered.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>This is the reason that no verse in the New Testament says that we are under the covering of the blood of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>However, a number of verses, especially in the Epistles, indicate that we are in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>According to Galatians 3, God has put us into Christ, and we are now in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Because Christ is the house that covers us, He is our Passover.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>He is not only the lamb, the unleavened bread, and the herbs; He is also the house whose lintel and doorposts have been sprinkled with the redeeming blood.</S>
