<h1 class="msg">CHAPTER FOUR</h1><h1 class="msg">BE RIGHT IN FOLLOWING OTHERS</h1><ol class="upper-roman" start="2"><li>Be right in following others:	<ol class="upper-alpha">	<li>Be careful in following any co-workers whom you appreciate and to whom you are attracted:		<ol class="decimal">		<li>He should be a person loving the Lord, living for the Lord, and renouncing his self, natural life, preference, and ambition.</li>		<li>He must hold the complete revelation of the entire holy Scriptures properly without any twisting and deforming.</li>		<li>He must be one who endeavors to keep the oneness of the Spirit, the oneness of the universal Body, by taking the unique ground of the local church.</li>		</ol></li>	<li>Be strongly discerning in the accepting of the divine revelation according to the holy Scriptures:		<ol class="decimal">		<li>The accepting of the divine revelation must be governed by:			<ol class="lower-alpha">			<li>The eternal economy of God as the basic principle.</li>			<li>Christ as the centrality and universality of God&rsquo;s eternal economy.</li>			<li>The Body of Christ which consummates the New Jerusalem as the divine goal of the processed and consummated Triune God.</li>			</ol></li>		<li>The application of the divine truths must avoid:			<ol class="lower-alpha">			<li>Uplifting any basic truths, such as the three sections of sanctification, the designation of Christ as the seed of David to be the firstborn Son of God, the acknowledgment of the fact that &ldquo;I am of Christ,&rdquo; etc., to cause divisions that divide Christ, including His Body (1 Cor. 1:11-13a).</li>			<li>Neglecting any subordinate truths or stressing any of them, which leads toward the direction of division that divides the Body of Christ.</li>			</ol></li>		</ol></li>	</ol></li></ol>
