<p class="bold">WEEK 19 — DAY 3</p><h2 class="uhead1">Matthew 26:17-18, 26-30</h2><p>17 &nbsp;Now on the first day of the Feast of Unleavened Bread, the disciples came to Jesus, saying, Where do You want us to prepare for You to eat the passover?</p> <p>18 &nbsp;And He said, Go into the city to a certain man and say to him, The Teacher says, My time is near. I am keeping the passover at your house with My disciples.</p><p class="bold">26 &nbsp;And as they were eating, Jesus took bread and blessed it, and He broke it and gave it to the disciples and said, Take, eat; this is My body.</p><p class="bold">27 &nbsp;And He took a cup and gave thanks, and He gave it to them, saying, Drink of it, all of you,</p> <p class="bold">28 &nbsp;For this is My blood of the covenant, which is being poured out for many for the forgiveness of sins.</p> <p class="bold">29 &nbsp;But I say to you, I shall by no means drink of this product of the vine from now on until that day when I drink it new with you in the kingdom of My Father.</p> <p class="bold">30 &nbsp;And after singing a hymn, they went out to the Mount of Olives.</p><h2 class="uhead1">Portions from Life-study Messages</h2><p>In verses 17 through 30 we see the keeping of the passover and the establishing of the table.…The Feast of Unleavened Bread is a feast of seven days (Lev. 23:6). It is also called the Passover (Luke 22:1; Mark 14:1). Actually, the Feast of the Passover was the first day of the Feast of Unleavened Bread (Exo. 12:6, 11, 15-20; Lev. 23:5). The table mentioned in [Matthew 26:20] refers not to the Lord’s table, but to the table of the Feast of the Passover.</p><p>Verses 21 through 25 reveal that the Lord established the table at the time of His betrayal.…After Judas had gone,…[the Lord established the table with the eleven real believers.] Thus, Judas participated in the Passover feast, but he did not partake of the Lord’s table.</p><p>Beginning at verse 26, the Lord’s table is established. The Lord and the disciples first ate the passover (Matt. 26:20-25; Luke 22:14-18). Then the Lord established His table with the bread and the cup (Matt. 26:26-28; Luke 22:19-20; 1 Cor. 11:23-26) to replace the Feast of the Passover because He was going to fulfill the type and be the real Passover to us (1 Cor. 5:7). Now we are keeping the real Feast of Unleavened Bread (Matt. 26:17; 1 Cor. 5:8).</p><p>The bread of the Lord’s table is a symbol signifying the Lord’s body, which was broken for us on the cross to release His life that we may participate in it. By participating in this life we become the mystical Body of Christ (1 Cor. 12:27), which also is signified by the bread of the table (1 Cor. 10:17). Hence, by partaking of this bread we have the fellowship of the Body of Christ (1 Cor. 10:16).</p><p>The Lord’s blood redeemed us from our fallen condition back to God and back to God’s full blessing. Concerning the Lord’s table (1 Cor. 10:21), the bread signifies our participation in life, and the cup, our enjoyment of God’s blessing. Hence, the cup is called the cup of blessing (1 Cor. 10:16). In it are all the blessings of God and even God Himself as our portion (Psa. 16:5). In Adam our portion was the cup of God’s wrath (Rev. 14:10). Christ drank that cup for us (John 18:11), and His blood constitutes the cup of salvation for us (Psa. 116:13), the cup that runs over (Psa. 23:5). By partaking of this cup we have the fellowship of the blood of Christ (1 Cor. 10:16).</p><p>Some manuscripts insert the word new before the word covenant in [Matthew 26:28]. The Lord’s blood, having satisfied God’s righteousness, enacted the new covenant. In this new covenant God gives us forgiveness, life, salvation, and all spiritual, heavenly, and divine blessings. When this new covenant is given to us, it is a cup (Luke 22:20), a portion for us. The Lord shed His blood, God established the covenant, and we enjoy the cup, in which God and all that is of Him are our portion. The blood is the price that Christ paid for us, the covenant is the title deed that God made for us, and the cup is the portion that we receive from God.
