   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE THREE PARTS OF THE SPIRIT</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>CONSCIENCE, FELLOWSHIP, AND INTUITION</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Just as our body has many parts, so does our spirit and our soul.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Our spirit is composed of three: conscience, fellowship, and intuition.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The conscience is for us to discern right from wrong, to justify or to condemn.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Romans 9:1 compared with Romans 8:16 proves that the conscience is a part of our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Fellowship is for us to contact God and to commune with God.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>This is shown in John 4:24 and Romans 1:9.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Intuition means to have a direct sense or feeling in our spirit, regardless of reason or circumstance.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>First Corinthians 2:11 indicates that our spirit can know what our soul cannot.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Our soul knows by reason or by circumstance, but our spirit can perceive without these.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>This is intuition, the direct sense in our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>THE THREE PARTS OF THE SOUL</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>MIND, EMOTION, AND WILL</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The soul is also of three parts.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The main one, the mind, is for thinking, considering Psa 13:2 , knowing Psa 139:14 , and remembering Lam 3:20 .</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>In the mind we have thoughts, ideas, concepts, reasonings, understanding, knowledge, etc. Emotion, another part of the soul, is for us to love 1 Sam 18:1; S.S. 1:7 or hate 2 Sam 5:8 , to like or dislike, to be joyful Isa 61:10; Psa 86:4 or grieved 1 Sam 30:6; Judg.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>10:16 .</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>All our emotional feelings, positive or negative, are in this part of our soul.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The will is also a part of the soul.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>It is the part through which we have our purposes and choices Job 7:15; 6:7 and make decisions 1 Chron 22:19 .</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>When I consider or reason, I am using the mind.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>When I feel happy or sorrowful, I am in the emotion.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>When I make a decision to do a certain thing, the will is in operation.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The mind, the emotion, and the will are the three parts of the soul.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Psalm 51:6 reveals that within our being are "the inward parts" and "the hidden part."</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Hebrews 8:10 compared with Jeremiah 31:33 proves that the mind is one of "the inward parts."</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The rest of "the inward parts" must be the emotion and the will.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Therefore, all the parts of our soul are "the inward parts" of our being, while our spirit is "the hidden part."</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>THE HEART</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Since 1 Thessalonians 5:23 speaks definitely that we are a tripartite being composed of the spirit, the soul, and the body, the heart could not be a separate part in addition to the spirit and the soul.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The heart is a composition of the first part of the spirit and all three parts of the soul.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>It includes the conscience Heb 10:22 , the first part of our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Thus, it condemns 1 John 3:20 as does the conscience.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>It also includes the mind, the will, and the emotion, which are the three parts of our soul.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Thus, it thinks Matt 9:4 and has thoughts Gen 6:5; Heb 4:12 ; it rejoices John 16:22 or has sorrow John 16:6 ; and it purposes Acts 11:23 and has intents Heb 4:12 .</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Hence, the Scripture shows us clearly that our heart is composed of the conscience, the mind, the emotion, and the will.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>It is equal to a part of our spirit and the whole of our soul.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Since the heart is thus composed of parts of our spirit and soul, it is very closely related to both.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>THE PURPOSES OF THE PARTS OF MAN</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The purpose of our body is our human existence.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>It is by our body that we may exist and live physically and practically for the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Our body is for the Lord, and the Lord is for our body 1 Cor 6:13 .</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The Lord prepares us a body Heb 10:5 that we may exist and live for Him.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Thus, we must offer our body to the Lord Rom 12:1 and glorify Him in our body 1 Cor 6:20 .</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The purpose of our heart in God's intention is that it may love Him.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Mark 12:30 says, "Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart."</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Our heart is a loving organ, prepared by God for us to love Him.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>The purpose of our spirit is to contact the Lord John 4:24 , to receive Him 1 Cor 6:17 , and to contain Him 2 Tim 4:22 .</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Our heart is the loving organ, whereas our spirit is the contacting, receiving, and containing organ.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>The Lord whom our heart loves is contacted, received, and contained by our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>What then is the purpose of our soul?</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Its main purpose is to reflect and express the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Second Corinthians 3:18, in the original text, has the thought of reflecting.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Our soul, that is our person or our personality, must be the very organ, as a mirror, to reflect and express the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Thus, we love the Lord with our heart; we contact, receive, and contain Him with our spirit; and we reflect and express Him with our soul in all that we think, like, and decide in all that we are and all that we do.</S>
