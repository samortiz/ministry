<h1 class="scripture">Scripture: John 10:9</h1>
<ol class="upper-romanbd">
<li>God&rsquo;s sphere
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>Everything has its own sphere. God and the blessing He bestows also have a sphere. Heaven, eternal life, and God Himself also have a sphere.</li>
	<li>A sphere is for separating the outside from the inside. Whatever is inside has the portion of the sphere; whatever is outside has no part of that portion. God and whatever belongs to Him also have a sphere; this sphere separates what is outside of God from what is inside.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>God&rsquo;s door
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>To enter any sphere one has to go through an entrance door. It is the same in God&rsquo;s sphere.</li>
	<li>The entrance door of God&rsquo;s sphere is the Lord Jesus. In order to enter into God&rsquo;s sphere, men have to go through the Lord Jesus.</li>
	<li>If there were no Lord Jesus in this universe, men would have no entrance to God&rsquo;s sphere. But thank God, He has established a door which is the Lord Jesus.</li>
	<li>The Lord Jesus on one hand bore men&rsquo;s sins and took away the barrier of sin between God and man. On the other hand, He released His life and took away the barrier of creation between God the Creator and man the creature. The Lord&rsquo;s bearing of sins and shedding His blood is an entrance. The Lord&rsquo;s death and releasing life is another entrance. Today if men want to enter into God&rsquo;s sphere, they must enter through the Lord&rsquo;s blood and the Lord&rsquo;s life. The blood takes away the barrier of sin between God and man, and the life takes away the barrier of creation between God and man. When men receive the Lord, they immediately enter into all that God is.</li>

<li>The Lord is the door of the sheep
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>We belong to God. God wants us to unite with Him.</li>
	<li>The Lord is the door through whom we can enter into whatever God is. So through the Lord we can enter into God&rsquo;s forgiveness, life, blessing, and habitation.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>How do we enter through the door?
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>We must confess the existence of the barriers. There is the barrier of sin, and there is the barrier between the Creator and the creature.</li>
	<li>We must confess that the Lord shed His blood for us that He might be our Savior.</li>
	<li>We must receive the Lord Jesus in order to have His life.</li>
	</ol></li>
