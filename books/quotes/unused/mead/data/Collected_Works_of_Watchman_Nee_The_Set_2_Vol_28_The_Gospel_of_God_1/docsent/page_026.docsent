   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>GOD BEING BOUND TO FORGIVE US</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>BECAUSE OF RIGHTEOUSNESS</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Therefore, before the Lord Jesus came to the earth and was crucified on the cross, it would have been fine for God to refuse to save us.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>God could have left us unsaved.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Had God not given us His Son, all that we could have said was that God did not love us.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>We could not say anything more.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>But because God has indeed given us His Son and put our sins upon Him that we might be redeemed from our sins, God can do nothing else but forgive our sins when we come to Him through the blood of the Lord Jesus and through His work.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Hallelujah!</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>God has to forgive our sins!</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Do you realize that God is bound to forgive our sins?</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>If you come to God through Jesus Christ, God is bound to forgive your sins.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>It was love that brought His Son to the cross, but it was righteousness that caused God to forgive our sins.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>John 3:16 says, "For God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son."</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Out of love God gave us His only begotten Son.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>But 1 John 1:9 says, "If we confess our sins, He is faithful and righteous to forgive us our sins and cleanse us from all unrighteousness."</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The work of the cross was accomplished for us through the love of God.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>But today when we come to God through the accomplished work of Jesus Christ, God has to forgive us based on His faithfulness and righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Hence, if the Lord Jesus had not come, God would be free not to save us.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>But now that the Lord Jesus has died, even if God were unhappy about saving us, strictly speaking He still has to do it.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>If He received the money could He refuse to return the note?</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>God cannot be unrighteous, because if He is unrighteous, He Himself becomes a sinner.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Therefore, God is bound to forgive all those who come to Him through the blood of the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Hallelujah!</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>God cannot refuse to forgive them.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>I want to shout that this is the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Since God has given us His Son, He is bound.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Do you think that we can pay God back now?</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Today through the Lord Jesus, not only can we pay God back, but we have more than we need to pay Him back.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>We have an overflow.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>For where sin abounds, there grace much more abounds.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Sin is abundant.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>But the grace in God's Son is more abundant, even superabundant.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>For this reason, it is through the Lord Jesus alone that one can be saved.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Everyone has to admit that there is nothing unrighteous with God when we come to Him by the Lord Jesus and when He gives us life and forgives our sins.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Our heart can never say that God, in forgiving our sins, saved us lawlessly when He passed over our sins, exercised forbearance toward us, and justified us who believe in Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>We can never say that God has dealt irresponsibly with our sins.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>On the contrary, we must say that God has saved us in the most righteous way.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Our salvation is a proper and upright salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Our sins have been judged; hence, we are saved.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>No one can say that God has saved us by using unrighteous procedures.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Rather, we must say that God has saved us by the most righteous procedures.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>GOD'S RIGHTEOUSNESS</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>MANIFESTED APART FROM THE LAW</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Now let us come back to Romans 3.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Verses 19 to 26 are quite a difficult passage in the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>But after what we have seen concerning God's righteousness and the righteousness that the Lord Jesus has accomplished, Romans 3:19-26 is wonderful.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Verse 19 says, "Now we know that whatever things the law says, it speaks to those who are under the law, that every mouth may be stopped and all the world may fall under the judgment of God."</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Why did God give man the law?</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>It was given so that man would have nothing to say before God, so that every mouth may be stopped.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>God wants to show man that everyone is a sinner and that everyone has sinned.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>There is not one who has done good.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Verse 20 says, "Because out of the works of the law no flesh shall be justified before Him; for through the law is the clear knowledge of sin."</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>The ultimate purpose of the law of God was to show man that he is a sinner.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>The purpose of the law was not for man to be saved through it.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>The tone of the law is completely condemnatory.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>The law says that man should be condemned, that he should die, and that he should perish.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>If the matter stopped here, there would be no gospel and everything would be over.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>But the matter does not stop here.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Man cannot live by the law, but God has other ways.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>If you cannot pay back the money, God has other ways to pay it back for you.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>The first two words in verse 21 are marvelous; they mark a big turn in this matter.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>"But now."</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Thank the Lord that there is a turn!</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>"But now, apart from the law, the righteousness of God has been manifested."</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>God's righteousness was originally manifested in the law.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>But if that were the case now, we would be doomed.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>What does it mean to say that God's righteousness was manifested in the law?</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>It means that whatever you owed God you had to pay back.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>If you sinned, you had to perish.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>If you transgressed, you had to go into perdition.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Thus, the law would manifest God's righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>To punish sinners would be the most righteous thing for God to do.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>But thank the Lord, God's righteousness is no longer manifested in the law.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>If His righteousness were manifested within the law, God would have to judge sinners.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>But the righteousness of God is manifested apart from the law, in which case, judgment falls on God Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>The end of verse 21 says, "Witness being borne to it by the Law and the Prophets."</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>Even the prophets in the Old Testament, including David and all the other prophets, testified to the same thing.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>How is God's righteousness manifested?</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>Verse 22 says, "Even the righteousness of God through the faith of Jesus Christ to all those who believe, for there is no distinction."</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>Since all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God v. 23 , how can we obtain God's grace? Verses 24 and 25 say that we are "justified freely...through the redemption which is in Christ Jesus; whom God set forth as a propitiation place." God has sent Jesus to redeem us from our sins and has set Him forth as a propitiation place.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>I believe we all know what the propitiation place is.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>The propitiation place is the covering of the ark in the Old Testament tabernacle; it was the place where God bestowed grace upon man.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>Every place on earth is defiled by sin.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>But this place, and only this place, is without sin.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>Now Jesus has become the propitiation place.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>How has He become such a place?</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>By His blood being the surety.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>God has set forth Jesus as the propitiation place, and now through the blood of Jesus I can come by faith to God.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>God cannot do anything else but bestow grace upon me.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>Only after God has done this can we say that His forbearance and His passing over of sins in the Old Testament was righteous; and only after God has done this can we say that His justifying those who believe in Jesus in the New Testament is also righteous.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>We are saved today not because God glossed over our sins but because God has dealt with our sins.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>Before God we are not forgiven debtors, but paid up debtors who are forgiven.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>This is something most precious in the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>This is the only way that Christians can have boldness before God.</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>Have you ever realized that inasmuch as love is precious, it is never that reliable?</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>You cannot bring a person to court just because he has not loved you for a few days.</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>There is no such thing as love in a law court.</S>
   <S PAR='98' RSNT='1' SNO='98'>But if unrighteousness occurs or if sin arises, the law will speak.</S>
   <S PAR='99' RSNT='1' SNO='99'>God likes to give us a handle, something for us to hold on to.</S>
   <S PAR='100' RSNT='1' SNO='100'>Through such a handle, our faith can be strengthened and the promises of God can be fulfilled in us.</S>
   <S PAR='101' RSNT='1' SNO='101'>This handle is the Lord Jesus Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='102' RSNT='1' SNO='102'>God knows that we may doubt, so He works faith into us through His Son.</S>
   <S PAR='103' RSNT='1' SNO='103'>We can say to Him, "God, since You have given me Your Son and have allowed Him to die, You must forgive my sins."</S>
   <S PAR='104' RSNT='1' SNO='104'>Sometimes we hear people praying, "O God, I want to be saved.</S>
   <S PAR='105' RSNT='1' SNO='105'>Please save me!</S>
   <S PAR='106' RSNT='1' SNO='106'>I have sinned, but I am determined to be saved.</S>
   <S PAR='107' RSNT='1' SNO='107'>Please be merciful to me and have the Lord Jesus die for me."</S>
   <S PAR='108' RSNT='1' SNO='108'>When such ones pray, they may cry bitterly.</S>
   <S PAR='109' RSNT='1' SNO='109'>They act as if God's heart is very hard and believe that before God would forgive them or turn His heart toward them they have to cry much.</S>
   <S PAR='110' RSNT='1' SNO='110'>Those who pray this way do not know what the gospel is.</S>
   <S PAR='111' RSNT='1' SNO='111'>If the Son of God had not come to the earth, their crying and imploring before God might work.</S>
   <S PAR='112' RSNT='1' SNO='112'>But the Son of God has come, and the problem of sin has been solved.</S>
   <S PAR='113' RSNT='1' SNO='113'>The redemptive work on the cross has been accomplished.</S>
   <S PAR='114' RSNT='1' SNO='114'>When people come to God, there is no need for poor begging anymore.</S>
   <S PAR='115' RSNT='1' SNO='115'>Since God has given us His Son, He can forgive sins through His Son.</S>
   <S PAR='116' RSNT='1' SNO='116'>He is faithful to do so; He is not being a liar by doing so.</S>
   <S PAR='117' RSNT='1' SNO='117'>And He is righteous to do so; there is nothing unrighteous in it.</S>
   <S PAR='118' RSNT='1' SNO='118'>When righteousness is involved, faithfulness is also involved.</S>
