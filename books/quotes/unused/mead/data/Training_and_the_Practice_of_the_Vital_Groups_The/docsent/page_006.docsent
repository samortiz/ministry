   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Becoming Mixed Christianity</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The church failed to the extent that it has become mixed Christianity Matt 13:33; Col 2:20-21 .</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The Lord Jesus prophesied in Matthew 13:33 that this would happen.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>In this verse He spoke of a woman putting leaven into fine flour.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The fine flour of the meal offering signifies Christ as food for both God and man, but Christianity has mixed leaven with the fine flour.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The leaven includes sin, the world, the flesh, Satan, and all the fallen, negative things.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Christianity surely is a mixture.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>They have the Bible; they have the name of God; they have Christ; and they preach the fundamental gospel that Christ died on the cross for our sins.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>But there are many unscriptural things, pagan practices, heretical doctrines, and evil matters mixed with the teachings of Christ to leaven the whole content of Christianity.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Today's Christianity is an impure mixture.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>One of the biggest mixtures is the denominations.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The standing of all the denominations is condemned and rejected by God see 1 Cor 1:12-13 and note 121; Rev 3:8 and note 83 Recovery Version .</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>4.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>God's Judgment a. Condemnation on the Fallen Church</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>God's judgment is His condemnation on the fallen church.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The New Testament is full of God's rebuking of the degraded church. b.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Cutting the Deformed Church Off from the Enjoyment of Christ</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>God's judgment is also His cutting the deformed church off from the enjoyment of Christ John 15:2a .</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Today's Christianity has not remained in the original form of the church, so it is deformed.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Among the seven churches mentioned in Revelation 2 and 3, one was Laodicea.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The Lord Jesus was not in that Laodicean church.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>He was outside knocking at its door Rev 3:20 .</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>That means the church in degradation is cut off from the enjoyment of Christ. c.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>To Let the Overcomers Rise Up</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>God's judgment on the fallen and deformed church is to let the overcomers rise up.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>In God's move through the Adamic race, through the Abrahamic race, and then through the church there was a failure.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>God's judgment, however, was for the purpose of raising up the overcomers.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>This is why there is the last book of the Bible Revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>In the book of Revelation there is the unique call of the Head, Christ, to His believers for them to be His overcomers.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>At the close of each of the seven epistles to the churches in Revelation 2 and 3, the Head, Christ, sounded out His call for the overcomers.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>He repeats this call seven times Rev 2:7, 11, 17, 26-28; 3:5, 12, 20-21 .</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The book of Revelation is not a book merely to tell us about the beasts or about the three and a half years of the great tribulation.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The book of Revelation is a book concerning the overcomers.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>We need to pay full attention to the Lord's calling for the overcomers.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>D. Through the Overcomers</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>God's move on the earth for the accomplishment of His economy is ultimately through the overcomers.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>This message is on the vital groups and the overcomers.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The vital groups should be composed of people who are overcomers.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>1.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>With the Pneumatic Christ as the Center and the Goal</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>God moves through the overcomers to accomplish His economy with the pneumatic Christ as the center and the goal Rev 5:6; Phil 1:19b .</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The term the pneumatic Christ means that in the last step of God's move, Christ was made the all-inclusive Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Revelation 5:6 reveals that the sevenfold-intensified Spirit is the eyes of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>A person's eyes are one with him, and he is mainly expressed through his eyes.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Christ is fully expressed by His seven eyes, and His seven eyes are the sevenfold-intensified Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>This makes Christ the pneumatic Christ, the Christ who is the consummated and compound, all-inclusive Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Philippians 1:19b speaks of the bountiful supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>The Spirit of Jesus Christ is Christ Himself, and this pneumatic Christ has the bountiful supply.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>He is all-inclusive; He is rich; He is bountiful in His supply; and this is the very Christ in this age of the overcomers.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>We need to realize what age we are in. We are not just in the church age.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>We are in the church, but we are in the age of the overcomers.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>In order to be an overcomer, we need to know the seven basic items of God's recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>God made Christ the pneumatic Christ as the center and the goal in the recovery of seven things.</S>
