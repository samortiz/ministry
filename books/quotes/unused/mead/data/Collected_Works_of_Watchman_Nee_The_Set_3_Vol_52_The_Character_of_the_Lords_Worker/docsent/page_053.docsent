   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THREE</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>A worker of the Lord has to pay attention to yet another thing being flexible in his daily living.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>God's servants cannot have a set standard for themselves, insisting on their own ways and views.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>If we want to serve the Lord properly, we have to maintain one principle: We do everything according to the Scripture and in a way that will not stumble anyone.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>In 1 Corinthians 9:19-22 Paul said, "For though I am free from all, I have enslaved myself to all that I might gain the more.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>And to the Jews I became as a Jew in order that I might gain Jews; to those under law, as under law though I myself am not under law , that I might gain those under law.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>To those without law, as without law though I am not without law to God but within law to Christ , that I might gain those without law.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>To the weak I became weak that I might gain the weak.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>To all men I have become all things that I might by all means save some."</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>For the sake of the gospel, Paul was all things to all men.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>This is a necessary character trait of one who serves the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Philippians 4:12 says, "I know also how to be abased, and I know how to abound; in everything and in all things I have learned the secret both to be filled and to hunger, both to abound and to lack."</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Man is prone to swing from one extreme to the other; he is prone to go to extremes.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Some Christians think that the only right thing to do is to abound and to be filled.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Others are just the opposite; they think that a man must suffer abasement, lack, and hunger.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>But Paul said that he had learned to be abased, and he had learned to abound.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>He had learned to be filled and to be in hunger.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>He had learned to abound and to lack.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>He had learned the secret in all these things.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>He said, "I am able to do all things in Him who empowers me" v. 13 . Paul was flexible in the outward things of his daily life.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Whether it was this or that, he could accept everything.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Unfortunately, many brothers and sisters are very stubborn.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Their daily habits are untouchable and unchangeable.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Some people have to take a hot bath every day.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Some people have to shave every day.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>If they are put in a situation where they cannot live according to their habitual ways, they will not be able to function.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>These may be very minor things, but they can become obstacles to the Lord's work.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Those who are set in their habitual ways cannot be God's servants.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>A worker of the Lord cannot be lopsided.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>He can go on with or without a hot bath, with or without shaving for a few days, with or without the opportunity to change his shirt for many days.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>He can sleep on a hard bed or a soft bed.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>He should be at ease in any environment he is put into.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Not only should daily habits not be an issue to a worker, but other things such as personality and age should not be a hindrance to him either.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Suppose in one place the people are very warm, while in another place the people are very cold.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>God's servant should function equally well in both places.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>If he is a cold person and he can only work among cold ones rather than among warm ones, he is disqualified from the work.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Some people can only work with warm ones; they cannot work among cold people.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Some people can only work among serious people; they cannot work among carefree ones.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>All such restrictions represent limitations to God's work.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Some brothers can only minister to older ones; they have nothing to say when they are among children or younger ones.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Such a lopsided personality hinders God's work.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Our Lord received the old and blessed the young.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>God wants us to be like our Lord, receiving the old and blessing the young.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Madam Guyon once said that a man in total union with God is able to be a counsel to the old man and a friend to a child.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>This is one lesson we have to learn.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Brothers and sisters, this again is related to the dealing of our self.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The self has to be rubbed away to such an extent that we can allow God to put us in any situation.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>In this way we will no longer be inflexible and will no longer be partial to any way.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Paul was able to be all things to all men because he was fully trained by the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>May we all learn to be dealt with by the Lord so that our daily habits and personality will not become rigid and unchangeable.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>May we not go to an extreme and may we not hinder or frustrate the Lord's work in any way.</S>
