<h1 class="title">Two Kinds of Walk by the Spirit</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Gal. 5:16, 18, 25; 6:8, 15-16</h1>
<ol class="upper-romanbd">
<li>The Spirit in Galatians 5:16 and 25 is the processed Triune God:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>In these verses <em>the Spirit</em> refers to the Spirit indwelling our spirit and mingled with our spirit&mdash;3:2, 5, 14; 6:1, 18.</li>
	<li>Instead of trying to fulfill the law, we should walk by the Spirit, by the processed Triune God:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>When we are led by the Spirit, we are not under the law, for the Spirit of life is our guiding principle, regulating our Christian walk in our regenerated spirit&mdash;Rom. 8:2, 4.</li>
		<li>To live by the Spirit is to have our life dependent upon the Spirit and regulated by the Spirit, not by the law&mdash;Gal. 5:18.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>The believers have the all-inclusive life-giving Spirit dwelling in their spirit, and they should live, walk, and have their being by this Spirit.</li>
	<li>God&rsquo;s New Testament economy is wholly a matter of walking by the Spirit to live Christ&mdash;vv. 16, 25; Phil. 1:21a.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>According to the Bible, every believer in Christ should have two kinds of walk by the Spirit&mdash;Gal. 5:16, 25:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>Because God is purposeful and seeks to reach His goal, He charges us to have two kinds of walk by the Spirit: the walk which builds up a proper daily living and the walk in line with the divine rules and principles to reach the goal established by God and to fulfill His purpose&mdash;vv. 16, 25.</li>
	<li>The Greek word for <em>walk</em> in verse 16, <em>peripateo,</em> denotes the daily, ordinary, regular walk; it means to move, to deport oneself, to act in ordinary daily life, implying a common, habitual daily walk&mdash;Rom. 6:4; 8:4; Phil. 3:17-18:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>The first kind of walk by the Spirit is a walk in which we are one spirit with the Lord&mdash;1 Cor. 6:17.</li>
		<li>In Galatians 5:16 to walk by the Spirit actually means to live Christ&mdash;Phil. 1:21a.</li>
		<li>To walk by the Spirit in Galatians 5:16 equals to live by the Spirit in verse 25.</li>
		<li>In the first kind of walk by the Spirit, we take the Spirit as the essence of our life&mdash;v. 16:
			<ol class="lower-alpha">
			<li>This means that our essence is the Triune God as our constituent.</li>
			<li>Whatever we are, whatever we do, and whatever we have will be by the Spirit as our essence.</li>
			<li>If we take the Spirit as our essence and crucify our flesh (v. 24), every aspect of our daily walk will be by the Spirit.</li>
			</ol></li>
		<li>If we would be sons of God in reality and practicality, we must walk by the Spirit and not by the flesh&mdash;3:26; 4:6; Rom. 8:14:
			<ol class="lower-alpha">
			<li>Because we are sons, God wants us to walk by the Spirit as His sons.</li>
			<li>If we would trust in the Spirit, we must stand on the ground of being God&rsquo;s sons, not on the ground of being God&rsquo;s creatures&mdash;Gal. 4:6.</li>
			<li>Because we are God&rsquo;s sons and because the processed Triune God is working within us toward the goal of sonship, we should walk by the Spirit&mdash;3:26; 5:16.</li>
			</ol></li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>The Greek word for <em>walk</em> in Galatians 5:25, <em>stoicheo,</em> denotes an official walk, a walk to carry out a certain commission; it means to walk according to rules&mdash;to walk in line, to march in military rank, to keep in step and, thus, to walk in an orderly manner&mdash;6:16; Rom. 4:12; Phil. 3:16:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>If we would have the second kind of walk by the Spirit&mdash;the walk for the fulfillment of God&rsquo;s purpose&mdash;we need to learn to walk by the Spirit as our way, rule, and principle&mdash;Gal. 5:25.</li>
		<li>The unique pathway toward God&rsquo;s goal is the processed Triune God as the life-giving Spirit; He alone should be the principle, the rule, the path, according to which we should walk.</li>
		<li>By uttering this word about walking by the Spirit as our rule, Paul eliminated law, religion, tradition, doctrine, and regulations as the rule.</li>
		<li>The second kind of walk by the Spirit is intimately related to the new creation&mdash;6:15-16:
			<ol class="lower-alpha">
			<li>Paul connects the second kind of walk with &ldquo;this rule&rdquo;&mdash;the rule of being a new creation&mdash;v. 16.</li>
			<li>The rule by which we should walk is the rule of being a new creation&mdash;2 Cor. 5:17.</li>
			<li>In Galatians 5:25 to walk by the Spirit is to walk in the new creation:
				<ol class="none">
				<li>1) Anything in our daily life that does not have God in it is in the old creation, but what has God in it is part of the new creation&mdash;6:15.</li>
				<li>2) We need to walk by the rule which is the Triune God to be our life and our living; to live in this way by the new creation is our rule.</li>
				<li>3) The new creation is a matter of God&rsquo;s chosen people taking the all-inclusive Spirit as their goal, aiming at Him, being one with Him, and, as a result, having the divine element transfused into them to reconstitute them and make them new&mdash;v. 8.</li>
				<li>4) We should walk by the principle of the new creation&mdash;vv. 15-16:
					<ol class="none">
					<li>a) The basic principle of the new creation is that we should live by the divine life&mdash;2:20; John 6:57.</li>
					<li>b) To live the new creation is to walk by the divine life and divine nature as a governing principle&mdash;Gal. 6:15-16.</li>
					<li>c) Walking by the principle of the new creation is mysterious because it is an organic matter altogether related to life&mdash;John 3:8.</li>
					<li>d) If we would live the new creation, we must do everything in oneness with the Triune God&mdash;15:4-5; 1 Cor. 6:17.</li>
					</ol></li>
				</ol></li>
			<li>To live the new creation is to live, walk, have our being, and do all things, great or small, with the element of God&mdash;Gal. 6:15-16.</li>
			<li>If we &ldquo;walk by this rule,&rdquo; we will live neither a religious life nor an unreligious life, but we will live a new creation as sons of God&mdash;v. 15; 3:26.</li>
