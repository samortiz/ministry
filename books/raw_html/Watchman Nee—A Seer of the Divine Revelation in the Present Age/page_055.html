<H1 CLASS=MSG>CHAPTER SEVENTEEN</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>MATURED</H1><P>The book of Genesis reveals that by the time Jacob reached the end of his life, he had matured to become Israel. We also see a matured life in Watchman Nee after his many experiences with the Lord and much suffering. His maturity was manifested in a number of ways.</P><P>He was one with the Lord because his whole being was saturated with the Lord. It was difficult to find a trace of anything natural in his being. He was always in the spirit, never frustrated by the flesh or restricted by the natural man.</P><P>He was always prepared to minister the Lord to others. It was unnecessary for him to prepare himself to minister; he was able to minister life to others constantly and instantly. Watchman Nee possessed a matured measure of life.</P><P>He was full of insight and able to discern the situation of others in a thorough way. He had the ability to isolate a person's problem and thoroughly diagnose his condition.</P><P>His heart was large, and he enjoyed bearing the burdens of others. The burdens of others were not a heavy weight to him; his care for them was like an ocean, without scarcity. He fully bore the burden of the Lord's recovery in building up the churches in China. Yet there was no indication that he was either striving or struggling to fulfill his commission.</P><P>In his dealings with others, sweetness, tenderness, and softness were spontaneous. He did not perform. The flavor of these virtues simply overflowed spontaneously from the fullness of his matured life.</P><P>It was his testimony that he was ready to be either raptured or martyred. As I write these words, on the desk before me are two paperweights made of stone. One bears the inscription of his word: "My future is to be either raptured or martyred."</P>
