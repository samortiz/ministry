   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Concerning the Small Group Meeting Everyone Leading, with No One Behaving</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>in the Way of a Worship Service</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The small group is the all-inclusive unit of the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In the church life, if the small group meeting is not strong, the church life will not be strong.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The secret of a sustained, healthy church life is simply the small group meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The small group is the practical church life and the practical church service.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>However, we must remember that the small group meeting is not a worship service.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>A small group meeting is not one where everyone meets together at a specified time and place.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>In the new way, we may begin meeting at home at a quarter after seven, even when the scheduled time for meeting is half-past seven.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Actually, our meeting should begin from the time we have our revival in the morning.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>During the whole day, we live in such a revival until we come to the small group meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>On our way to the meeting, whether we are riding in the car or walking on the street, we should either be praising or singing.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>When we arrive at the saints home, even when there are only one or two there, we do not wait.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>There is no set program or procedure for the small group meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Nor is there any leader.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Every brother and sister is a leader.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>When you are there, you are the leader.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>When I come, I am the leader.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Everyone who comes can be the leader, and everyone is free to sing, pray, or read the Scriptures.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Mutually Asking Questions</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>for Guidance in Life and Truth</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Furthermore, everyone can ask questions in the small group meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Everyone can also answer the questions.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>For example, I am an old man.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>I have a problem about whether I should retain a beard.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>I can ask, Can a man of my age keep a beard?</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Such a question can be raised in the small group meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The small group meeting is there to solve my problems.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>If there is a young sister in the meeting, and she thinks that she is not a brother, nor an elderly one, nor a leader, and should therefore sit there quietly, she is wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>We have to see that everyone who comes to the small group meeting is qualified to speak.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>If the young sister realizes this, she may say, To me keeping a beard is a troublesome matter.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Recently we were pursuing a study of the book of Leviticus.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>There it says that all the hairs of the body have to be completely shorn.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Although I am a young sister, I feel that according to the Bible, it is better not to have a beard.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Another elderly sister may say, She is absolutely right.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Although she is young, her words contain the biblical light.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>To me it is troublesome for an elderly person to have a beard.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>It is more simple for him not to have one.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>In these days, no one likes to see people with a beard.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Whoever has a beard makes others feel uncomfortable.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Those without beards are more proper.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>For the sake of the Lord s testimony, it is better that the brothers do not have beards.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>This is a good example of a teaching.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>After this, a small sister speaks again, and then another brother adds something.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Finally a more experienced one may put in a few words.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>In less than five minutes, the question is answered.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>This is a very good practice.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Those that dared not speak before, now will dare to speak.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Those that could not speak before, now are able to speak.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Those who considered that they were unqualified before, now will realize that everyone is qualified to ask and to teach others.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Throughout the fifty-two weeks of the year, we should have this kind of meeting at least once a week.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>All the attendants of the small group meetings will then be like children of an educated family.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>When they speak, they will be filled with light and truth.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Do not be afraid of speaking the wrong thing in the meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>We are all learning here.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>If we are not learning, we will not make any mistake.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>If we are learning, surely we will make some mistakes.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>We are practicing at the same time that we are learning.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>This is the secret of the small group meetings in the new way.</S>
