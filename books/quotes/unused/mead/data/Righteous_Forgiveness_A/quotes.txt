[1]  God has no desire to change our outward behavior; He only wants to change our life.
[2]  If these things are not settled, God can never give life to us, and we will never have the right to receive anything from Him.
[3]  When we sin, our conscience also does not let us go.
[4]  Sometimes when the conscience is hushed, we do not sense too much guilt.
[5]  If we sin carelessly and God forgives our sins irresponsibly, then God Himself falls into sin in His forgiveness.
[6]  This does not mean that God does not have the power to forgive sins, but it means that God can only grant forgiveness when it comes up to His dignity.
[7]  He said, "Mr. Nee, if God wants to forgive our sins, why can He not just say so? Why did He have to send His Son to be crucified on the cross? This is too cumbersome!" He thought that God is a nice fellow who writes off our sins unscrupulously without any concern for the law! He did not realize that God had to go through many steps before He could issue forgiveness.
