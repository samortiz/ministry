One is fear, and the other is godliness. What do fearing and being godly mean? By the grace of God, we would like to share a little of what we have learned concerning these matters.</p><h2 class="head1">ONE</h2><p>God demands that His children be holy. In 2 Corinthians 7:1, Paul said, "Therefore since we have these promises, beloved, let us cleanse ourselves from all defilement of flesh and of spirit, perfecting holiness in the fear of God." This verse shows us that our holiness is very much related to our fear of God. God is holy, and the more we draw near to Him, the more we feel our uncleanness. The more we serve God, the more we fear ourselves. When we first learn to fear the Lord, it is natural that we fear the self-element in everything we do. For example, your son may come and ask what he should do. If you fear God, you will be afraid of the self-element in your answer. This is the meaning of fear. Suppose a brother asks you for help. If you fear God, you will be afraid of yourself in rendering help to your brother. But at the same time, you will also be afraid of yourself in refusing to help your brother. You are constantly in fear of yourself. This is the meaning of fear. In your acquaintance with the brothers and sisters, you may constantly be afraid of any mixture of the self. This attitude is called fear. To fear is to be afraid of the self in everything that you do. In criticizing or praising others, a person may have the fear that this criticism or praise comes from the self. Having a fearful heart is being afraid of the mixture of self-element.</p><p>Let me give a few more examples. Some brothers and sisters like to write letters. Under normal circumstances, writing letters is not wrong. But some brothers and sisters have a natural fondness for writing letters. They waste a considerable amount of valuable time in this matter. If we fear God, we will be afraid of our self even in writing letters. Any time we do something for ourselves, by ourselves, with our own goals in mind, for our own interest, and with the self in full view, we are not being fearful. Being fearful is being afraid of the self in everything and being concerned that we do not offend God in anything. This applies even to the way we deal with our children and with clothing and other necessities. We should be afraid that we have a self-element in the way we deal with our children and with clothing and other necessities, and we should be afraid of offending God in these matters. This apprehension concerning the self is proper fear. We may discover some fault in a brother and may want to rebuke him. But if we live before the Lord, the minute we set our mind on the matter, we will pray, "Lord, I am afraid of self-activity in rebuking my brother." This is the meaning of fear. However, if we are afraid of rebuking our brother just because we do not want to offend his feelings, this is not fear. To fear does not mean to be afraid of difficulties; it does not mean to be sensitive to human feelings. To fear means to be afraid of the activity of the self. The only thing we have to be afraid of is the self. Some people are worried about many things. They are worried about this and that. As a consequence, inexperienced ones say that they are very spiritual. But those who genuinely fear the Lord are not afraid of this and that. They are only afraid of one thing&mdash;the self; they are afraid of anything that may not be of God, through God, for God, or unto God. They are afraid of their self-element. This is the proper meaning of fear. Brothers and sisters, as we grow in life, we will not be afraid of many things. We will only be afraid of the self; we will be afraid of offending God. When some brothers and sisters find out something wrong with other brothers and sisters, their mind may try to come up with some clever ways to deal with the situation. Is this spiritual? We cannot say that this is spiritual. This is being political. Even if one succeeds, there will be no spiritual content or result to it. It is self when we deal with others in anger, and it is also self when we deal with others with smiles and subtlety. Brothers and sisters, our temper is not an expression of the fear of God, and our gentle tactics are not expressions of the fear of God. Being political is exercising the self. Anyone who is political is not being fearful of God. Those who fear God are afraid of the self not only when they lose their temper, but also when they deal with others in a gentle way. Our temper is often an expression of the self, and our gentle treatment of others is a greater expression of the self. In our gentleness we have not feared God. To fear is to maintain an attitude of apprehension about our self before God. The most precious attitude a man can have before the Lord is a fearful heart. This means that he is afraid of the presence of self within. This is being fearful.</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_050.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_052.html">Next</a> </body></html>
