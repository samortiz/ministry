   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>2.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Freed from the Law of the Old Man</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The regenerated man, having the old man crucified, is now free from the law of the old man Rom 7:3, 4, 6; Gal 2:19 .</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The law was given to the old man, but the old man, the old husband, is dead.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Since my old husband is dead, I, as his wife, am discharged from his law.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Paul says that the law of the husband governs the wife as long as her husband lives.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>However, when the husband dies, the wife is free.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Our old husband was our old man.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Now we are the regenerated new man.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Since the law was given to the old husband and since he died on the cross, we are discharged from his law.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>This is why we are no longer under the law.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>3.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Married to Christ, the New Husband</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Now we are married to Christ, our new husband.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>We have seen that Romans 7:4 says that we are married to Christ, even Him Who has been raised from among the dead.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>In 2 Corinthians 11:2 Paul also says that he has espoused us to one husband, Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Christ is our new husband.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>4.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Taking Christ as the Head</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>As regenerated beings, both male and female believers are a part of the wife.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Since Christ is our husband we must depend on Him and take Him as our Head Eph 5:23 .</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>If we do this, we will bear fruit in resurrection to God 7:4 and serve the Lord in newness of spirit 7:6 .</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>We will no longer be in the flesh, but in the newness of the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The deep thought here corresponds to the depth of God s justification seen in the example of Abraham.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>In God s justification He called His chosen people out from everything other than God back to Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>He called them out of their fallen state back to Himself, that His called and chosen people should not depend upon themselves for their living, but depend upon God for everything.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>This means that as they come back to God they take Him as their husband.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>To take God as our husband means to terminate all that we are, have, and do and to trust in God for everything.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Taking Christ as our husband also means that we believe in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>No longer should we live by ourselves but by Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>We must let Christ live for us.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Hence, the deep thought in Romans 7:1-6 corresponds to the deep thought concerning justification in Romans 4: God s intention is to bring us back to Himself and cause us to place our full trust in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>No longer should we live by ourselves, act by ourselves, or be anything in ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>We must be totally terminated, and our head must be completely covered.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>We are no longer the husband.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>We, as the old man, have been crucified.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Christ is now our husband.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>In any wedding ceremony the bride s head is always covered.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Thus, at a wedding there are two persons but just one head.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The wife s head is covered by the husband, and the husband is the head.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>What has become of the wife?</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>She is no longer independent.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>She has been reduced to being nobody in herself.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Do you like to hear this?</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>I do.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>I do not like to hear it because I am a husband, but because I am a part of the wife.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>I have been completely nullified and I am nobody.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Christ is my husband and my head.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>I have no head of my own.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>My head has been covered.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Christ is not only my head He is also my person.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>The wives must take their husbands as their person, not only as their head.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>We must even take Christ as our life.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Christ is our husband, our head, our person, and our life.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>We have been terminated and have become nobody.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Christ lives in us and for us.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>I have been fully called out of everything else and called into Him.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>I believe in Him and put my whole trust in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Christ is everything to me.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>He is my husband, my head, my person, and my life.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Therefore, I am fully under grace, no longer under law in any way.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>The law has nothing to do with me, and I have nothing to do with the law.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Through the law I am dead to the law Gal 2:19 .</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Now in grace I am alive to God.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Are you still loaded with all the old teachings which command you to do so many things?</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Whenever you try to do anything on your own, it means that you, as the old man once again, are turning to Hagar.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>All you can produce is Ishmael.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Do not join yourself to Hagar, divorce her.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Put her aside and tell her that you have nothing to do with her.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Then, as the new man, come to Sarah, the grace of God, and in union with her you will produce Isaac, Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>You will experience Christ and enjoy Him.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>This is not only correct doctrinally but wonderfully true according to our experience.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Let us consider Galatians 4:21-26 a little further.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>In this passage Paul allegorizes Hagar and Sarah as two covenants: Hagar as the covenant of the law and Sarah as the covenant of grace.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>By this we can understand that Hagar typifies the covenant of law and that Sarah typifies the covenant of grace.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>Thus, Ishmael was produced by the work of the law, and Isaac was brought forth by grace.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>Galatians 4:31 says, So then, brethren, we are not children of the bondwoman, but of the free.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>This means that we are not children of the law, but children of grace.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>Therefore, if we go to Hagar we turn to the law, but if we come to Sarah we turn to grace.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>We all must come to Sarah and be under grace that we may experience Christ more and more.</S>
