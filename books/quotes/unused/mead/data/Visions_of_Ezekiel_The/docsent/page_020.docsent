   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE ISSUE OF COORDINATION Becoming Burning Coals</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The result of the coordination of the four living creatures is that they become the burning coals.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>They now look like something burning.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>There is a fire among them and with them.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Because they are coordinated as one, God comes in as the fire and they become the burning coals.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Every living creature becomes a burning coal.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>How can we know whether or not in a particular local church there is the proper coordination?</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>We can tell by the burning coals.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Is the church burning?</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>If there is no burning, it is a strong proof that there is no coordination.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Where there is coordination, there will surely be the burning.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The burning will do several things.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>First, the burning will burn out all the negative things.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>If you have a heap of coals burning together, what could exist among them?</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Whatever is put upon them will be burned.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>If in the church there is the proper coordination, there will be the burning to burn out the worldliness, the flesh, the self-aim, the self-goal, the pride, the boasting, and all kinds of negative things.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Even all kinds of opinions, teachings, and doctrines will be burned out by the coordination.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>There will be the burning because everyone is in the proper coordination.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Among them there is nothing but burning.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>No opinions can remain.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>No self, no flesh can remain.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Sometimes the leading ones or some of the saints are just playing.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>But in a coordinated church where there is the burning, all the playing will be burned out.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Second, the burning of the coordination will make you fervent, hot, and on fire!</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>There will be no coldness or lukewarmness.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Everyone will be burned and burning.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>When people come in they will realize that they cannot stay unless they are willing to be burned.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>They will say, "Do not touch these people, these people are awful; they will burn you.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Even if you shake hands with them you will be burned."</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The coordination brings in a real burning, a real fervency.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>This burning will not allow you to be like Laodicea.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The church in Laodicea was lukewarm, having no fervency, no burning.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Third, the burning in the coordination will produce the power and impact of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The impact in the local church comes out of the burning.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>If you desire to have an impact, you must be coordinated.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>You need the burning of the coordination.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Then, out of your burning there will be the impact and the power.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The negative things will be burned out, you will be on fire, and you will have the power with the impact.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Becoming Burning Torches</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Not only do the four living creatures look like burning coals, but they also look like burning torches.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The coals are for burning, but the torches are for enlightening.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>From the proper coordination in the local church there will be not only the burning, but also the enlightening and shining.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Whenever you touch the church you should be able to realize that there is nothing of darkness among these people.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Every corner is thoroughly enlightened.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Light is there.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>It may be that when you get into a local church, there is the sense of darkness.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Nothing is clear; nothing is in the light; everything is dark and every part is under darkness.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>This is because the church is divided and does not have the proper coordination.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>If the church has the proper coordination, every corner will be under the light.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Having a Fire Going Up and Coming Down</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Among the coordinated living creatures, while they are the burning coals and the burning torches, there is a fire among them going up and down.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>This fire is God Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Whenever the church is properly coordinated, burning as coals and enlightening as torches, there will be the divine fire going up and coming down all the time.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Not Walking but Running</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>The living creatures, having such a coordination, being the burning coals and the burning torches, and having the fire going up and coming down, will not walk but run 1:14 .</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>They run because they have the power and the impact.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>In some local churches there is no running, but fighting.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>In others they are not fighting, they are just squatting, just sitting.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>The proper church is the church that runs.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>They run because they have the proper coordination.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>They run like lightning, and as they run they give people the light.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>In their running there is the lightning.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>While they run they flash the lightning.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>This is the proper church life.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Every local church must be like this.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>This is the coordination and this is the proper move of the local church.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Without such a coordination there is no move of a local church.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>The move is in the coordination.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>CONCLUSION</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>These verses show us how that we may have the proper coordination.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>We all must learn the four kinds of walks: the straightforward walk, the backward walk, the sideways walk to the right, and the sideways walk to the left.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>This will give us a good coordination.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Then we will be the burning coals and the shining, burning torches, and we will have God as the divine fire among us going up and coming down.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>This will become our power and our impact.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>People will see the light in our running.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>Wherever we go and whatever we do, we will manifest the lightning.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>There will be the flashing of light, causing people to be enlightened.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>Such a running and such a moving is the proper church life.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>Coordination will bring in the Lord's presence and the Lord's blessing.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>Furthermore, such a practice of coordination will always keep the church in a proper balance.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>It will prevent us from going to any extreme.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>We must apply the matter of coordination not only within a local church, but also among all the local churches.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>We all must love to be "followers of the churches" 1 Thes 2:14 .</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>We are one body in one move of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>When one church is taking the lead in a certain direction under the leading of the Holy Spirit, we all must learn to walk backward and sideways to follow.</S>
