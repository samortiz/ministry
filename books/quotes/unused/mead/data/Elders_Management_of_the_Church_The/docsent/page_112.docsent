   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>O. Leading Others to Accept Coordination</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>It is at this point that we can have genuine coordination.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>This is not the coordination we had when we first entered into the service.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>It is the coordination that comes after we have learned many lessons.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>It is only at this point that such a person truly understands what it means to accept coordination before God.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>To accept coordination is nothing other than to accept the restriction of those who are fellow members and who are serving together with you.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Coordination is a restriction; it is a total restriction by others.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>I cannot serve alone; I can only serve together with the brothers and sisters in the church.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>I can only accept the others' restriction and coordinate with them.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>If they are spiritual, I have to coordinate with them.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>If they are not spiritual, I also have to coordinate with them.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>If they are deep, I have to coordinate with them.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>If they are superficial, I also have to coordinate with them.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>If they are natural, I have to coordinate with them.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>If they are carnal, I still have to coordinate with them.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>I can only stand on their side.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>I cannot ask them to stand on my side.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>All the reasons for not being able to coordinate should not come from my side.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>I have been led to learn the lesson of the cross and have been broken.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Today I will take the restriction of the whole church.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>I accept this coordination.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>At this time, we will have the genuine coordination, and at this time, such a coordination will be in oneness, and it will be knitted together firmly and fitted together properly.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Brothers, you and I are still in the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>If we never arrive at this stage, our mutual coordination can never be lasting.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>There can be many reasons for problems caused in our coordination.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>There are the carnality, the opinions, and the misunderstandings.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>There are also the many works of the enemy.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Only when we reach this stage can our carnality, opinions, misunderstandings, and the works of the enemy lose their effectiveness.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Towards all the things that are not of God, this is a body that is immune; no bacteria can have any effect on it.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>This is the only kind of coordination that is solid and lasting.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>P. Leading Others to Know the Body</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>By this time, they will come into a realm; they will touch something and will realize the glorious fact that the church is the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>They will truly touch the reality of the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>By that time, you will have done a glorious work before the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Only this can be considered the true building up of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Only this can be considered the true managing of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Only then is there a true coordination worked out.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Perhaps of the three to five hundred brothers and sisters serving in coordination here, only twenty to thirty have arrived at such a kind of coordination, while all the other ones are outside such a coordination.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>We do not at all belittle those who are outside this coordination, for a person has to have the outward coordination before he can have the inward coordination.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>But the twenty or thirty brothers and sisters who have been brought through each of the preceding ten or more points have finally reached this last point and have really come to realize what the Body is.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The coordination for these is deep, genuine, and weighty.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The life of the church depends upon them, and the life span of the church depends upon them.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>They are like the kernel within an almond seed, where the life is contained and where the center of life exists.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The church is completely hinged upon them and is entrusted to them.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>With such a center, the church will be stable and firm.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>We should also believe that these twenty or thirty people will go on to lead others, just as we do.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>After a period of time, they will bring forth manyfold others like themselves.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>In this way the church will ever continue to reproduce and will be built up.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>This is the management of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>If the elders will go on in this way, I believe many will discover a rich wellspring.</S>
