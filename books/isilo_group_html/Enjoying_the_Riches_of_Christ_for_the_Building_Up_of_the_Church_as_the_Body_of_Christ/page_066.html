What is there at the beginning is also there at the end. At the beginning of the Bible there was the tree of life, and at the end of the Bible we have the same tree of life. At the beginning there was the river flowing, and at the end the flowing river again appears. At the beginning of the Bible there were gold, bdellium (pearl), and onyx, the precious stones in the flow of the flowing river. At the end of the Bible there are the same materials: gold, pearl, and precious stones built together as a city. Lastly, at the beginning of the Bible there was a bride built up by God, and at the end of the Bible there is also a bride.<p>We must be clear that at the beginning there was not a city; there was just a garden. At the end of the Bible, however, instead of a garden there is a city. The record at the two ends of the Bible is figurative. As a figure, a garden mostly signifies something natural; in a garden there are the things of nature. In a city, however, the main feature is building. In the whole universe, according to the record of the Bible, God has only two kinds of works: the work of creation and the work of building. His first work was the work of creation, and His second work is the work of building. Moreover, God&#8217;s creation is for God&#8217;s building. However, many Christians have not seen this important point.<p>There is no doubt that God&#8217;s creation has been fully completed. Now God&#8217;s work is the building. Genesis, the first book of the Bible, is a book of creation, and Revelation, the last book of the Bible, is a book of building. The Bible began with creation, and it ends with God&#8217;s building. Now God is in the process of building, and we are under the process of God&#8217;s building. This is why in these last days the Lord will recover the important matter of His building.<h2 class=head1>THE RECOVERY OF GOD&#8217;S ULTIMATE AND CONSUMMATE INTENTION</h2><p>With the Reformation about five hundred years ago, God began His recovery. Throughout these five hundred years many things have been recovered. The first item recovered was justification by faith. Following that many other items were recovered. We believe that the last item of God&#8217;s recovery is the building, because this is the last item, the last point, in the whole Bible. What is the last item in the entire Bible of sixty-six books? It is a city built by God with gold, pearl, and precious stones.<p>Without a doubt history shows us that this point has been fully neglected. Even today many dear saints pay their full attention to the preaching of the gospel, the edification of the saints, holiness, the victorious life, spirituality, and to many other things. Many dear Christians are busy with many things, but very few today care for the building. People today spend much time for the preaching of the gospel, and nothing is wrong with this. We do need the preaching of the gospel, but we need to realize that preaching is not for its own sake. Many are also busy with the study of the Bible. That is not wrong; it is absolutely right to study the Bible, but study should not be merely for the sake of study. Today we also have mission work. That is marvelous, and we praise the Lord for this. In the past few centuries the Lord raised up much mission work to bring His gospel to every corner of this earth. However, mission work should not be merely for mission work. The Lord also raised up the experience of the inner life, especially in the past three hundred years. Since the time of Madame Guyon, this has been a great help to many seeking saints, and we again thank the Lord for this. However, even the inner life should not be for the inner life. Many doctrines have also been recovered. We thank God for this, but even the doctrines should not be only for the doctrines. We also have the so-called Pentecostal or charismatic things. Of course, some are not genuine; some are no doubt human-manufactured, but still some are real. We praise the Lord for all these items, yet all these items should not be for their own sake. They should be for the building. God&#8217;s intention is ultimately to have the building.<p>The building is God&#8217;s ultimate consummation. Read the Bible again. If we do not have the building of God, we are short of at least the last two chapters. Our book of Revelation may only have twenty chapters. It may not have chapters twenty-one and twenty-two. We very much need these two chapters. In these last days the Lord has truly come to these two chapters.<br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_065.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_067.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Enjoying the Riches of Christ for the Building Up of the Church as the Body of Christ &nbsp; pg 66</div><br></body></html>
