   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Question: We are caring for a meeting that has three new ones who are all at different stages of growth.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Many times it seems that they all want to talk at once.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Sometimes it seems that the meeting will actually divide because the young ones are talking so much.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>I feel that we should take the lead somewhat, but I do not know what to do.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>What should we do in this situation?</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Answer: You should never try to keep a meeting that much in order or that quiet.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>We always expect to have an orderly meeting, but we should not have this kind of expectation.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>That is religious.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Let the new ones feel free.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>If three of them would speak at the same time, you should say something to them, but you must say it in a happy and encouraging way.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>When these three all start to speak at the same time, you may smile and say, "I am so happy that you all will say something.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>What if we let this dear one speak first?"</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Surely the new ones will listen to one another, and the two whom you stopped will not be offended.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>It all depends upon how you handle the situation and how you speak to them about this kind of matter.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>When the first one finishes, do not ask the second one to speak right away.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Instead, take the opportunity to answer some of the first one's problems.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>In this way you can turn the whole meeting, and the other two will not be offended.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>This is another thing you must learn in handling the group meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Question: I was in a group meeting that was very enjoyable with a lot of speaking, but then one brother began to speak for over ten minutes.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>He went on and on, and all the new ones became uncomfortable.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>One of the new ones even left the room.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Eventually I said, "Brother, let's all sing a hymn."</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Is this the way to handle this kind of situation?</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Answer: You have to be wise.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>At the opening of the meeting you may say, "What if each one speaks for not more than two minutes."</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>We can do this at the beginning of the meeting, making it a kind of regulation.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Even if you do not say such a thing, if one is speaking quite long, for eight to ten minutes, you can still handle it in a loving way.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>You can say, "Brother, let's give some time to the others."</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Most people would listen to this.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The young ones would usually take your word, but the older ones would say, "Give me another minute."</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>This means another ten minutes.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Do not argue, and let him continue.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Then after one minute, say, "Brother, one minute is over.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Let's turn the meeting to others."</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Most people, even the older ones, would take this word.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>But sometimes the storm comes, and when it comes you have to endure it.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Do not be bothered; it will pass.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>This is not a problem, so do not make an issue out of it.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>If you do, you will turn this matter into a problem, and you will suffer.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Question: One thing we have been practicing in our group meeting is to ask the new ones a question to draw out something from them.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Is this profitable?</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Answer: This is altogether right.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>If the new ones do not have any questions to ask in the group meeting, you must learn how to initiate a subject by asking a question.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>However, you have to ask your question just as a new one.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Do not ask it as if you were the Apostle Paul.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>That will cause trouble.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>You must ask a beginning type of question just like a new one in order to stir up some answering.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Then those answers will all become teachings.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Question: In the past you said that we should go to a meeting with a definite goal.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>If in a group meeting the questions being asked do not match the goal of the meeting, should we answer the questions and disregard our goal?</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Answer: What is the goal of the group meeting?</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>The goal of the group meeting is to perfect the saints; it is not any particular subject.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>You may have a burden to teach people about justification, and now they are asking you about the eating and drinking of God, but this is not your goal for the meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>This shows that you are religious; you are too legal.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>The goal of the group meeting is to perfect people.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>As long as you can carry out this goal, that is marvelous.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Whether you teach justification or you teach people why we should eat and drink God, both help to fulfill our purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>The purpose is to perfect.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Surely you have to prepare something, but you still must leave this matter wholly in the hands of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Then you can be flexible and simply follow.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>You must learn how to be flexible all the time.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>You may feel that to learn all these things is too difficult, but this is not my invention.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>This is what the Bible reveals.</S>
