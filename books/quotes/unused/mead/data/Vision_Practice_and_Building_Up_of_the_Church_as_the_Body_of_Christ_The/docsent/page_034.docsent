   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER NINE PRACTICAL MATTERS IN THE SPIRIT</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>FOR THE BUILDING UP OF THE CHURCH Scripture Reading: Eph 4:29-30; 5:18-27; 6:10-11, 18</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The last portion of the book of Ephesians is instruction concerning the practical church life.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>We should remember that after the apostle Paul gave a full vision of the church, he offered a prayer at the end of chapter 3 specifically that we would be strengthened into our inner man that Christ may make His home in our heart, that is, that He may spread, take over, and occupy our whole inward being vv.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>16-19 .</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>This is a very basic prayer for the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The church life is not merely outward in practice.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Rather, it is something inward.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>We need to keep in mind that we have an inner man, a human spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Our inner man must be strengthened; then all our inward parts will be taken over, possessed, by Christ, and He will make home and settle down in our whole being.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Eventually we will be filled unto all the fullness of God; that is, we will be fully mingled with God.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>This is very basic to the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>We can never have a church life by ourselves, in ourselves, or with ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The church life must be a life of our being mingled with God in which our inner man, our spirit, is strengthened.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Our inner man needs to be strong.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Our greatest need for strengthening is not in our body or even our soul our mind, will, and emotion.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Our spirit must be the strongest part.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>It must be prevailing, having the first place, so that our entire being comes under the inner man and Christ has full control of it.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Then there is the possibility for us to be filled unto the fullness of God.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>This means that we will be thoroughly, wholly, and fully mingled with God.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>It is in this mingling that we have the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>This is a very basic matter, and we cannot stress it too much.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>We need to give message after message to stress this one matter, that our inner man must be strengthened and that Christ must take over our whole being so we can be mingled with God and filled unto all the fullness of God.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>THE PRACTICE OF THE CHURCH LIFE</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>BEING IN SPIRIT</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>After the prayer in chapter 3, the writer goes into the details of the practice of the church life in chapter 4, which are mainly a matter in spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The first item of the practice of the church life is to keep the oneness, which is a matter of the Spirit vv.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>3-6 .</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The last three chapters of this book do not give the ground to mere teachings or doctrines.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The church life is not a matter of teaching or doctrine.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>It is a matter of being in the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>If we are in the spirit, we have the oneness, but in doctrinal teachings we have only divisions.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>We can never be one in doctrines.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Not even a brother and his wife can be absolutely one in doctrinal teachings.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>We can never be one in teachings, but there is a real oneness in spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>If we would forget about our natural mentality and reasonings and take care of the spirit within, we will be one with all the saints who are in spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The genuine oneness is the oneness of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Therefore, we must be in spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>When we are out of the spirit, we are in division.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>In so many matters we are simply different.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Therefore, we must learn to be in spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Arguing gets us nowhere; it only causes divisions.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The situation of Christians today is like a honeycomb, full of divisions and compartments.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Whenever we are out of the spirit, we are in a compartment, a small division.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The genuine oneness is of the Spirit, so we need to learn to be in spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Almost the entire first part of chapter 4 of Ephesians is an instruction on the way to keep the oneness.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The way to keep the oneness is in the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>This spirit is the mingled spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>The divine Spirit and the human spirit are now one.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>It is this mingled spirit that saturates and takes over our whole being.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>When our spirit spreads into our mind, we are renewed in the spirit of our mind v. 23 . The only way to be renewed is for the spirit to get into our mind to saturate, take over, possess, and occupy it.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Our mind predominates our whole being, so the spirit must take control of the mind.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>In this way our whole being is renewed.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Moreover, this renewing has much to do with putting on the new man.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Strictly speaking, the new man is the Body 2:15-16 .</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Therefore, to put on the new man is simply to put on the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>This is to have the church life in practicality.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Many Christians today talk about the church life, or the Body life, but where is the Body life?</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>The practical Body life is in the renewing in the spirit of our mind.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>As we are being renewed in the spirit of our mind, we are gradually putting on the new man; that is, we are gradually coming into the practice of the Body life.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>We began to practice the church life in Los Angeles a few years ago.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Now we can check with ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>How much church life we have had depends on the degree to which we have been renewed in the spirit of our mind.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>If we have only a small amount of renewal in the spirit of our mind, we have only a small amount of church life.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>The church life we have cannot exceed our being renewed in the spirit of the mind.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>This is not a mere doctrine; it is very practical.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>The oneness is in the spirit, and the putting on of the new man, the Body life, is also in the spirit.</S>
