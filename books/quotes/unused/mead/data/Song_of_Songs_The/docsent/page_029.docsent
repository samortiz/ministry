   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Verses 9 and 10 say, "King Solomon made himself a chariot of the wood of Lebanon.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>He made the pillars thereof of silver, the bottom thereof of gold, the covering of it of purple, the midst thereof being paved with love, for the daughters of Jerusalem."</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>This is the second part of the answer.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The word "behold" in verse 7 covers verses 9 and 10 also.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The word "chariot" is translated "palanquin" in Darby's New Translation.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The bed is used by Solomon in the night, whereas the palanquin is used by him in the day.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>If the bed speaks of his rest, the palanquin must speak of his move.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>If the bed denotes his dwelling, the palanquin must denote his fellowship.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>If the bed is toward the enemy, the palanquin must be toward the friend.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>We see a palanquin, not a chariot.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>If it were a chariot, there would be the need for a wheel.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>But a palanquin is carried by men.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>We should recall the history of the ark.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The ark was not to be drawn by oxen.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Rather, it had to be carried by the sons of Kohath.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>This means that in His move among God's children, Christ is carried by those who belong to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The palanquin is made of the wood of Lebanon, which is cedar.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Wood denotes humanity, whereas the wood of Lebanon denotes uplifted and noble humanity.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>"He made the pillars thereof of silver."</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>This speaks of His redemption.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>In the objective sense, it means that Christ is carried to others by means of His redemption.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>In the subjective sense, it means that the work of the cross has to remove all flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Only then can we express Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>"The bottom thereof of gold."</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>This speaks of the fact that everything is from God.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The divine life is the life we received at the time of regeneration.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>We come into full participation of this life when we become absolutely one with the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>God's life is the unique basis upon which we can express Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Outside of God's life, we have no other ground to stand on.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>"The covering of it of purple."</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>It is purple because He is King, and He must reign.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>All the government is upon His shoulder.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>He will receive the kingship and sit as King.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>"The midst thereof being paved with love, for the daughters of Jerusalem."</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Love is under the feet; it is at the bottom of the palanquin.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>This means that all the saints love Him.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The question that was posed asked, "Who is this that cometh out of the wilderness?", and the answer was, "King Solomon made himself a palanquin."</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>This speaks of the union between the believers and the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The answer first covers Solomon's position before his enemy.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Now it covers his position before his friend.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>In the first case, it speaks of Solomon's power; in this case, it speaks of Solomon's glory.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>In the first part, we see Solomon's strength being the maiden's strength.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>In this part, we see Solomon's glory being the maiden's glory.</S>
