   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE CONTINUATION OF THE OLD BEHAVIOR</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Jacob became crippled after Peniel, but he still did not know what he had experienced.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>When the day broke, he still acted according to his original plan.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Many people condemn Jacob and pass judgment on him.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>They think that Jacob should have stopped his activities because he had been touched by God.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Since he was touched by God already, every problem should have been solved.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>This is the mentality of those who do not know themselves.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>They think that everything is clear-cut and that all of their problems can be solved in one breath.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Actually, things are never that simple.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>We have to realize that experience is not a whim of an idea.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Jacob could not become Israel in an instant.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Since he had made all the arrangements the day before, he carried out his scheme as planned.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>But we have to realize one thing: After God touched the hollow of his thigh, he was different when he met Esau.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>We can see that Jacob was beginning to change.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Let us read Genesis 33:1-3: "And Jacob lifted up his eyes, and looked, and, behold, Esau came, and with him four hundred men.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>And he divided the children unto Leah, and unto Rachel, and unto the two handmaids.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>And he put the handmaids and their children foremost, and Leah and her children after, and Rachel and Joseph hindermost.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>And he passed over before them, and bowed himself to the ground seven times, until he came near to his brother."</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>He was still as cunning as before.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>He even bowed down seven times to the ground before his brother.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Verse 4 says, "And Esau ran to meet him, and embraced him, and fell on his neck, and kissed him: and they wept."</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Jacob did not expect that his schemes would not be needed and that all his plans were in vain.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>God's protection was real.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>All he needed was a little faith and he could have avoided much vexation and fear!</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Esau did not try to kill him; rather, he was coming to welcome him.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>He embraced Jacob, fell on his neck, and kissed him.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>All of Jacob's cleverness and plans came to nothing!</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>When he left his brother and met Rachel, he wept.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Now when he came back and met Esau, he wept again.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Some people weep because they like to weep by nature.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>But Jacob was a resourceful person; he did not weep easily.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>However, when he saw his brother, he wept.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>This was a rare occasion.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>This means that the experience of Peniel had made Jacob a soft person.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Verses 6 through 8 say, "Then the handmaidens came near, they and their children, and they bowed themselves.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>And Leah also with her children came near, and bowed themselves: and after came Joseph near and Rachel, and they bowed themselves.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>And he said, What meanest thou by all this drove which I met?</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>And he said, These are to find grace in the sight of my lord."</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>He was still delivering the speech he had prepared the day before.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The day before he had prepared to call Esau "my lord."</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>He went according to the original plan and called him "my lord."</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>A man can be dealt with in his natural life, and his power can be stripped by God, but his outward conduct may take a few weeks or even a few months to change.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Verses 9 and 10 say, "And Esau said, I have enough, my brother; keep that thou hast unto thyself.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>And Jacob said, Nay, I pray thee, if now I have found grace in thy sight, then receive my present at my hand: for therefore I have seen thy face, as though I had seen the face of God, and thou wast pleased with me."</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>We should not consider this word as Jacob's pretense.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>He said, "I have seen thy face, as though I had seen the face of God."</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Jacob was not trying to be humble in saying this.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Of course Jacob was very good at pretending, but this word was not his pretense.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>There was deep significance to his word.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>This word means that for him to see Esau's face was for him to face Peniel.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>What does this mean?</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>It means that when one sees the face of those he has offended and sinned against, he sees the face of God.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Whenever we meet those whom we have sinned against, we meet God.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Whenever we come across those whom we have offended, we come across judgment.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>If we owe anyone anything, if we have ill-treated anyone, or if we have done anyone harm, we will see God every time we see them if the matter is not settled.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>They will become as fearful as God.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Every time we see their face we will be reminded of God, and every time we come across their way we will come across judgment.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Jacob was stating the real fact.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>For Jacob, seeing Esau's face was indeed "as though I had seen the face of God."</S>
