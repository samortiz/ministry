L.</h2><p>I was born into a non-Christian family. I heard the gospel in Chefoo and believed in the Lord Jesus. After I was saved I became very hungry for God's word. But I lived a vacillating and unsteady life for about half a year. I worked in the courthouse and often was ridiculed by others. Yet I loved my Lord. He is so glorious, rich, and real to me. On the one hand, I saw the perfection of the Lord, and on the other hand, I saw my own imperfections. The Lord did some stripping work in me, and for a few years I lived in poverty. Sister Peace Wang once said that poverty is necessary and that one does not know God's riches without poverty. I intended to migrate to northwest China for the gospel, but I was hindered by the outbreak of the war with Japan. During the subsequent years, I touched the Lord's love and could not stay away from Him. At that time I understood how we can live with or without many things. The most important thing is to have the Lord. As long as I have the Lord, I am satisfied. He is the only satisfaction of my life. My relationship with the Lord is like that of a fish with water. I cannot leave Him. As soon as I leave Him, I will be finished. Thank the Lord that I was granted permission to come to the mountain to be trained. I have a few questions, and I wonder whether Brother Nee can answer them for me.</p><p>1) What is the difference between dying with the Lord and the killing of the Lord's light? 2) If we want to preach the gospel, do we ask the Lord to give us a love for man's soul? 3) Can we serve the Lord by taking up a secular profession? 4) How do we separate the inner man from the outer man?</p><h2 class="head1">BROTHER NEE'S COMMENT</h2><h2 class="head2">Dying with the Lord<br />and Being Killed by His Light</h2><p>First Corinthians 1:30 says, "But of Him you are in Christ." All of our experiences are of the Lord; they all are part of the Lord's experience. This is like saying that the experiences of a pregnant mother are the experiences of the fetus. Wherever the mother goes, the baby follows inside her womb. Hebrews speaks of the Lord being a priest superior to Aaron. The Lord was of the tribe of Judah. According to the flesh, He could not even be a priest. Judah was the tribe of the king. But the Lord was made a priest according to the order of Melchisedec. This is the reason He was greater than Aaron, who was a priest according to the order of the tribe of Levi. Abraham was an ancestor of Levi. When Melchisedec offered up sacrifices on behalf of Abraham, Aaron was still in Abraham's loins (Heb. 7:10). This proves that Melchisedec was greater than Abraham. In being a priest after the order of Melchisedec, Christ is greater than Abraham. Levi offered one tenth of what he had to Melchisedec through Abraham because he was in Abraham's loins. This is like saying that the entire human race was in Adam's loins. When Adam sinned, the entire human race sinned. We are included in the same act of sin; we have taken the same fruit of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil.</p><p>Individually speaking, I have never been to the garden of Eden. But in Adam I was there. When I was in Singapore, I met a pregnant sister. She visited Amoy for some time and later returned to Singapore. When I visited Singapore a second time, her child had grown very much. I asked the child if he had ever been to Amoy. The child said no. He had never been there as an individual, but he had been there in his mother's womb. This is what it means to be crucified with Christ. Although the child never saw Amoy while he was in his mother's womb, he was there in reality. Individually speaking he was never there. But jointly speaking he was there. Just as the death of Christ is a reality, our death in Him is also a reality. Because I am in Adam, I do not have to commit the same sin as Adam; yet I am still as much a sinner as Adam. Now I am in Christ. Just as Christ was crucified, I was crucified as well. Just as the Lord Jesus died, I have died also. This is what God has done through the cross of Christ. This is what it means to be crucified with Christ. This answers half of your first question.</p><p>The killing of the Lord's light is something subjective in our experience. When a man receives light, the death of the cross begins to work on him and strip him. When God takes away this and that from him, it is death operating in him. This is the meaning of 2 Corinthians 4:10, which says, "Always bearing about in the body the putting to death of Jesus." Everything human that has its origin in the self must be gradually removed. This work of the Lord is progressive and cumulative, with the result being "that the life of Jesus also may be manifested in our body. For we who are alive are always being delivered unto death for Jesus' sake....So then death operates in us, but life in you" (vv. 10-12). The first death relates to our crucifixion with the Lord; through this the problem of sin is settled. The second death relates to the self and the flesh. It strips the self and has nothing to do with sin. This conforms us to Christ more and more. It is the killing work of the Lord's light.</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_019.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_021.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Collected Works of Watchman Nee, The (Set 3) Vol. 58: Spiritual Judgment and Examples of Judgment &nbsp; pg 20</div><br></body></html>
