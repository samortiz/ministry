Being the God-allotted Portion of the Believers<br>as Their Life and Life Supply Today<br>and Their Glory in the Future</H2><P>Christ is the God-allotted portion of the believers (Col. 1:12) as their life and life supply today (Col. 3:4) and their glory in the future (Col. 1:27). Colossians 1:27 says that Christ in us is the hope of glory. As our God-allotted portion, Christ is our life today, and He will be our glory in the future.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>10. Being the Foundation Stone,<br>the Cornerstone, and the Topstone<br>of God's Building</H2><P>Christ is the foundation stone (1 Cor. 3:11; Isa. 28:16), the cornerstone (Eph. 2:20b), and the topstone (Zech. 4:7) of God's building.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>11. Being Resurrection, Life, Power, Wisdom:<br>Righteousness, Sanctification, and Redemption,<br>and the Reality of All Positive Things</H2><P>Christ is resurrection, life, power, wisdom: righteousness, sanctification, and redemption, and the reality of all positive things (John 11:25; 14:6; 1 Cor. 1:24, 30; Col. 2:16-17; Gal. 3:27; John 10:9; 1 Cor. 10:3-4). Colossians 2:16-17 says that eating, drinking, holidays, the Sabbath, and new moons all are shadows, and that the body of these shadows is Christ. According to Galatians 3:27, Christ is our clothing; that is, we wear Him. In John 10:9, Christ is our door; through Him we go out of the religious fold and enter into the rich pasture. In 1 Corinthians 10:3-4, Christ is our spiritual food and our spiritual drink; He is also the spiritual rock that follows us. He is the reality of all positive things.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>12. His Riches Being Unsearchable</H2><P>According to Ephesians 3:8, Christ's riches are unsearchable.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>13. Giving the Spirit Not by Measure</H2><P>Christ gives the Spirit not by measure (John 3:34b). Because He is all-inclusive and all-extensive, Christ is also immeasurable.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>14. His Grace Being Sufficient for Us</H2><P>The grace of Christ is sufficient for us (2 Cor. 12:9).</P><P>All of the above items concerning Christ are included in the Lord's recovery. Nearly all of them have been lost, missed, or put aside by Christianity.</P><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_008.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_010.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>A Brief Presentation of the Lord's Recovery &nbsp; pg 9</div><br></body></html>
