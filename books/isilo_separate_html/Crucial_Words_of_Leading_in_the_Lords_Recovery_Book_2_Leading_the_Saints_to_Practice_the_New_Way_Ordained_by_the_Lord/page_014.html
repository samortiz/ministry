<p>In pursuing the knowledge of the truth, no one should say that there is no opportunity; in particular, the trainees should not feel that there are not enough teachers. Everyone can enter into the Life-study messages. Even if there are some portions that you do not understand, you can all come together to discuss and learn from one another. Thus, you will be able to find a way. If you become well versed in all of the twelve hundred plus Life-study messages, you will be an outstanding person in regard to the knowledge of the Bible. On the other hand, we need to see that everywhere there is the urgent need of the ministry of the word. Therefore, we need to all be filled and equipped with the truth contained in the twenty-seven books of the New Testament. Not only so, one by one we need to practice to speak the truth. We now have an excellent opportunity. In Taipei alone, there are several dozen districts. Every district provides the opportunity to speak and is waiting for the ministry of the word. There are currently several hundred people in the training, and they can all go to different districts to minister life according to what they have learned. There is no need to give lengthy messages. To speak for five to ten minutes is sufficient. If we do this, the meetings in these districts will be immediately enriched.</p>
<p>This is the reason that we needed to change the system. The old way kept us in death for too long. Many among us have been elders for years, yet I wonder what we have been doing. The present condition of the brothers and sisters is more or less the same as it was five years ago. In the old way we did not render the proper leading to the brothers and sisters. As a result, not much progress was made. Should we now give the elders an examination? Those who are qualified will remain, and we will have to consider what to do with those who are not qualified. Whatever the case, there must also be a way for the elders to make progress.</p>
<p>In the Lord&rsquo;s work we must be right toward God, toward others, and toward ourselves. If I meet with the brothers and sisters for seven years and they remain the same, I am not right toward myself. Hence, we must all rise up to enter into the truth. If we would pay attention to the aspect of truth as well as to the aspect of life, we will be very useful. From now on, regardless of where we are and who we are, whether working saints or housewives, whether students or business people, whether full-time serving ones, elders, or co-workers, we must all pursue the truth.</p>
<p>First, we need to pursue the Life-studies. There are over twelve hundred Life-study messages. No matter how busy the elders may be, they need to spend at least ten minutes each day to read the Life-studies. In this way they can finish a message in three days. In one year they will have read at least one hundred and twenty messages, which is one-tenth of the twelve hundred messages. If they read in this way for ten consecutive years, they will be able to finish all of the Life-studies. If we enter into the Life-studies in such a way, the elders will definitely be different. Every one of them will be able to speak for the Lord and minister life.</p>
<p>Some of the elders&rsquo; children may already be serving full time, while their fathers, the elders, are still not able to stand up to speak for the Lord. This is not acceptable. If this is the case, I must condemn my work because it has not helped them. I know that they love the Lord, but they have not received the proper help in the matter of taking the lead. Much of my fellowship may offend them, but my intention is to give them the proper leading, hoping that from now on, if they continue to be elders, they will begin to read the Life-studies for at least ten minutes a day. In this way they will be able to stand up to speak and minister to the saints in the small groups and district meetings.</p>
<p>Every aspect of Taiwan is improving; only the church has not made progress and has not undergone any change. We need to wake up and pray to the Lord: &ldquo;O Lord, I am willing to change. I do not want to take the old way. I want to take the new way. Lord, although I do not know how to change, I pray that You would have mercy on me; I want to change.&rdquo; The elders need to wake up; otherwise, why should they bother to continue being elders? This does not mean that I am urging the elders to resign; rather, I am asking them to improve and make progress. They need to pray: &ldquo;Lord, I have been an elder in this meeting hall for ten years, but what have I actually accomplished?&rdquo; Of course, the elders in every locality have the accomplishment of standing for the Lord&rsquo;s testimony by maintaining a certain situation. We need to worship the Lord for this. Nevertheless, when we speak of engaging in warfare and going forward, they are utterly helpless. There are two reasons for this: a shortage in truth and an inadequacy in life. If the elders are rich in truth and have an adequate measure of life, they will be useful and be a blessing to the church.</p>
<p>My heart aches whenever I speak regarding this matter. If there were no church in this place, I would knock on the doors of my relatives. After saving one, I would take him with me to go out to knock on more doors. In this way I am sure that a church would be raised up within a few weeks. Not only so, at the end of the year there would be at least sixty, if not one hundred, saints in this church. I am sure of this. As long as we are willing to move, we will be able to accomplish something, but if we are not willing to move, we will not have any assurance of accomplishing anything. The attitude of &ldquo;not moving&rdquo; is fatal.</p>
<p>We have reached the stage where we should sit down and speak a frank word as to what we should do from now on. If we feel that the new way is right, we should put our whole being into it; if we do not feel that it is right, the old way is still there and we can easily return to it. However, if we want to take the new way, we must have a change in our attitude, intention, concept, and motive. Our inner being must completely change. If we do not change, we will not be able to take the new way. The first thing we need to change is our pursuit of the truth. I surely sympathize with the brothers because they all have jobs and are very busy; however, no matter how busy they are, they need to set aside at least ten minutes a day to pursue the truth.</p>
<p>Second, we all need to have a daily revival before the Lord. According to the principle of God&rsquo;s creation, when the day dawns, it does not stay bright forever; it remains bright for twelve hours at most. There are twelve hours in the night to provide us time for respite, consideration, and reflection so that we can consider whether the day was a success or a failure and hope that tomorrow morning will be a new day, a new beginning. The Bible says that God&rsquo;s lovingkindness and compassions are new every morning (Lam. 3:22-24). Every morning Jehovah God is our new portion that rises with the sun. His compassions are always new. We should all have a new beginning before God every morning, a beginning that is different from the past. We should forget yesterday and have a new beginning today. Today is a new revival, and every morning we need to have a revived living.</p>
<p>We should not excuse ourselves by saying that we are weak. We may be weak, but the Lord is not weak. First John 4:4 says, &ldquo;Greater is He who is in you than he who is in the world.&rdquo; In addition, Paul says, &ldquo;I am able to do all things in Him who empowers me&rdquo; (Phil. 4:13). In Philippians 1:19 he also speaks of &ldquo;the bountiful supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ.&rdquo; The promises are available, the Spirit of Jesus Christ is within us, and the One who empowers us is with us; these are all for us to apply.</p>
<p>Every morning when we come to the Lord&rsquo;s word, we need to tell the Lord, &ldquo;Amen, Lord. This is Your word. I read Your word not only in the morning but also in the evening. Lord, I do not have to wait until the morning to be revived; I want to be revived in the evening.&rdquo; We should have this kind of attitude and have such a transaction with the Lord; we should not remain in our old way. May the Lord have mercy on us.</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_013.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_015.html">Next</a> </body></html>
