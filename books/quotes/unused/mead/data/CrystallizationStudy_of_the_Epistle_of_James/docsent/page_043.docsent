   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The Synagogue of Satan</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Also, the synagogue was called by the Lord Jesus the "synagogue of Satan" Rev 2:9 .</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>C. Teaching the Jewish Believers</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>to Keep the Law of the Old Testament</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>James taught the Jewish believers to keep the law of the Old Testament 1:25; 2:8-12; 4:11-12 .</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>What a mixture this is!</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Keeping the law was the responsibility of the Jews, not of the believers.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>1.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Confirmed by James's Word</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>This is confirmed by James's word in Acts 15:21 and 21:20-25.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>In Acts 21 we are told that James and his co-elders in Jerusalem told the apostle Paul that thousands of believers in Jerusalem were enthusiastic for the law.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Based upon this, they asked Paul to show the Jews that he was not against the law but keeping the law.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>They proposed, according to the Jewish custom, that Paul make a Nazarite vow with God.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>This vow was completed with the offering of sacrifices.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Paul went to the temple and waited for the last day of his vow to offer the sacrifices.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>He carried out this vow to such an extent, but God would not tolerate his offering the sacrifices and came in to disrupt it.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Paul was arrested and eventually sent to Caesar's prison in Rome.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>God would not allow Paul to participate in carrying out the Nazarite vow, a strict Judaic practice.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>2.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>James Appreciating the Law</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>James appreciated the law, calling it the "perfect law, the law of freedom" and the "royal law," as the psalmists did in the Old Testament Psa 1:1-2; 19:7-11; 119:10-11, 43, 142, 151 .</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>No doubt, these words were quoted by James from the Psalms to describe the law.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>He uplifted the law to the uttermost.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>3.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Christ Having Ended the Law</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>But in God's New Testament dispensation, Christ has ended terminated and taken away the law Rom 10:4; Heb 10:9 .</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The law was the way by which God dealt with His people in the Old Testament, but James is in the New Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>In this New Testament, the way God takes to deal with His people is no longer by the law but by grace.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Actually, the law was ended and taken away by Christ on the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Colossians 2:14 reveals that the ordinances of the law were crucified on the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Christ brought many things to the cross to be crucified with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>He terminated you and me, the old man, Satan, sin, the world, and the ordinances of the law.</S>
