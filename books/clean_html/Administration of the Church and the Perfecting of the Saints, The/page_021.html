<h2 class="head1">THEOLOGICAL DISPUTES<br />
CONCERNING THE TRIUNE GOD</h2>
<p>There are two extreme and erroneous schools of teaching concerning the truth that God is triune, that is, three yet one. Tritheism stresses the matter of three, teaching that there are three separate Gods: the Father is one God, the Son is one God, and the Spirit is another God. Modalism stresses the matter of one, teaching that God ceased to be the Father when the Son was manifested and that God ceased to be the Son when the Son ascended and became the Spirit. Since the second century there have been many disputes concerning the Triune God. All the truths in the Bible have two aspects. The truth concerning God has the aspect of God being three and of His being one. The word <em>triune</em> comes from Latin and is composed of the words <em>three</em> and <em>one.</em></p>
<p>The Bible reveals that there is only one God. In the Old Testament the book of Isaiah says, &ldquo;I am Jehovah and there is no one else; / Besides Me there is no God&rdquo; (45:5). Psalm 86:10 says, &ldquo;You alone are God.&rdquo; The New Testament also says that God is one&mdash;there is one God (Mark 12:32; 1 Cor. 8:4, 6; 1 Tim. 2:5; James 2:19). However, the Bible also says that this God is the Father, the Son, and the Spirit (Matt. 28:19). Hence, in Christianity there is the term <em>Trinity,</em> which is used to express the truth that God is one in three persons. But this term can easily be understood as being tritheistic.</p>
<p>A co-worker, who was influenced by this term, came to Los Angeles in 1965 to argue with me. I asked, &ldquo;Brother, how many Gods would you say there are?&rdquo; He said, &ldquo;Three Gods.&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;Brother, never say such a thing; this is a great heresy.&rdquo; But he argued, &ldquo;Psalm 82 mentions <em>gods,</em>&rdquo; and I explained, &ldquo;The word <em>gods</em> in verse 1 refers to angels. There are many angels, but both the Old Testament and the New Testament say clearly that we have only one God.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Because Brother Nee realized that the term <em>Trinity</em> could be easily misunderstood, he preferred the term <em>triune.</em> The church fathers created the term <em>Trinity</em> because they did not understand the truth concerning the Triune God. In Chinese <em>Trinity</em> is rendered &ldquo;three persons in one entity.&rdquo; Our God is one, but He is the Father, the Son, and the Spirit. The error of modalism is that it does not confess the eternal coexistence of the Father, the Son, and the Spirit. Modalists accept the truth in the Bible concerning there being only one God, but they take this truth to the extreme and say that the Father, the Son, and the Spirit exist in three consecutive modes and do not coexist eternally. Because of this great error, modalists are heretical.</p>
<p>Some in the United States oppose us and say that we are modalistic. We told them that although we say that the Father, the Son, and the Spirit are one, we also confess the eternal coexistence of the Father, the Son, and the Spirit. John 1:1 says, &ldquo;In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.&rdquo; The phrase <em>the Word was God</em> indicates that the Word and God are one, and the phrase <em>the Word was with God</em> indicates that the Word and God are distinct. The word <em>with</em> proves that the Son did not come into existence after the Father. If the Son had come into existence after the Father, They could not have been with each other. In order for one to be with the other, They must exist at the same time. In John 17:5 the Lord Jesus prayed, &ldquo;Glorify Me along with Yourself, Father, with the glory which I had with You before the world was.&rdquo; This proves that the Father did not exist first and then become the Son, who then later became the Spirit.</p>
<p>Tritheists teach that the Father is the Father, the Son is the Son, and the Spirit is the Spirit. They do not confess that the Lord is the Spirit. Therefore, they interpret <em>the Lord</em> in 2 Corinthians 3:17 as &ldquo;God.&rdquo; They say that <em>the Lord is the Spirit</em> means the same as <em>God is Spirit</em> in John 4:24. This is their interpretation. However, if we read the context of 2 Corinthians 3:17, we will understand that they have misinterpreted this verse. Verse 14 says, &ldquo;Their thoughts were hardened; for until the present day the same veil remains at the reading of the old covenant, it not being unveiled to them that the veil is being done away with in Christ.&rdquo; This verse says that the veil is being done away with in Christ. Verses 15 and 16 say, &ldquo;A veil lies on their heart; but whenever their heart turns to the Lord, the veil is taken away.&rdquo; Verse 16 says that whenever their heart turns to the Lord, the veil is taken away. This is strong proof that these verses are speaking of the same thing. Christ in verse 14 is the Lord in verse 16. The Lord is Christ. In verse 14 the Bible says, &ldquo;Christ,&rdquo; and in verse 16 the Bible says, &ldquo;The Lord.&rdquo; Then verse 17 says, &ldquo;The Lord is the Spirit.&rdquo; Therefore, according to the context, the Lord refers to Christ.</p>
<p>Verse 18 says, &ldquo;We all with unveiled face, beholding and reflecting like a mirror the glory of the Lord, are being transformed into the same image from glory to glory, even as from the Lord Spirit.&rdquo; According to the context, this portion of the Scriptures is concerning our being transformed into the image of God&rsquo;s Son. Romans 8:29 also speaks of our being conformed to the image of God&rsquo;s Son. What 2 Corinthians calls the Lord&rsquo;s image is called the image of God&rsquo;s Son in Romans. This proves that the Lord in 2 Corinthians 3 is the Lord Jesus. Moreover, in 2 Corinthians 4:5 Paul says, &ldquo;We do not preach ourselves but Christ Jesus as Lord.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hence, according to the context of 2 Corinthians 3 and 4, the Lord is Christ. In order to conform to their theory, tritheists misinterpret <em>the Lord</em> in 2 Corinthians 3 as &ldquo;God.&rdquo; However, if we agree that <em>the Lord</em> here refers to <em>God,</em> we must say that since the Lord Jesus is God, and God is the Spirit, then the Lord Jesus must be the Spirit.</p>
<p>We have inherited the orthodox truth that has been passed down through the generations. This light is becoming brighter and clearer to us. Therefore, we can boldly declare, &ldquo;The Lord is the Spirit.&rdquo; The Spirit is the Triune God having passed through the processes of incarnation, human living, death, resurrection, ascension to the heavens, and descension to the earth; hence, the Spirit possesses both divinity and humanity. On this point we were greatly helped by Brother Andrew Murray&rsquo;s book <em>The Spirit of Christ.</em> Andrew Murray was probably the first to see that humanity is in the Spirit. We were also blessed by the Lord to see the type of the holy anointing oil in the Old Testament. The holy anointing oil in Exodus 30 is composed of pure olive oil compounded with four spices (vv. 23-25). The Brethren taught that the holy anointing oil typifies the Holy Spirit. We acknowledge that this is correct. However, the Brethren did not see that the holy anointing oil contains the elements of divinity and humanity as well as the elements of Christ&rsquo;s death and His resurrection.</p>
<p>The Spirit is the compound Spirit. He is typified not only by olive oil but by olive oil compounded, mingled, with four elements. Today the Spirit is not just oil; He is an ointment, possessing the elements of divinity, humanity, crucifixion, and resurrection. This is the Spirit. Our life is in this Spirit, and our living should also be in this Spirit. Furthermore, our service and work should be in this Spirit.</p>
