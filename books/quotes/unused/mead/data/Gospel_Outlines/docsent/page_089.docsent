   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Subject Eighty-eight MEN S EXCUSES FOR REFUSING SALVATION Scripture: Luke 14:15-24 God s preparation of salvation God prepares salvation like a man preparing a feast.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>God s salvation feast is prepared by the Lord Jesus, and all things are ready.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Provided in God s salvation are: firstly, the redemption of the Lord Jesus; secondly, Christ s resurrection life.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The redeeming blood and the resurrection life are the food at the salvation feast.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Every time we come to the Lord s table, we are coming to God s salvation feast, and what we eat and drink is the Lord s blood and the Lord s life.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>God s invitation to salvation God not only has prepared the feast of salvation through Christ, but also has extended the invitation for salvation through the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The invitation of the Holy Spirit is through those who preach the gospel and the gospel messages.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Today you are here listening to the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>You have been invited to the gospel feast.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Men s excuses Men made excuses because of their own riches and their own capability.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Give the examples the Lord used: some bought a piece of land, some bought some oxen, and some are getting married.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>All these excuses illustrate men s riches and capability.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Speak seriously according to these principles.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>As long as men are rich and capable, they will excuse themselves from the invitation of the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Riches and capability can be related either to material things or to morality.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Land, houses, and buying and selling are the material riches; doing good is the moral riches.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The ones who accepted the invitation All the ones who accepted the invitation were the maimed, the blind, the lame, the poor and the weak ones.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>To respond to God s invitation to salvation, you must become a poor and weak one.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Friends, if you think that you are rich and capable, you cannot respond to God s invitation.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>God s constraining The ones who are naturally poor and the ones who are willing to be poor are few in number.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>They cannot fill up the seats of salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The naturally poor ones are the ones who were poor originally; the ones willing to be poor are the ones who were rich but are willing to become poor.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Therefore God has to constrain people to accept His invitation.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>God s constraining is to strip men and to wound them.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>To strip men is to turn their riches to poverty; to wound men is to turn their capability to incapability.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Give some examples, such as many who were unwilling to receive God s salvation until the family was broken, or there was a death of someone close to them, or they were critically ill with pneumonia.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Such constraining is the great care and mercy of God for you.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>How to respond to the invitation Be humble and confess that you are poor and incapable.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Repent and turn to God.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Receive Christ and His redemption.</S>
