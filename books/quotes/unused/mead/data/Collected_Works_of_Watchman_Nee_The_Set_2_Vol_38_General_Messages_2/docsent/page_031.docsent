   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER FORTY-SEVEN THE TESTIMONY OF THE LORD JESUS</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>BEFORE THE HIGH PRIEST</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>AND PONTIUS PILATE Scripture Reading: Matt 26:57-66; 27:1-2, 11, 18; John 18:28-40; 19:7-8, 12, 15 ONE</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>On the night the Lord Jesus was betrayed, He was seized and taken to Caiaphas the high priest.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Although the chief priests and the whole Sanhedrin sought false testimony against Him and sought to put Him to death, they could find nothing to use against Him.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Some false witnesses came forward to testify against Him, but their testimonies did not match; in the end, the chief priests and the Sanhedrin found nothing.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The interesting thing is that under these circumstances, when so many people asked the Lord Jesus questions and brought false witness against Him, He did not answer at all.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>But when the high priest asked, "I charge You to swear by the living God to tell us if You are the Christ, the Son of God," He answered, "You have said rightly."</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Then the high priest condemned Him based on this word.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>In the morning, they bound up the Lord and delivered Him to Pilate the governor.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>When Pilate asked, "Are You the King of the Jews?", He answered, "It is as you say."</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>It is strange that after His response Pilate declared that He had no sin and was about to release Him.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>When He answered the high priest by saying, "You have said rightly," He was condemned, but when He answered Pilate by saying, "It is as you say," He was declared to be without guilt.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The two reactions were exactly opposite.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Before Caiaphas the high priest, the Lord's interrogation concerned the matter of being the Son of God, not of being King.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Before Pilate the governor, the Lord's interrogation concerned the matter of being King.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Outwardly, there is a big difference between these two matters, but in the eyes of God, they are linked together.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>In God's eyes the Jews did not have a king, and the Son of God came to be their King.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Therefore, the Lord Jesus did not answer any other questions during the course of His trial other than the two which concerned His person and His work.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>TWO</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>We would like to turn our attention to the matter of the Lord's testimony.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Before Caiaphas the high priest, the Lord acknowledged that He was the Son of God; He was testifying for Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Before Pilate, the Lord acknowledged that He was the King; He was also testifying for Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>When the high priest heard the Lord's testimony about being the Son of God and that He would be "sitting at the right hand of Power and coming on the clouds of heaven," he tore his garments and said, "He has blasphemed!</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>What further need do we have of witnesses?</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Behold, now you have heard the blasphemy.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>What do you think?"</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>They answered and said, "He is worthy of death."</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Why did they refuse the testimony of the Lord Jesus?</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>What was their intention?</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>They were not trying to prove whether or not He was the Son of God.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>To them it would prove that He had sinned if He said that He was the Son of God.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>They had no intention of determining whether He spoke the truth; their goal was to find an excuse for condemnation.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Therefore, when the Lord Jesus acknowledged that He was the Son of God, they immediately condemned Him by saying that He had blasphemed.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>They were not interested in knowing whether this man was indeed the Son of God.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Their only interest was in getting Him to say some words that could be used as an excuse for killing Him.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>They were the prominent ones among the Jews, yet they were not concerned about the things of God.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Their only concern was that this Jesus, who called Himself the Son of God, was threatening their position by what He did and said.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>If they allowed Jesus to go on, their position would be in jeopardy, and their dignity would be bankrupted.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Therefore, they hastily tried to remove Jesus so that they could maintain their personal prestige.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>They twisted the Lord's word, saying, "This man said, I am able to destroy the temple of God and build it up in three days."</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Actually, the Lord Jesus did not say this.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>See John 2:19-21.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>They said this to show their concern for the temple.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>But by that time the temple had become a den of robbers; they were not concerned about it.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>When the Lord Jesus came to cleanse the temple, they even tried to kill Him Mark 11:17-18 .</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>They only cared for the outward appearance of the temple, and they were using it as a means to add to their base gain.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>They did not want the reality of the temple, and they feared that it would expose their sins.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>They kept the form of religion but denied the truth; they even tried to do away with the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Therefore, when the Son of God came to the world and declared that He was the Son of God, they regarded it as a sin.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>They thought that no one should say this even if it was true.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>The Lord Jesus was condemned by the high priest because He testified that He was the Son of God, not because He was the Son of God.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>They thought that this statement should never be made.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>They thought that the truth should never be testified.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>They tried everything they could to overturn this testimony.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Finally, they appealed to the political power of Rome to kill the Lord Jesus.</S>
