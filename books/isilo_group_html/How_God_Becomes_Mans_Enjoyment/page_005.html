<p>Our experience of the water of life is related to drinking the Spirit. We did not make up the expression <em>drink the Spirit.</em> First Corinthians 12:13 says that we were all &ldquo;given to drink one Spirit.&rdquo; Verse 4 of chapter 10 says also, &ldquo;All drank the same spiritual drink; for they drank of a spiritual rock which followed them, and the rock was Christ.&rdquo; According to these verses, God&rsquo;s people can drink the Spirit who flows forth from Christ. When we drink the Spirit, we will have the following experiences.</p>
<h2 class="head3">Being Convicted and Confessing Our Sins</h2>
<p>John 16:8 says, &ldquo;When He [the Spirit] comes, He will convict the world concerning sin and concerning righteousness and concerning judgment.&rdquo; Our experience upon drinking the Spirit is to see our sinful condition. Feeling sinful and being convicted of sin are proof that the Spirit has entered a person and is working within him. Believers often ask how to be filled with the Spirit. Being filled with the Spirit is not a matter of feeling excitement but of letting the Spirit search us and dig out our sins and shortcomings. If we are willing to receive His shining and to confess and deal with our sins one by one, the Spirit will be able to fill us.</p>
<p>Stanza 3 of <em>Hymns,</em> #250 says, &ldquo;I will dig by praying, / Dig the dirt entirely, / Thus release the Spirit, / Let the stream flow freely.&rdquo; The dirt in us is sin. As soon as we are saved, the Spirit indwells us; however, He cannot fill us, because we are still full of sin. This can be likened to a glass that cannot be filled with water because it is filled with dirt. The dirt must be emptied out before water can be poured in. The amount of dirt that is removed is the amount of water that can be poured into the glass. Water can fill the glass only when the dirt has been removed. We should ask ourselves whether we have ever thoroughly confessed our sins to the Lord even once.</p>
<p>It was eight years after my salvation that I had a thorough confession of my sins. In 1925 I repented and was saved. I knew that the Holy Spirit lived in me. However, it was not until 1933 that I began to confess my sins daily to the Lord. During that time, when I prayed, I cared for nothing other than confessing my sins. The more I confessed, the more there was to confess. I spent several days and nights confessing my sins until I sensed that I was free from the heavy burden of sin and was assured, refreshed, and uplifted in my spirit. I began to mount up with wings like an eagle (Isa. 40:31); I was full of joy within and could not stop singing and praising. That was an experience of being filled with the Spirit.</p>
<p>There are believers who have been saved for many years but have not had a thorough confession of their sins. It is not that the Spirit does not visit them or shine on them but that they have refused to confess their sins. As a result, they are clogged by the dirt of sin.</p>
<p>I have spent a substantial amount of time before the Lord to consider the condition of the saints. Many saints, experientially speaking, are deadened in their spirit. Merely preaching doctrine is futile to these saints. They must be led to &ldquo;dig wells.&rdquo; It is not a matter of receiving the Spirit or of the Spirit coming upon them. These saints are closed; their soul is like a fortress, even though they appear to be without sins or problems. Such a condition makes it difficult for the Spirit to flow; thus, they need a thorough digging.</p>
<p>The river of water of life has flowed into us, but it cannot flow through us because we are closed, clogged, and unwilling to open and confess our sins. It is not that we do not have the sense of sin but that we refuse to confess our sins. If we are willing to confess a sin when the Lord shines on it, He will shine on something else for us to confess. If we confess this, He will shine on another item. This can be likened to a house that has not been cleaned for many years. Before it is cleaned, we may not see the dirt, but once we begin to clean it, we discover the filth that is everywhere. The house will look like new only after a thorough cleaning, that is, after all the filth is cleared away. This is the type of cleaning that we need.</p>
<p>Even though some of the saints are in their teens, they have accumulated sins. They profess that the Lord Jesus is their Savior, and they believe that He bore their sins on the cross, but they have never spent time to thoroughly confess their sins. Therefore, they are not living, and they have pushed the Spirit into a small corner so that He cannot move within them. The Spirit has no ground to reign in them. They initially drank the living waters for their salvation, but this water has not become in them a fountain flowing forth as rivers of living water (John 4:14; 7:38). Therefore, even though the Spirit is within them, they are poor and dry because the Spirit does not flow out as rivers of living water.</p>
<p>In order for the Spirit to flow out as rivers of living water, we must have a thorough confession of our sins. There is no other way. The Spirit is waiting for us to confess our sins. It might be that He has been shining on our sins for more than three years, but instead of cooperating with Him, we refuse to confess our sins. When the Spirit comes to us and we sense our sins, we should confess them immediately. This is the work of the Spirit (16:8). We should say, &ldquo;Lord, forgive me.&rdquo; If we receive more shining, we should continue to confess until we are filled with the Spirit. This is the kind of digging spoken of in <em>Hymns,</em> #250.</p>
<p>The brothers and sisters who pray in a released way in the meetings are like unclogged passages for the Spirit. Other brothers and sisters, who pray faintly, are like smoking flax. These saints either do not pray often, or they are clogged because they have not confessed their sins in a long time.</p>
<p>If I were in a gathering where some saints prayed faintly, I would immediately pray, &ldquo;Lord, dig in us; dig away our sins. Empty us; empty our filth.&rdquo; I would also fellowship with them, saying, &ldquo;Brothers, if we have the Spirit&rsquo;s shining and a sense of condemnation, we need to confess our sins. We should confess whatever the Spirit shines on. We need to be cleansed of our sins. We must not confess in a general or vague manner but confess our sins item by item, just like settling an account. We should confess not only sinful words and deeds but also our sinful intentions and motives. We should confess until we realize that there is nothing good in us and that there is nothing good in our dealings with our parents, siblings, teachers, schoolmates, and especially with the Lord. We should confess our sins until we are ashamed, remorseful, sense our hopelessness, and see that our only recourse is to deliver ourselves to the Spirit. Then the Spirit can gain the ground to fill us and be poured out upon us. Furthermore, we will taste the rivers of living water and know what it is to drink of the Spirit.&rdquo;</p>
<h2 class="head3">Glorifying the Lord Jesus</h2>
<p>When we drink the Spirit, He also causes us to exalt and glorify the Lord Jesus, that is, to praise and worship Him. John 16:14 says, &ldquo;He [the Spirit] will glorify Me, for He will receive of Mine and will declare it to you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When the Spirit works, we first sense the need to confess our sins. We should not think that everything is fine as long as we give the Lord Jesus glory and praise. We should call upon the Lord Jesus when we sense our sins. We must confess our sins until we no longer sense our sinfulness and are at peace. Then the Spirit will spontaneously lead us to offer praises to the Lord.</p>
<p>There is a Christian group that first leads a person to thoroughly confess his sins and then leads him to praise the Lord. Although this is not so accurate doctrinally, it is correct experientially. Those who have confessed their sins have an open heart and can immediately praise the Lord. When we praise Jesus the Lord, we experience the pouring out of the Spirit.</p>
<p>May we all have prayers of thorough confession. We should confess at night and in the morning until we are refreshed and unclogged, that is, until we no longer have any burdens, coverings, or blockages. Then we will see that the Lord Jesus is lovely, glorious, and worthy of our honor, praise, and worship. Not only so, the Spirit will be poured out upon us and will fill us; we will drink the Spirit richly and be saturated with the Spirit. Then rivers of living water will flow and overflow from within us to supply all those in need. This is the experience of the river. May the Lord lead us to have such experiences.</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_004.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_006.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>How God Becomes Man's Enjoyment &nbsp; pg 5</div><br></body></html>
