[2]  In these messages on the Spirit we shall cover the Spirit's person, symbols, attributes, coming, and work.
[3]  We shall begin by considering the various aspects of the person of the Spirit.
[4]  The title "the Spirit of God" is quite common.
[5]  It is used in Genesis 1:2, which says that the Spirit of God moved upon the face of the waters.
[6]  Galatians 4:6 says, "Because you are sons, God sent forth the Spirit of His Son into our hearts, crying, Abba, Father!"
[7]  God's Son is the embodiment of the divine life 1 John 5:12 .
[8]  Hence, the Spirit of God's Son is the Spirit of life Rom 8:2 .
[9]  Acts 16:7 says, "When they had come down to Mysia, they tried to go into Bithynia, and the Spirit of Jesus did not allow them."
[10]  The interchangeable use of the Spirit of Jesus with the Holy Spirit in Acts 16:6 reveals that the Spirit of Jesus is the Holy Spirit.
[11]  The Spirit of Jesus is a particular expression concerning the Spirit of God and refers to the Spirit of the incarnated Savior who, as Jesus in His humanity, passed through human living and death on the cross.
[12]  THE CONCLUSION OF THE NEW TESTAMENT MESSAGE EIGHTY THE SPIRIT HIS PERSON 2
[13]  In this message we shall cover more aspects of the person of the Spirit.
[14]  In the New Testament the Spirit is also called the life-giving Spirit 1 Cor 15:45 .
[15]  The Spirit of God has been processed through Christ's death and resurrection to consummate in the life-giving Spirit.
[16]  Today the Spirit, who is the reality of God, the Father, the Lord, the Son of God, Christ, and Jesus, is the life-giving Spirit for imparting life into the believers.
[17]  The writings of John reveal that the Spirit is the Spirit of reality John 14:17; 15:26; 16:13; 1 John 4:6 .
[18]  The Spirit is called the Spirit of reality because whatever the Father in the Son is and whatever the Son is, is realized in the Spirit.
[19]  Q. THE SPIRIT OF GLORY AND THAT OF GOD
[20]  First Peter 4:14 says, "If you are reproached in the name of Christ, you are blessed, because the Spirit of glory and of God rests upon you."
[21]  Literally, the Greek says "the Spirit of glory and that of God."
[22]  The Spirit of glory is the Spirit of God.
[23]  Such a Spirit is the Spirit of God expressed through the suffering believers and the Spirit of the experienced God enjoyed by the suffering believers.
[24]  In the book of Revelation the Spirit is called the seven Spirits 1:4; 4:5; 5:6 , the sevenfold intensified Spirit to counteract the degradation of the church.
[25]  The seven Spirits in Revelation 1:4 undoubtedly are the Spirit of God because They are ranked among the Triune God.
[26]  The Spirit is the totality, the aggregate, of all the elements of the titles of the Spirit of God.
[27]  This Spirit is the Holy Spirit, the Spirit of God, the Spirit of the Father, the Spirit of the Lord, the Spirit of the Son of God, the Spirit of Jesus, the Spirit of Christ, the Spirit of Jesus Christ, the Lord Spirit, the Spirit of the living God, the life-giving Spirit, the Spirit of life, the Spirit of grace, the Spirit of reality, the Comforter, the Spirit of power, the Spirit of glory and that of God, the eternal Spirit, and the seven Spirits.
[28]  THE CONCLUSION OF THE NEW TESTAMENT MESSAGE EIGHTY-ONE THE SPIRIT HIS SYMBOLS 1
[29]  The Spirit is the reality of all the divine entities and matters.
[30]  John 20:22 says, "He breathed into them and said to them, Receive the Holy Spirit."
[31]  Here the Spirit of life is likened to breath, which is for life.
[32]  In John 20:22 the Spirit as the breath was breathed as life into the disciples for their life.
[33]  As our clothing the Spirit not only covers us but is also a "uniform" that gives us authority.
[34]  In this message we shall cover more symbols of the Spirit found in the New Testament.
[35]  First Corinthians 10:4 says, "All drank the same spiritual drink; for they drank of a spiritual rock which followed them, and the rock was Christ."
[36]  The spiritual drink here refers to the living water which flowed out of the cleft rock Exo 17:6 and that typifies the Spirit as our all-inclusive drink John 7:37-39; 1 Cor 12:13 .
[37]  The Spirit as symbolized by the spiritual drink is the ultimate issue of the Triune God.
[38]  Second Corinthians 1:22 says that God has sealed us, and Ephesians 1:13 and 4:30 tell us that, as believers, we have been sealed with the Holy Spirit.
[39]  The anointing in 2 Corinthians 1:21 is the sealing in verse 22.
[40]  In 2 Corinthians 3:3 ink is a symbol of the Spirit: "Being manifested that you are a letter of Christ ministered by us, inscribed not with ink, but with the Spirit of the living God."
[41]  The Spirit of the living God, who is the living God Himself, is not an instrument, like a pen for writing, but the very element, like the ink, with which the apostles minister Christ as the content for the writing of living letters that convey Christ.
[42]  In Revelation 5:6 we have yet another symbol of the Spirit the seven eyes of the Lamb: "I saw in the midst of the throne and of the four living creatures, and in the midst of the elders, a Lamb standing as having been slain, having seven horns and seven eyes, which are the seven Spirits of God, sent forth into all the earth."
[43]  The seven lamps are simultaneously the seven eyes of the Lamb.
[44]  In this message we shall cover the attributes of the Spirit.
[45]  We use the word "attributes" to denote the virtues of God's being.
[46]  Romans 15:30 speaks of the love of the Spirit; Galatians 5:22 indicates that love is the fruit of the Spirit; and Colossians 1:8 mentions the believers' love in the Spirit.
[47]  The New Testament reveals that the Holy Spirit has the attribute of holiness for sanctification 1 Pet 1:2; Rom 15:16 .
[48]  In the New Testament the word "holy" means separated to God, set apart to Him.
[49]  In God's New Testament economy the Spirit has the attribute of reality John 14:17; 15:26; 16:13 .
[50]  Reality is the all-inclusive attribute of the Spirit of God, for it includes the Father, Christ the Son, and all the divine items and entities.
[51]  Beginning with this message, we shall consider the Spirit's coming.
[52]  The New Testament describes the coming of the Spirit to John the Baptist, to Mary, the mother of Jesus, to Jesus Christ, to the saints in the transitional period between Christ's incarnation and resurrection, and to the New Testament believers.
[53]  As the Divine Essence for the Conceiving and Birth of Jesus
[54]  The third instance of the coming of the Spirit in the New Testament is the coming of the Spirit to Jesus Christ as both the divine essence and the divine power.
[55]  D. TO THE SAINTS IN THE TRANSITIONAL PERIOD BETWEEN CHRIST'S INCARNATION AND RESURRECTION
[56]  According to God's economy, there was a transitional period between Christ's incarnation and resurrection.
[57]  The Spirit came to certain saints during this period, which lasted about thirty-three and a half years.
[58]  John the Baptist and Mary, the mother of Jesus, are not included among these saints, for John was filled with the Spirit and Mary was overshadowed by the Spirit before the beginning of this transitional period.
[59]  Now we shall go on to consider the Spirit's coming to the New Testament believers.
[60]  John 15:26 tells us that the Spirit was sent from with the Father by the Son.
[61]  The Spirit has been given by the Son John 3:34 .
[62]  The Spirit was also given by the Father John 14:16b; Luke 11:13 .
[63]  g. Breathed into the Believers by the Son in Resurrection
[64]  The Holy Spirit here is actually the resurrected Christ Himself because this Spirit is His breath.
[65]  We have covered the Spirit's person, symbols, attributes, and coming.
[66]  The Lord was absolutely under the anointing of the Holy Spirit.
[67]  As the Means for Him to Cast Out Demons
[68]  In Matthew 12:28 the Lord Jesus says, "If I by the Spirit of God cast out demons, then the kingdom of God is come upon you."
[69]  This word indicates that Christ fought the battle for the kingdom by the Spirit.
[70]  The Spirit was the means for Christ to offer Himself to God.
[71]  Hebrews 9:14 tells us that through the eternal Spirit Christ offered Himself without blemish to God.
[72]  Next we shall consider the work of the Spirit to convict the world.
[73]  Let us now begin to consider the work of the Spirit in the believers for the divine dispensing.
[74]  Just as the Holy Spirit worked mainly in Christ and not on Him, so the Spirit works mainly in the believers and not on them.
[75]  We may talk about regeneration without realizing that in regeneration we have been given the divine life.
[76]  The main work the Spirit does in regeneration is to impart the divine life, the eternal, uncreated life of God, into us.
[77]  Freeing Them by His Law of Life from the Law of Sin and Death
[78]  As the Holy Spirit saves us by renewing us, He frees us by His law of life from the law of sin and death.
[79]  In Romans 8:2 Paul says, "The law of the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus has freed me from the law of sin and of death."
[80]  We have seen that for the divine dispensing the Spirit works in the believers by enlightening them, sanctifying them, regenerating them, giving them life, saving them by renewing them, freeing them by His law of life from the law of sin and death, and giving life even to their mortal bodies.
[81]  Leading Them to Live a Life as Sons of God
[82]  The Spirit also works in the believers by leading them to live a life as sons of God.
[83]  "As many as are led by the Spirit of God, these are sons of God" Rom 8:14 .
[84]  Through the various aspects of the Spirit's work which we have covered thus far, the believers are washed, sanctified, and justified.
[85]  First Corinthians 6:11 says, "These things were some of you; but you were washed, but you were sanctified, but you were justified in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and in the Spirit of our God."
[86]  In 2 Thessalonians 2:13 and 14 we see that salvation in sanctification of the Spirit is unto the obtaining of the glory of Christ to express God.
[87]  By this we are thoroughly saved from all old and negative things and made a new creation to obtain the Lord's glory.
[88]  First Peter 1:2 speaks of "the foreknowledge of God the Father, in sanctification of the Spirit, unto obedience and sprinkling of the blood of Jesus Christ."
[89]  This means that the work of the Holy Spirit in us is for the purpose of dispensing the Triune God into us.
[90]  Whatever the Spirit does in us is for the dispensing into our being of the Triune God in His life, nature, element, and essence.
[91]  As the Means for Them to Know That God Abides in Them and They in God
[92]  A number of verses in Acts reveal that the Spirit fills the believers inwardly.
[93]  Acts 13:52 says, "The disciples were made full of joy and of the Holy Spirit."
[94]  In John 16:13 we have the Spirit's work in the believers to guide them into all the reality: "When He, the Spirit of reality, comes, He will guide you into all the reality; for He will not speak from Himself, but whatever He hears He will speak; and He will disclose to you what is to come."
[95]  The Spirit of reality guides the believers into all the reality of the Triune God and of all divine matters.
[96]  THE CONCLUSION OF THE NEW TESTAMENT MESSAGE NINETY THE SPIRIT HIS WORK 5
[97]  In this message we shall cover more aspects of the second stage the inner-life-working stage of the Spirit's work in the believers for the divine dispensing.
[98]  Teaching Them Spiritual Words the Things of the Spirit of God for Spiritual Communication
[99]  First Corinthians 2:13 says, "Which also we speak, not in words taught by human wisdom, but in words taught by the Spirit, communicating spiritual things by spiritual things."
[100]  Another aspect of the Spirit's work in the believers is His comforting them.
[101]  Acts 9:31 says, "The church throughout the whole of Judea and Galilee and Samaria had peace, being built up; and going on in the fear of the Lord and in the comfort of the Holy Spirit, it was multiplied."
[102]  In this message we shall cover the remaining aspects of the Spirit's work in the believers in the inner-life-working stage.
[103]  The believers in Christ should live and walk by the Spirit Gal 5:16, 25 .
[104]  As the Spirit works in the believers, He fights for them against the flesh.
[105]  Galatians 5:17 says, "The flesh lusts against the Spirit, and the Spirit against the flesh; for these oppose each other, that you should not do those things which you desire."
[106]  Longing within Them unto Envy for God against Worldliness
[107]  James 4:4-5 reveals that the Spirit within the believers longs unto envy for God against worldliness: "Adulteresses, do you not know that the friendship of the world is enmity with God?
[108]  In Ephesians 4:30 Paul says, "Do not grieve the Holy Spirit of God, in whom you were sealed unto the day of redemption."
[109]  The first stage has twelve aspects, from enlightening, sanctification, and regeneration through sanctification.
[110]  The second stage, which we have called the inner-life-working stage, has twenty-five aspects, from transformation through not insulting the Spirit.
[111]  Romans 8:26a says, "In like manner the Spirit also joins in to help us in our weakness."
[112]  Infusing His according-to-God Mind into Them in Their Prayer
[113]  As the Spirit works in the believers by helping them in their weakness and by interceding for them with groanings, He infuses His according-to-God mind into them in their prayer.
[114]  "He who searches the hearts knows what is the mind of the Spirit, because He intercedes for the saints according to God" Rom 8:27 .
[115]  Unto Him They Sow and of Him They Reap in Their Life
[116]  Unto the Spirit the believers sow, and of the Spirit they reap in their life.
[117]  Galatians 6:8 says, "He who sows unto his own flesh, shall reap corruption of the flesh, but he who sows unto the Spirit shall of the Spirit reap eternal life."
[118]  Testifying Together with the Water and the Blood That Christ Is the Son of God
[119]  On the one hand, the Spirit confesses Christ's humanity, that He has come in the flesh; on the other hand, the Spirit confesses Christ's divinity, that He is the Son of God.
[120]  In the believers the Spirit testifies together with the water and the blood that Christ is the Son of God 1 John 5:6-9 .
[121]  As the Means for Them to Take Christ as Their Righteousness by Faith
[122]  The Spirit is the means for the believers to take Christ as their righteousness by faith.
[123]  The Spirit who indwells the believers cries with their spirit, Abba, Father.
[124]  We have seen that in the third stage of the Spirit's work in the believers the Spirit works to maintain our fellowship with the Triune God.
[125]  In this message we shall consider further aspects of this stage of the Spirit's work.
[126]  After referring to the anointing in 2 Corinthians 1:21, Paul goes on to say in verse 22 that God "has also sealed us and given the pledge of the Spirit in our hearts."
[127]  The indwelling Spirit is the firstfruit foretaste of the believers' divine inheritance, which is the Triune God Himself.
[128]  Romans 8:23 says, "We ourselves also, having the firstfruit of the Spirit, even we ourselves groan in ourselves, eagerly expecting sonship, the redemption of our body."
[129]  This is the stage in which the Spirit works in us to keep us in fellowship with the Triune God.
[130]  The grace of Christ is the rich element of Christ, the love of God is the rich element of God, and the fellowship of the Holy Spirit is the aggregate of the rich element of Christ and God transmitted into our being for our spiritual enjoyment.
[131]  In this fellowship we enjoy the rich elements of the Triune God, which are the elements for our transformation.
[132]  Day after day the rich elements of the Triune God are being transmitted into us, and we are being transformed.
[133]  The Spirit who dwells in us and works in us is the oneness of the Body of Christ.
[134]  As the Spirit works in the believers, He also frees them from the letters of the law.
[135]  Second Corinthians 3:17 says, "The Lord is the Spirit, and where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is freedom."
[136]  Testifying to Them the Law of Life of the New Covenant
[137]  The Holy Spirit testifies to the believers the law of life of the new covenant.
[138]  "The Holy Spirit also testifies to us; for after having said, This is the covenant which I will covenant with them after those days, says the Lord: I will put My laws upon their hearts and upon their minds I will inscribe them; then He says, And their sins and their lawlessnesses I will by no means remember any more" Heb 10:15-17 .
[139]  We have covered three stages of the Spirit's work in the believers for the divine dispensing: the first stage from initial sanctification, enlightenment, and regeneration through continual sanctification; the second stage from transformation through not grieving the Spirit; and the third stage from the Spirit as the means for the believers to pray through the Spirit resting as glory upon the persecuted believers.
[140]  The first stage is the initial stage, the second is the inner-life-working stage, and the third is for maintaining our fellowship with the Triune God.
[141]  As the Consummation of the Triune God for Them to Be Baptized into the Divine Trinity
[142]  Matthew 28:19 says "Go therefore and disciple all the nations, baptizing them into the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit."
[143]  After the Lord Jesus charged His disciples to disciple the nations, bringing them into the Triune God, the all-inclusive Spirit came upon, fell upon, the believers as the power to carry out the Lord's commission.
[144]  After the Spirit descended upon the believers, He filled them outwardly.
[145]  Being the Element for the Apostles to Be the Sufficient Ministers of the New Covenant
[146]  The all-inclusive, consummated Spirit is the element, the divine essence, for the apostles to be the sufficient ministers of the new covenant 2 Cor 3:6 .
[147]  This means that the apostles became ministers of the new covenant not by human knowledge or natural effort but by the Spirit as the constituting element.
[148]  Being the Element of the Ministry of the New Testament
[149]  This means that both the ministers and the ministry are a constitution of the all-inclusive Spirit.
[150]  This stage of the Spirit's work is related to the church and includes the believers' gifts, functions, and ministries.
[151]  As the Power for the Apostles to Preach the Gospel of Christ to the Nations
[152]  The book of Acts reveals that the Spirit gives direction to the believers.
[153]  For example, Philip's activity in preaching the gospel was under the direction, leading, and guidance of the Holy Spirit.
[154]  Acts 11:28 says, "One of them named Agabus rose up and signified through the Spirit that there was about to be a great famine over the whole inhabited earth, which occurred at the time of Claudius."
[155]  "They passed through the country of Phrygia and Galatia, having been forbidden by the Holy Spirit to speak the word in Asia" v. 6 . The move of the Apostle Paul and his co-workers for the spread of the gospel was not according to their decision and preference, nor according to any schedule made by human council, but by the Holy Spirit according to God's counsel, as in the mission of Philip Acts 8:29, 39 . They intended to speak the word in Asia, but the Holy Spirit forbade them.
[156]  The Spirit also establishes the elders in the churches.
[157]  In Acts 20:28 Paul tells the elders of the church in Ephesus that the Holy Spirit had placed them among the flock as overseers.
[158]  Manifesting Himself in Each One of the Members of the Body of Christ through Different Gifts
[159]  The Spirit manifests Himself in each one of the members of the Body of Christ through different gifts 1 Cor 12:7-11 .
[160]  In verse 7 Paul says, "To each one is given the manifestation of the Spirit for profit."
[161]  Operating the Gifts in Each One of the Members of the Body of Christ
[162]  The Spirit also operates the gifts in each one of the members of the Body of Christ.
[163]  Finally, the Spirit speaks with the church: "The Spirit and the bride say, Come!"
