<h1 class="title">ISSUE NO. 12</h1><h2 class="head4">P. O. Box 84, Hankow, October 1938</h2><h2 class="head1">NEWS CONCERNING THE WORK</h2><h2 class="head2">Brother Faithful Luk, Singapore</h2><h2 class="head3">One</h2><p>Dear Brother Philip:</p><p>I received your letter of June 13 and read everything. Two weeks ago I went from Penang to Na-Bang in Thailand and did some work. I did not return until yesterday. After reading your letter I must thank the Lord unceasingly. I cannot help but praise the Lord greatly for the work that He has done through you in Hong Kong! Allow me to say a few words about the meeting in Na-Bang in Thailand. I believe you would like to know about it. Two years ago a servant of the Lord went there to pioneer the work, and some were baptized. They began to break bread every Lord's Day to remember the Lord. The believers were very anxious about being raptured, and they began to wait for His coming at their meetings. In one of the Lord's Day morning meetings recently, they waited from ten o'clock until two o'clock the following afternoon. Evil spirits deceived our brothers, saying, "The rapture is coming. In a few hours you will be raptured. Close your eyes, or else you will become a Laodicean." When night came, no one went home. Instead, they groped their way in the dark from the meeting hall to the courtyard outside the hall and waited the whole night. They fasted for four meals. They were beaten by the wind and the rain at night and scorched by the sun in the day. Although eight or nine of them eventually went home throughout the time, about twenty or thirty people were left, and they did not disperse until two o'clock the following afternoon. The evil spirits, who always try to buffet us or deceive us, were indeed evil. But the Lord is victorious, and He will also preserve us (2 Thes. 3:3). Many left after this episode, and the meeting was almost abandoned. But thank the Lord for His grace. They are now learning to sing Hymns #41, #159, etc. Through the prayer of the brothers and sisters in various places, they are slowly being recovered. However, we still need the desperate prayer of all the brothers and sisters everywhere.</p><p>They have the book The Spiritual Man, and they also purchased seven or eight copies of Rethinking Our Work (The Normal Christian Church Life). Under such conditions, we were still able to baptize seven brothers and sisters into the Lord's death, and some others are waiting to be baptized. We hope that the local meeting can be established and preserved until the Lord comes back. The responsible brothers are Brothers Lei Ming-ching and Lei Ming-shuang. The address is [omitted]. If any experienced co-worker is willing to correspond with them or to help them by sending literature, they will gladly receive it. Most of the people here are from Foochow, and no other denominations are working here. I heard that some time ago there was a Foochow brother who testified in Hong Kong and who later came to Thailand. I do not know his name or address. Please find out who he is and write a letter to him. If he is still working in Bangkok, the capital of Thailand, he may be able to give some time to visit the brothers and render them some help. I hope that the Lord establishes His own testimony throughout Thailand. Last week Brother Tang Wen-tze was in Penang and conducted meetings for a week. There may be more meetings next week. Please pray for us. Peace to you all. Greetings to Brother James Chen, Brother Wen-yau, Brother Stephen Kaung, Brother Chu-yien, all the co-worker sisters, and the brothers and sisters meeting in Kowloon!</p><p>Brother Faithful Luk<br />July 7</p><h2 class="head3">Two</h2><p>Sister Lee:</p><p>Peace to you. We are at peace in Southeast Asia. The weather is always the same. There are two common sayings here: "The whole year it is summer, but one shower of rain turns it into autumn," and "This is an evergreen country, daily bathing in the sun and timely moisture with abundant rain." I have received your letter. May the Lord care for the brothers in all the localities.</p><p>A few days ago I received a letter from Brother Nee in London: "During this time of national tragedy, my concern is the support of the workers....If I would do things like others, I might be able to earn a high income. But we have learned the lesson of the cross. How can we exercise fleshly hands in hope of helping God's faithfulness, while in reality we tear down our own faith?...May the Lord be gracious to us." Opportunities opened up in Penang and Thailand. After I returned to Penang from Thailand, I had another week of meetings, and the Lord gained some people. May the Lord preserve us all the way to the end. Peace be to you. Greetings to Sisters Wang and Chang.</p><p>Faithful Luk, August 1</p>
