<h2 class=head1>THE SEVEN SPIRITS</h2><p>After the church was established and became degraded, as the life-giving and compound Spirit, He became the seven Spirits of God; that is, He is the one life-giving, compound Spirit but is intensified sevenfold (Rev. 1:4; 4:5; 5:6).<h2 class=head1>THE INDWELLING SPIRIT</h2><p>Furthermore, as the Spirit of life, He was breathed into the believers by Christ, in the night of His resurrection, as the gentle breath to be their indwelling Spirit to fill them inwardly (John 20:22; Acts 13:52).<h2 class=head1>THE ONE DIVINE APPLICATION</h2><p>He applies all that the Triune God is in Christ, all that the all-inclusive Christ is, and all that He has accomplished, obtained, and attained to all the people whom God has chosen; thus He became the one divine application. The Father made the economy, the Son accomplished it, and the Spirit applies to us what the Son has accomplished. Thus, the Spirit is the application.<p>As the application, the Spirit sanctifies, separates, God’s chosen people from the fallen people of the world and leads them to repent to God and receive Christ (1 Pet. 1:2). He regenerates the people who have received Christ as their Savior with His resurrection life to be the sons of God (1 Pet. 1:3; Titus 3:5; John 3:5; 1:12). He sanctifies the regenerated sons of God with the holy nature of God (Rom. 15:16; 6:19, 22) and renews the sanctified saints (Titus 3:5). He transforms the renewed saints metabolically into the glorious image of Christ (Rom. 12:2a; 2 Cor. 3:18; Rom. 8:29) and conforms the transformed saints to the image of the firstborn Son of God (Rom. 8:29). The Spirit also seals the believers with all that Christ is and all that He has accomplished, obtained, and attained, thus dispensing all the divine elements of Christ into the very being of the believers until they will be redeemed in their body, that is, transfigured to be like the glorious body of Christ (Eph. 1:13; 4:30; 2 Cor. 1:22; Rom. 8:23; Phil. 3:21).<p>The Spirit is the pledge from God to the believers guaranteeing that the Triune God is their inheritance (Eph. 1:14; 2 Cor. 1:22; 5:5). He, as the compound ointment, anoints the believers with the divine elements of Christ (2 Cor. 1:21; 1 John 2:20, 27). He witnesses with our spirit that we are children of God (Rom. 8:16). He, as the Spirit of life and the Spirit of God, indwells the believers, imparting life and peace to them and even life to their mortal bodies (Rom. 8:2, 9, 11, 6).<p>The one Spirit intercedes with groanings for the believers who are transformed by God under the working together of all things (Rom. 8:26-28). He, as the indwelling Spirit, is the One in whom the believers pray in their spirit (Jude 20; Eph. 6:18). He holds the sword of the Spirit of God for the believers to take the offensive in the spiritual warfare (Eph. 6:17-18). He comforts the believers (John 14:16; Acts 9:31). He leads the sons of God (Rom. 8:14). He, who searches all things, even the depths of God, reveals all the things that God has done for the believers (1 Cor. 2:10).<p>He, as the life-giving Spirit, gives life to the word of God, through whom the new testament ministers minister the word of God (2 Cor. 3:5-6). He is the Spirit of the new testament ministry of righteousness (2 Cor. 3:8-9; 4:1). He imparts righteousness, peace, and joy into the believers as the reality of the kingdom of God (Rom. 14:17). As the flow of God (John 7:38), He transmits in His fellowship the grace of Christ, the element of the divine life, with the love of God, the source of the grace of Christ (2 Cor. 13:14). As the dispenser of what God is in Christ as grace to the believers, He dispenses the reality of God as grace to them (Heb. 10:29).<p>The Spirit sets apart and sends out the apostles to spread the gospel of Christ (Acts 13:2, 4). He leads the apostles in their trips for the gospel spreading (Acts 16:6-7). He prophesies through the prophets concerning the apostles’ sufferings and persecutions (Acts 21:11). He leads the apostles to speak things concerning God’s dealings with His people (1 Cor. 7:40).<p>He distributes different gifts to the believers (1 Cor. 12:4-11). He, as the reality of the speaking Christ, speaks to all the churches, calling for overcomers in the degradation of the church (Rev. 2:7, 11, 17, 26, 29; 3:5-6, 12-13, 21-22). As the essence of the Body of Christ, all that He works in and on the believers is for the constitution, the building, of the Body of Christ in Him as the oneness (Eph. 4:3-4).<h2 class=head1>THE SPIRIT OF POWER</h2><p>As the Spirit of power, He was poured upon the believers by the Christ in ascension as the violent wind to be the power to fill them outwardly for their spreading of the gospel of Christ (Acts 2:2-4, 17-18, 33; 1:8). First, Christ breathed this Spirit as the gentle breath into the disciples to be the indwelling Spirit. Now in His ascension, Christ poured out the Spirit as the violent wind, not for their life but for their ministry to spread the gospel. The inner Spirit as the breath is for life. The outpoured Spirit of power as the wind is for work.<h2 class=head1>THE SPIRIT AND THE BRIDE</h2><p>Such an all-inclusive, compound, consummated, life-giving Spirit, the consummated Triune God as the Bridegroom, and God’s redeemed, regenerated, transformed, and glorified church as the bride, say, “Come!” (Rev. 22:17). Eventually, this all-inclusive Spirit becomes the Bridegroom to marry God’s redeemed. That’s us. Then there is such a couple. The consummated Triune God is married to His redeemed, regenerated, transformed, conformed, and glorified people. They are regenerated in their spirit, transformed in their soul, and glorified in their body to match the marrying God. God and His wife are thus exactly the same in life, in nature, and in expression, just as Eve was the same as Adam. This all-inclusive Bridegroom will be a fulfillment of the type of Adam, marrying one who is out of Him and transformed into His image, glorified with His glory, and brought back to Him to be one couple. This is the end of the Bible.<p>Now we have seen the one Bible, the one God, the one Christ, and the one Spirit. The one Bible is a revelation of the Triune God; the Father is the source and substance, the Son is the element, and the Spirit is the essence to apply the consummated Triune God to His chosen and redeemed people.<p>I have purposely released these ten “ones” because I do not know how long the Lord will keep me here, so I must give you a very basic and all-inclusive view of the Lord’s recovery. All the co-workers and elders should know this. By this fellowship we can see clearly what the Lord’s recovery is. It is not to recover baptism by immersion or the Lord’s table with one cup and one bread. These are not the major items of the Lord’s recovery. I feel that I have been in the Lord’s hands to finish the full interpretation of the whole Bible. Now I want to present these ten “ones” as the real conclusion to this interpretation.
