   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER TEN THE INDWELLING CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>IN 2 CORINTHIANS 2 Scripture Reading: 2 Cor 1:21-22; 2:10, 14-16; 3:3, 6b, 17-18; 4:6-7; 13:14</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In this book of 2 Corinthians there is no doctrine.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>But in telling us of his life, Paul did give us a hint about some of the things we have in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>While he is testifying of the kind of life he has in Christ, spontaneously he reveals some things about Christ to us.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Therefore, the things about Christ in this book are more precious than in other books.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>FIRMLY ATTACHED</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The first thing that Paul tells us is that we have been firmly attached to the anointed One.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Now he who firmly attaches us with you unto the anointed one, and hath anointed us, is God; Who hath also sealed us, and given the earnest foretaste of the Spirit in our hearts 2 Cor 1:21-22, Gk.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>. God has firmly attached us unto Christ, God s anointed One.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>To be attached means to be put together.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Christ is the anointed One, and God has firmly attached us to this Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>SEALED</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Then Paul tells us that we have been sealed by God, and He has given us the foretaste of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>God s anointing brings us His divine essence, and God s sealing impresses us with His likeness.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Whenever you seal something, the likeness of the image will be impressed upon it.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The foretaste of the Spirit is for our enjoyment.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>So we must realize Christ as God s anointed One.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>This means that He is the very realization of the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>God has attached us to such a One, and He spontaneously becomes a seal upon us.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>We all have been sealed with the Triune God by the living Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Many Christians can testify that there is no need to ask certain persons if they are Christians.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>When you look at them, there is a seal.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>They bear the impression that they are in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>That is the likeness of the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>God is expressed in their face, and that is the sealing.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>At the same time it is the enjoyment of God.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>We all have been attached to the Triune God, and He is our expression through our enjoyment of Him.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>This is altogether related to the indwelling of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The indwelling of Christ is the attaching, the sealing, and the enjoyment of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>In no other book has there been anything said about the attachment.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>It is only in 2 Corinthians.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>This means that from Paul s own experience he testifies that he is one who has been attached to the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>He did not live by himself.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>He lived by the One to whom he had been attached.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>THE LIFE-GIVING SPIRIT</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Then Paul tells us that we do not need anything of the letter, which means the knowledge of the doctrine of the Scriptures.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Who also hath made us able ministers of the new testament; not of the letter, but of the Spirit: for the letter killeth, but the Spirit giveth life 2 Cor 3:6 .</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>We do not need the letter; we need the Spirit that gives life.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Paul mentioned this in Romans 8, but it is not so clear as in 2 Corinthians 3.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Eventually Paul declares that today the Lord Jesus is that Spirit that gives life.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Now the Lord is that Spirit: and where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is liberty 2 Cor 3:17 .</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The Lord Jesus today is that life-giving Spirit; He is the Spirit that gives life.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>In no other book is Paul so thorough and so clear in telling us that the Lord Jesus Christ is the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>There is only this one verse that tells us so strongly, so bravely, so clearly, and so emphatically that Jesus the Lord today is that Spirit that gives life.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>THE LIBERATING SPIRIT</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>After this, he says that this Spirit, who is the Lord Jesus Himself, is within us liberating us.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>He is liberating us from the letter of the law; from the letter of the doctrines, teachings, and knowledge, and from regulations, rituals, etc. He is the liberating Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Human culture is a bondage.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Religion is another bondage.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Every doctrine in letter is so binding.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Even knowledge can be a snare.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Religion, culture, doctrine, and knowledge confine people.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>They may restrain them from being wild, but in another sense they bind them and kill them spiritually.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>But now the Lord Jesus is not only the life-giving Spirit, but also the liberating Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>He is within us, and wherever the Lord is, there is liberty.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>He is the liberating Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Again I say that in no other book do you have such a verse that clearly tells us that Jesus today is the liberating Spirit, liberating us from within by being our life.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Most Christians think that Jesus liberates us from outside.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>But in this chapter, Paul tells us that the liberation Jesus affords us is from within.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>It is mainly not His power, but by His life.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>He is the life-giving Spirit, liberating us from within.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>The more we take Him as our life and person, the more we are liberated from all bondage.</S>
