Then after Psalm 16, we have no more until Psalm 22. What about the Psalms between Psalm 16 and 22-Psalms 17, 18, 19, 20, and 21? By reading them carefully, we may realize that in these Psalms there is a certain kind of improvement. These Psalms are unlike Psalms 3 through 7 or 9 through 15. We may extend our little sketch to include these Psalms and to show the spiritual level and progression:<p>Psalms 17 through 21 are down from the level of Psalm 16, but they are not as far down as Psalm 3 through 7 and 9 through 15. Later, following Psalm 24, we will see more and more improvement, till finally, when we reach the last book of the Psalms, there will be no further declining. At the end of the Psalms, we have improvement to the uttermost, and the normal level is attained.<h2 class=head1>FROM THE LAW TO THE ANOINTED ONE</h2><p>Here, in Psalms 17 through 21, we have the first stage of improvement. We may define these Psalms as follows: The saints&#8217; prayers firstly take the righteousness of the law as a base, but later turn to God&#8217;s Anointed One, Christ, as the center. Do you see the improvement? The writers of these Psalms also appreciate the house of God. (See Psalm 18:6 and 20:2.) They realize that God hears their voices from His temple, that God sends them help from the sanctuary and strengthens them out of Zion. To this extent they appreciate God&#8217;s dwelling place.<p>Psalm 19, as an insertion in this section, shows that the righteousness upon which the saints rely is of two kinds of testimony-the testimony of creation and the testimony of the law. But when we come to Psalms 20 and 21, God&#8217;s Anointed One becomes God&#8217;s testimony. The three great testimonies that God has toward man are creation, the law, and Christ. Christ is the last and greatest. For this reason there is the improvement. By this time the Psalmists came to realize something concerning Christ as God&#8217;s Anointed. They said that the king hears when they call (20:9). When they cry, God hears, and the king hears also. They put the king on the same level as God. This is a real improvement.<p>In Psalms 17 through 21 the concept changes from the law to God&#8217;s Anointed; it is gradually shifted from one line to another. Let us read all these verses referring to God&#8217;s Anointed.<p>Psalm 17:15, &#8220;As for me, I will behold thy face in righteousness: I shall be satisfied, when I awake, with thy likeness.&#8221; This is apparently the word of David, but if we read it again and again, we will see that it is in reality the word of Christ. While David was uttering something, the Spirit of Christ spoke within his utterance. This is the utterance of the Anointed. &#8220;As for me, I will behold thy face in righteousness: I shall be satisfied, when I awake, with thy likeness.&#8221; Many Bible students believe this expresses the desire of Christ during the three days between His crucifixion and resurrection. &#8220;When I awake (that means &#8220;when I arise&#8221;) I will be satisfied with thy likeness,&#8221; with the likeness of the Father. This was Christ&#8217;s desire while He was dead those three days. This is the desire of resurrection.<p>Now let us read Psalm 18:43-44: &#8220;Thou hast delivered me from the strivings of the people; and thou hast made me the head of the nations.&#8221; This, of course, does not refer to David; David was not the head of the nations, but Christ. These were the words of David, but within David&#8217;s words was the utterance of Christ. David was indeed God&#8217;s anointed king, but now Christ uttered something within David&#8217;s utterance. &#8220;A people whom I have not known shall serve me. As soon as they hear of me, they shall obey me: the strangers shall submit themselves unto me.&#8221; This must be Christ. Now verse 50: &#8220;Great deliverance giveth he to his king; and showeth mercy to his anointed, to David, and to his seed for evermore.&#8221; &#8220;Seed&#8221; here is singular, not plural. The seed is Christ. You see, the concept of the Psalms has been shifted from the law to the Anointed. This is indeed an improvement.<p>Now let us go on to Psalm 20, verses 6 and 9: &#8220;Now know I that the Lord saveth his anointed; he will hear him from his holy heaven with the saving strength of his right hand.&#8221; No doubt the king, the anointed, is Christ. &#8220;Save, Lord: let the king hear us when we call.&#8221; This is a wonderful verse. Who is the king? Christ is the King, the Anointed.<p>Psalm 21:3-5: &#8220;For thou preventest him with the blessings of goodness: thou settest a crown of pure gold on his head. He asked life of thee, and thou gavest it him, even length of days for ever and ever.&#8221; This verse is just like Revelation 1:18, which says, &#8220;I am living for evermore.&#8221; Verse 5: &#8220;His glory is great in thy salvation: honor and majesty hast thou laid upon him.&#8221; Here we have one with glory, honor, majesty, and length of days. Who is this one? Undoubtedly, it is Christ. The concept of the Psalmist has totally changed; so, I say, there is an improvement. We could not see this kind of improvement in Psalms 3 through 7 or 9 through 15; it did not appear until after Psalm 16.<br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_015.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_017.html">Next</a> </body></html>
