   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE WHOLE BODY SERVING Church Service Being Absolutely</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>under the Sovereignty of the Holy Spirit</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Brother Witness Lee: What is the difference and relationship between the coordination in the Body, the coordination among the co-workers, and the coordination among the brothers and sisters?</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Is coordination merely a matter of following the ministers, or is there something else?</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Brother Nee: For all the time that the church has been on this earth, God never asks man to direct the church.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>God never asks a few more advanced ones to direct a church.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The services in a local church are the result of the assignment of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>We may think that the brothers who have good behavior and who have some gifts in addition are the best candidates for services.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>But actually, things often work out exactly the opposite.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Those who appear to be qualified do not have the gifts, and those who do not appear to be qualified have the gifts.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Although some do not appear to be qualified, others are saved through them.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The ones who appear to be qualified, on the contrary, cannot bring others to salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Sometimes, the Lord would do something that leaves one bewildered as to what to make of it.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>We have to realize that today the gifts are not under our control.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Moreover, we cannot even ask for the gifts.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Everything depends on the sovereignty of the Holy Spirit 1 Cor 12:11 .</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Man is unable to do anything; he can only submit to the works of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>When God wanted Saul of Tarsus, He chose Saul of Tarsus.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Today our concept is that Paul is our dear brother.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>But if you were to ask the people in Jerusalem at that time, everyone would have told you that they were afraid of Saul.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Even those in Tarsus were afraid of him.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Others never imagined that Saul would be saved.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Even Saul himself did not imagine that he would be saved.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Today we have to see the sovereignty of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Everything is under His sovereignty.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Those who do not learn to submit under the Holy Spirit will never do a good work.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Paul did not receive his authority through his commission.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>A commission by itself does not give a person authority.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Only when the Holy Spirit gives man authority will he have the authority.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Paul told the Corinthians that they were his letters of commendation 2 Cor 3:2 .</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Where there is the gift, there is the ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Where there is the ministry, there is the authority.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>This point cannot be argued.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Paul received the gift and became the minister.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Therefore, he could exercise authority over others.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>He did not need any commendation other than this authority.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>We often say, "Lord, You are the Head of the church.''</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>This is easy to say, but it is not easy to be realized.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Every work is initiated by the Lord; only He can raise up the gifts.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>All that the responsible ones are doing is cooperating with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>If a man tries to act according to his self-will today, the church should exercise some kind of arrangement.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>This arrangement is for the purpose of dealing with his flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>An arrangement should not be considered as the appointment of a gift.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Because there is the flesh, there is the need for some arrangement.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Such arrangement is for the purpose of frustrating, subduing, and restricting the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>All works that originate from self-will cannot come into the church.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The revival of the church does not come through man's arrangements, but through the sovereign operation of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Without the sovereignty of the Holy Spirit, any commendation, commission, or authorization is useless.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>The most it will do is to add a few signatures to the letter of recommendation.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>The Whole Body Serving Being</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>the Greatest Recovery Today</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>We have to see that if the one-talented ones do not rise up to serve, there is no way for the church to go on.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>The priesthood is a universal priesthood.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>This is the greatest recovery of this century.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Many people think that the matter of service is the work of a few people, but true service involves the whole Body.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>As long as this matter is not fully recovered, we have to go on speaking.</S>
