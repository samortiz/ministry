[1]  CHAPTER ONE CHARACTER THE FIRST GROUP GENUINE, EXACT, STRICT 1.
[2]  Whereas our words represent our person, our character is our very person.
[3]  A person s usefulness, the things which can be entrusted to him, the responsibilities he can bear, and the things he is able to accomplish altogether depend on his character.
[4]  Accordingly, character has very much to do with the Lord s service.
[5]  CHAPTER THREE EXAMPLES OF A PROPER CHARACTER Scripture Reading: Mark 1:35; 3:20-21; 6:30-31, 34; 8:1-10
[6]  In this chapter we shall consider what kind of character the Lord Jesus had while He was on the earth.
[7]  We may think that those of us who serve the Lord need to have a proper character, but that the Lord Jesus had no such need.
[8]  However, if we read the four Gospels carefully, we can see that while the Lord was on the earth, His service before God depended greatly on His character.
[9]  All those who study the Bible can perceive in this Gospel the character of the Servant of God.
[10]  If you are able to distinguish between disposition and character, you will find the matter of disposition in the Gospel of Luke and the matter of character in the Gospel of Mark.
[11]  We must see that in the matter of serving the Lord and being a servant of God, the one thing that is indispensable is a proper character.
[12]  In the Apostle Paul s writings in his Epistles concerning the Lord Jesus, we can actually see the writer himself.
[13]  Though all of Paul s Epistles concern Christ, they allow us to see Paul.
[14]  On the other hand, Paul said, Always bearing about in the body the putting to death of Jesus, that the life also of Jesus might be manifested in our body 2 Cor 4:10 , and also, And we all with unveiled face, beholding and reflecting as a mirror the glory of the Lord, are being transformed into the same image from glory to glory, even as from the Lord Spirit 2 Cor 3:18 .
[15]  We can immediately realize from this illustration that our usefulness in the Lord s hand is based on our character and that it takes our character to minister life.
[16]  To build up your character, you must keep the rules governing which bed you should sleep in, where you should hang your clothes, and where you should store your suitcase.
[17]  I do not recognize this as life, yet if you desire to serve the Lord, you must be particular about your character.
[18]  CHAPTER FOUR CHARACTER BUILDING Scripture Reading: 2 Cor 3:5-6; 4:2-3
[19]  In this chapter we will cover the things that a serving one should build up before the Lord.
[20]  To be useful in the Lord s hand, one who serves Him must first be properly built up.
[21]  We have said that if a person desires to be used by the Lord, he must realize that his natural life is unuseable in the Lord s hand and that he himself is totally corrupt before the Lord.
[22]  This building up refers not only to the inward constitution of the Lord s life but also to the development of his character.
[23]  Brothers and sisters, please remember that when God uses you to accomplish His work, you cannot add anything of your own, since all that you have does not avail in God s work.
[24]  So never assume that you are clear about the Lord s teaching and say, Well, we are just thorn-bushes; we have no function in God s work, and we cannot add glow to His fire.
[25]  At the very least, one who wishes to be used by God must certainly receive some education.
[26]  It is difficult for an unlearned person who has not developed his mind through education to be useful to God.
[27]  Being educated is a condition that we must fulfill in order for God to use us.
[28]  Brothers and sisters, if you can use a reference book in Greek, read English, and write fluently in Chinese, you will see how much your usefulness will multiply in the Lord s hand.
[29]  If your character is deficient, you will not be of much use in the Lord s hand.
[30]  This is by no means a great doctrine, yet it has much to do with our usefulness to the Lord.
[31]  I do not wish to find fault with you, but I feel that I have a responsibility before the Lord to say this to you: some of you impress me as being lazy.
[32]  I realize that you are not intentionally lazy but are so because there is not the element of diligence in your character.
[33]  As we have been raised in such an environment, if we are not completely revolutionized within, and if we bring our national character into the Lord s service, our service will never be successful.
[34]  If your dress, your home, and the things you do reveal that you are a careless and passive person, how can your service to the Lord be aggressive?
[35]  I realize that my speaking has been somewhat fragmented, but I hope that from now on you will seize every occasion, large and small, to build up your character so that you will be suitable for God s use.
[36]  CHAPTER FIVE A CHARACTER USEFUL TO THE LORD Scripture Reading: 2 Tim 2:20, 21
[37]  In this chapter we will again consider the character of one who serves the Lord.
[38]  In 2 Timothy 2:20-21 the apostle indicated that to be a servant of the Lord one must be useful to the master.
[39]  Then in chapter four he showed us not only that he was not made sufficient of himself but also that he did not preach himself; he preached Christ Jesus as Lord.
[40]  Because if our cleverness, wisdom, and ability are not subdued by the Lord, what we do will definitely be of ourselves, not of the Lord.
[41]  Similarly, we do not minister our character to others, but we bear Christ to them by our character.
[42]  It would actually be very worthwhile for you to study the character of persons from Abraham in the Old Testament to John in the New Testament.
[43]  This shows us that the extent to which God could use him depended on how much his character had been developed before the Lord.
[44]  There is no doubt that the God who filled Moses was unlimited; however, Moses ability to testify and minister the God who filled him was based upon the character he had developed during his shepherding years.
[45]  His compassion toward the Israelites was many times deeper than a mother s. With such a character it was no wonder that God s fire could burn upon him.
[46]  Since God was manifested through him, God must have been the life, but Moses needed such a character to uphold God s manifestation.
[47]  The spiritual life is the Christ constituted in you, the Christ seen by you, the Christ known by you, the Christ with whom you are filled.
[48]  The point here is that as Christ has been seen by you and is being ministered to others through you, what kind of character should you have in order to be useful?
[49]  If you take pleasure only in preaching the all-inclusive Christ and His all-inclusive death on the cross, yet you are not willing to engage in trivial duties in your daily life, there is a shortage in your character.
[50]  If these qualities are not in your character, it makes little difference whether you are available for the Lord s service or not.
[51]  Therefore, in order to serve the Lord, to preach the gospel, and to establish churches, you must build up a character that is useful to the Lord.
[52]  I am sure that we have all seen the Lord s way clearly and that our motives are pure.
[53]  We are surely destined to take this way, but the extent to which the Lord can have His way in us depends on how much our disposition has been overthrown and our nature broken.
[54]  A person s work or service is absolutely related to his character.
[55]  As his character is, so will be his way of doing things and his work.
[56]  Therefore, while learning to serve the Lord, we need to be in constant fellowship with Him and rely on His grace; on the other hand, we also must deal severely with our character.
[57]  We cannot say that the Holy Spirit does not touch or interfere with the matters of our character, such as the way we conduct ourselves and the way we do things, but we are wrong if we expect the Holy Spirit to build a good character for us.
