<p>I began speaking for the Lord in 1927 when I was invited to speak to denominations and other Christian gatherings. However, that was not regular. It was not until a church was raised up in my hometown of Chefoo in 1932 that I began to speak on a regular basis for the Lord. I spoke at least three to five times every week. That was over fifty-two years ago. During these fifty-two years I have listened to many pastors and preachers and paid attention to the content of their messages. For over half a century, while I labored, I also observed how others labored. In addition, I was born into Christianity; on my mother&rsquo;s side I am a fourth-generation Christian, and I studied in Christian schools from elementary school through junior college. It can therefore be said that I have a considerable amount of knowledge concerning today&rsquo;s Christianity.</p>
<h2 class="head1">AN UNPRECEDENTED DESIRE<br />
FOR THE GOSPEL AND THE TRUTH<br />
BEING IN MAN&rsquo;S HEART</h2>
<p>According to my observation, there is an unprecedented openness toward the Lord in the heart of people today. This is seen in their desire to hear the gospel. I have been laboring in America for over twenty-two years. During this time we have not seen such openness to the Lord in the heart of men, nor have we seen such a desire for the gospel. The Chinese migrants are the source of this situation. When I received the burden to go to America twenty-three years ago, I was clear that I was taking the Lord&rsquo;s recovery to the English-speaking world; I was not going there to do a work among the Chinese. Therefore, I spent my time and energy on the American people. For nearly twenty years I did not stress the work among the Chinese in America, because I knew that if many Chinese were saved, it would be difficult to bring in the Americans. The Lord confirmed the way we took, by bringing thousands of American brothers and sisters into the recovery.</p>
<p>However, two years ago there was a change in the American immigration law, which increased the quota for Chinese immigrants from twenty thousand to forty thousand. This enabled many Chinese to move to the United States, and many of our brothers and sisters also went. Then I had the feeling that if we do not care for the Chinese brothers and sisters, we would lose them. Thus, we began the work among the Chinese, and we found out that the Chinese students throughout the various campuses in the United States were open to the gospel.</p>
<p>We had a welcoming meeting at the University of Southern California the day before school started. This is the largest private university in Los Angeles. Over fifty Chinese freshmen came to that gathering. We also have Chinese-speaking meetings at the University of California in Los Angeles. This fall when school started, there were over fifty students at our welcoming meeting. Some may think that fifty students is not a large number, but the American saints were amazed that so many Chinese students responded to the gospel at a college campus. The brothers who care for the students on the various campuses have found out that no matter where they go, people&rsquo;s hearts are open. The American students have also changed. The 1960s was the age of the hippies, but we are now in 1984, and there are no more hippies. The American trends come fast and go fast. The college students today are industrious and aggressive, and they are open to the gospel.</p>
<p>Furthermore, we discovered that Christians today like to read the Bible, and they want to understand the Bible. They may read books, periodicals, and pamphlets related to the Bible, but they pay great attention to expositions of the Bible. Their desire to understand the Bible is unprecedented. I have labored for the Lord for over thirty years in China and over twenty years in the United States, but I have never seen such a situation. There is an unprecedented need for the gospel, for Bible interpretation, and for the truth, because people everywhere have an open heart.</p><h2 class="head1">THE POOR CONDITION OF CHRISTIANITY</h2>
<p>On the negative side, the poor condition of Christianity is also unprecedented. Since the end of World War II until the present, for thirty-nine years, Christianity has been in a poor condition. I have been laboring in America and observing the condition of Christianity for more than twenty years. During this time I paid particular attention to the publications in Christianity. Even though I did not have the time to read all the Christian publications, I urged the brothers to observe them. We have paid attention to the views of other believers and how they work.</p>
<p>The Christian publications that can be considered weighty are in English and in Chinese. God is using even the Chinese language. In the twentieth century the release of God&rsquo;s word in the Spanish language has been rare. The Christian publications with content are in English and in Chinese.</p>
<p>From the end of the nineteenth century to the middle of the twentieth century spiritual publications concerning the divine life, the truth, and expositions of the Bible gushed forth like a waterfall. These publications were mainly in English. I was saved in that tide. After my salvation the Lord brought me into the flow of the truth. Therefore, even though I was born in China, I collected many spiritual publications in English. In addition, the missionaries who went to China printed many spiritual publications. Consequently, by the time I was saved, there were already several publications in China that had some spiritual weight. The most outstanding publication was <em>The Spiritual Light.</em> This magazine was published in Nanking and was jointly managed by some believers in China. The editor-in-chief later became a senior co-worker sister among us. The articles in that magazine were quite spiritual. Another highly regarded publication was <em>The Bible Magazine</em> published in Wuchow, Kwangsi. Its editor-in-chief was a missionary of the Christian and Missionary Alliance. This publication was concerning Bible interpretation. Almost every seeking Christian in China had a copy of this publication.</p>
<p>However, since 1945 until the present there has not been a publication with spiritual weight in English or in Chinese. Many Christian publications are being printed, but they are like newspapers and lack content concerning the divine life, the truth, and Bible exposition.</p>
<p>The use of radios, telephones, and televisions made communication convenient after World War II. It is now easy for the whole world to know what transpires in a given place within a short time; nothing can be hidden. It seems as if the world has become smaller. A book published in Hong Kong can be purchased in the United States shortly after it is printed, and a book published in the United States can be purchased in Taiwan. The convenience in communication makes it easy to know what is being published in Christianity without much effort. Hence, we can boldly say that in the last thirty-nine years few Christian publications with spiritual weight were published in the world. This shows the poor condition of Christianity. Therefore, the present need is indeed great. The need for the gospel and the truth has increased, and many people are very open. They do not know God, Christ, or their real need, but their hearts are open. Many believers want to read and understand the Bible, and the young people in particular want to study books on Bible exposition. It is regrettable that the supply in Christianity cannot satisfy people&rsquo;s need. This is the true condition of Christianity today.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE LORD&rsquo;S RECOVERY<br />
BEING FULL OF THE TRUTH</h2>
<p>We are in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery where the Lord is recovering the truth. We are founded on the truth, and we pay attention to the truth, not material riches, just as Peter said in Acts, &ldquo;Silver and gold I do not possess&rdquo; (3:6). The Lord has filled our hands with the truth. In China this shocked the Chinese believers and also the Western missionaries. The Western missionaries had the concept that they were going to preach the gospel and teach the Chinese people. They did not know that we knew so much of the truth.</p>
<p>In 1937 there was a burden in the work to take the rich truths among us to the brothers and sisters in the various sects and denominations. Therefore, according to the arrangement in the work, I was assigned to the northern and northwestern parts of China. Beginning from the summer of that year, I visited the various Christian denominations in the seven provinces of Shantung, Hopeh, Shansi, Honan, Suiyuan, Shensi, and Kansu to teach them the truth.</p>
<p>One day I met an American missionary in his forties in Shensi province. He was with the Church of the Nazarene. In our conversation I found out that he attended the Nazarene Theological Seminary in America, but he had not heard of J. N. Darby, Jessie Penn-Lewis, D. M. Panton, or Robert Govett. He was surprised to hear me speak of so many names that he did not know. The Western missionaries considered that the Chinese only knew Buddhism and that the more learned Chinese knew the teachings of Confucius but not the truths of the Bible. They could not imagine that we knew the Bible.</p>
<p>We can say that for the last one hundred years, the four people I spoke of were authorities in Bible exposition, the experience of the divine life, and the truth. However, even though J. N. Darby can be considered the king of Bible expositors, some of the Western missionaries who went to China to teach the Bible did not know about Darby. They did not know that we read <em>The Synopsis of the Bible</em> by Darby. They did not know the Bible as we knew it, because they did not see the light that we saw.</p>
<p>As an example, after I was saved, I learned the Bible from teachers of the Brethren Assembly. The Brethren teachers are renowned for their knowledge of the biblical types and prophecies. I was with the Brethren Assembly for seven and a half years and learned these things. Therefore, in my conversation with the Western missionary, I asked him about the seven weeks and the sixty-two weeks in Daniel 9, but he did not know about them. However, someone who was considered to be ignorant of the Bible was able to speak about these matters.</p>
<p>When we came to Taiwan, we published <em>The Crucial Truths in the Holy Scriptures.</em> This book consisted of sixty topics of the truth. Then in 1951 we began printing a magazine entitled <em>The Ministry of the Word.</em> We have printed this magazine for thirty-three years, and many brothers and sisters in Southeast Asia attest that it has been a spiritual supply to the overseas churches.</p>
<p>When I went to America twenty-three years ago, I established the publication work there, and I published <em>The Stream</em> magazine. After ten years, in 1974, I realized that it was inadequate to share messages merely on various types. In those days we held conferences on a specific subject, and I would give ten to twenty messages that were focused on the same crucial point. However, this was inadequate for the perfecting of the saints. Therefore, I began to seek another way.</p><h2 class="head1">THE LIFE-STUDIES OF THE NEW TESTAMENT</h2>
<p>By the Lord&rsquo;s mercy, after being immersed in the Bible for almost fifty years, in 1974 I was burdened to put my knowledge of the Bible into writing by holding two trainings every year, one in the summer and the other in the winter. In every training we covered a book in the Bible, but books that are more profound and difficult, such as Ephesians, were covered in two trainings.</p>
<p>Beginning from 1974, we have held twenty-one trainings in ten and a half years. These trainings were published as Life-study messages. There is only one book left for us to cover, and that is the book of Acts. We will finish the entire New Testament in the winter training of 1984. The Lord has enabled me to spend eleven years to write footnotes for every chapter of the twenty-seven books in the New Testament and to provide outlines and cross references for every book. In addition, there are about one thousand two hundred Life-study messages, and every message has approximately ten pages. This is a total of about twelve thousand pages. The Life-study messages of the New Testament are rich.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Releasing the Truth and Ministering Life</h2>
<p>The goal of the life-study trainings is to release the mystery and truth in the Bible from the perspective of life. <em>Life-study</em> is a term that we invented. This term had not been used throughout the two thousand years of church history. We thank the Lord that the Life-study messages are now popular. A brother read a book concerning reading the Bible that was published by a seminary in Taiwan. The book says that the best way to read the Bible is to read it in the way of a life-study. This seminary not only accepts the term <em>life-study</em> but also says that it is the best way to read the Bible. We agree with this statement. Whenever we prayerfully read a Life-study message, we touch life and are enlivened and satisfied.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Opening the Scriptures</h2>
<p>Another purpose in holding the life-study trainings is to open the Scriptures. The footnotes in the Recovery Version of the New Testament are the key to opening the Bible. If we read some verses and carefully study the footnotes for those verses, that chapter of the Bible will be opened to us.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Solving Problems in Reading the Bible</h2>
<p>My intention is also to help believers by explaining difficult portions that have been encountered by Bible readers for years. When I began reading the Bible, there were certain portions that I could not understand, even after I had done a considerable amount of research and study. An example of a difficult portion is 1 Peter 3:18, which says, &ldquo;Christ also has suffered once for sins, the Righteous on behalf of the unrighteous,...on the one hand being put to death in the flesh, but on the other, made alive in the Spirit.&rdquo; For over fifty years I did not understand this verse. It was not until the life-study training on 1 Peter that I received clear light concerning this verse. When the Lord Jesus was crucified, He was a grain of wheat that fell into the ground and died (John 12:24). When a grain of wheat falls into the ground and dies, the &ldquo;death&rdquo; it experiences operates on the shell of the grain. When water is added to the soil, the shell of the grain decays, but while the shell is decaying, the life within the grain begins to operate. This is the meaning in 1 Peter 3:18 of the Lord being put to death in the flesh but being made alive in the Spirit.</p>
<p>The Lord Jesus was the grain of wheat, and the shell of the grain was His flesh in which the divine life was concealed. If the Lord did not go to the cross, if His body did not die, He would not have been made alive. Hence, when He was on the cross, He was dying on one hand, and He was being made alive on the other. This is just as a grain of wheat. When the grain falls into the ground, on one hand, it is put to death, but on the other hand, it is made alive. After much study, I found this truth when I wrote the footnotes for the book of 1 Peter. Before then I had not seen the light so clearly concerning the Lord Jesus dying on the cross and being made alive in His Spirit. We do not hear people in Christianity say that when the Lord Jesus was crucified, He was made alive. The Lord&rsquo;s light and truth are truly among us.</p>
<p>We are not here to exalt ourselves, but we are simply stating a fact. Since World War II, for thirty-nine years, there has not been one publication that is weighty concerning Bible exposition, the divine life, or the truth. However, in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery, the twenty-seven books of the New Testament have been clearly expounded and published in about one thousand two hundred Life-study messages with twelve thousand pages.</p><h2 class="head1">GOING OUT TO DISTRIBUTE FOOD</h2>
<p>There is a spiritual famine throughout the earth just as there was a famine in Joseph&rsquo;s time. However, the Lord&rsquo;s recovery is a storehouse filled with food, just as Joseph&rsquo;s storehouses were. We have seen the need among God&rsquo;s children; therefore, we should rise up and distribute the food in our storehouse. If we do not go out to distribute food, our food will breed worms and stink.</p>
<p>When I visited Taiwan in the past, I was not satisfied with our meetings, but this time I have a different feeling. I am satisfied and even surprised, because many saints have become &ldquo;scholarly.&rdquo; Their testimonies and prayers show that they have learned many things, and their use of expressions such as <em>essence</em> and <em>economy</em> shows that their utterance has improved. However, we still need to lift up our eyes to see that many households are starving and that there is famine everywhere. We need to send food to the starving households. Since we have so much food in our household, we should have the heart to distribute this food. The general subject of this training is &ldquo;Guidelines for the Propagation of the Lord&rsquo;s Recovery.&rdquo; The burden and goal of this training is to propagate the Lord&rsquo;s recovery. We should not merely sit in Joseph&rsquo;s storehouses and enjoy the food. We need to distribute and propagate these riches.</p>
<h2 class="head1">PROPAGATING THE LORD&rsquo;S RECOVERY</h2>
<h2 class="head2">Pursuing the Truth to Be Equipped</h2>
<p>For the propagation of the Lord&rsquo;s recovery, we must pursue the truth in order to be equipped. Second Timothy 3:17 says, &ldquo;That the man of God may be complete, fully equipped for every good work.&rdquo; The Bible is our equipment, and we need to be fully equipped in God&rsquo;s word. The Bible is our armor and our weapon in our warfare against the enemy. We do not have pastors or preachers among us. Everyone here is an evangelist and a preacher of the Word. We all need to be teachers of the Word, and we also need to be apostles and prophets.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Speaking to People to Minister the Truth</h2>
<p>Some saints may say that Brother Lee can be an apostle but that they cannot. We should not think that we cannot be apostles. When we speak the truth to our parents, we are apostles. We can say, &ldquo;The Lord Jesus sent me to share good news with you: you need Him. He is life and light, and He is our Redeemer. When you receive Him, you will receive life and be satisfied.&rdquo; When we say this, we are apostles. We can be apostles to our parents even though we are their children. We also have many friends and relatives with whom we can share the good news through preaching the gospel. The Bible reveals that apostles are all-inclusive. Their functions include preaching the gospel, prophesying, and teaching. We are apostles; we preach the gospel, and teach the Bible. Paul said, &ldquo;I was appointed a herald and an apostle...a teacher of the Gentiles in faith and truth&rdquo; (1 Tim. 2:7). Paul was sent to be an apostle to teach people the truth. We must also go out to meet people&rsquo;s need.</p>
<p>We need to be equipped when we teach the Bible. Suppose we have a relative who has been a Christian for many years, but he does not know the meaning of <em>justification, sanctification, essence, economy,</em> and <em>the dispensing of the Triune God.</em> We should be able to speak clearly on sanctification. If we are unable to, we are a &ldquo;false teacher.&rdquo; To be a teacher, we need to know how to speak the truth. We should be able to say, &ldquo;In John 17:17 the Lord Jesus said, &lsquo;Sanctify them in the truth; Your word is truth.&rsquo;&rdquo; Our speaking does not need to be longer than fifteen minutes, but it should be clear. This will surprise our relative, and he will realize that even though he has attended Sunday services for years, he never heard his pastor say that John 17:17 is on sanctification. Perhaps he will open his Bible and consider what we have said. Then he will be supplied.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Redeeming the Time<br />
and Seizing the Opportunity</h2>
<p>If the brothers and sisters in the church in Taipei practice speaking the truth to people every day, there will be a result. In the past, sixty percent of our service to the Lord was in vain, and only forty percent was effective. We often had vain conversations with people and wasted their time by speaking about outward things. We need to seize the opportunity to speak with our relatives a short word about sanctification. When we ride a bus, we should have some gospel tracts and a small Bible with us. If we are equipped, we can speak to people. We may begin a gospel conversation with someone by saying, &ldquo;You are blessed. There is a verse in the Bible that speaks about being blessed, and it says, &lsquo;Blessed are the pure in heart.&rsquo;&rdquo; Whether or not he receives our gospel, we have sown the seed of the gospel into him. During a bus ride of ten or twenty minutes, we can do the work of the gospel. If we will do this, the city of Taipei will be permeated with the gospel in one year, and many will be saved and brought to the church.</p>
<p>Some may say that they are very busy, because they go to school, work, and do other things. In addition, they have a busy church life with meetings and services every day. Therefore, they do not have time for anything else. We should never be busy in a blind way and not have any result. We should consider how much time we waste in a day. We need to redeem the time and labor in the gospel in our neighborhood, at school, and at work. We may need to be like a nurse who speaks with people when she is giving them a vaccination. We do not need to hold a Bible in our hand in order to speak the truth, and we do not need to look as if we are spiritual. We simply need to be spontaneous. We need to spread the good news and be a gospel messenger. We also need to study the truth.</p>
<p>The outline of this message presents the following main points: the apostle Paul was a teacher of the truth (1 Tim. 2:7), the church is the pillar and base of the truth (3:15), God desires all men to be saved and to come to the full knowledge of the truth (2:4; 4:3; 2 Tim. 2:25; 3:7; Titus 1:1), the word of the truth is the gospel of our salvation (Eph. 1:13), knowing the truth sets us free (John 8:32), God&rsquo;s word is the truth that sanctifies us (17:17), we must build up ourselves upon our most holy faith (Jude 20), we must be fully equipped with the Scripture (2 Tim. 3:16-17), we must cut straight the word of the truth (2:15), and the word of God grows (Acts 6:7; 12:24). These items require our careful study.</p>
<p>If we meet a pastor in Christianity, we should fellowship with him and speak the truth to him. Even if we speak with an archbishop in the Catholic Church, we can say to him, &ldquo;Everyone needs to be regenerated, and you also need to be regenerated.&rdquo; We can speak the truth concerning regeneration. We need to be trained and to practice so that we are not intimidated when we see a pastor or an archbishop. We all need to speak the truth, cut straight the word of the truth, and open the Bible to people in a clear way. Then people will be convinced and subdued, both inwardly and outwardly. We cannot hire people to speak in this way, because such people are a priceless treasure. The Lord Jesus needs thousands of priceless treasures who manifest their function.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Cooperating with the Lord<br />
by Praying Desperately</h2>
<p>This is not a tough requirement. Some may say that this is too difficult and that I want to reap where I did not sow and to gather where I did not winnow. But the Lord Jesus has already winnowed, and the harvest is ripe. There are millions of &ldquo;fish&rdquo; in Taipei. As long as we go out, we will catch a few. This word is fair. Our need today is to practice. We need to be determined to practice. If we do not practice, we need to fast, and if our labor has no result, we should also fast. We should say, &ldquo;Lord, I am fasting because my work is not effective, but the work of the other saints is effective.&rdquo; To fast is to refuse to eat before God. God loves us, and He is concerned when we do not eat. If we have this kind of desperation, our work will be effective.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER TWO</h1>

<h2 class="head1">THE LORD&rsquo;S RECOVERY<br />
BEING A RECOVERY OF THE TRUTH</h2>
<p>In the previous chapter we saw the actual condition among Christians in relation to the pursuit of the truth. We will continue to speak concerning the truth in this chapter. The Lord&rsquo;s recovery is a recovery of the truth. We were founded on the truth, and for the past sixty years we have continued our existence by the truth. This is the situation in the Far East and in the West. By the Lord&rsquo;s grace we can say that on all five continents the Lord&rsquo;s recovery is strong and rich in the truth. The Lord&rsquo;s recovery is full of light. Whenever I open the Bible and begin to write, light comes. Some may say that the books of the Bible are sufficiently explained in the Life-study messages. However, what I wrote is but a small portion; I wrote according to the actual need of the saints and according to their ability to receive. The Lord continues to give us light, and I worship Him for this.</p>
<p>It is a great thing for the Lord&rsquo;s word to come to us and for His light to shine on us. By the Lord&rsquo;s mercy we have been able to convey His revelation in spoken and printed words. Our position, authority, and power lie entirely in the truth. If the truth were taken away from the Lord&rsquo;s recovery, there would be nothing left. We do not have organization or methods, and we cannot rely on organization or methods. The truth is the solid rock on which we stand. Paul says, &ldquo;The house of God...is the church of the living God, the pillar and base of the truth&rdquo; (1 Tim. 3:15). The church is the pillar and base of the truth. If a pillar and base are not upholding something, they are not functioning. What the church upholds is the truth.</p>
<h2 class="head1">LEARNING THE TRUTH<br />
AND TEACHING THE TRUTH</h2>
<p>We were founded on the truth, we began our work with the truth, and we exist by the truth. The truth is our stand, our position, our authority, and our power. On the one hand, all the brothers and sisters respect, treasure, and appreciate the truth, but on the other hand, we must confess that not many in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery actually pay the price to enter into the truth. Toward the end of last year, as I considered the situation in the Far East and in the West, I realized that there was a crisis among us: The co-workers did not pay sufficient attention to the truth; they did not enter into the truth. As a result, they were unconsciously manifesting signs of deviation.</p>
<p>This is the reason that I called an urgent meeting in February of this year for all the elders and co-workers in the recovery. Even though I was busy with many matters, I set aside two weeks to meet with the brothers. During that time I followed the Lord&rsquo;s leading and released a strong word. The brothers admitted that those messages saved us from an impending crisis. We addressed being constituted with the truth, the need for the truth, and how to focus on the truth. All the messages are printed in the books of the <em>Elders&rsquo; Training</em> for the brothers and sisters to read and learn. (See <em>Elders&rsquo; Training, Books 1&mdash;4.</em>)</p>
<p>Concerning the burden to enter into the truth, I said that even though we appreciate and respect the truth, the saints and even the elders lack the practical application of the truth. We can be compared to students who study and pass examinations but who do not know how to teach others. It is one thing to learn mathematics and pass a test, but it is another to teach mathematics. The Lord&rsquo;s recovery needs those who are able to teach the truth. This is according to the Bible, which says that we should come to the full knowledge of the truth and that we should teach others the truth (1 Tim. 2:4; 2 Tim. 2:2). When Paul wrote the Epistles to Timothy, he paid much attention to this matter. Paul said that the elders who take the lead well should be counted worthy of double honor, especially those who labor in word and teaching (1 Tim. 5:17).</p>
<p>Being an elder is more than being a shepherd who cares for the saints. According to Ephesians 4:11, shepherds are teachers. The Lord gave four categories of gifted persons to the church. He gave apostles, prophets, evangelists, and shepherds and teachers. Based on the grammatical structure of verse 11, <em>shepherds and teachers</em> refers to the same group of gifts. If we want to be shepherds, we need to learn to teach. If we do not know how to teach, how can we shepherd others? Therefore, shepherds need to be able to teach. It is regrettable that we are satisfied if the elders in the churches are only able to manage business affairs. The elders surely need to know how to manage business affairs; otherwise, the church will be chaotic. However, the church does not have only business affairs. The business affairs in the church are for God&rsquo;s economy. They are for accomplishing God&rsquo;s eternal purpose and fulfilling His heart&rsquo;s desire, which is Christ as the mystery of God and the church as the mystery of Christ. This cannot be accomplished merely by managing business affairs. It requires the elders who take the lead to teach the saints the truth.</p>
<p>The Bible does not emphasize spiritual education in schools; it emphasizes the homes. This refers mainly to the education rendered by mothers. We always refer to the elders as fathers, but they should be mothers, not fathers. The strength of a family depends thirty percent on the father and seventy percent on the mother. If a mother is weak, the family will be weak even if the father is strong. A strong mother does not only have a strong will; she also has strong character, integrity, and morality. She should also be strong in knowledge. She should be able to teach her children at home, whether the subject is mathematics, geography, or natural sciences. In this modern age a good mother must receive higher education; otherwise, her children will not receive help with their homework. We must be mothers who lovingly and patiently care for our children. We change their diapers, feed them, cook for them, wash their clothes, and teach them. These preparations are for them to become useful.</p>
<p>Whether a person becomes useful depends on the education that he receives. A person&rsquo;s education should be comprehensive. A mother cannot say that she cannot teach Chinese because she is an expert in mathematics. A competent mother should be able to teach mathematics, geography, English, Chinese literature, and even how to use the computer. Then her children will be useful. This also applies to education in the church.</p>
<p>Establishing a seminary to train students is not God&rsquo;s way. The prophets in the Old Testament may have had disciples, but in the New Testament the apostles did not have disciples. In the New Testament the church is a restaurant, a hospital, and a home that is filled with teaching. Hence, the primary function of the elders is to teach the saints. The atmosphere among us needs to change. The elders in the churches need to enter into the truth and be good mothers who teach the saints in the local churches. Then every church will be a &ldquo;scholarly family,&rdquo; and the brothers and sisters will spontaneously pursue the truth and progress in the truth.</p><h2 class="head1">GOSPELIZING AND TRUTHIZING TAIWAN</h2>
<p>Today Taiwan is prosperous, advanced, and educated. All of these aspects are commendable and can be considered quite outstanding in the world. This provides us with a good situation and an excellent opportunity to gospelize and truthize Taiwan. We need to teach the saints the truth and to go and teach others the truth. We can teach our relatives, friends, classmates, and neighbors. We all have relatives and friends who need us to teach them the truth. In addition, when we take any kind of public transportation, we can speak the truth to those around us. Whether we are taking a short trip or a long trip on the road, even in the train, we can speak with those around us concerning the truth.</p>
<p>The function of the church as a golden lampstand is to shine on people. We should consider whether our church as a golden lampstand is shining. If we are not shining brightly, it may be that the gospel and the truth are not going forth. In the meetings in Taipei, the singing is strong and the atmosphere is uplifted. With such an atmosphere, one thousand saints should be willing to go out to preach the gospel and speak the truth.</p>
<p>The strength displayed in our singing needs to be brought into our daily living. We should be strong in the meetings as well as at home. We can sing a hymn to our relatives and speak the truth to them based on the hymn. If we are unable to speak the truth, we will need to take the way of Christianity and invite our relatives to listen to a message on the Lord&rsquo;s Day. However, regardless of how wonderful the message is, it may not apply to them. Therefore, we should avoid this way and instead speak the truth.</p>
<p>Before visiting Taiwan this time, I received a letter from you, which said that many saints have a burden to go to different places in the world for the propagation of the Lord&rsquo;s testimony. This is very good. However, we first need to truthize Taiwan. This can be compared to an apprentice who is learning to be a barber. A person learning to be a barber should first cut simple hairstyles. We should learn and practice to speak the truth in Taiwan.</p>
<p>When I began to serve the Lord full time in 1933, I knew that I would take this way my whole life. Before this I was an accountant; I never attended a seminary. However, I knew that in order to serve the Lord full time, I had to be able to preach, so I practiced aggressively. I learned as an apprentice and practiced by speaking to the sea. This kind of exercise truly helped, but the effectiveness was not evident, because the object of my preaching, the sea, could not respond. However, our situation is different. There are people for us to practice with everywhere. We can speak in the meetings and in our homes. We can speak to our parents, our relatives, and our friends. No matter where we are, we can practice and learn to speak. We need to speak all the time. If we will receive this word and practice for two months, we will make progress.</p>
<p>In order to teach, we must first learn; without learning we cannot teach. I am burdened for us to see that we must learn the truth. The word of the truth saves us and releases us. It also sanctifies us and builds us up. After we learn the truth, we will be able to speak the truth. Then the truth, the Lord&rsquo;s word, will grow. The more the truth grows, the more it multiplies. If we preach the gospel and teach the truth, our speaking will cause the Lord&rsquo;s word to spread on the island of Taiwan. Eventually, everyone will know the truth. This will be a beautiful situation.</p>
<p>The island of Taiwan is approximately three hundred and ninety kilometers from north to south, and the east and west coasts are divided by the Central Range mountains. It has a population of over nineteen million who reside in concentrated regions. This is a good environment. We should not consider that when we speak to someone, we are speaking only to that person. If the person we are speaking to thinks that our words are reasonable, he will repeat what we say to other people. In this way, our speaking will spread from one person to ten persons, and from ten persons to a hundred persons. We surely need to rise up and speak.</p>
<h2 class="head1">PREACHING THE GOSPEL IN ONE ACCORD</h2>
<p>When we first came to Taiwan, we preached the gospel in one accord, and our whole heart was to preach the gospel. Hence, there was some success. At that time, we printed thousands of gospel tracts for the entire population of Taipei. Then the brothers and sisters distributed the gospel tracts to every house. We divided the city of Taipei into several districts, and the saints went to every street and put gospel tracts in every mailbox. In this way, every household in the city of Taipei received a gospel tract.</p>
<p>We also printed gospel banners, such as, &ldquo;God so loved the world,&rdquo; &ldquo;Jesus is Lord,&rdquo; and &ldquo;Jesus came to the world to save sinners.&rdquo; We posted these banners in train stations, bus stops, and at major intersections. The brothers and sisters also hung banners on their doors. When we saw a house with a big banner hanging on the door, we knew that one of the saints lived there.</p>
<p>In addition, we sent out gospel teams on gospel marches. They went out during the day, and sometimes in the evening. Every Lord&rsquo;s Day afternoon the gospel teams marched from the meeting hall on Renai Road to New Park. They would beat big drums, shout the banners, and sing &ldquo;You need Jesus.&rdquo; There was an amphitheater in the park that could seat three thousand people, and people would come out and fill the amphitheater almost every Lord&rsquo;s Day. We collected at least five hundred names at every gathering. On Monday evening we distributed the names to the saints, and they visited the people on their list. Many elders and deacons in the churches in Taiwan were saved during those gospel gatherings.</p>
<p>Many people were saved in those days. One Saturday evening we baptized about four hundred people in three halls in Taipei and then baptized another three hundred the next morning. We baptized over seven hundred people. By preaching the gospel in this way, our number reached fifty thousand in six to seven years; this was a hundredfold increase. We need to be aggressive in preaching the gospel.</p>
<p>We have been in Taiwan for thirty-five years. In the first seven years our number increased from five hundred to fifty thousand, but since then our number has not increased. If our rate of increase had continued at a hundredfold, we would now have five million saints. If there are fifteen thousand saints in Taiwan who endeavor in the gospel, what would be our rate of increase? If it were only thirty-fivefold, there would be 500,000 saints in Taiwan. Therefore, our goal for the next seven years should be to increase to 500,000. If we think that this is too many, we should at least aim for half of that number, which is 250,000. If we are faithful, our number can reach 250,000 in seven years. This depends on the endeavor of the young brothers and sisters and on the cooperation of the older brothers and sisters.</p><h2 class="head1">THE LIFE-STUDIES BEING<br />
A HELP FOR STUDYING THE BIBLE</h2>
<p>We should not merely get excited concerning this goal. We also need to work hard to learn the truth. Learning the truth is a must, and the only way to learn the truth is to study the Bible. Some believers read only spiritual publications. This is to receive inspiration and can be compared to eating a snack or drinking coffee. We will not be healthy if we eat only snacks and drink coffee. We need to eat proper food. I am healthy because I eat three proper meals every day. I do not rely on snacks. In the same way, our proper, spiritual food is the Bible.</p>
<p>I am thankful to the Lord that I learned from several good teachers in the Brethren Assembly during the first seven years of my Christian life. I also heard much Bible exposition. The impression that the truths of the Bible formed within me is still very powerful and cannot be nullified. We may be touched when we read a spiritual publication, but that feeling will last for only a few days, and then it will vanish. However, the truths of the Bible that enter into us are permanent. Therefore, we should be encouraged to study the Bible. Everyone needs to study the Bible.</p>
<p>I know that it is not easy to understand the Bible. I am burdened to help the saints to enter into the truths of the Bible, because I also experienced difficulties in learning the Bible. This burden to help the saints was the source of my writing the Life-studies, which are included in the footnotes of the Recovery Version of the New Testament. The Lord&rsquo;s recovery has a secure standing in the Far East, and it has spread to every continent in the West. Beginning in 1974 I began to use every opportunity to put my knowledge of the Bible into writing. I was already seventy years old by that time. I labored diligently for eleven years to complete the <em>Life-study of the New Testament.</em> This is a great asset that will render the brothers and sisters much help. During those eleven years, I worked with two helpers for about five hours a day and four to five months every year. This was a long period of time. I wrote notes for every chapter from Matthew to Revelation.</p>
<p>There are several principles in my writing of the Life-study of the Bible. First, the Life-studies are not focused on knowledge. They are a life-study; they do not expound the Bible according to knowledge. Second, the function of the Life-studies is to open our mind so that we can understand the Bible. Hence, as long as we read the Life-studies and the footnotes of the Recovery Version, our mind will be opened to understand the Bible. The Life-studies also resolve difficult portions in the Bible. There are a number of portions in the Bible that have puzzled readers for the past two thousand years. Some of these portions were resolved correctly, others incorrectly, and still others were not resolved. I went through these portions and consulted reference books. I then tried my best to write the answers in a proper and unbiased way. Therefore, almost all the difficult portions in the Bible are resolved in the footnotes of the Recovery Version, and the answers are definite.</p>
<p>I began to study the Bible in my youth. For seven and a half years after I was saved, I met with one of the strictest groups of the Brethren, who are known for their exposition of the Bible. In our meetings we were taught by an elderly British brother who had profound biblical knowledge. He once spent at least six months to expound Romans 1:1-2, which says, &ldquo;The gospel of God, which He promised beforehand through His prophets in the holy Scriptures.&rdquo; Every Lord&rsquo;s Day he expounded clearly and logically the promises in the Old Testament related to the gospel. In those seven and a half years I attended five meetings every week no matter how heavy it rained or how much it snowed. I received a good foundation there. Later I contacted Brother Nee and became his co-worker. I received much help from him. Moreover, I also studied the teachings of the church fathers throughout the centuries and the writings of Martin Luther and the Reformers after him, of the mystics, of the inner-life, and even of Pentecostalism. I collected and assimilated the best Bible expositions in Christianity. These are incorporated in the footnotes of the Recovery Version. Hence, the footnotes contain the very best of Christian knowledge and Bible exposition throughout the generations.</p>
<p>I used simple English when I wrote the footnotes of the Recovery Version. Sometimes my polishers revised the phrases and words, but I made it clear to them that I do not want to show off my learning. I wanted to reduce the scholarly flavor and present the genuine truths to people in simple words. Therefore, the footnotes are easy to read. I spent much time and effort to write the footnotes. I had two helpers who consulted at least twenty different reference books of two categories. The first category of reference books were related to the original text, and the second category were Bible expositions. For example, I spent one week to write footnote 6 for 1 John 1:6 concerning the eight points on <em>truth.</em> I believe that this footnote is a great help to all of us. Before I wrote that footnote, whenever I spoke on the word <em>truth,</em> I had to study in order to determine the proper definition and find the supporting verses. I do not need to do that anymore, because all the definitions and supporting verses are in the footnote. There are quite a number of footnotes like this. Therefore, all the saints, and especially the young people, should be encouraged to read the Recovery Version and the Life-studies of the New Testament.</p><h2 class="head1">READING THE RECOVERY VERSION <br />
AND THE LIFE-STUDIES DAILY</h2>
<p>There are about one thousand two hundred messages in the <em>Life-study of the New Testament.</em> We should read one message a day, and we should also read the Recovery Version of the New Testament with its footnotes and marginal cross references. In other words, we need to read these four things every day: about ten pages of Life-study messages and several verses with their footnotes and cross references in the Recovery Version. If we read six messages a week, we will read at least three hundred messages in a year and one thousand two hundred messages in four years. We can read through the Recovery Version of the New Testament and all the messages in the <em>Life-study of the New Testament</em> in four years. The college graduates who will join the full-time training for two years will read two Life-study messages in four hours daily in the training. They will finish all the Life-study messages in two years.</p>
<p>The brothers and sisters who are willing to read all the Life-study messages and to study every word of the Recovery Version of the New Testament will have a solid foundation. This inexhaustible treasure will be within them for their whole life. I have already put into writing the riches that I accumulated through nearly sixty years of labor. Those who can spend four hours a day will be able to read through these riches in two years. This is truly profitable. The young people should also read all the Life-study messages. The saints, who make a schedule to spend two hours reading daily, can finish in four years. The saints who make a more intense reading schedule and spend four hours a day can finish in two years. If all the churches are willing to practice this, every saint will become a &ldquo;scholar.&rdquo; Then when we go out to speak the truth, we will be knowledgeable and able to clearly and logically present the truth.</p>
<p>Furthermore, I would encourage the saints who can read English to also read the messages in English. This will help them to use the reference books. Some of the young people should also spend the time to learn Greek. They should not expect to become a Greek scholar. It is good to be able to use the Greek reference books, especially the lexicons, dictionaries, and word studies. There are some good word studies of the New Testament Greek. We will receive much help if we use these reference books. I began to use an English-Greek Interlinear Bible in 1932, so I have been referring to the Greek text for fifty-two years. This has been a help to me.</p>
<p>It is not possible for every brother and sister to study the Bible as I did. Therefore, I wrote the footnotes of the Recovery Version of the New Testament and the Life-study messages to help the saints to enter into the truth. However, at least a few saints should spend some time to study Greek. Nevertheless, the <em>Life-study of the New Testament</em> is complete and is an asset to the Lord&rsquo;s recovery. If the Lord delays and I go to be with the Lord, the saints will appreciate the preciousness of this asset. All the saints should receive the Lord&rsquo;s leading and take this way to enter into the truth.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE LEADING OF THE CHURCH<br />
NEEDING TO BE COMPREHENSIVE</h2>
<p>During the first seven years of the work in Taipei, my leading to the church was comprehensive. For example, the training in 1953 included truth, life, the church, and the gospel. The church should not have only one aspect. It should not seek only spirituality or only the preaching of the gospel or only the expounding of Scriptures. The leading of the church should also be comprehensive; it should pay attention to the pursuit of the truth, the growth in life, the practice of the church life, and the preaching of the gospel. Hence, these five chapters are given as guidelines. The first chapter is &ldquo;Pursuing the Truth to Be Equipped&rdquo; and is related to the truth. The second chapter is &ldquo;Growing in Life to Live Christ&rdquo; and is concerning life. The third chapter is &ldquo;Loving to Live the Normal Church Life&rdquo; and is related to the church. The fourth chapter is &ldquo;Being Fervent for the Gospel by Preaching in the Homes and by Spreading through Migration&rdquo; and is about the gospel. These four chapters are according to the comprehensive outlines that we used in the trainings held during the first seven years in Taiwan. Those trainings covered truth, life, the church, and the gospel. The fifth chapter is &ldquo;Bearing the Responsibility to Shepherd and Teach in the Homes and Small Groups.&rdquo; We need a foundation in the truth, the growth in life, and a normal church life. In addition, we need to be fervent to preach the gospel from house to house in our locality and also to spread and propagate the gospel to other places through migration. This is the way found in the Bible. As a result, we will bear some responsibility in the home meetings and group meetings to shepherd and teach the saints.</p>
<p>Of the first four items, pursuing the truth is the most difficult one to practice. The remaining three items have a shortcut, but there is no shortcut for learning the truth. Learning the truth can be compared to studying in school. There is no shortcut. A student must be diligent. When I was young, I memorized Chinese literature in order to be a top student. This was the fruit of diligence. When I learned English, I analyzed the grammar of every word and memorized numerous articles in English. Therefore, when I went to the United States, although I was weak in conversational English, in terms of writing I often corrected the grammar of the American brothers and sisters. I can also understand any verse in the Bible in English, no matter how difficult it is. Sometimes there may be one or two words that I do not know, but due to my proficiency in grammar, I can understand the meaning by analyzing the sentence. If the grammar is inaccurate, our understanding will be inaccurate. Hence, we should not choose an easy way to pursue the truth. Rather, we need to pay the price to learn.</p>
<p>We need to receive this plea and make a resolution to give ourselves to study the Lord&rsquo;s Word. We have a great asset, and this is an excellent opportunity. If we do not understand English, the Life-study messages are in Chinese. Moreover, there are many treasures in <em>The Ministry of the Word</em> magazine, which we have printed from 1951 to the present. Nevertheless, we need to read the Life-studies every day; we should consider them as our main meal. We should consider the other treasures as something sweet that we eat after our meal. Then we will receive the help.</p>
<p>The Lord has blessed us with these rich treasures. The younger generation needs to expand these treasures so that the word of the Lord could increase. We did not have these treasures in the first seven years in Taiwan, but I rejoice that now these treasures are published. Even though there was not much increase in the last years in Taiwan, the churches continued steadily, and we have an asset. Furthermore, I went to the West, and from there the Lord&rsquo;s recovery has spread to the whole world. By the Lord&rsquo;s mercy we held two trainings annually for eleven years and completed the life-study of the entire New Testament. I am satisfied with these treasures.</p>
<p>This is an opportune time for the churches in Taiwan to be encouraged to pick up the way of truth, life, the church, and the gospel that we practiced in the first seven years. We are not poor; we have a rich family inheritance. I have been a Christian for sixty years, but I have not seen a place that can compare to Taiwan. The environment, the level of education, the convenience of transportation, and the prosperity in Taiwan are unprecedented. This is the Lord&rsquo;s mercy. He has enabled us to maintain a good relationship with the different levels of the government these thirty-five years. We have an excellent opportunity to use these treasures so that others can share our blessings. They can share the blessing of the gospel and salvation and also the blessing of the truth and the divine life. This is our responsibility.</p><h2 class="head1">GROWING IN LIFE TO LIVE CHRIST</h2>
<p>Now we come to the main point of this chapter, which is growing in life to live Christ. We first need to see what we mean by growing in life. In order to grow in life we need to be rooted in Christ (Col. 2:7). This means that we should take Christ, not ourselves, as our foundation, our source, in all things. We should not be rooted in education, nor should we be rooted in our business. We need to take Christ as our source and foundation and be rooted in Him in all things. When the apostle Paul spoke of being rooted, the believers in Colossae had accepted Greek philosophy and were keeping the traditions of the Jewish religion. Therefore, Paul exhorted them not to take these things as their foundation but rather to be rooted in Christ by taking Him as their foundation, their source.</p>
<p>After we are rooted in Christ, we need to learn to enjoy the word of God, just as newborn babes long for milk (1 Pet. 2:2-3). The word of God is our milk, and the element in the word is Christ. We need to learn to enjoy the word of God every day, just as newborn babes drink milk. Then we will receive the element of Christ for the increase of His life in us.</p>
<p>The workers who plant and water cannot give us life; rather, it is God within us who gives us life (1 Cor. 3:6-7). No matter what the Lord&rsquo;s workers do, they can only plant and water, not give life. Therefore, everyone who is a co-worker of the Lord must rely on God. Only God is life, and only He can give life to man.</p>
<p>Our growth in life is the result of the growth of God within us (Col. 2:19). As God&rsquo;s element increases in us, we grow in life. We also need to grow up into Christ, the Head, in all things (Eph. 4:15). In the first point we needed to be rooted into Christ, to take Him as our foundation, our source. This point is a continuation of the first point. We need to grow up into Christ in all things. Finally, we need to grow into a holy temple in the Lord (2:21). Our growth in life is not for us to become spiritual giants; it is for us to grow together with others into the dwelling place of the Lord, which is the holy temple, the church. Therefore, growth in life is for the church.</p>
<p>Let us now see what it means to live Christ. Only when we have the growth in life can we live Christ. In order to live Christ, we were made alive through Christ&rsquo;s resurrection (John 14:19; Eph. 2:5-6). Regeneration is the beginning of our living Christ. Through Christ&rsquo;s resurrection we were regenerated, made alive.</p>
<p>We live Christ by growing together with Him in His death and resurrection (Rom. 6:5). We need to remember this word. When a grain of wheat is sown into the ground, it dies, but while it is dying, life is growing. According to Romans 6:3-5, we are baptized into the death of Christ, and when we come out of the water, we enter into His resurrection. Being baptized into death and entering into resurrection are a kind of growth. When Christ was on earth, He lived by dying. His death was not a termination; rather, it was the means for Him to live. We are joined to Him by faith and grow together with Him in His death and resurrection. This is the genuine growth in life. The genuine growth in life is to die to the natural life and to live in the divine life. This is death and resurrection. Christ grew in His death and resurrection, and we also grow together with Him in His death and resurrection.</p>
<p>We also enjoy Christ and thereby live because of Him (John 6:57). After being regenerated and growing in the death and resurrection of Christ, we can enjoy Him through prayer and reading the Bible to fellowship with Him, eat Him, and drink Him. As we enjoy Christ, we live by Him. The Life-studies are a great help for us to enjoy Christ and live by Him. As a result of our living by Christ by enjoying Him, Christ lives in us (Gal. 2:20), and for us to live is Christ (Phil. 1:21).</p>
<p>Finally, regardless of our circumstances, whether through life, through death, through suffering, or through joy, Christ will be magnified in our body (v. 20). The environment can change, but there is one thing within us that cannot change and that is to magnify Christ. We magnify Christ in joy, in suffering, in life, and in death. This is to live Christ, and this is our testimony.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER THREE</h1>

<h2 class="head1">DELIVERING THE MEETINGS FROM PROCEDURE</h2>
<p>Traditional meetings in Christianity follow certain procedures, but we need to be delivered from rigidly following procedures in our meetings. In the meetings we sing hymns, give testimonies, expound the Bible, and release God&rsquo;s word, but we should not be influenced by traditional Christianity and follow traditional procedures whenever we meet.</p>
<p>We have fellowshipped concerning the exercise of the spirit and the release of the spirit since 1960. From 1960 to 1961 I wrote eighty-five new hymns in Chinese, which were mainly concerning the spirit. However, it seems as if the more I promoted the release of the spirit, the less the saints released their spirit, and eventually there was no release of the spirit. Paul says that we should not quench the Spirit (1 Thes. 5:19), because it is easy to quench the Spirit. As believers, we all have a mingled spirit&mdash;the Spirit and our spirit mingled as one spirit. The Christian life, work, testimony, and meetings depend on the mingled spirit. However, if we quench our spirit instead of exercising it, our life, work, testimony, and meetings will be empty.</p>
<p>If our spirit is not exercised, any work that we do will not be the work of the Spirit, and our living will be merely a religious display; we will live and walk according to doctrines. A life that is according to doctrines is not a genuine Christian life. The Christian life depends on the life of Christ, and the life of Christ is our mingled spirit. Our mingled spirit is the life of Christ (Rom. 8:10).</p>
<p>When I went to the United States in 1962, I began the work by speaking concerning the spirit. As a result of this clear speaking, in 1969 the Lord&rsquo;s recovery in the United States reached a climax. I still appreciate the condition of the churches from 1969 to 1972. During this time the meetings in all the churches in the United States reached the highest point. The meetings did not begin in the meeting halls; they began in the homes. If a meeting began at 7:30 in the evening, the saints began to release their spirit in their homes at 6:30. Many brothers and sisters actually lived in the spirit all day long. When they woke up in the morning, they released their spirit and drew near to the Lord. That was the beginning of the evening meeting. In other words, the evening meeting began when the brothers and sisters had their morning watch. During those years the saints were filled in spirit every day.</p>
<p>As a result of daily exercising their spirit, the saints wrote many hymns that are in the English supplement. In addition, an hour before every meeting one could see groups of saints singing on their way to the meeting hall and shouting Amen, Hallelujah. When in the meeting, the saints did not follow any procedures. They praised the Lord and shouted Hallelujah. The meetings were living, and it was easy to release the divine word. The atmosphere of a meeting can function like a water pump and draw words out of a person. Even if a person did not want to speak, it was impossible for him to remain quiet, because the atmosphere of the meeting pulled the words out of him.</p>
<p>However, it is not often that such a situation is seen in Taiwan. This meeting is comparatively good, because it is better than most meetings. According to our habit, we do not testify at the beginning of a meeting. We always testify after the message. This time, we departed from tradition and testified at the beginning of the meeting. I agree with this practice, and we all sensed the freshness. Therefore, in the future we should not go back to our old regulations and follow tradition. Our testimonies should be living. We should never keep our old regulations. We need to learn to be living. Moreover, the saints who did not give a testimony should not consider themselves superior and criticize the saints who testify.</p><h2 class="head1">LEARNING TO GAIN PEOPLE FOR THE LORD</h2>
<p>A young brother testified that he wants to preach the gospel in Africa. I would advise him not to go and preach to the Africans yet but to stay in Taiwan and preach to the Chinese first. We should not have unrealistic dreams. I never dreamed that I would go to America and preach to the Americans. It was the Lord who took me there. My initial consideration was only to spread to northwest China with the manpower from the north and the financial strength from the northeast. However, the Lord took me to America.</p>
<p>Instead of considering where to go, we should first learn some skills. After we learn some skills, we can go anywhere and be able to &ldquo;catch fish&rdquo; wherever we go. We will be fishers of men who gain people regardless of their nationality. If we do not have any skills, we may not be able to gain a single person when we go to Africa. I never dreamed of going to America, but when I went there, I was able to catch a large number of &ldquo;fish,&rdquo; and they are all Caucasian &ldquo;fish.&rdquo; God does not pay that much attention to the place where we labor. God cares for people. Taiwan is a good &ldquo;fishpond.&rdquo; In Taipei we do not even need to get into the pond; the fish are jumping at us. Therefore, we must first catch the &ldquo;fish&rdquo; that are on the streets of Taiwan. After we bring in all the people, we can go forth for the propagation.</p>
<p>For many years I often asked the saints whether a person who loves the Lord but is unable to lead one person to salvation in a year could be excused by the Lord. Now I would ask, &ldquo;Is it too much to ask that we lead one person to the Lord in a year?&rdquo; Regardless of our consideration, this is not a high requirement. We need to make a vow to the Lord to lead one person to salvation every year.</p>
<p>If one thousand saints lead one thousand souls to salvation this year, next year we will have 2,000 saints. At present there are about 5,000 saints who participate in the church life in Taipei, and 3,500 of these saints attend the meetings regularly. If every one of the 5,000 saints gains one person this year, next year there will be 10,000 saints; in the second year, 20,000 saints; in the third year, 40,000 saints; in the fourth year, 80,000 saints; in the fifth year, 160,000 saints; in the sixth year, 320,000 saints; and in the seventh year, 640,000 saints. If we continue to increase in this way, in the tenth year everyone in the city of Taipei will be saved and will be our brother or sister. In other words, the entire city of Taipei can be gospelized in ten years.</p>
<p>In 1949 when we began the work in Taiwan, there were 500 saints in the meetings. In seven years, by 1956, our number increased to 50,000. However, at present there may not even be a total of 50,000 saints who meet in Taiwan. This shows that there has not been any increase during the past twenty-eight years. Even though everyone is busy attending the meetings, our number has not increased. However, the real estate assets of the churches in Taiwan have increased. Twenty-seven years ago there were only three or four meeting halls in Taipei, and they were built with wood. Today there are twenty-one meeting halls in Taipei, and they are all modern buildings. This is also the situation in the other localities. There has been an increase in real estate, but the number of saints did not increase. It is as if we have been boxing for twenty-eight years but have not been able to knock down one person. This shows that our boxing skills are not good, because we have not been able to hit the mark. We need to study our situation to see if there are mistakes in the way that we carry out the work for the Lord&rsquo;s testimony.</p>
<p>The problem of having no increase exists all over the world, not just in Taiwan. We have over five hundred churches on all five continents, but the churches do not have large numbers of saints. We need to be concerned and to study our &ldquo;farming techniques.&rdquo; We should farm in order to reap a harvest.</p>
<p>The elders in Taipei will do a &ldquo;census&rdquo; by organizing the information cards of the saints. They probably have more than twenty thousand information cards. After this conference, the other churches in Taiwan will also organize their information cards. We should not throw away the information cards of the saints whom we cannot locate, because the cards have historical value, and we should ask the saints who do not have an information card to fill one out.</p>
<p>After the churches have finished their &ldquo;census&rdquo; and have organized their information cards, we will know the actual number of saints in Taiwan. We will also know how many are meeting regularly and how many are dormant. The dormant brothers and sisters are the &ldquo;field&rdquo; that we should cultivate. We need to labor on them in love. All the responsible brothers in all the churches in the recovery need to conduct a similar &ldquo;census.&rdquo;</p>
<p>During the past thirty-five years, the Lord has shown mercy to and blessed the church in Taipei. The saints who participate in the church life in Taipei are our &ldquo;land&rdquo; that needs to be cultivated, but we have not cultivated our farmland. These saints work in hospitals, schools, and other places. Even if five hundred full-time serving saints will go to contact these saints, it will not meet the need.</p>
<p>In the Lord&rsquo;s recovery we need to contact and gain people, but we must have the truth. We gain people by the truth. Another way to gain people is with the hymns. Hymns are related to our meetings, and they are related to the Christian life and living. Hence, we need to speak a further word concerning growing in life to live Christ. Growth in life is the foundation of our meetings. If we do not have the growth in life, we will be like little children in our meetings. As we grow and mature in life, we will be mature people in our meetings. The condition of our meetings depends on our growth in life. If we follow the Spirit&rsquo;s leading and pay attention to life, we will grow in life. It is not appropriate for us to remain passive in the meetings. We should bear responsibility for every meeting that we are in. Everyone should bear responsibility for the meetings.</p><h2 class="head1">ALL THE ACTIVITIES<br />
IN THE MEETINGS BEING LIVING</h2>
<p>How should a Christian meeting be conducted? Currently, while we are waiting for everyone to arrive and take their seats, some saints talk and others pray. Then after everyone is seated, we wait for a brother to call a hymn, for another brother to read some verses, and for still another brother to give the message; then after the message we have a time for testimonies. This is a degraded, religious way. A meeting of the church should be a gathering of the saints with their riches that are released with a strong, rich spirit. Everyone should release his spirit and function according to his spirit, not according to any procedures. We do not have written procedures among us; most of our procedures are unwritten. These unwritten procedures are our &ldquo;customs.&rdquo; According to these customs, we do not function in the meetings; we only wait. This is wrong.</p>
<p>We need to have a change. We should not be concerned about what we should do in the meetings. Whether we pray, praise, or sing, it should be living. We need to be delivered from our old way of meeting. If a sister is the first saint to arrive at the meeting hall, she may begin to pray, and as the rest of the saints arrive, they can join the prayer. The brother who gives the message should not follow the old way. Whether he reads the verses in the Scripture reading depends on the sense in his spirit. If he has the sense in his spirit to read the verses first, he should read them; otherwise, he does not need to. During the message a saint may feel led by the Spirit to call a hymn. Everyone should sing. This meeting is according to 1 Corinthians 14:26, which says, &ldquo;Whenever you come together, each one has a psalm, has a teaching, has a revelation, has a tongue, has an interpretation. Let all things be done for building up.&rdquo;</p>
<h2 class="head1">SINGING THE HYMNS<br />
ACCORDING TO THE LEADING OF THE SPIRIT</h2>
<p>The brother who is speaking may consider that calling a hymn during the message would be a distraction, and the saints may think that this would cause confusion. However, if everyone is exercising their spirit, we must believe that the leading of the Spirit will not be wrong.</p>
<p>The leading of the Spirit needs human cooperation. Suppose everything in a meeting is focused on life: the prayers are for life, and the burden of the message is also on life. When a saint feels led by the Spirit to call a hymn, which hymn should he select? If he does not know the hymns well, he will not be able to select a proper hymn. Hence, we need to know the hymns as well as the truth.</p>
<p>The hymns in the Chinese hymnal are classified into twenty-nine main categories and three hundred forty-five subcategories. If the saints want to study theology, they should spend four years to study the theology in our hymnal. This word is not an exaggeration. If someone really wants to study the hymns, he will need to spend much time and effort to learn the twenty-nine categories and the three hundred forty-five subcategories.</p>
<p>When we compiled the English hymnal in America from 1963 to 1964, our purpose was to show American Christianity that the truths in our hymns are high and comprehensive. We accomplished that purpose. There are one thousand eighty hymns in the English hymnal, but we regularly use less than three hundred hymns in the meetings. There are seven hundred eighty hymns in the Chinese hymnal and six hymns in the appendix, but less than three hundred hymns are regularly used in the meetings. The hymns that we do not sing serve as a contrast. It is difficult for new ones to select a hymn, because they do not know which hymn is appropriate. There should be only one line of hymns in our hymnal, and that is the line of life. All the hymns should be under the category of God&rsquo;s economy.</p>
<p>We will now learn how to use the hymns in the meetings with <em>Hymns,</em> #499. Stanza 1 says, &ldquo;Oh, what a life! Oh, what a peace! / The Christ who&rsquo;s all within me lives. / With Him I have been crucified; / This glorious fact to me He gives. / Now it&rsquo;s no longer I that live, / But Christ the Lord within me lives.&rdquo; According to our custom, when we call a hymn, we ask the sister at the piano to play the tune once before the saints sing the entire hymn. From now on, we should not remain in our old ways. If a brother senses that we should sing this hymn, he can call it. We do not have to sing all four stanzas. We may sing only stanza 1. The sister at the piano needs to be alert. If she waits for a brother to ask her to play the tune once and then plays the tune, the meeting will be deadened. Every saint needs to kindle the fire. If the sister serving at the piano is not quick enough to respond when a hymn is called, any saint in the meeting should begin to sing the hymn. Then everyone else will follow.</p>
<p>After we sing stanza 1, a brother might stand up and say, &ldquo;Brothers and sisters, I have a deep sense today concerning this stanza: &lsquo;Oh, what a life! Oh, what a peace! The Christ who&rsquo;s all within me lives.&rsquo; I never saw so clearly that Christ lives in me and that I am crucified with Christ. This is a glorious fact that He gives to me. Now it is no longer I that live, but Christ the Lord lives within me.&rdquo; These few sentences are sufficient; if he speaks too long, there will be less time for the message. After he sits down, we do not have to sing the next stanza. If we do sing stanza 2, the saint at the piano needs to play immediately. The entire process should be living, and everyone should follow the Spirit.</p>
<p>It is proper to abide by the law in society, but we should not abide by the law in the meetings. This does not mean that we want confusion. We need to follow the Spirit. Our standard and our law are the Spirit. Everyone needs to follow the Spirit.</p>
<p>The saints who play the piano need to play in a tempo that is suitable for the meeting. When a person learns to play the piano, he will play at a certain tempo. However, the saints who play the piano should not be mechanical when they play in the meeting. Some hymns should be played a little faster. Otherwise, it will seem as if &ldquo;an old ox is pulling a cart.&rdquo; The tempo used in singing a hymn does not need to be so consistent. For example, the first stanza of a hymn used to open the meeting can be a little faster and the rest of the stanzas slower to stabilize the meeting. Furthermore, all the hymns should not be played at the same tempo. Music is expressive; it should not be rigid like steel. Therefore, the saints who are experienced in playing the piano can play a hymn fast or slow; they can also play it in a higher key or in a lower key. We all need to learn the hymns so that we are not limited by the piano.</p>
<p>If we sing stanza 2, it will be more meaningful to us. Formerly, our singing was not that much in the spirit, because we sang in a habitual way. Now we can touch the reality because our singing is the result of the Spirit&rsquo;s leading. From now on, we should not sing in a routine way. I remind myself not to give messages or read the Scriptures in a routine way. This fellowship should help us to understand that the meetings in the churches should be living. They should not be routine and follow a set of rules or procedures.</p>
<p>In a big meeting it is appropriate to have a concluding prayer on certain occasions. However, it is not necessary to have a concluding prayer. Whether there should be a concluding prayer depends on the leading of the Spirit. If the meeting needs a concluding prayer, a leading brother does not have to be the one to give the prayer. Every brother and sister in the meeting should exercise their spirit and follow the leading of the Spirit. It would be wonderful for a young brother in junior high school to be led by the Spirit to release a concluding prayer after the message. His prayer will be refreshing and living.</p>
<p>Our meetings in the past were killed by procedures and routine. Christianity annuls the function of the believers. We should not repeat the mistakes of Christianity and become dead. Therefore, everyone needs to rise up and stand against our customs, but there should not be confusion. After hearing this word, some of the saints may think that they are now free to do what pleases them. This will not be permitted.</p><h2 class="head1">CHRISTIAN MEETINGS BEING TO EXHIBIT CHRIST</h2>
<p>Christian gatherings were formerly called &ldquo;worship&rdquo; in China. In the local churches, we did not follow this old custom of calling our gatherings &ldquo;worship&rdquo;; instead, we called our gatherings &ldquo;meetings.&rdquo; Most Christians said that it was worship time, and we said that it was meeting time. Now most Chinese Christians, whether in China or overseas, have dropped the term <em>worship</em> and instead use the term <em>meeting.</em> When I went to America, I wanted to change the concept of Christians in America concerning meetings. After much consideration, the Lord showed me that Christian meetings are for the exhibition of Christ. I believe that this was of the Lord. According to the type in the Old Testament and the revelation in the New Testament, whenever we meet, we should bring Christ. You bring your portion of Christ, and I bring my portion of Christ. We all bring our portion of Christ.</p>
<p>Concerning worship to God, John 4:24 says, &ldquo;God is Spirit, and those who worship Him must worship in spirit and truthfulness.&rdquo; When we expound this verse, we should not take it out of context. The Lord Jesus was conversing with a Samaritan woman whom He wanted to lead to salvation. The woman was sinful; she had had five husbands, and the one she had then was not her husband. When the Lord Jesus revealed her sinful condition, she changed the subject to the matter of worship. She said, &ldquo;Our fathers worshipped in this mountain, yet you say that in Jerusalem is the place where men must worship&rdquo; (v. 20). Instead of rebuking her, the Lord said, &ldquo;The true worshippers will worship the Father in spirit and truthfulness, for the Father also seeks such to worship Him&rdquo; (v. 23).</p>
<p>In the Old Testament God wanted His people to go up to Jerusalem three times a year to hold a feast unto Him. In order to attend a feast, the children of Israel could not be empty-handed; they had to bring offerings with them. Every offering is a type of Christ. Hence, we need to bring Christ with us to the meetings. In the Old Testament Jerusalem was God&rsquo;s dwelling place, but today God&rsquo;s dwelling place is in our spirit. The church is the dwelling place of God in spirit (Eph. 2:22). When we are gathered in spirit, our spirit is today&rsquo;s Jerusalem.</p>
<p>The Lord Jesus seemed to be saying to the Samaritan woman, &ldquo;The hour has come, and the age has changed, because I have come. We are not in the Old Testament age but in the New Testament age. This is not the age of types; it is the age of reality. In the Old Testament I had not yet become flesh, but in the New Testament I have become flesh. God desires that you worship in spirit and take Me as the reality of all the offerings. I have become flesh, full of grace and reality. I am the reality. Today God is not worshipped in this mountain or in Jerusalem; He is worshipped in your spirit. Moreover, you do not need the sacrifices. All the sacrifices have passed away. You need to take Me as the offerings. I am the reality.&rdquo;</p>
<p>According to John 4:24 our Christian meetings to worship God should not be religious worship. We worship God by contacting Him with our spirit. Therefore, in order to overturn the old impression of Christianity, when I compiled the English hymnal in the United States in 1963, I translated the Chinese hymn on exhibiting Christ, which says, &ldquo;Whene&rsquo;er we meet with Christ endued, / The surplus of His plenitude / We offer unto God as food, / And thus exhibit Christ. / Let us exhibit Christ, / Let us exhibit Christ; / We&rsquo;ll bring His surplus to the church / And thus exhibit Christ&rdquo; (<em>Hymns,</em> #864).</p>
<p>Our meetings are to exhibit Christ. When we come to a meeting, we need to bring Christ with us. We exhibit Christ by offering Christ to God. In the Old Testament the sacrifice that the people offered to God had more than one function. The sacrifice typifies Christ, whose blood washes away our sins. Then God and the offerer enjoyed the sacrifice together. This is to enjoy Christ together with God. Whenever we meet, we offer Christ to God. On the one hand, He is our sin offering through which we are forgiven of our sins. On the other hand, God is here and we, the offerers, are here to enjoy Christ together in one Spirit. This is a genuine Christian meeting.</p>
<p>However, the worship in Christianity has followed the custom of the nations and has become deformed. It is according to the custom of worshipping idols that cannot speak, cannot see, and cannot hear. In 1 Corinthians 12 where Paul writes concerning the exercise of gifts in the meetings, he says, &ldquo;You know that when you were Gentiles, you were always being led away to dumb idols, whenever and however you were led. Therefore I make known to you that...no one can say, Jesus is Lord! except in the Holy Spirit&rdquo; (vv. 2-3). In the past we served and worshipped dumb idols, but now we can say, &ldquo;Jesus is Lord!&rdquo; Paul says, &ldquo;No one can say, Jesus is Lord! except in the Holy Spirit.&rdquo; The meaning of this statement is twofold. On the one hand, we must be in the Spirit to say that Jesus is Lord, and on the other hand, when we say that Jesus is Lord, we are in the Spirit. Even though we may not be in the Spirit when we come to the meeting, as soon as we exercise to say, &ldquo;Jesus is Lord,&rdquo; we are in the Spirit. We exalt Jesus as Lord in our meetings by saying that Jesus is Lord. This causes us to exercise our spirit. This is the way to exhibit Christ and speak forth Christ. First Corinthians 12:3 is a basic verse concerning Christian meetings and the exercise of gifts. We are in the Spirit when we say that Jesus is Lord.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE TESTIMONY OF LIVING CHRIST AND<br />
LIVING A NORMAL CHURCH LIFE</h2>
<p>This is our testimony. We are not here to merely do a gospelizing and truthizing work without living Christ. Christ must become our living. He is not only the life within us; He is also the living expressed by us. Our preaching the gospel depends on this testimony, and our speaking the truth also depends on this testimony. The focus of our testimony is that we live Christ. We preach the gospel, speak the truth, and come together to live the normal church life as those who live Christ. This is the testimony of Christ.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER FOUR</h1>

	</ol></li>
</ol>
<p>In this chapter we will consider the matter of being fervent for the gospel by preaching in the homes and by spreading through migration. There are several hymns in our hymnal that stir up and encourage us to preach the gospel. For example, <em>Hymns,</em> #921 is a simple and effective hymn. Stanza 1 and the chorus say, &ldquo;Rescue the perishing, / Care for the dying, / Snatch them in pity from sin and the grave; / Weep o&rsquo;er the erring one, / Lift up the fallen, / Tell them of Jesus the mighty to save. / Rescue the perishing, / Care for the dying; / Jesus is merciful, / Jesus will save.&rdquo; This hymn was written by an American sister, Fanny J. Crosby.</p>
<h2 class="head1">PREREQUISITES FOR PREACHING THE GOSPEL</h2>
<p>There are two prerequisites for preaching the gospel. The first prerequisite is to be crazy for the gospel. Whoever preaches the gospel must be crazy. A person who is not crazy cannot preach the gospel. It is difficult for a person who is very rational to lead people to salvation. Preaching the gospel requires us to be crazy. The second prerequisite is to be thick-skinned. The countenance or expression of a person who preaches the gospel should not change; otherwise, he cannot preach the gospel. A gospel preacher must be crazy and not self-conscious; that is, he must be thick-skinned. These are requirements for preaching the gospel.</p>
<p>When I was young, I was embarrassed to meet people or converse with them. I avoided guests, and I did not visit people in their homes. After I was called by the Lord, I practiced contacting and speaking with people. Initially this was difficult for me, but after practicing for many years, there was some progress. If we want to preach the gospel, we need to be crazy, and we cannot be self-conscious. We should not become angry when we are rebuked, and we should not be elated when we are welcomed. We need to be thick-skinned so that our countenance remains unchanged regardless of the environment.</p>
<p>Furthermore, a crazy gospel preacher must learn to sing gospel songs. It is not easy for a calm and rational person to sing. The more we sing the gospel songs, the crazier we will be. Before I stand at the podium to preach the gospel, I have a time of thorough prayer. This is my secret. I also exercise to be crazy, but I am not irrational. The more rational a person is, the more he is self-conscious. It is difficult for a person who is too self-conscious to speak. When he sees a relative or a person who has a doctorate degree in the audience, he becomes timid and cannot speak to them. This is wrong. A crazy person can say even to the president, &ldquo;We all need salvation.&rdquo; Only a crazy person has the boldness to preach the gospel to the president.</p>
<p>Dear young brothers and sisters, you should not make plans to go to Africa or India for the gospel. Rather, you need to be crazy and preach the gospel in Taiwan first. This applies especially to those who have consecrated themselves to serve full time. The young people need to learn to contact people at school. There are about 120,000 college students, 50,000 high school students, and 50,000 junior high school students in Taipei. This is a total of 220,000 students. The young full-time serving ones need to go to the various campuses to contact the students. You should not be crazy the first time you contact a student. Rather, you need to be proper, but you should not feel ashamed. Gradually, after you have preached the gospel to a certain extent, you will need to be crazy.</p>
<p>We need to learn to be crazy and thick-skinned because we were not born this way. Before we go to a campus, we need to have an adequate time of prayer to pray ourselves into the spirit. After we pray thoroughly, we will be crazy. Our spirit will be burning, and our skin will be thickened. We also need to sing hymns in a released way. We can sing short gospel songs, such as &ldquo;Rescue the perishing&rdquo; (<em>Hymns,</em> #921) and then &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve fallen into sins&rdquo; (Chinese <em>Hymns,</em> #715). &ldquo;Rescue the perishing&rdquo; is concerning our need to preach the gospel, and &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve fallen into sins&rdquo; is about the sinner&rsquo;s need to be saved. Furthermore, we should be expressive when we sing the hymns, especially the gospel hymns. &ldquo;Rescue the perishing&rdquo; should be sung with a strong voice. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve fallen into sins&rdquo; should be sung softly, but the chorus&mdash;&ldquo;He longs to save you! / He&rsquo;s waiting for you! / Won&rsquo;t you let Him save you / While it&rsquo;s today?&rdquo;&mdash;should be sung with a strong voice.</p>
<p>Beginning from 1940 I led the brothers and sisters in northern China to preach the gospel. It was in Chefoo that we first used the term <em>the gospel preaching of the church.</em> At that time, every year we had a four-day gospel campaign of eight sessions. We used the first four days of the Chinese Lunar New Year and had one session in the morning and another session in the evening. During those four days I was crazy. I gave myself fully to preaching the gospel. The only other things that I did were to eat and to sleep. I was so exhausted after every meeting that I could only sleep until the next meeting. My whole being was spent on the gospel.</p>
<p>Formerly I did not know how to sing, neither could I speak well, but whenever I preached the gospel, I was crazy. There are several gospel hymns that we sang often in northern China, for example, <em>Hymns,</em> #1044, &ldquo;Are you ready God to meet?&rdquo; and #1080, &ldquo;What profit all the labor here?&rdquo; After singing these hymns, we felt that everything is vain, including our spouses and children. This was the result of our singing with expression. Another hymn we sang often is #309: &ldquo;What a wonderful change in my life has been wrought / Since Jesus came into my heart!&rdquo; The chorus of this hymn is very releasing; it says, &ldquo;Since Jesus came into my heart! / Since Jesus came into my heart! / Floods of joy o&rsquo;er my soul like the sea billows roll, / Since Jesus came into my heart!&rdquo; We sang the chorus until it seemed as if our entire being was &ldquo;rolling.&rdquo; Other hymns we often sang include #930, &ldquo;Must I go, and empty-handed&rdquo; and #918, &ldquo;Christians, make haste, your mission high fulfilling.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The brothers need to learn how to properly lead the singing during the gospel-preaching meetings. A meeting can be killed or enlivened by the way we lead the saints to sing the hymns.</p><h2 class="head1">THE COMMISSION OF THE GOSPEL</h2>
<p>We need to see the commission of the gospel. Preaching the gospel is the greatest commission in the Bible, and it is the Lord&rsquo;s greatest charge to us. This charge is found in three portions of the New Testament: the last chapter of Matthew, the last chapter of Mark, and the last chapter of Luke. According to these three portions, after the Lord Jesus resurrected, He left us with a commission. This commission was His final charge. Matthew 28:19 says, &ldquo;Go therefore and disciple all the nations, baptizing them into the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit.&rdquo; Mark 16:15 says, &ldquo;Go into all the world and proclaim the gospel to all the creation.&rdquo; We need to proclaim the gospel not only to all the nations but also to all the creation. Luke 24:47 says, &ldquo;That repentance for forgiveness of sins would be proclaimed in His name to all the nations, beginning from Jerusalem.&rdquo; These three verses show that preaching the gospel is the Lord&rsquo;s commission to us.</p>
<p>After a person is saved, he does not need to be encouraged to preach the gospel, because there is a spontaneous desire within him to preach the gospel to others. When he preaches the gospel, he is full of joy. Preaching the gospel revives us. We are burning within when we preach the gospel to people. The presence of opinions and disputes in the church is proof that the church has lost the burden of the gospel. The best way to eliminate opinions is to preach the gospel. When we preach the gospel, we are in one accord. Preaching the gospel is truly the Lord&rsquo;s commission. The Lord lives in us because He wants us to preach the gospel to others. Every believer has a desire to lead others to salvation and has the spirit of the gospel within him. Preaching the gospel is the Lord&rsquo;s commission to us.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE GOSPEL</h2>
<p>Paul said, &ldquo;I am debtor both to Greeks and to barbarians, both to wise and to foolish&rdquo; (Rom. 1:14). The debt that Paul owed was the debt of the gospel. In 1 Corinthians he said, &ldquo;If I preach the gospel, I have no boast, for necessity is laid upon me; for woe to me if I do not preach the gospel. If I do this of my own will, I have a reward; but if not of my own will, I am entrusted with a stewardship&rdquo; (9:16-17). This shows that we bear responsibility for the gospel.</p>
<p>This applied to Paul, and it also applies to every believer. Whenever a believer draws near to the Lord, he has the sense that he owes people the gospel, that he is a debtor of the gospel. Even though he is not hired, he bears responsibility and feels that he has the debt to preach the gospel. He also feels that it is an offense to the Lord if he does not preach the gospel and that the Lord will judge him for not preaching the gospel. If we have a heart for the Lord, we will sense the distress of not preaching the gospel. However, if we are willing to preach the gospel, we will receive a reward from the Lord. Therefore, we not only need to receive a commission from the Lord, but we also need to take care of the inner feeling of responsibility. Preaching the gospel is our responsibility.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE ENDEAVOR FOR THE GOSPEL</h2>
<p>We also need to endeavor in the gospel (1 Cor. 9:19-22; Rom. 1:15-16). Paul said to his younger co-worker Timothy, &ldquo;Proclaim the word; be ready in season and out of season; convict, rebuke, exhort with all long-suffering and teaching&rdquo; (2 Tim. 4:2). It is wrong for us to say that it is not convenient to preach the gospel or that it is not the right time. It is also wrong for us to excuse ourselves and say that we are too busy. Paul said that we need to preach the gospel in season and out of season.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE POWER OF THE GOSPEL</h2>
<h2 class="head2">Prayer</h2>
<p>In order to preach the gospel, we must have the power of the gospel, which comes through prayer (Acts 6:4). If we want to preach the gospel in a fresh, living, effectual, and powerful way, we must pray thoroughly. We need to pray until we are saved. Sometimes we are not saved when we go to preach the gospel. If we are thin-skinned, we need to pray in order to be saved from our shyness and bashfulness when we want to preach the gospel. When we preach the gospel in this way, we experience salvation. For example, we may want to preach the gospel, but we still love the world and are not completely separated from it. Unless we are delivered from the world, it will be difficult for us to preach the gospel with authority. Hence, we need to pray until we are saved from the world. Here is another example. Friction is unavoidable between family members. Sometimes there is friction with our parents or with our children or with our spouse. Such friction makes us unhappy and causes us to blame others. How can we preach the gospel in this condition? We need to pray until the Lord saves us from our anger and from blaming others.</p>
<p>Here is yet another example. Suppose a student, who has so much homework that he needs to study during the day and at night, receives a burden to preach the gospel. If he does not pray himself out of his studies, he will be powerless when he preaches the gospel. He will be like a deflated tire. This does not mean that the students who want to preach the gospel should neglect their studies. They need to study diligently, but when they go to preach the gospel, they need to pray and be saved from their studies. Only then can they preach the gospel with power.</p>
<p>Since we are very weak and fragile, even a piece of clothing can occupy us. A sister may feel that she needs to wear something presentable when she goes to preach the gospel. But the more she considers her clothing, the more her spirit sinks. It may be that her children are naughty and soil her dress. In this situation the sister needs to pray herself out of being occupied with her clothing. In order to preach the gospel, we need to be crazy and not care for or be concerned with anything else.</p>
<p>In conclusion, we must pray before we preach the gospel. We need to first pray for our deliverance, not for the salvation of others. We are able to save others when we pray until we are clear and transparent. If our condition is not that of a saved person, how can we save others? In order to preach the gospel, we must not be usurped by any person or thing. We can release others only when we are released. We must not be occupied by any person or thing. Therefore, we need to pray much so that we may be delivered from any form of pre-occupation. When we are released, we will be able to release others.</p>
<p>When we preach the gospel, we should also pray for people&rsquo;s salvation. However, we first need to pray until we are released. Then we need to pray to receive power. We need to pray for the economical Spirit to fill us and be with us. We should pray, &ldquo;Lord, today I apply the economical Spirit that You have poured out upon Your Body. Clothe me with Yourself as a mantle. I am going out to speak today. Open the heart of those whom I speak to, and demolish the stronghold of Satan within them while I am speaking.&rdquo; We need this kind of prayer. It is better to have thorough prayer before we preach the gospel.</p><h2 class="head2">The Word of God</h2>
<p>In order to preach the gospel, we also need to be soaked with the Word of God through prayer and fellowship with the Lord (4:31). If we have the burden to preach John 3:16, we should spend at least half an hour to absorb this verse. This verse says, &ldquo;God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son, that everyone who believes into Him would not perish, but would have eternal life.&rdquo; We need to be soaked with every word. First, <em>God,</em> then <em>so,</em> then <em>loved,</em> and then <em>the world;</em> that is, <em>God so loved the world.</em> Then we should continue with <em>that He gave,</em> and then <em>His only begotten Son,</em> and so forth. We need to be soaked with this verse until it becomes our feeling, and we can express it from within. Then when we use this verse to preach, we will not speak empty doctrine or dead letter; rather, we will utter the words with which we have been saturated. This kind of speaking will be full of power and will touch people.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Holy Spirit</h2>
<p>Christians say that we need the power of God in order to preach the gospel (Acts 4:8). But where is the power of God? The power of the gospel depends on our being released. If we are not released, we will not have power. The power of God is already upon us. Hence, unless we are released, the power of God will not be manifested. This applies to preaching the gospel and to ministering the word.</p>
<p>Here is a negative example of what it means to be released. When we are not angry, it is likely that we are not released when we speak with others. Even though we utter words that are audible, we are not released. When we are angry, however, it is easy for us to be released when we speak. Anger requires energy. The angrier we are, the more energy we use, and our entire being is released. However, the Spirit does not come out when we are angry, even though we are released. Hence, when we speak for the Lord, we need to use our whole being to speak His word. Then the Spirit will be released. This is the secret.</p>
<p>When believers in Christian seminaries learn to preach the gospel, they are instructed how to maintain a proper demeanor, to look directly at the audience, and when to raise or lower their voice. Seminaries do not teach people the secret of being released. It is insufficient to merely utter words. We also need to push out our person.</p>
<p>The Lord raised up Brother John Sung as an evangelist in China. He preached the gospel in a powerful way. When he preached the gospel, he did not care about proper demeanor or grammar. He jumped about on the platform as if he was crazy. He only cared to release his burden; he did not care about anything else. Once as he was preaching in a Lutheran Church near Hankow, he suddenly picked up the song-leader&rsquo;s baton, pointed at a woman in the audience, and said, &ldquo;You, a concubine.&rdquo; It turned out that the woman was actually a concubine. That night she was unable to sleep but was enlightened and repented, because the Spirit convicted her. The following day she gave her testimony in the meeting.</p>
<p>Sometimes we cannot be too mild or proper when we preach the gospel. Some believers with a theological training are able to preach in a systematic and logical way. They have the right tone and attitude and do everything in a proper way, but no one is saved. In 1933 I heard Brother John Sung preach in Chefoo. The topic was the woman in Mark 5 who suffered from a flow of blood. He drew a big heart on the blackboard and then said, &ldquo;Brother John Sung comes to preach, and everyone repents. As soon as you repent, the precious blood of Jesus washes your heart and cleanses it thoroughly...Then Brother John Sung goes away, and two weeks later the precious blood begins to leak out, leak out...&rdquo; He did not say anything else. He merely used the drawing on the blackboard to illustrate his words a few times. Incredibly, the audience was moved, and many wept bitterly and repented. As far as the truth is concerned, I could not accept his message, but because I saw the result of the meeting, I respected him.</p>
<p>We need to be crazy when we preach the gospel. If we are too proper in our demeanor, we will be dead. Before John Sung preached the gospel, he spent half a day to pray on his knees and immerse himself in the message. This was his secret. Then when he spoke from the platform, his whole being came out with his words. We should not merely speak without being released. After listening to John Sung preach the gospel, I came to the conclusion that his preaching was questionable in relation to the truth, but his way of gospel preaching was right. When he preached the gospel, his spirit came forth. There is life in our spirit; hence, when our spirit comes out, life comes out. When life comes out, people will touch the Lord, repent, and believe in the Lord.</p>
<p>One year as I was preaching the gospel in Chefoo during the Chinese New Year holidays, I pointed at a lady in the audience and said, &ldquo;You are a wicked woman.&rdquo; I had no reason to say this. Then I said that her husband worked hard to support her, but she still insisted on wasting money. I thought that I was just giving an example; I did not know that that was her situation. The lady, who was a gospel friend of one of the sisters, was very angry and asked the sister how I knew her personal affairs. However, I did not know anything about her. That night the Holy Spirit worked in her, and she repented and was saved. When she came to be baptized, she gave her testimony.</p>
<p>On another occasion when I was preaching the gospel, I took a stick, pointed at a student in junior high school, and said, &ldquo;You stole a few pieces of chalk from school and drew circles with them on the ground at home.&rdquo; The student was the son of a sister in the church, and he was not yet saved. After the meeting he said, &ldquo;I must believe in the Lord; Jesus is real. My mother did not tell Brother Lee about this matter, but I did exactly what he said.&rdquo; Before this, his mother had preached the gospel to him, but he would not believe. This time, however, he believed in the Lord.</p>
<p>When we are released, the Holy Spirit is present. Hence, we cannot be a gentleman when we preach the gospel. This is the reason that the gospel is preached in a dead way in Christianity, not in a living way. We need to be released so that the gospel can come out. Today the Spirit is in and upon the believers. The essential Spirit is within us, and the economical Spirit is upon us. The question is whether we will be released. When we are released, the essential Spirit within and the economical Spirit without come forth. This is the power of the gospel.</p>
<p>On the day of Pentecost Peter, who was a fisherman from Galilee, stood up and spoke in Jerusalem, the capital of the Jewish nation. He forgot that he was merely an uneducated fisherman. He became crazy. He did not become crazy intentionally; the Spirit was upon him. He was released, and the Spirit came out.</p><h2 class="head2">The Lord&rsquo;s Name</h2>
<p>When we preach the gospel, we must proclaim the Lord&rsquo;s name and lead people to call on the Lord&rsquo;s name. The opposers say that calling on the name of the Lord is an erroneous doctrine. However, in Acts 3 Peter spoke to the lame man who asked for alms at the door of the temple which was called Beautiful, and said, &ldquo;Silver and gold I do not possess, but what I have, this I give to you: In the name of Jesus Christ the Nazarene rise up and walk&rdquo; (v. 6). That man stood up and began to walk. He entered with the apostles into the temple, and was walking, leaping, and praising God (v. 8). After this incident the Jewish rulers, elders, and scribes threatened the apostles and &ldquo;charged them not to utter anything at all nor teach based upon the name of Jesus&rdquo; (4:17-18). We need to teach people to call on the name of the Lord, because the Lord&rsquo;s name is all-powerful, and it is in this name that we are saved (vv. 10, 12).</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Lord&rsquo;s Authority</h2>
<p>When we go out to preach the gospel, we should not think that we are small and insignificant. We are not insignificant. In Matthew 28 the Lord Jesus said, &ldquo;All authority has been given to Me in heaven and on earth. Go therefore and disciple all the nations&rdquo; (vv. 18-19). When we preach the gospel, we represent the authority in heaven and on earth. Our believing this depends on our exercise. We do not need to shout and yell and say to people that we represent an authority. Our faith should confirm this. We do not need to say this to people, but we need to say to the devil, &ldquo;Satan, you need to know that Jesus Christ has obtained all authority in heaven and on earth; He is the Lord of heaven and earth, and I am His representative.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In conclusion, in order to have the power to preach the gospel, we need to pray, enter into the Lord&rsquo;s word, and be released. In addition, we need to be in the Lord&rsquo;s name and apply the Lord&rsquo;s authority.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE CHANNEL OF THE GOSPEL</h2>
<h2 class="head2">Preaching from House to House</h2>
<p>What is the channel of the gospel? Human beings are the mouthpiece of the gospel, and the homes are the channel of the gospel. Every saint should open his home to preach the gospel. Acts 2 and 5 show clearly that the early believers first opened their homes for meetings (2:46), and then preached the gospel from house to house (5:42). After Cornelius was instructed by an angel to send for Peter, he invited his relatives and intimate friends to his home (10:22-24). Then Peter spoke to the household of Cornelius and also to his relatives and intimate friends (11:12-14).</p>
<p>In order to preach the gospel and gain people, we must open our homes. Every family has relatives, neighbors, friends, classmates, and colleagues. We need to invite them to our homes. We do not need to invite them all at one time, but we can invite three to five people at a time in a consistent way. The saints, who have a burden, should invite their relatives and friends for a &ldquo;gospel dinner&rdquo; at least once a week. The mealtime can be used to share the gospel. Just as people in the world have social engagements to do business and solicit clients, we should invite people for meals in order to preach the gospel. Every saint should invite people to his home for the purpose of preaching the gospel. Human beings do not have a heart of iron; they have emotions. When we invite someone to our home for a meal, his heart will open, and the Lord Jesus can enter into him. We can be assured that if we invite two people for a meal, we will gain at least one.</p>
<p>There are five thousand saints in the church in Taipei. If we are all willing to endeavor to lead one person to salvation every year, there will be ten thousand saints by next year. If we continue to increase in this way every year, there will be five million people in ten years. The Lord is leading us to attain our goal in many areas. Some saints are involved in the campus work, others are involved in the children&rsquo;s work, and still others are preaching the gospel in the communities. By laboring in these areas and opening our homes, it will be easy for us to double our number every year.</p>
<p>When we lead a person to salvation, we do not gain only one person. Every person is a new branch that can bear fruit; he can lead his relatives and friends to salvation. In the past we only had old branches; we did not use this capital. Hence, year after year there has not been much increase. We need to seriously consider these words. We should immerse ourselves in the Lord&rsquo;s word through prayer, push out the Spirit by being released when we speak, receive the Lord&rsquo;s name, and exercise His authority. Then we will have the power to preach the gospel. Finally, we should open our homes as an outlet for the gospel.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Spreading through Migration</h2>
<p>Another channel of the gospel is to spread through migration. Initially the church in Jerusalem had at least ten thousand believers, but they were all concentrated in Jerusalem. Therefore, God allowed persecution to scatter them. When they left Jerusalem, they went to various places as immigrants and spread the gospel (8:4-5; 11:19-21). It is good that some of the saints have the burden and are prepared to migrate. However, we need to take care of the testimony in &ldquo;Jerusalem,&rdquo; and then we can spread to other places&mdash;to other cities and to other countries&mdash;and deliver the gospel to them. This is the way we should take today. We must receive this burden to rise up and preach the gospel and save souls.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER FIVE</h1>

</ol>
<h2 class="head1">RISING UP QUICKLY TO PREACH THE GOSPEL</h2>
<p>We hope that by giving these messages the churches in Taiwan, especially the saints in the church in Taipei, will rise up quickly to preach the gospel. Today every aspect of society in Taiwan is advancing; the government is stable, and the economy is strong. This is an excellent opportunity for the church to preach the gospel. We are not being faithful to the Lord or to our fellow countrymen if we do not grasp this opportunity. Taipei is like a big fishpond; there are millions of fish all around us. We must preach the gospel and deliver salvation to them, or we will be indebted to them.</p>
<p>Paul said, &ldquo;Woe to me if I do not preach the gospel. If I do this of my own will, I have a reward&rdquo; (1 Cor. 9:16-17). He also said, &ldquo;I am debtor both to Greeks and to barbarians, both to wise and to foolish&rdquo; (Rom. 1:14). Paul was not cursing himself when he said, &ldquo;Woe to me.&rdquo; Rather, he was saying that if we lose the race of our Christian life, we will not receive a reward. The condition of woe does not refer to being cursed; it refers to not receiving a reward. If we preach the gospel, we will receive a reward; if we do not preach the gospel, we will not receive a reward. The Lord knows whenever a sinner repents, because the Bible says that there is &ldquo;joy in heaven over one sinner repenting&rdquo; (Luke 15:7). Whenever a sinner repents, the angels in heaven rejoice.</p>
<p>A sinner&rsquo;s repentance is significant to God. We should not think that it does not matter whether or not we lead a person to salvation. Whenever a person is saved, there is a record before God. If we do not lead anyone to salvation, we will suffer loss instead of receiving a reward. Therefore, we need to rise up and preach the gospel to save people. <em>Hymns,</em> #921 says, &ldquo;Rescue the perishing, / Care for the dying, / Snatch them in pity from sin and the grave; / Weep o&rsquo;er the erring one, / Lift up the fallen, / Tell them of Jesus the mighty to save. / Rescue the perishing, / Care for the dying; / Jesus is merciful, / Jesus will save.&rdquo; After singing the hymns in a thorough way, we need to begin to take action and go forth to preach the gospel. The fire of the gospel needs to be kindled, and everyone needs to pick up this burden.</p>
<p>Preaching the gospel is the primary obligation of Christians to society. This is the reason that some Christians refer to preaching the gospel as &ldquo;the great commission.&rdquo; In Mark 16:15 the Lord charged us to &ldquo;go into all the world and proclaim the gospel to all the creation.&rdquo; In the Chinese Union Version <em>to all the creation</em> is rendered as <em>to all the nations.</em> There is also a note which says, &ldquo;<em>Nations,</em> lit., <em>creation</em>.&rdquo; In this verse the Greek word means &ldquo;creation.&rdquo; We need to preach the gospel until every person on earth has heard the gospel. Then we can continue to preach the gospel to the rest of creation. The Lord Jesus said, &ldquo;Go therefore and disciple all the nations&rdquo; (Matt. 28:19). <em>All the nations</em> refers to every tribe, tongue, people, and nation. The first commission we bear before God is to preach the gospel. If we do not preach the gospel, we are not fulfilling our obligation. Paul said that he was a debtor (Rom. 1:14). As long as our obligation is not fulfilled, we are debtors.</p>
<h2 class="head1">GOSPELIZING TAIWAN</h2>
<p>Every saint needs to resolve to save one person every year. This is not difficult. We should not think that we are unable to catch one fish in a year even though we live in a &ldquo;fishpond.&rdquo; We have no excuse. God in His sovereignty has arranged for many people to be around us. Some of the streets in Taipei seem to be filled with people. Moreover, we all have relatives, friends, classmates, and colleagues. If we contact them every day, we will be able to lead at least one person to salvation in a year. If every one of the seven thousand saints in this meeting leads one person to salvation, by next year there will be fourteen thousand saints. Some saints may have a stronger desire and lead two or more people to salvation. This is also good. Then we will not have an increase of merely seven thousand. We all need to make such a vow.</p>
<p>In the past we neglected the matter of gaining people. Now we need to forget the past and press on by opening to the Lord and receiving His forgiveness. We need to begin a new page in the history of the churches in Taiwan by gaining a twofold increase every year.</p>
<p>According to statistics, the population of Taipei and its suburbs is 3,000,000, and there is a floating population of around 800,000. Therefore, the total population is about 4,000,000. There are around 50,000 saints on the name list of the church in Taipei, and about 5,000 saints meet regularly. If the 5,000 saints gain one person every year, after one year there will be 10,000 saints; after two years, 20,000; after three years, 40,000; after four years, 80,000; after five years, 160,000; after six years, 320,000; after seven years, 640,000; after eight years, 1,280,000; and after nine years, 2,560,000. After ten years our number will reach 5,120,000.</p>
<p>If we are faithful to practice diligently, lay a foundation, and build up the habit of leading one person to salvation in a year, we will have a twofold increase every year, and in ten years our increase will be a thousandfold. For us to succeed, every saint will need to lead one person to salvation every year. The older saints, the middle-aged saints, and even the younger saints need to consider how they can lead one person to salvation in a year. If we are able to do this, we will have a twofold increase in one year and a thousandfold increase in ten years. We will be able to gospelize Taiwan in ten years, and Taiwan will be a gospel nation that is filled with the gospel.</p>
<p>In order to gospelize Taiwan we must pray. We need to rise up corporately to pray for the gospelization of Taiwan in ten years. Then we need to endeavor to preach the gospel in every place. Whether we are at school, at work, or in the market, we must preach the gospel. The churches should cooperate and print gospel tracts for the saints to distribute in large quantities. When the sisters buy groceries, they can give gospel tracts to the cashier and to other women who are buying groceries. There is no need for us to be timid. They should distribute gospel tracts day after day. Distributing gospel tracts can be compared to digging a well. Water does not come forth as soon as we begin to dig. Rather, we need to dig persistently until we reach water.</p>
<p>In 1939 in Tsinan, Shantung Province, there was an official who held a prominent position at the Provincial Bureau of Construction. A brother, who held a low position, also worked at the bureau. Because the brother was very burdened to preach the gospel to this official, he and his wife prayed for the official. Every morning the brother put a gospel tract on the official&rsquo;s desk. When the official saw the gospel tract, he threw it into the trash can. This went on for almost half a year. Then one day the official picked up the gospel tract and read it. Eventually, he believed in the Lord and attended the meetings in the church in Tsinan and was greatly blessed.</p>
<p>The official threw away the gospel tracts he received, but he could not do this for three hundred and sixty-five days. He was eventually gained by our brother&rsquo;s perseverance. We should not worry if people dislike the fact that we distribute gospel tracts. People will know that we are &ldquo;crazy.&rdquo; However, there will also be a continual result. We must build up such a gospel atmosphere.</p>
<p>In 1949, when we arrived in Taiwan, we preached the gospel. We posted gospel banners of different colors in the streets and alleys and in train and bus stations. This created a good atmosphere for the gospel. When we saw a house with a banner on the door, we knew that a brother or sister lived there. If the environment permits, the church should print some banners and post them in different places in order to create an atmosphere for the gospel. The banners can read, &ldquo;God so loved the world,&rdquo; or &ldquo;Christ came to the world to save sinners.&rdquo; In 1949 we also had gospel marches in which we all wore gospel robes. Some saints beat large drums and everyone else sang, &ldquo;You need Jesus.&rdquo; These marches enhanced the gospel atmosphere. Praying, speaking, and preaching are our weapons for preaching the gospel. Christians need to pray, speak, and preach. Prayer is the greatest weapon, because it can shake the authority of Hades.</p>
<p>In order to preach the gospel, we can have gospel marches, post gospel banners, distribute gospel tracts, and speak in every place. We can distribute gospel tracts at work, at school, and even when we are in a store. We should also distribute tracts when we are on a train or a bus. Wherever we are, we should distribute gospel tracts. Some people need to receive more than ten gospel tracts before they decide to read one. They will eventually believe in the Lord after being &ldquo;besieged&rdquo; with gospel tracts.</p>
<p>If we distribute only one or two gospel tracts, we will not create an atmosphere of the gospel. Suppose five thousand brothers and sisters in Taipei distributed gospel tracts every day. A person may receive your tract today, my tract tomorrow, and another person&rsquo;s tract the day after. This would be very effective. In order for the gospel to spread, we should not be silent or quiet. We should go out to speak to people and to distribute gospel tracts.</p><h2 class="head1">OPENING OUR HOMES<br />
FOR THE PREACHING OF THE GOSPEL</h2>
<p>The most effective way to preach the gospel is to open our homes for the gospel. Therefore, I am burdened to &ldquo;push&rdquo; the elders and co-workers to urge the saints to open their homes. Many saints have not yet opened their homes. We need to speak until everyone is restless and rises up to preach the gospel. In the past I was not willing to push people, but my concept has changed. I will push the elders and co-workers to ask all the saints to open their homes. Because we were too &ldquo;spiritual,&rdquo; the elders and co-workers merely asked the saints to pray and seek the Lord&rsquo;s leading concerning opening their homes. As a result very few homes are open. Therefore, we must help the saints to open their homes.</p>
<p>After the saints open their homes, they do not need to hold a big gospel meeting or to invite many people to hear the gospel. The saints can invite eight to ten relatives, neighbors, and friends to hear the gospel. Every night there should be eighty to a hundred homes that are preaching the gospel in the church in Taipei. There can be eight to ten people in every home. It should not be a religious worship service. Our relatives and friends who come should feel comfortable to speak with one another. In such a warm atmosphere it is easy to preach the gospel. All the saints in the church in Taipei and in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery need to open their homes for the preaching of the gospel.</p>
<p>We should even be willing to miss the regular church meetings in order to preach the gospel in our homes. Suppose we may have a relative who is free only on Thursday. We should be willing to invite them to our home on Thursday, even if we need to miss a meeting of the church. The elders should not expect the saints to be in every meeting. However, when the saints are not preaching the gospel in their home, they should be in the meetings.</p>
<p>In addition to the regular church meetings, we should open our homes to preach the gospel at least one evening a week. There are advantages to opening our homes. On the one hand, our cold hearts will be burning. On the other hand, we can lead our friends or relatives who are not saved to receive the gospel. Moreover, it will benefit our neighbors.</p>
<p>Suppose we open our homes to preach the gospel every week of every month of every year. Every home will be able to lead at least three people to salvation a year. If there are 1,200 to 1,500 homes in Taipei, there will be an increase of 4,000 people in a year. This is a solid and effective way to gain people, because people will be gained gradually. It is not too much for an open home to lead one person to salvation every four months. Every person we gain is a new branch that can easily bear fruit. He can lead people to salvation. Hence, it is easy for us to have a twofold increase in a year. After listening to this word, we should all rise up and take action before God by opening our homes for the gospel. The saints who receive this word and are willing to open their homes can invite people over at least once every three weeks. Every opened home is a gospel station. If every gospel station gains three people yearly, we will have a considerable increase.</p>
<p>The sisters are key in opening the homes. The responsible brothers who want to promote opening the homes need to fellowship with the sisters. The husbands usually work. Many sisters, however, stay at home and are not occupied by so many other things. Therefore, the responsible brothers should encourage the sisters to open their homes. According to the New Testament, sisters tend to love the Lord more than brothers do. The Lord Jesus was anointed twice by sisters (Matt. 26:6-13; Luke 7:36-39). The brothers were in their mind, and asked, &ldquo;Why this waste?&rdquo; (Matt. 26:8). They also calculated that the ointment &ldquo;could have been sold for much and given to the poor&rdquo; (v. 9). Brothers tend to be in their mind whenever they speak about the Lord. Sisters are not so much in their mind; they are more emotional. When they love the Lord, they are willing to spend for the Lord.</p>
<p>Therefore, to promote preaching the gospel in the homes, we must begin with the sisters. If the sisters do not respond, we will not succeed. The sisters must rise up and respond to this move. The refreshments we prepare make it easy for people to open their hearts so that the gospel can enter into them. The refreshments are prepared by the sisters. Hence, we must rely on the sisters if we want to preach the gospel in the homes. The sisters should not be frugal when they serve those who come to hear the gospel. When we serve those who come to listen to the gospel, we are serving the Lord Jesus. It is good to spend our money for people to be gained.</p>
<p>We need to take this way to open our homes willingly. We do not need to rely on the help of certain brothers when we invite gospel friends to our homes. We must preach the gospel ourselves. We may not know how to preach the first time, and we may still lack experience the second time, but as we continue to practice, we will learn. I did not know how to ride a bicycle when I was young. It was not until I was in my thirties that I learned to ride a bicycle, because I was assigned to work for the Lord in Tientsin. When I first got on the bicycle, I fell, but after falling, I got back on the bicycle. Eventually I learned how to ride a bicycle by trying. As long as we fail but continue to practice, we will learn. The leading brothers need to let the saints preach the gospel, especially the saints who do not know how to preach the gospel. Otherwise, only a few saints will be able to bear responsibility in spiritual matters. We need to let everyone preach the gospel. When someone opens his home, he should preach the gospel and nourish the ones who are saved. Then the Lord will have a way to spread.</p><h2 class="head1">STRESSING THE CHILDREN&rsquo;S WORK</h2>
<p>When we open our homes, we should also preach the gospel to the children, because almost every household has children. There are not enough children in the children&rsquo;s meeting in Taipei. There are only four to five hundred. The elders said that the children have either grown up, or they are still too young. However, this is not a good reason. We should not neglect the children&rsquo;s work. We fellowshipped about the children&rsquo;s work eighteen years ago in 1966. If there were ten thousand children between the ages of six and twelve at that time, today there should be ten thousand young adults between the ages of twenty-four and thirty. If they are not all saved, at least six thousand of them should be saved.</p>
<p>Our labor in the church life is a long-term endeavor. We need to lead our children to salvation, and we also need to gain the children of our relatives and neighbors. This requires the coordination and participation of many saints. We cannot rely on the meeting halls; rather, we must labor in the homes. The saints with large homes can have a meeting with twenty children. The saints with smaller homes should have fewer children. If there are not enough adults to teach the children, the saints who are in high school and college can help. We may need fifty homes in order to gain one thousand children. When the number of children increases to four thousand, we will need two hundred classes. Even though the parents of some of the children may not be in our meetings, they may like to have their children join the children&rsquo;s meeting. This will give us the opportunity to gain the parents through their children. If we practice this, after a few years we may have ten thousand children in the church in Taipei.</p>
<p>After eight to ten years these children will be seeds for the spread of the gospel in junior high and high school and even in college. This is the way for us to multiply and gain thousands of new ones every year. The gospel work among the children needs the cooperation of the families and the young saints. We also need some co-workers to coordinate the children&rsquo;s work.</p>
<h2 class="head1">EXPANDING THE GOSPEL TO THE YOUNG PEOPLE</h2>
<p>Another way to gain people is through the gospel work on the campuses. This depends on the participation of the full-timers. It would be good to have three hundred full-timers, who are between the ages of twenty-five and forty, to preach the gospel on various campuses. In Taipei there are around 120,000 university students, 80,000 technical college students, 60,000 high school students, and over 100,000 junior high students. This is a total of over 400,000 students. We need many full-time servings ones to labor on the students. This is a good source to gain new believers.</p>
<h2 class="head1">SPREADING THE GOSPEL TO ALL PEOPLE IN SOCIETY</h2>
<p>The recovery has been in Taiwan for almost thirty years. We now have brothers and sisters who work in every aspect of society. They work in factories, businesses, hospitals, and even government institutions. Therefore, we should encourage all the saints to preach the gospel. This is another way to gain new believers.</p>
<h2 class="head1">RECOVERING THE DORMANT SAINTS</h2>
<p>In addition, the church in Taipei has information cards for thirteen to fifteen thousand saints, but only five thousand come to the meetings. This means that at least eight thousand are not in the meetings. It is worthwhile for us to labor on these eight thousand saints. We can restore them to the church life by fellowshipping with them, visiting them, and inviting them to our homes for meals.</p>
<h2 class="head1">PROMOTING THE GROUP MEETINGS</h2>
<p>Even though five thousand saints attend the meetings in Taipei, there are only three to four thousand saints in any given meeting. The brothers and sisters have a heart for the Lord, but they have not been helped to function. Hence, we must arrange them into groups, with twelve saints in a group. The five thousand saints in the church life will form four hundred groups. We should group the saints according to their geographic location, not according to their spiritual growth.</p>
<p>It may be that fifty to sixty groups will then form a district. There may be seven or eight districts in the church in Taipei. Some co-workers, who can care for and lead the groups, should be assigned to every district. The saints in a group should decide whether to meet once a week or once every two weeks for mutual fellowship and mutual visitation. The people they lead to salvation can later be added to a small group that is located near them.</p>
<p>When the number of saints in a group increases to twelve or sixteen, that group should split. There will then be eight or nine saints in both groups. When the groups increase further, they can split again. The brothers and sisters will not lose contact with one another.</p>
<p>In the past many people were baptized but not many remained. The groups will function to maintain the fellowship among the saints and to care for the new believers. Therefore, we need to organize the information cards so that we will know who is in the church life and who is not attending the meetings. The saints who are not in the meetings can be assigned to groups in their districts. The saints in a group meeting should pray for the dormant ones who are assigned to them and consider how to fellowship with them. It is easy to visit the dormant saints who are in our neighborhood or to invite them to our home. Even though we may not be able to recover every saint initially, we can gradually recover at least one or two thousand saints.</p><h2 class="head1">SUPPORTING THE FULL-TIME SERVING ONES</h2>
<p>There are many saints who want to serve full time. After we sounded the call, over one thousand two hundred saints signed up. Six hundred of these will serve full time, and the rest will serve part time. Half of the saints who signed up to serve full time are from Taipei. This may be the first time in church history that over six hundred full-timers and over six hundred part-timers came forward at one time to serve the Lord. The long-term living expenses of the six hundred full-timers will not be small. We need to pray concerning this.</p>
<p>Ten saints should be able to support one full-timer. In other words, one out of every ten saints should be a full-time serving one. Everyone in the church should participate in preaching the gospel, and we should also be able to match the gospel move with our material offering. We thank the Lord that the economy of Taiwan is strong and that the standard of living is high. There is no problem related to finances. However, the saints need to be faithful in material offering to match the Lord&rsquo;s move. In particular, the working saints need to endeavor to support the full-time serving ones. In this way we will all move on together.</p>
<h2 class="head1">MOBILIZING THE WHOLE CHURCH<br />
TO BUILD UP A MODEL</h2>
<p>You should not rely too much on my leading. If the Lord allows, I will visit twice a year and stay for at least one month when I visit. When I am here, you will not be able to sleep peacefully, because I will create a lot of work for you. Our goal is to mobilize the whole church. The full-timers are not the only ones who can have a part in the gospel activities and church services. Every one of us must have a part.</p>
<p>If everyone functions in the ways that we have fellowshipped, the whole church will be mobilized to gain people. In conclusion, we need to be aggressive to preach the gospel in our homes, to children, to students, and to those with whom we work. We also need to recover the dormant saints. In this way the church will increase. We also need to lead the brothers and sisters to focus on knowing the truth, growing in life, and living Christ. Moreover, the saints should also take part in the church life so that there will be a testimony of a golden lampstand in every locality. We will first spread the gospel where we live, and lead many people to salvation. Then the Lord may lead us to go to other countries.</p>
<p>This should be our common burden. From now on the churches in Taiwan need to rise up and take action. This will produce a model. Then all the churches in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery will see this model and know how to spread and propagate in order to gain people. There are over five hundred churches in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery on five continents. Apart from the Far East, there are over three hundred churches on the other four continents. There are over two hundred churches in Asia. Most of the churches outside of the Far East are not large. They may have an average of a hundred people. A model for propagation should be established in Taipei so that the whole earth can see how the churches in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery increase in number.</p>
<p>How we promote this matter is important. It seems as if the world has become smaller, because what happens in one place can quickly spread to other places. Once the church in Taipei begins to practice, the five hundred churches will know. We must build up a model in Taiwan, because the condition in other places is not as favorable as the condition here. We need to pray for the spread of the gospel. We need to grasp this golden opportunity to participate in the move for the spread of the gospel through the propagation and increase. We also need to build up a model.</p></body></html>
