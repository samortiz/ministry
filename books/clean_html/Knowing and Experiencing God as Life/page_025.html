<h1 class="title">BEING CONFORMED<br />
TO THE LORD&rsquo;S DEATH</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Phil. 3:10; 2 Cor. 4:7-12, 16-17</h1>
<p>As a result of regeneration, every believer has two lives: the human life and God&rsquo;s divine life. Although we have two lives, God wants us to live only by His life. If God had not revealed this wonderful matter to us, we could not imagine that the God of the universe desires to be lived out of man. He intends to have a group of people who have the human life but live by His life. He earnestly desires that these people would allow Him to live out of them. This thought is mysterious and wonderful. God wants to be expressed, but He does not want to be expressed in Himself. He wants to enter into man and be expressed in man.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE GREATEST PROBLEM TO TAKING GOD AS LIFE</h2>
<p>God desires His divinity to be expressed in humanity. Such a thought does not exist in man. Man has the concept of morality, the concept of good and evil. People think that as long as they depart from evil and have a good, ethical living, they are noble persons. According to this view, human beings should be vessels of morality, expressing morality. However, this is not God&rsquo;s thought. He has no intention for man to be a vessel of morality, expressing merely morality and goodness. God desires man to be His vessel so that He can be contained in this vessel and expressed from this vessel.</p>
<p>Man is a living vessel; hence, it is rather difficult for God to enter into man to be man&rsquo;s life. This desire is not a simple matter. Here is a simple illustration, even though it is not adequate. It is easier to ask a simple person to accept the thoughts of a wise person than it is to ask a wise person to accept the thoughts of a foolish person. Nor is it easy to ask a smart person to accept the decisions of another smart person.</p>
<p>It is not so easy to put two lives together. If we did not have the human life, God would be free to put His life into us as He wishes, but He did not take this way. It pleases God to put Himself in the living creature that He created. Although our human life is weak, it is also obstinate, stubborn, opinionated, and self-willed. If we use human relationships as an example, it is hard to find a couple who have been together for ten years but have never argued. Some people may not fight with their fists, but they use their tongues to fight. It is hard to find a couple who get along all the time. Every person has a strong life. The wife does not submit to her husband, nor does the husband respect his wife. Two brothers may be able to live together, but this does not mean that they do not have issues. Some people might say that this is a matter of different opinions, but it is really a matter of different lives. When people have different lives, it is not so easy for them to get along.</p>
<p>Now let us consider this: God dwells in us as our life. Although our life is weak, we are rather strong. Hence, He encounters difficulties when He wants us to take Him as our life.</p>
<h2 class="head1">GENUINE LOVE AND SUBMISSION TO THE LORD<br />
DEPENDING ON TAKING HIM AS LIFE</h2>
<p>A person who loves the Lord puts aside his soul-life and takes the Lord as his life. For example, a wife who loves her husband should take her husband&rsquo;s life as her life. If a husband loves his wife, he will take his wife&rsquo;s life as his life. However, we should not understand this word in a natural way; it is not that a husband should give up his life for his wife&rsquo;s sake. Rather, a husband who loves his wife will consider her when he speaks, acts, and makes decisions. A couple who have been together for forty or fifty years often look alike, because they are alike in their speaking, attitude, and taste. The wife resembles the husband, and the husband resembles the wife. The more they love each other, the more they will resemble each other. Similarly, if we love the Lord, we will put ourselves aside and take Him as our life, and as a result, we will become like Him.</p>
<p>Taking the Lord as our life touches God&rsquo;s heart more than doing many things for Him or accomplishing many works. We touch His heart when we put aside our life to take Him as life and to let Him be our life because we love Him. It is not that we do not have a life, but because of our love for Him, we continually deny our soul-life so that we do not live by our life but take His life. As a result, our living is not merely a matter of obeying Him or of doing things that please Him, but our living is God being expressed from within us.</p>
<p>In contacting the saints, we often feel that this brother is very good or that sister is very good, because they have many positive virtues. However, it is not so easy to smell the flavor of God in their virtues. Although these virtues come out of their human life, God is not expressed in these virtues. Some believers have done many prosperous and flourishing works for God, but these works do not bear the divine element. There are other saints, however, who do not have an outward display of many virtues or who seemingly have not accomplished anything of significance, but they bear the flavor of God and of His element. When we touch them, our first impression is not of their virtues but of God. God comes forth in their living and their work.</p>
<p>Such an expression of God is what makes the four Gospels different from books on ethics. The books of Confucius and other Chinese philosophers have an ethical flavor, but they do not bear the flavor of God. The Gospels are the biography of Jesus, the Nazarene. When we read His biography, we see that whether He was speaking, healing the sick, or casting out demons, He expressed God; God came forth from Him. Jesus was a man, but He took God as His life and lived by God. In His living and in His work, His actions were not focused on doing good or on accomplishing a great work. His focus was God. He let God live in Him and be expressed in Him.</p>
<p>It is true that the Lord obeyed God&rsquo;s will. But we must have a proper understanding of what this means. The Lord did not merely obey God&rsquo;s will, nor did He do things to please God apart from God. His obeying God&rsquo;s will transcended this level. He denied His life and lived by the divine life to obey the Father&rsquo;s will. In other words, His obeying of the Father&rsquo;s will was His letting the Father live out of Him. He fully cooperated with God by receiving God as life; He denied His life to live by the Father&rsquo;s life. The Lord did not only do things for God or work for God, but He let the Father live out of Him. He accomplished God&rsquo;s will not by doing the things that the Father ordained; rather, He accomplished God&rsquo;s will by letting the Father live from within Him. Such a living can be seen in His healing the sick, His casting out demons, and His teaching. Whatever He did was the Father living out from Him. This is what it means to do God&rsquo;s will, to obey God. When we deny our self, take God as life, let Him live in us, and live by His life, we are obeying God and doing His will.</p>
