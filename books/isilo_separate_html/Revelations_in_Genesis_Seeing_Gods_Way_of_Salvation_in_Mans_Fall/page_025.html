<h2 class="head2">Scattered&mdash;Not Being Able to Live Together<br />
in One Place</h2>
<p>Because the people intended to rebel against God collectively, He scattered them so that they would not be able to live together in one place (vv. 8-9).</p>
<h2 class="head2">Confounded&mdash;Not Being Able to Have<br />
the Same Language</h2>
<p>God confounded the people&rsquo;s language, causing them to not be able to understand one another&rsquo;s speech (v. 7). After God&rsquo;s confounding, they could, for example, no longer easily understand the word <em>come.</em> In order to understand one another&rsquo;s speech, there was a need for translation. Therefore, not having one language is God&rsquo;s judgment. When Jehovah confounded the language of all the people, they were scattered over the surface of all the earth. <em>Babel,</em> the name of the city, means &ldquo;confusion,&rdquo; which was the issue of being cursed and judged.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE WAY TO BE<br />
DELIVERED FROM MAN&rsquo;S FOURTH FALL</h2>
<p>God had a way to deal with the first fall, a way of escape for the second fall, and a way of salvation for the third fall. However, there was no dealing, no escape, and no salvation for the fourth fall. There was only a revelation of a way for deliverance, as seen in Abraham&rsquo;s calling.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Leaving Everything<br />
Related to Background and Environment</h2>
<p>Abraham&rsquo;s deliverance involved leaving everything related to his background and environment. When God called Abraham, He told Abraham to go from his land, from his relatives, and from his father&rsquo;s house (12:1), that is, to leave everything of his background and environment. At that time Abraham was in Chaldea (11:28), the land of Shinar, which was the place of man&rsquo;s rebellion against God, the source of man&rsquo;s rebellion against God (10:10; 11:2-4). Joshua 24:2 and 14 tell us that the land of Chaldea, the birthplace of Abraham, was a land full of idols. It was a place where people worshipped idols and exalted their own name. However, God came to call Abraham, telling him to leave everything of his background and environment.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Living a Life in Opposition<br />
to the City and Tower of Babel</h2>
<p>Abraham also lived a life that was altogether in opposition to the living in Babel. When he arrived in the land of Canaan, he pitched a tent, built an altar, and called on the name of Jehovah (Gen. 12:5, 7-8). Abraham&rsquo;s tent stood as a testimony in opposition to the city of Babel, and his altar stood as a testimony in opposition to the tower of Babel. A human city symbolizes a life without God, whereas a tent symbolizes a life with God. A human city symbolizes a life of not trusting in God, whereas a tent symbolizes a life of trusting in God. Abraham&rsquo;s life was the life of a tent, which was altogether contrary to Babel, and Abraham&rsquo;s distinctive mark was an altar, not a tower. The tower of Babel was a declaration of man&rsquo;s renunciation of God, whereas Abraham&rsquo;s altar was a mark of man&rsquo;s calling on God. The tower was for man&rsquo;s name, but the altar was for calling on the name of God. Abraham&rsquo;s life was completely in opposition to the living in Babel. Whereas the people of Babel had a city, Abraham had a tent. Whereas the people of Babel declared their renunciation of God, Abraham declared his acceptance of God. Whereas the people of Babel did not trust in God, Abraham trusted in God. Whereas the people of Babel built a tower to make a name for themselves, Abraham built an altar to call on the name of God.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE LINE OF THE CITY AND THE LINE OF THE TENT</h2>
<p>At the time of Abraham&rsquo;s calling, the city of Babel and the tent of God were in opposition to each other. Ever since the fall of man, human life has been divided into two different lines. One line involves the living of those who follow Satan, those who are the seed of the serpent (3:15), which is a godless living symbolized by a city. The other line involves the living of those who belong to God, those who are the seed of the woman, which is a God-trusting life symbolized by a tent. In the Bible these two kinds of life are always in opposition. Actually, the opposition between the tent and the city did not begin with Babel. According to Genesis 4, Cain built a city called Enoch before the deluge (v. 17), and after Noah came out of the ark, he lived in a tent (9:21). Hence, Noah&rsquo;s tent and the city built by Cain were in opposition to each other. In chapter 12 Abraham&rsquo;s tent was an anti-testimony to the city of Babel. When the children of Israel were serving God in the wilderness, they dwelt in tents and pitched a tent of meeting for God (Exo. 33:7-8, 10). These tents were in opposition to the cities built by the children of Israel during their enslavement in Egypt (1:11). When they entered into Canaan, the city of Jerusalem, which was the enlargement of the tent, was also in opposition to the city of Babylon, which was the enlargement of the city of Babel. Ultimately, at the end of the Bible, Babylon the Great (Rev. 17&mdash;18) and the New Jerusalem (21:2-3, 9-27) are in opposition to each other.</p>
<p>The Bible is a record of these two lines: the line of the city and the line of the tent. The Bible tells a story of the city, beginning with Genesis 4 and continuing through Revelation 18. First, there is the city of Enoch built by Cain (Gen. 4:17); later there is the city of Babel (11:4, 9); still later there is the city of Babylon (Psa. 137:8; Isa. 13:19); and finally there is Babylon the Great (Rev. 14:8; 18:2). These are all on the same line. Another line is the line of the tent. First, there is the tent of Noah (Gen. 9:21); later there is the tent of Abraham (12:8); still later there is the city of Jerusalem, which was brought forth after the descendants of Abraham entered into the land of Canaan with the Ark of God (1 Kings 11:32, 36). Finally, there is the holy city, New Jerusalem, which will come down out of heaven from God. Although the New Jerusalem is a city, it is still called a tabernacle (Rev. 21:2-3), and it is the ultimate issue of the line of the tent.</p>
<p>These two lines are never joined; their ways of life are completely different and always in opposition to one another. The line of the city is filled with idols and completely rejects God, whereas the line of the tent is filled with people who want God and trust in God completely. With a tent there is always an altar, and in the city of Jerusalem there was an altar (1 Kings 9:25; 12:27). An altar is a sign of man&rsquo;s need for God. When there is a &ldquo;city&rdquo; with a &ldquo;tower,&rdquo; people continually declare that they do not want God. When there is a &ldquo;tent&rdquo; with an &ldquo;altar,&rdquo; people continually declare that they want God. Man wants God, trusts in God, and takes God as his center so that everything is for God only when there is a tent and an altar.</p>
<p>The way to be delivered out of the fourth fall is by being called by God to leave our background and environment and by living a life in opposition to the living in Babel. Babel does not want God, but we want God. Babel makes a name for man, but we exalt God&rsquo;s name. By leaving our background and environment and by living a life in opposition to the living in Babel, we can be delivered and preserved from the fall.</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_024.html">Prev</a> | Next </body></html>
