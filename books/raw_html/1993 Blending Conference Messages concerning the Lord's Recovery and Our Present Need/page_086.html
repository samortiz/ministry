<H2 CLASS=HEAD1>STUDYING OUR CANDIDATES AND FINDING OUT<br>THE BEST WAY TO TAKE CARE OF THEM</H2><P>Once a vital group is formed, the group members should meet together once a week to fellowship about and study every case of their candidates to find out the best way to take care of each candidate and the best helper or helpers to catch the candidate. We need to consider all of our acquaintances, and we need the proper discernment in our consideration of whom we should labor on. We should spend our time to labor on those whom we consider to be promising and not waste our time on others who are not open. In our group meetings we should pray and study our candidates for the gospel together. We need to consider people's condition, especially spiritually, and then act appropriately to meet their need in the gospel. If we do this, we will gain a clear vision of what their situation is, and this will lead us to contact them in the right way. We need to decide how we should visit a certain person and who would be the right one or ones to go.</P><P>In Luke 19 the Lord likened our church service to a kind of business. He charged us in verse 13 to do business until He comes. We need to do business in and with the Lord by studying how we can gain people. Thank the Lord that we can bear the burden with the Lord in the vital groups to gain the increase for the Lord's recovery.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>AFTER A CANDIDATE IS GAINED AND BAPTIZED,<br>THEY SHOULD DO THEIR BEST TO BRING<br>HIM OR HER TO THEIR GROUP MEETING</H2><P>After a candidate is gained and baptized, the vital group members should do their best to bring him or her to their group meeting and help him or her to participate in the fellowship of the group meeting and learn how to function in the mutual teaching and mutual perfecting. After a person is gained and baptized, he must be raised up to be a living member of the Body of Christ. Today what God needs are not merely saved souls but living members so that His Body can be built up to the fullest extent. Some may have the concept that if they can help someone to be saved and baptized, that is sufficient. However, God is not satisfied until every saved and baptized one is a living member who can be useful for the building up of the Body of Christ.</P><P>It is not easy to raise up a newly baptized one to be a living, functioning member of the Body of Christ. This may require two years of diligent and patient labor. Today in the Lord's recovery there is no better atmosphere in which the new ones can be raised up than the vital groups. If we endeavor to bring the newly gained and baptized ones into the vital groups to be with the other vital members, the new ones too will become living and functioning members. Therefore, we need to make it a priority to bring our newly saved ones to the vital group meetings.</P>
