The works of God are all under His sovereign authority, and His sovereign authority is in all His works. On the day of Pentecost, when the church in Jerusalem was established, it was established not merely with the inhabitants of Jerusalem, but with peoples from all over the world who were gathered together at Jerusalem. There were speakers of at least fourteen or fifteen dialects gathered together that day. Thus, the first appearing of the church was among a group of people from many different places and countries who spoke many different languages. In a matter of moments, all those people from so many places and countries, who spoke so many different languages, became one new man. They were all speaking the same kind of language there. Anything man does requires gradual improvement, and what comes last is the best; however, what God does, does not need improvement; it is the best from the first moment. The first appearing of the church was at its highest standard. This is very significant. The first appearing of the church was not merely among a local group of people; instead, it was among an international group of people. We thank God that we here in this conference are not merely a group of people from one locality. The regions represented here today are even more widespread than those represented by the people in Jerusalem at that time. Hallelujah! If we were to invite representatives present here from each of the six continents to the platform, we could ask them to use their native languages to speak the same thing. This demonstration would give us a deep impression of the new man among an international group of people.<h2 class=head1>THE LORD DESIRING TO RECOVER THE TESTIMONY OF THE NEW MAN ON THE EARTH TODAY</h2><p>I absolutely believe that this international gathering is not a coincidence but the Lord&#8217;s arrangement. At this time we have received a deep impression that the Lord in these days is moving in His recovery. I myself feel it is marvelous to be able to release these messages on the new man, which have never before been released. Even during the conference preceding this training, I was not clear as to what I should speak in this five-day training. It was not until the first day that I became clear within that the Lord wants us to take the opportunity to release the messages on the new man, while representatives from all six continents are present. I believe that from now on the churches in all the six continents will no longer be the same as before, and the churches will go on in the way of the new man. We all must arrive at this goal of being the one new man in the whole earth, speaking the same thing with one heart and one mouth to the glory of God.<p>Christianity has been bearing a negative testimony for several centuries by constantly saying that Christians have no way to be one. But today the Lord wants to present a positive testimony for Christianity to see that Christians can certainly be one. Brothers and sisters, can Christians really be one? By the Lord&#8217;s grace it is more than possible! In a previous message I used negative words to speak of positive matters. I said that it is impossible even for a husband and wife to arrive at the true oneness, much less possible for individual believers. Without the Lord&#8217;s mercy and grace, all of us descendants of Adam are &#8220;little demons,&#8221; and no one can be one with anyone else. But on the day of Pentecost the Lord came in, and those speakers of different dialects immediately became one in the Lord. We thank the Lord that all of us have been baptized into the Triune God. Every one of us can boast, &#8220;Hallelujah, today I am in Christ. In Christ we all have the Lord and His grace, so we are all one. We can be one; this is absolutely possible!&#8221; It is possible because we are all in the Lord and have His grace.<p>If we look at ourselves, there is no way for us to be one with others. Therefore, we should not look at ourselves, and the Lord never asks us to look at ourselves. The Lord wants us to look at Him. The Lord says, &#8220;Look to Me and you will be saved.&#8221; As soon as we look at the Lord, we are immediately one in the Lord. Therefore, we can all testify together today that it is possible for Christians to be one. Moreover, it is not only possible; we are already practicing it. The two days of gospel meetings that we had during the conference would not have been possible in a mere Christianity alliance. In the Lord&#8217;s church there is no need for an alliance because we are already one. This is a symbol, a sign. I really believe it when I say that from now on the Lord will go the same way and do the same work in each of the six continents; He will sound the same trumpet and produce the same testimony.<br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_036.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_038.html">Next</a> </body></html>
