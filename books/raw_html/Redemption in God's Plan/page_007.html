        <h2 class="head1">THE CENTRAL ISSUE OF THE UNIVERSE</h2>
<p>From man&rsquo;s perspective, the earth is the center of the universe, and the garden of Eden is the center of the earth. The tree of life and the tree of the knowledge of good and evil were at the center of the garden. Hence, from the human perspective, these two trees are the center of the universe. When God put Adam in front of these two trees, man&rsquo;s future depended on how he dealt with these two trees. These two trees are at the center of the universe, and our relationship to these two trees is the central issue of the universe.</p>
<p>By standing in front of the tree of life and the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, Adam was actually standing in front of God and Satan. The garden of Eden had three main features: the tree of life, which signifies God; the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, which signifies Satan; and Adam, who represents man. God, Satan, and man are the three main characters in the universe. God and Satan want to gain man. Whereas God wants to gain man in order to fulfill His purpose, Satan wants to gain man in order to fulfill his evil intention. Therefore, the central issue of the universe is whether man will stand on God&rsquo;s side in order to be gained by God or on Satan&rsquo;s side in order to be gained by Satan. If we stand on God&rsquo;s side and are gained by Him, we will fulfill God&rsquo;s purpose. However, if we stand on Satan&rsquo;s side and are gained by him, we will serve Satan&rsquo;s intention.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE FREEDOM OF MAN</h2>
<p>Although God wants us to stand on His side and to be gained by Him, He will not force us to choose Him, and although God does not want us to stand on Satan&rsquo;s side or to be gained by Satan, He will not stop us from choosing Satan. God did not compel Adam to contact the tree of life, nor did He stop Adam from contacting the tree of the knowledge of good and evil. God did not make the tree of life more accessible to Adam than the tree of the knowledge of good and evil. Rather, God put Adam in front of the tree of life and the tree of the knowledge of good and evil and gave him the freedom to choose. God is the Creator, but He let Adam choose between Himself and Satan. This shows God&rsquo;s greatness. God is so great that He will not force us to stand on His side. If we prefer God, we can freely choose Him, but if we prefer Satan, we are free to choose God&rsquo;s adversary. God gives us the freedom to choose. He will never force us to choose His way.</p>
<p>God did not eliminate Satan from the universe in order to limit Adam&rsquo;s choice to Himself, and He did not block the way to the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, leaving only the tree of life for Adam to contact. Rather, God placed Adam before both the tree of life and the tree of the knowledge of good and evil. Both God, as the tree of life, and Satan, as the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, were before Adam. Hence, he could choose between the tree of life, signifying God, or the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, signifying Satan. If Adam had chosen God, he would have received life, but he chose Satan and received death. God gave Adam the freedom to choose and to decide according to his own will.</p>
<h2 class="head1">GOD&rsquo;S PROHIBITION AND WARNING</h2>
<p>Although God did not stop Adam from contacting the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, He did command him to not eat of its fruit. Genesis 2:16-17 says, &ldquo;Jehovah God commanded the man, saying, Of every tree of the garden you may eat freely, but of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, of it you shall not eat; for in the day that you eat of it you shall surely die.&rdquo; Although God did not command Adam to eat the fruit of the tree of life, He warned him to not eat the fruit of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil. The tree of life occupies a central place in God&rsquo;s heart, but He put the tree of life among all the other trees and said to Adam, &ldquo;You may eat freely&rdquo; (v. 16). This shows His greatness. God warned Adam to not eat the fruit of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil by saying that in the day that he ate of it he would surely die (v. 17). Knowing the consequences of eating the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, God warned Adam. God&rsquo;s prohibition was a warning to Adam to not eat the fruit of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil. God commanded Adam to &ldquo;guard&rdquo; the garden, and He also warned Adam concerning the existence of the evil one.</p>
<h2 class="head1">SATAN&rsquo;S TEMPTATION</h2>
<p>Satan knew that God&rsquo;s desire, pleasure, and purpose involved man and that the fulfillment of God&rsquo;s plan was delegated to man. Thus, if God gained man, He would be able to carry out His plan through man. Satan also knew that God intended to deal with him through man. Thus, if Satan could gain man, he would be able to frustrate God&rsquo;s plan. Satan knew that God intended for man to eat of the tree of life; therefore, before man could be gained by God, Satan came in to corrupt and usurp man. Before man could contact the tree of life and enter into a relationship with God, Satan tempted man to contact the tree of the knowledge of good and evil and to enter into a relationship with him instead. Satan, as God&rsquo;s adversary, intended to disrupt God&rsquo;s plan. Satan knew that if he could corrupt and usurp man, he would be able to frustrate God&rsquo;s plan. Satan&rsquo;s action to corrupt and usurp man was malicious in its intention.</p>
<p>On the one hand, God commanded man to guard the garden of Eden, and on the other hand, He warned man of the existence of the evil one and of his evil desire to corrupt and kill man (vv. 15-17). It is important to consider how the evil one corrupted and usurped man.</p>

 	<h2>Noise Words</h2>
 	<p>Common words, such as "and", "is", "but", and "the", also known as noise words, are bypassed in a search. The search string, the Spirit &amp; who, would result in an error since who, which stands by itself, is a noise word. The following is a list of noise words:</p>
	<p>$, a, also, an, and, another, any, are, as, at, be, because, been, being, both, but, by, came, can, did, do, each, for, has, had, he, have, her, here, him, himself, his, how, if, in, into, is, it, like, make, me, might, much, my, of, on, or, our, out, over, said, should, since, some, still, such, take, than, that, the, their, them, then, there, these, they, this, those, to, too, very, was, way, we, well, were, what, where, which, while, who, with, would, you, your</p>

  	<h2>Ranking</h2>
  	<p>Rank is a value from <strong>0</strong> to <strong>1000</strong> indicating how closely a match scored or ranked against the original search string. Rank values are affected by the following factors:</p>
		<ol>
            <li><span>The total number of occurrences of the original search words/phrases in a portion of a book.</span></li>
            <li><span>Content that includes the search words in close proximity to each other are ranked above those that do not. Therefore, a portion of a book that has the search words in close proximity may have a higher ranking than another portion of a book that has a higher hit count but the words are not in close proximity to one another. Therefore, we also include a search word hit count for reference.</span></li>
            <li><span>The rank values are relative to each other. Therefore, it is not possible to interpret the RANK value as a percentage or group the rank values into high/medium/low ranges. Think of rank as a method to order the results for a specific search.</span></li>

 	<h2>Search Scope</h2>
 	<h3>Include All Word Forms</h3>
	<p>This option breaks out the search string into its individual words and generates all conjugations and declensions for each word in the search phrase. A search on the word, dwell, would search for dwell, dwelling, dwelling's, dwells, dwelt, and dwelled.</p>
	<p>There is no need to use ^ (inflectional search) or * (prefix search) when using the Include all word forms search scope.</p> 
	<h3>Specified Word Forms</h3>
	<p>This option searches for exact matches of the specified words or phrases used in the search string. Use of ^ (inflectional search) with a particular word in the search string will broaden the search for that given word in that all conjugations and declensions for that word will be searched. Similarly, use of * (prefix search) with a particular word in the search string will broaden the search for that given word in that all words with that prefix will be searched as well.</p> 
	<h3>Note</h3>
	<p>Common words, such as "and", "is", "but", and "the", also known as noise words, are bypassed in a search. A list of all noise words is as follows:</p>
