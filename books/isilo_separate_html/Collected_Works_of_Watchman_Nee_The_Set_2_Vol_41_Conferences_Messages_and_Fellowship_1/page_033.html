Christ is the Head, and we are the members of His Body. The fingers are organically joined to the body and do not need to bear any responsibility of their own. The head will supply all their needs. Those who have wounded themselves and have lost too much blood need a transfusion of blood. Ordinarily, however, a person does not need any infusion of blood because he has the ability within him to produce blood. The head of the body supplies the needs of the whole body. In the same way, Christ is the Head and we are the members of His Body. He is responsible for meeting all the needs of the members.</p><h2 class="head2">The Lord as Our Bread of Life</h2><p>Another relationship we have with the Lord relates to His being our bread of life. He is here for us to eat, and He is here to be our life. In John 6 the Lord said, "I am the bread of life; he who comes to Me shall by no means hunger, and he who believes into Me shall by no means ever thirst....Unless you eat the flesh of the Son of Man and drink His blood, you do not have life within yourselves....He who eats My flesh and drinks My blood abides in Me and I in him" (vv. 35, 53, 56). The Lord descended from heaven to be our bread, meet our needs, satisfy us, and give us the strength to live on this earth. As the living Father has sent Him and He lives by the Father, so he who eats Him shall also live because of Him (v. 57).</p><h2 class="head2">The Bridegroom and the Bride</h2><p>Ephesians 5 says that Christ is the Husband and the church is the bride. This speaks of another relationship we have with the Lord. Everything that a bride has is found in the bridegroom. After the bride marries the bridegroom, everything of the bridegroom belongs to the bride. A girl may have some debts before her marriage. But after she is married, the bridegroom will take over all the debts of the bride. In addition, all that the bridegroom has will become the bride's. Our Lord is the Lord of all. Everything belongs to Him. We might have been a poor girl, but now we are married to Christ. Once we belong to Christ, everything becomes ours (1 Cor. 3:21).</p><h2 class="head2">The Father of the Orphan and the Orphan</h2><p>An orphan does not have a father or a mother. He has to make all of his own provisions. He has to take care of his own food, clothing, shelter, and travel. The Lord said that He has not left us as orphans. Today He has become our Father. He is not only helping us by standing beside us; He is abiding in us to be the Father to us. He is supplying all of our needs (cf. Matt. 10:19-20).</p><h2 class="head1">BELIEVING IN GOD'S FACTS</h2><p>The above five relationships between a believer and the Lord are spiritual facts, and they are recorded in God's Word. We do not need to do much. All we have to do is believe and receive, and these facts will become our experience. We believe in God's Word, which says that we are the branches of the vine, that we are the members in the Body of Christ, that the Lord is our bread of life, that we have been married to Christ, and that Christ is the Father to us the orphans. When we believe in these facts, we will enter into the enjoyment of the Lord's full provisions.</p><p>A brother once came to me and asked, "How can I overcome?" I said, "First, you have to let go. Second, you have to believe. Letting go is giving up your struggling, and believing is accepting the facts that God has accomplished in Christ." He told me that he had let go and believed, but had not experienced victory yet. I told him, "Brother, what would you do if you purchased my land and signed a contract, and then someone came and built a little hut on it, claiming that he would not move away because it was his land? All you have to do is show him the grant deed and prove that you purchased the land. Either the grant deed is wrong or he is wrong. Are you going to believe in your own defeat, or are you going to believe in God's Word?" God's Word is the fact; it is God's contract with us. We have to believe what God's Word says and ignore the interference the devil puts in our mind.</p><p>We often say that we have let go. Actually we have not really let go. This is like two friends, one fighting to give the other some money and the other fighting to refuse it. The two fight back and forth with the money. Finally, one puts the money on the floor and walks away. The other will surely go and pick it up. But our experience is like a person who puts the money on the floor and then feels uneasy, turning his head back to check on the money every few steps as he walks away. If a person does this, the other party surely will not pick up the money. Only when we have completely let go of ourselves will God pick us up.</p><p>In Chefoo, Mrs. Witness Lee once came and said to me, "I have surrendered and I fully believe that the Lord is my victory. I have indeed broken through in the matter of overcoming. Yet my victory is very short-lived. After a week, I am defeated again. What is happening to me?" I asked, "Has Christ changed?" She answered "No." I said, "Has God's Word changed?" Again she answered "No." Then I said, "Suppose your son is out in the streets one day and a person comes along and says to him, `You are not born of your mother. You were bought.' Your son may come back crying and ask if he was bought. Of course, you will say to him, `You are born of me. Do not listen to strangers telling you all kinds of nonsense.' After hearing this, he may feel relieved and go out to play again. The same man may come again, say the same thing to him, and add that others are also saying this. Your son may come back crying again. What will you say to him then? You will surely say, `Son, are you going to believe in a stranger's word, or are you going to believe in your mother's word? Whose word is more trustworthy?' Today we act the same way. We believe Satan's word which seems to be backed up with all kinds of proofs, rather than believing in God's Word. Every time Satan comes to trouble us, we should declare `Satan's words are lies, and only God's Word is real.'" This is faith. This kind of faith has passed through the test; this kind of faith glorifies God's name.</p><p>Mr. W&mdash;&mdash; was an Anglican preacher. One day his daughter died. After he returned home from her funeral, he considered what he should speak the next day, which was the Lord's Day. He chose the subject of his sermon from 2 Corinthians 12:9, which says, "My grace is sufficient for you." He knelt down and prayed for God to bless the subject. While he was praying, he asked himself, "Is God's grace sufficient after all? If God's grace is not sufficient for me, how can I tell others that God's grace is sufficient for them? My daughter has died, and I am grieved and cannot get over it. This means that God's grace is not sufficient for me. I cannot lie." He thought of changing the subject, but there was no time to prepare for another one. He could only pray, saying, "God, I want to experience Your sufficient grace; may Your grace become sufficient for me." He prayed for a long time, but it did not seem to have any effect on him. At that moment, he looked up and glanced at a verse on the mantel. The verse had been left there by his mother on her way to the funeral. It was 2 Corinthians 12:9: "My grace is sufficient for you." The words "My" and "you" were printed in blue, and the words "is sufficient" were printed in red, while the rest of the letters were printed in black. Suddenly, light dawned on him. He said, "The Lord says that His grace is sufficient for me, yet I am still praying for His grace to become sufficient to me." He confessed his sins and, at the same time, thanked and praised the Lord for His sufficient grace. He was filled with joy and thanksgiving. The next day when he was on the platform, he delivered the best sermon of his life. Someone asked what his secret was, and he answered that he had seen what faith was after his daughter's funeral. Faith is not asking God to fulfill His promise. Faith is thanking and praising God for what He has said.</p><p>A brother spoke once on the overcoming experience. After he spoke, he asked if there were any questions. He noticed that one sister was weeping silently. Another old sister stood up and said, "I have been praying for the past few years for victory, but I have not yet overcome. What is wrong with me?" The brother answered, "There is nothing wrong with you. The only problem is that you have prayed too much. If you would turn your prayers into praises, everything would be fine." Right after he said this, another brother stood up and said, "I have prayed for victory for eleven years, but have never been able to overcome. This sister's question and your answer have just brought victory to me." The preacher then turned to the young sister and asked how she felt. She said that she also had been touched by the question and answer and had also broken through. This is faith. Faith is believing that the Lord has overcome and that He has given us His victory. That evening all three overcame at the same time.</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_032.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_034.html">Next</a> </body></html>
