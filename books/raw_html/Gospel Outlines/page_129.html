<h1 class="title">A GOOD MAN STILL NEEDS SALVATION</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture: Acts 10:1-5; 11:4-18; 10:34-43</h1>
<ol class="upper-romanbd">
<li>A good man
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>Cornelius was a godly, that is, a good man.</li>
	<li>Both he and his household feared God.</li>
	<li>He often gave alms to the poor.</li>
	<li>He prayed to God.</li>
	<li>The Lord heard his prayer.</li>
	<li>All the above five points prove that Cornelius was a good man. However, he was not a saved man. <em>Emphasize strongly that he was a godly man, but he was not saved.</em> Yes, he feared God, but he was not saved. He always gave alms, but he was not saved. He prayed to God, and God heard his prayer, but he was not saved.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>Why he was not saved
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>He was a good man, but he was still a sinner. <em>Emphasize strongly that a good man is still a sinner.</em> He was a good man; he had all the preceding five good points, but it cannot be said that he had no sin. A man is not without sin just because he honors his parents, is honest, meek, merciful, and compassionate. He was a good man, but he was not yet saved.</li>
	<li>He was a good man but would still die. No matter how many good points a man possesses, eventually he has to face death. A man who goes to the Sunday service, contributes regularly, and fears God will still have to die someday.</li>
	<li>All his goodness, fear of the Lord, and giving of alms were of his own effort. Since he did not have the life of God, he needed to be saved.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>The gospel of salvation
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>The gospel of salvation is not man&rsquo;s invention. Cornelius thought that as long as he had good behavior and was a godly man, he would be saved. This is absolutely wrong.</li>
	<li>The gospel of salvation is a revelation from God. While Cornelius tried his own way to touch God, God appeared to him in a vision saying, go get Peter, he will show you the revelation of salvation. Only that kind of revelation can save you.</li>
	<li>The revelation of the gospel is to show that Jesus is the Lord of all, and that He is God come as man to be our Savior.</li>
	<li>The gospel is to show people that Christ died and resurrected to be the Savior of mankind, to forgive sins, and to be life for man.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>How can a good man be saved?
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>A good man as well as a bad man needs to be saved.</li>
	<li>A bad man has to repent. A good man also has to repent. A bad man may have a hundred sins to confess, and a good man may have at least ten sins to confess. Therefore, a good man also needs to repent.</li>
	<li>Just as a bad man needs Jesus to be his Savior, so also a good man needs Jesus to be his Savior.</li>
	</ol></li>
