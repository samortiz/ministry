   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>GOD'S LIFE BEING RELEASED THROUGH DEATH</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Let us read Luke 12:49.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>This is the deepest verse in the Gospel of Luke.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The Lord said, "I have come."</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>He does not mention anything about redemption.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>He merely came "to cast fire on the earth, and how I wish that it were already kindled!"</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>This verse speaks of a fire being cast on the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>This means that the fire is not from the earth, but from heaven and from God.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Fire signifies the life in the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The Lord came to cast fire on the earth, that is, to release God's life to the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Following this the Lord said, "But I have a baptism to be baptized with, and how I am pressed until it is accomplished!" v. 50 . The word "pressed" in Greek means "bound" and "confined." The Lord was saying that He came to release the life of God.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Yet He was still in the flesh and could not release such a life.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>He felt bound and confined.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Because of His flesh, God's life could not be released; His life was limited by the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>This is why He felt bound and confined.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The Lord spoke of a baptism which He had to be baptized with, which was not yet fulfilled.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Since He had already been baptized in chapter three, why did He say that He had another baptism to be baptized with?</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>We must note that the Lord did not say that He had not been baptized.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>He was saying that there was a baptism that had not yet been accomplished.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>"Baptism" in this verse clearly refers to His death on the cross Mark 10:38 .</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The death of Christ was His great release.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>If Christ had not died, the divine life within Him would have been imprisoned and bound.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>But once He died, the divine life was released and ready to be received by man.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>This is what He wished to see.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The phrase in Jesus is not in the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The Bible only says "in Christ."</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>We cannot be in Jesus, because Jesus was a man.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>He was God's only begotten Son, and we have no part in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>No one can be in Jesus of Nazareth.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>But one day this man who was in the flesh, this individual man, was crucified on the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Although His flesh died, this death released His life.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>When He resurrected from the dead, He became Christ Jesus; He became the One whom we can get into.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>When we are in Christ, we receive His life; we die and are raised up together with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>This is what Christ's resurrection has accomplished.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Let us now turn back to John 12:24.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The grain of wheat in this verse refers to Christ, the only Begotten of God.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>When Christ died, the grain of wheat died.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The shell of the grain was broken, and the life of the grain was released.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>After some time, the one grain became many grains.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>All the grains come from the one grain.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Originally, there was only one grain.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Now it has become many grains.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The one grain becomes many grains by falling to the ground to die.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Christ, the one Man, died; His body was broken, and His life was released.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>In resurrection, the one grain becomes us; we become the many grains.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Our life has its origin in Christ, the one grain.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Our life is derived from Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>In this way, we know what it means for Christ to be the Head and for us to be His members.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Although this life is in us today, this life comes from Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>This is the process through which Christ regenerated us.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>HAVING THE SAME LIFE</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>The Lord was first the only begotten Son.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>After His death and resurrection, He brought forth many grains and became God's firstborn Son.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>As the many grains, we have now become God's many sons.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>On the day of resurrection the Lord said to Mary, "I ascend to My Father and your Father" John 20:17 .</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>The Lord could not have said this three days before.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>But on the day of resurrection, He could say this.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Before His death, He did not have such a relationship with us, but through His death and resurrection, He released His life to us.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>We have all received the same life and become the sons of God.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Before our regeneration, we were different in Adam in many ways.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Now in Christ we become the same.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>We have the same life and share the same nature.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>A NEW MAN IN CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Outwardly, baptism appears to be a very simple matter.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>But we must never consider it as being that simple.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Through baptism, everything is buried.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>The end of Galatians 3 says that those who are baptized into Christ have put on Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>There cannot be Jew or Greek, slave or free man, male or female; we are all one in Christ Jesus vv.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>27-28 .</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>For many years Communism has tried unsuccessfully to abolish all class distinctions.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Even if it can abolish the father-son relationship, there are the other relationships that cannot be abolished.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>But in Christ, all distinctions, including nationality, sex, and class are abolished.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>In Christ we have all become one.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>Please remember that our becoming one has everything to do with the baptism in verse 27.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>We were buried in the water when we acknowledged that our old man had died and that this old man and all that he possessed had been crucified with Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>When we entered the water, we entered as a person in Adam.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>But when we came out of the water, we came out as a Christian in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>When we came out of the water, all of our differences in Adam were left behind in the baptismal water and buried.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>We now have Christ as our life; we have all become Christians, and we can now be one.</S>
