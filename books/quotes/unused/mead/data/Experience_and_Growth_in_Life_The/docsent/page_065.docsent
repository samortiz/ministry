   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>DEALING WITH DISPOSITION AND CHARACTER The Scriptural Basis for Dealing with Our Disposition</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>While there are no verses in the New Testament which directly tell how to deal with the disposition, there are a number of verses which can be used.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Since the disposition is implied in the "I," the old man, the soul, and the self, our dealing with these things includes our dealing with the disposition.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In Galatians 2:20, the "I" has been crucified.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>This "I" implies the disposition.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In the same way, when we deny the self Matt 16:24 and lose the soul-life Matt 16:25-26 , the disposition is dealt with, because it is implied in these things.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The Scriptural Basis for Dealing with Our Character</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Dealing with our character is seen in Romans 8:13, which says, "For if you live according to flesh, you are about to die; but if by the Spirit you put to death the practices of the body, you will live."</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The practices of the body are actually our character.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>To deal with the practices of the body is to deal with our character.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Dealing with Our Disposition by Living under the Cross</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>In order to deal with our disposition, we must realize that we have been crucified Gal 2:20; Rom 6:6 .</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>From morning to evening, throughout the entire day, we must remember that we are people who have already been crucified.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Because we have been crucified, we should not live according to our disposition.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>We should not live, act, or walk according to what we are naturally.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>To live in such a way is simply to live according to our disposition.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The way to deal with our disposition is to realize and remember that we are crucified persons and remain under that realization throughout the day.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Dealing with Our Disposition by Opposing Ourselves</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Along with the realization that we are crucified, we have to oppose ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>To oppose ourselves is to oppose our disposition.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>If you realize that your disposition is to be quiet, as long as you remain quiet, you are simply living according to your disposition.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>But if you would oppose your quiet disposition, you must first realize that your natural person has been crucified and then remain under the killing of the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Then in the meetings you, opposing yourself, can exercise to speak something of the Lord to the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>DISPOSITION AND USEFULNESS</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The thing which most damages our usefulness in the Christian life and church life is our living according to our disposition.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>I have been in the Lord's work for many years, and I have found that some brothers and sisters have a strong element in their disposition which hinders them from coordinating and cooperating with others.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>If certain brothers or sisters are assigned a certain work, no one else can be included with them to help in that work; they must do it exclusively.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Such brothers or sisters are usually very capable, and they can also easily stir up trouble in the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The Lord's work is a work of the Body and by the Body; therefore, coordination is desperately needed.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The Apostle Paul was very capable, but he also needed a number of others to help him and coordinate with him.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Even if you are one of the top ones, there is still the need of coordination.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Even the Lord Jesus Himself needed to coordinate with others.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Actually, most of us do not like to work with others.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>If we are lazy, careless persons, we may like others to labor for us.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>But if we are diligent persons, laboring all the time, we may not like others to work with us, because whatever they do interferes with what we are doing.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>In our spiritual life, in our Christian life, in our church life, and in the Lord's work, we must learn to be people who are always opposing ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>As a person with a strong disposition, I can testify that I must constantly realize that my disposition is crucified.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>In the past, my confession was almost completely about my failure to live Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Today, very often my confession to the Lord is concerning my disposition.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>We must learn to live a life of opposing ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>To oppose ourselves is to oppose our disposition.</S>
