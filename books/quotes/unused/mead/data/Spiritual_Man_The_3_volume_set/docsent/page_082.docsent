   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Because the spirit is surrounded by the soul, as if buried inside the soul, it is often influenced by the stimulus of the mind.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>A regenerated person inherently has an unspeakable peace in his spirit, yet because the spirit and the soul have not been divided, even a slight stimulation will disturb the peace and tranquility of his spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>This is due to the soul having many independent desires and thoughts.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Sometimes the soul is filled with joy; this influences the spirit and causes the believer to think that he is the happiest person in the world.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>However, when he experiences an irritation, he thinks he is the most miserable person in the world.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>A soulish believer often has such experiences.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>When soulish believers hear the teaching of the dividing of spirit and soul, they want very much to know where their spirit is.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>However, having exhausted their search, it seems that they remain unable to sense having a spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Since many believers never have any real experience in the spirit, naturally they cannot distinguish their spirit from their soul.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Moreover, since their spirit and their soul are still tightly woven as one, they consider the experiences of the soul such as joy, vision, love, etc. as the supreme spiritual experiences.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Since they do not have any spiritual experience, they should simply admit this and not try to substitute their soul for their spirit, thus bringing loss to themselves.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Before a believer's walk of life becomes completely spiritual, he will have the experience of a mixed spirit and soul as described above.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>As far as his feeling is concerned, he will not be content with the tranquility in his spirit, but rather will seek for a kind of emotional pleasure.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>As to conducting himself in his daily living, sometimes he follows the leading of the intuition, but other times he follows his own thought, reasoning, and desire.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Such an experience of a mixed spirit and soul indicates that there are two sources within the believer: one is of God, the other is of man; one is of the Holy Spirit, the other is of self; one is intuitive, the other rational; one is spiritual, the other is natural one is of the spirit, the other is of the soul.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Before a believer arrives at perfection, sometimes he follows this and sometimes that.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>If a believer carefully examines himself in the light of God, he will see that he has these two lives within him.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Thus, sometimes he lives by this life and sometimes by that life.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Sometimes he realizes that he should live by faith with a trustful heart through the Holy Spirit, and other times he lives according to himself and to what he himself calls spiritual feelings.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>With such a living, he is more often in the soul than in the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The degree to which a believer is soulish depends on his understanding of the life of the spirit, including the principle of cooperating with God, and also on how he acts and makes decisions according to the soul-life.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The activities of his natural life in his various faculties determines the extent of his being soulish.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Some can live entirely in the world of feelings and ideals; some live sometimes by their soul and at other times by their spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Unless a believer is taught by God Himself and receives the revelation of the Holy Spirit in his spirit, he cannot know how abominable the soul-life is and be willing to live entirely in the spirit.</S>
