<H2 CLASS=HEAD2>Offering Up Our Money Being a Great Deliverance</H2><P>Brother Chi Yung-tung testified: After I heard Brother Nee's words, untold tears were flowing within me. I was brought into the responsibility of the work through our brother. When I left my job in 1928, I had five children, and I was in debt. But what the Lord has given me today is so much richer than what I had. The Lord is responsible for meeting His demands, because whatever comes from God, God Himself will be responsible for fulfilling it. I was once a rich man, and I encountered robbers four times. These robbers were not only after money; they were after our lives. They tried purposely to kill the landlords and the capitalists. They had killed over thirty people out of forty. These facts are for our warning. It is good for Christians to be neither rich nor poor. Money makes a person proud, and consecration is a great deliverance. We must not miss the Lord's command today.</P><H1 CLASS=SCRIPTURE>Scripture Reading: Rom. 12:1-2, 4; Acts 2:44-46; 4:32-35; 5:12-14</H1><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>MONEY AND THE SERVICE IN THE BODY</H2><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>Consecrating Everything for the Purpose<br>of Serving in the Body</H2><P>Brother Witness Lee's fellowship:Romans 12 speaks in a strong way of the matter of consecration. The consecration there is for service. This service is a service in the Body of Christ. It is not individual service, but service in the Body. If a man is not in the Body, it is difficult for him to understand God's will. I am afraid some people will misunderstand what we are doing here during the past few days and will think that we are rallying a fund-raising campaign. If you understand things in this way, you are off. We have received God's grace to serve Him in this age. In order to do that, we have to offer up everything and put everything in the Body. We need to be coordinated in our work and in our jobs. In order for God to take the fast way, and in order for the work to reach a high standard, we must have such a kind of consecration.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>Where Riches Are, There Being Our Person Also</H2><P>Why do we have to touch the matter of riches? It is because the Lord says, "For where your treasure is, there will your heart be also" (Matt. 6:21). Where your heart is, there will be your very person also. Riches are like a nail; they nail a person down. Perhaps in these few days, some nails have loosened up. But they have not fallen down yet.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>Deliverance from Riches Being the Practical Way<br>to Offer Up Our Bodies</H2><P>The first time God did such a work was in Acts 2. There the saved ones were delivered from riches on the first day (vv. 44-45). Yet today, every one of us is still under the tight grip of riches; they are still nailing us down. May God deliver every one of us from riches. Romans 12 speaks of two bodies. One is our own body, and the other is the Body of Christ. We offer up our bodies for the Body of Christ. If a man has not been delivered from riches, he cannot offer up his body to God.</P><P>The most powerful testimony in God's recovery is the testimony of the Body. In order to have the Body service, a man must offer up his own body as a living sacrifice.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>Being Delivered from Money to Serve in the Body</H2><P>Acts 2 and 4 show us that as soon as money goes out, there is the one accord. When the disciples took care of the problem of money, the one accord followed, and God's work was realized in a marvelous way in an instant. The book of Acts is our standard. The first time God saved men, He saved them in great numbers. All those men were delivered from riches. Their service was carried out in the Body. This service in one accord is the Body service spoken of in Romans 12.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>Dealing with Money to Have the Body Service</H2><P>If a Christian has not been terminated by God with respect to money, he cannot serve the Lord along with other members. Even if he is to serve, his service will be a superficial one and will not be one that issues from the heart. One of the greatest obstacles to our consecration is the matter of riches. And one of the greatest enemies in the Body of Christ is individualism. In Acts, no one said that anything was his own. If you say that this money is yours, it will be difficult for you to be delivered from individualism. The strongest manifestation of individualism is in the matter of money.</P><P>Our way, our work, and our testimony in the future lie with the Body. If the question of money is not settled, we cannot expect to have good coordination, and we cannot expect that we can serve God.</P>
