   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>II.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>OF GOD S MERCY</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>What shall we say then?</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Is there unrighteousness with God?</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Certainly not!</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>For He says to Moses, I will have mercy on whom I will have mercy, and I will have compassion on whom I will have compassion v. 15 . When God says, I will, we should not argue with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>We are not God and we do not have His sovereignty.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>We may reason with Him, asking, Why do you love Jacob and hate Esau?</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>God may reply, Don t argue with Me. I will to do it.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>I will have mercy on whom I will have mercy.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Everything depends on My will.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>What is the difference between mercy and compassion?</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>It is difficult to distinguish.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Although compassion is very close to mercy, I would say that compassion is deeper, finer, and richer than mercy.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Putting compassion together with mercy in this verse strengthens the fact that God is merciful.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>So then, it is not of the one who wills, nor of the one who runs, but of God, the One Who shows mercy v. 16 . Mercy goes farther than grace.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>If when I am in a good condition and my standing matches yours you give me a gift, that is grace.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>However, when I am in a poor condition and my standing is far removed from yours and you give me something, that is mercy.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>If I come to you as your dear friend and you give me a Bible as a gift, that is grace.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>However, if I am a poor unclean beggar, unable to do anything for myself and you give me ten dollars, that is not grace, it is mercy.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Thus, mercy reaches farther than grace.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Grace only extends to a situation that corresponds to it, but mercy goes much farther, reaching into a situation that is poor and unworthy of grace.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>According to our natural condition, we were far removed from God, totally unworthy of His grace.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>We were only eligible to receive His mercy.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Thus, 9:15 does not say, I will have grace on whom I will have grace.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>No, it says, I will have mercy on whom I will have mercy.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>You may think that there was nothing good about Jacob, that he was altogether a subtle, crafty person, and that Esau was much better than he.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>You are right.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>That is how God has shown His mercy.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Jacob was pitiful, but God had mercy on him.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>God s mercy does not depend upon man s good condition; rather it is shown in man s pitiful condition.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>It reaches beyond His grace.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>It is God s mercy that has reached all of us.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>None of us was in a condition that corresponded to His grace.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>We were so poor and so pitiful that there was the need for God s mercy to bridge the gap between us and God.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>It was God s mercy that brought us into His grace.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>How we need to realize this and worship God for His mercy!</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Even now, after being saved and having participated in the riches of His life, we still, in some ways, are in a condition that needs God s mercy to bridge the gap.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>This is the reason that Hebrews 4:16 says that firstly we need to obtain mercy and then we can find grace for timely help.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Oh, how much we need His mercy!</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>We must treasure God s mercy as much as we appreciate His grace.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>It is always God s mercy that qualifies us to participate in His grace.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>So then it is not of the one who wills, nor of the one who runs, but of God, the One Who shows mercy.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Our concept is that the one who wills will get what he wills to get and that the one who runs will gain what he runs after.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>If this were the case, then God s selection would be according to our effort and labor.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>But it is not so.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>It is altogether of God who shows mercy.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>We do not need to will or to run, for God has mercy on us.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>If we do know God s mercy, we will not put our trust in our effort; neither will we be disappointed by our failure.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>The hope for our wretched condition is God s mercy.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>For the scripture says to Pharaoh, For this very thing I have raised you up, that I might show forth My power in you, and that My name should be proclaimed in all the earth v. 17 . In Pharaoh God showed forth His power, not His mercy, that His name might be proclaimed in all the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>This shows that even God s enemies are useful to Him in fulfilling His purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>So then, verse 18 says, He has mercy on whom He wills, and He hardens whom He wills.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>What should we say with regard to this?</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>We should say nothing, but worship God s way.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Everything depends upon what He wills to do.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>He is God!</S>
