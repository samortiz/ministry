   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>The Spontaneous Issue of the Dynamic Power</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>of the Lord s Salvation</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In verses 1 through 7 we are not told that the Lord said much to Zaccheus.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Zaccheus, however, responded in a very strong way, recognizing the Savior as his Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>And Zaccheus stood and said to the Lord, Behold, the half of my possessions, Lord, I give to the poor v. 8 . Zaccheus could utter such a word even though he had not heard the Man-Savior s teaching concerning material possessions.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>On the way from Galilee to Jerusalem, the Savior spoke about material possessions a number of times.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The first was in chapter twelve.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>When someone out of the crowd asked Him to tell his brother to divide the inheritance, He said to them, Take heed and guard yourselves from all covetousness; for no one s life is in the abundance of his possessions 12:15 .</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Then in 14:33 the Savior went on to say, Everyone of you who does not renounce all his own possessions cannot be My disciple.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>In chapter sixteen He spoke to His disciples concerning the mammon of unrighteousness and then issued a warning to the rich.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>In chapter seventeen He spoke about material possessions in relation to the rapture of the overcomers: In that day, he who shall be on the housetop and his goods in the house, let him not come down to take them away; and he who is in the field, likewise, let him not turn back to the things behind v. 31 . Following this, in 18:22 He said to the rich ruler, All things, whatever you have, sell and distribute to the poor, and you will have treasure in the heavens; and come, follow Me. From all these instances we see that the Man-Savior spoke repeatedly concerning material possessions.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Zaccheus, of course, did not hear any of this.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Nevertheless, in responding to the Savior s word, he said that half of his possessions he gives to the poor.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>We have seen that in verse 8 Zaccheus went on to say to the Lord, If I have taken anything from anyone by false accusations, I restore four times as much.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>What Zaccheus did here was according to the requirements of the law for restoration Exo 22:1; 2 Sam 12:6 .</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>This was the spontaneous issue of the dynamic power of the Lord s salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>In the case of the saving of Zaccheus in Jericho, we see that the Lord s salvation is actually the Lord Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>In verse 5 He says, Today I must stay in your house.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>But in verse 9 He says to Zaccheus, Today salvation has come to this house.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>When we put these verses together, we see that I in verse 5 is equal to salvation in verse 9.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>This indicates that salvation is actually the Lord Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>When He comes, salvation comes.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Wherever He stays, there salvation stays.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>A Captive under Oppression</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>We have pointed out that Zaccheus responded to the Man-Savior in the way he did because of the dynamic power of His salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>With the Man-Savior there is dynamic power, and this power is the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>He ministered the jubilee by the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>In chapter four He declared that the Spirit of the Lord was upon Him because He had been anointed to proclaim release to the captives.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The Lord had been appointed and anointed to proclaim the jubilee to all those who were oppressed.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>In the sight of the religious people, especially the Pharisees, Zaccheus was a leading sinner, for he was a chief tax collector.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>But in the sight of the Man-Savior he was a captive under oppression.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Before he climbed up the tree to see the Savior, Zaccheus may have given much consideration to how to be released from his sinful condition.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>As a Jew, he must have been condemned in his conscience for working as a tax collector to gather taxes for the Roman imperialists.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Hence, he was condemned by his own conscience as a traitor to his country.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Therefore, he may have tried to get out of his sinful condition, but he was unable to do so, for he was a captive and was oppressed.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Seeking and Saving the Lost</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Luke 19:10 says, For the Son of Man has come to seek and to save that which is lost.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Here we see that Zaccheus was not only a sinner; he was also lost.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The Savior came to Jericho purposely to seek and to save such a lost one.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The Lord s seeking Zaccheus in Luke 19 may be compared to His seeking the Samaritan woman in John 4.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The Savior told Zaccheus, I must stay in your house, and John 4:4 says of Him, He had to pass through Samaria.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>It was necessary for Him to go through Samaria in order to meet a lost Samaritan woman.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The Lord went there to seek her and save her.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The same kind of thing happened in Luke 19.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The Lord had to stay in Zaccheus house in order to save this lost person.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Salvation, the Jubilee,</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>and the Kingdom</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>In 19:1-10 we see that wherever the Man-Savior is there salvation is also, for He Himself is salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Furthermore, when this salvation is present, the kingdom of God is also present, and the kingdom of God is the jubilee.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Therefore, when the Lord came into the house of Zaccheus, that was a jubilee not only for an individual but for the entire household.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>When the Lord came into his house, salvation came to that house.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>We may say that the case of the healing of the blind man near Jericho and the case of the saving of Zaccheus in Jericho are one.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>In the first case the blind man receives sight from the Savior, and in the second case Zaccheus receives the Savior as dynamic salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>This indicates that first we receive sight from the Savior, and then we receive the Savior Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>This Savior is salvation, and salvation is the kingdom of God as the jubilee.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Now we can realize that in 19:1-10 a leading sinner is brought into the jubilee of grace.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Now he can enjoy the Savior and the kingdom of God, for now he is in the kingdom of God and enjoying this kingdom as his jubilee.</S>
