We need to preach the gospel according to the way of the New Testament. We have also seen the need for the feeding of the new believers in the home meetings. We need to feed the new ones, nourishing them so that they may grow. Then we have to have group meetings to equip, to teach, and to perfect the members of the Body of Christ so that they all will be able to do the same work that the gifted persons do to build up the Body of Christ. Finally, we need to attain to the stage of every member of the church prophesying in the church meetings for the building up of the church as the Body of Christ and as the new man.</P><P>Our lack is in the actual practice of the God-ordained way. According to the actual practice, the God-ordained way replaces the papal system and the clergy-laity system. To replace these systems is to kill the practice of today's Christianity. We should not preach the gospel in the old way of winning souls. Instead, we should practice the New Testament priesthood of the gospel to present and offer saved sinners as sacrifices to God (Rom. 15:16; 1 Pet. 2:5). To carry out the papal and clergy-laity systems, one must have a gathering in which one or two speak to convince and help others to believe in the Lord Jesus and be saved. But the practice of the New Testament priesthood of the gospel does not depend mainly upon gatherings with good speakers. This practice altogether depends upon the functioning of all the members of the Body of Christ to contact people individually, one by one.</P><P>We should not despise the individual contact with people. As long as we do not practice the New Testament priesthood of the gospel by contacting people one by one, we are still somewhat remaining in the papal and clergy-laity systems. In Christianity a small number of the ones who are brought to Christ go to seminaries to learn how to be the clergy. They do not have the thought that they have been saved and regenerated and are being sanctified and transformed as the living members of the Body of Christ. It is easier to practice the old, organizational clergy-laity system than it is to gain people one by one and present them as sacrifices to God.</P><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_051.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_053.html">Next</a> </body></html>
