   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>In the Time from the Initiation</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>of the Lord s Recovery among Us until Now</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The interpretation of the Bible advanced even more from the initiation of the Lord s recovery among us until now.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Once Brother Nee told me that because Europe and America had been spoiled for the Lord s move, that forced the Lord to go to China.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Brother Nee said that China at that time was virgin soil for the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>However, the missionaries who had gone to China never helped the people there to be clear about the assurance of salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The assurance of salvation is clearly revealed in the New Testament, but because most of the missionaries did not know this truth, they had no way of teaching it.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The Lord gave Brother Watchman Nee a clear vision of the assurance of salvation, and many were revived by his messages on this truth.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The assurance of salvation was then made very clear to the Chinese believers.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>In 1935 Brother Nee held a conference in my hometown, Chefoo, to cover the victorious, overcoming life of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Before that time we were not so clear about this truth.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>In 1940 Brother Nee opened up the truth concerning the Body of Christ and the practical life of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>He called this the blueprint of the practicality of the local church.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>I brought that blueprint back with me to northern China.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>As a result, there was a great revival in the church in Chefoo at the end of 1942.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The Interpretation Which Began</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>from the Trinity and Christology</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>and Has Been Continuing until It Has Now</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Reached the New Jerusalem</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>In about the last thirty years, what the Lord has mainly shown to us is God s economy and God s dispensing, which consummate in the New Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>It is difficult to find anything in Christian bookstores on the truth concerning the New Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Some wrongly believe that the New Jerusalem is a material city with real golden streets.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>It is difficult to find some who have a biblical view of the holy city as the wife of Christ, as the mingling of the processed Triune God with the transformed tripartite man.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Many years ago, Tersteegen, a German writer, wrote something about the New Jerusalem in a proper way.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>About sixty years ago, Brother T. Austin-Sparks wrote something concerning the New Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Beginning from about thirty years ago, we began to see more and more concerning the holy city.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>We have published many messages concerning the New Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>In these messages we cover many detailed points concerning the holy city as the consummation of the divine economy and the divine dispensing.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>I have to give the credit to Brother Nee for what has been revealed to us.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>I heard him say that the New Jerusalem will be the consummation of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>This gave me the basis for understanding the New Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>When the church is completely perfected and established, that will be the New Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>It will first appear in the thousand-year kingdom on a small scale.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Then it will appear in the new heaven and new earth on the fullest scale as the consummation of God s saved people.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The interpretation of the Bible has been built up by the entire Body of Christ through the past nineteen centuries.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>We inherit all the interpretation of the past centuries and stand on the shoulders of the foregoing teachers.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>We have to thank the Lord for this.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Furthermore, we have to thank the Lord that He has shown us more in the last few decades, such as the practical church life, the all-inclusive, life-giving, compound Spirit, even the seven Spirits, God s economy, God s dispensing, and the ultimate consummation of the church, that is, the New Jerusalem, the mingling of the processed Triune God with the transformed tripartite man for God s eternal manifestation and expression.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>THE NEED OF THE SPREADING</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>OF THE UNDERSTOOD DIVINE TRUTHS</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>FOR THE LORD S RECOVERY AND RESTORATION</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Today there is the need of the spreading of the understood divine truths for the Lord s recovery and restoration.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>We can borrow Romans 10:14-15 and say, How shall people hear without one who spreads?</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>How beautiful are the feet of those who spread the interpreted and understood divine truths!</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>If we have a burden to go to Europe, we must spend day and night to study the truths we have published.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Then we will know what the Lord s recovery is, and we will have a real burden to go to Europe to teach people.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The Lord charges us in Matthew 28:19 to go and disciple the nations.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The Lord s word here shows us that we should be burdened to go and teach all the nations.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>There is the need of the spreading of the translated, interpreted, and understood truths for the Lord s recovery and restoration.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>The Lord does everything by speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>If there is no speaking of the Lord, there is no work of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>There cannot be a recovery in Europe if there is not the speaking of the divine truths.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Most of the millions of people in Europe are void of the knowledge of these divine truths.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>The spreading of the divine truths will bring in the Lord s restoration.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>According to Isaiah 11, the restoration will come because the earth will be full of the knowledge of Jehovah, / As the waters cover the sea v. 9 . We have to speak for the Lord to bring in this restoration.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>How shall people hear without one who spreads the divine truths?</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>How beautiful are the feet of those who spread the interpreted and understood divine truths!</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>This is why we have to study these truths.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Otherwise, we are not qualified to go to Europe.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>We should not go to speak to people in a superficial way.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>We may be able to speak John 3:16 to people: For God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son, that everyone who believes in Him should not perish, but have eternal life.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>However, if someone asks us what eternal life is, we may not be able to tell them.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>It is possible to give fifteen messages on John 3:16.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>The first message can be concerning who God is, the second message can be on love, and the third message can be on the world.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Then we can tell people how God gave His Son.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>God did not drop His Son down from the heavens to the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>He gave His Son through incarnation.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Then another message can be given on the only begotten Son.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>More can be said about what it means to perish and what it is to have eternal life.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Message after message can be given on John 3:16.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>We are not going there to preach to people in the traditional way, but to talk to them about all the divine truths.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Through our speaking, some will be solidly saved.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>If we speak the deeper truths in John 3:16 to them, they will never forget this verse.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>May the Lord burden us to learn the divine truths and to spread them everywhere for His recovery and restoration.</S>
