   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>The Fifth Way to Hell:</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Fear of Man</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>I will speak of a final way to go to hell.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>I know that the Holy Spirit is working among us.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Many of us have already perceived the reality of the coming age and realize that we should believe in the Lord Jesus to avoid God's punishment and wrath.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>But there is another danger which we all need to pay attention to.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>We have known that we should have our sins purged, forsake the companions of fornication, believe in the death of the Lord Jesus for us, and confess Him as our Savior.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>But there is another big hindrance keeping us from having our sins purged and confessing Christ as our Savior.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>What is this hindrance?</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>It is the fear of man.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Many of you are standing on the border line of believing in the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Just another step will make you believers in the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>However, you dare not believe or confess because you are afraid that other people might scorn you or rise up against you.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Therefore, we need to read two verses to help you overcome the fear of man.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Proverbs 29:25 says, "The fear of man bringeth a snare."</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Revelation 21:8 says, "But the cowardly...their part will be in the lake which burns with fire and brimstone, which is the second death."</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Those who fear men are those who are cowardly.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>What will be their destiny?</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>They will fall into the snare of the devil and be bound by him.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>They dare not believe in the Lord Jesus or confess themselves to be Christians before others.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Eventually, they will all be thrown into the lake of fire hell together with the devil.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The works of the devil give people this fear of man.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Through a fearful heart, the devil keeps his prisoners.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>He puts this fearful heart inside of man so that man will never dare to leave his domain.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>In this way man becomes his servant forever.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The devil cannot reason with man because many times, even if he tried, the reasons would not be convincing.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Man often realizes that it is foolish to serve Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>He realizes that there is no real joy in living in sins.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Even if the flesh enjoys temporal pleasure, the conscience is always under prolonged condemnation.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>He realizes his degradation in humanity and corruption in morality.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>When he considers his life after death, he senses even more darkness.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>When pondering his future judgment, he trembles with fear.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>No matter how much he tries to free himself and rid himself of the bothersome problem of hell, the existence of hell is deeply rooted in man's life.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>He can neither wash away the thoughts nor drive them out.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Sometimes he may be happy because he can successfully argue in theory that hell does not exist.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Nevertheless, when he searches his heart at midnight, when he is weak physically, or when he is sick unto death, his conscience still tells him deep within that there probably is a hell and that he cannot escape!</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Do you think man does not know that serving Satan and committing sins will lead him to the place of eternal punishment?</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>After hearing the gospel of the Lord Jesus' death for man, do you think he does not know that he should receive Christ as his Savior and confess His name before men to escape the future punishment and present oppression of sins?</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Even Satan knows that he cannot reason with man concerning these matters.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>When it comes to matters of his own gain or loss, man knows which side is more reasonable.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Nevertheless, Satan is very crafty.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>He knows that he cannot prevail in doctrine so he adopts other means to keep man as his prisoner.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Even though he fails in many ways, he is still able to do one thing.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>He speaks to those whose hearts have been touched, saying, "Believing in the Lord Jesus is good, but are you unafraid of men's opposition?</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>You are a wife, and your husband dislikes religion.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Are you unafraid of his opposition?</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>He often commits sins.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>If you do not go along with your husband, will he not scorn you?</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>You will probably be rejected the first time you mention such a matter.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Are you unafraid of him?"</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Maybe in your family you are a son, and your parents, grandparents, and other adults such as your uncles, etc., are all adherents of Confucianism.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>They all greatly oppose Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>If they learn that you have believed in Christ, they will either be infuriated or persecute you fiercely and greatly affect your future.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Or they will scorn you, saying, "Someone like you wants to be religious?"</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Satan shows you the dark side of your family to make you afraid and to stop you from confessing the Lord Jesus as your Savior.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Maybe you are a student, and many in your school do not believe in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>They always chide, mock, and despise those who believe in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Whenever you think about this, Satan will say to you, "Consider this: if you tell them that you have believed in Christ, they will probably give you the same treatment as they have given to the other Christians.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Can you bear this?</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>If you were also a despiser and mocker of believers of Christ, it will be even more embarrassing!</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>You used to mock others and now you too are a Christian!</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>The one who mocked others will now be mocked!</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>How can you bear this?"</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Satan makes you afraid to receive Christ as your Savior.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Maybe you have a friend who strongly dislikes people who believe in the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Maybe you have a fianc who is strongly against Christ and even very worldly and cold toward Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>If they hear that you have believed in the Lord Jesus, they will stand against you.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Perhaps you may even lose their favor.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Satan presents all these pictures to you to make you so afraid of your dear friends that you dare not confess the Lord as your Savior.</S>
