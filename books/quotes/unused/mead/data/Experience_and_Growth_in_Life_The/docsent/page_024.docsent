   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>The Spirit is the crucial element of the phrase "the law of the Spirit of life."</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>"The Spirit of life" means that the Spirit is life and that life is the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The Spirit being the consummated God means that the Spirit is of God.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>God Himself is also Spirit John 4:24 .</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The Spirit is the essence of God, and He is also the consummation of God.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The law of the Spirit of life is not a law in letters, like the Ten Commandments, regulating us concerning good and evil.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The law of the Spirit of life is like a natural law in physics.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>If you throw something into the air, it will drop to the ground.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>This is the law of gravity.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The law of gravity is not a commandment in letters but a natural force, a natural law, which operates according to a principle.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Romans 8:2-3 has two kinds of laws.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The first law in verse 2 is the natural law.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The second law in verse 3 is the written law, the law of Moses.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Because of the weakness of our flesh, the written law had no possibility of doing anything for us, but the law of the Spirit of life as a natural law is just the divine life.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The vegetable life, the animal life, and the human life all have their own law.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>A life does not only have a law; a life is a law.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>When a tree is small, it may be hard to discern what kind of tree it is.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>As a tree grows, the kind of tree that it is becomes manifest.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The almond tree will bring forth almonds, and the peach tree will bring forth peaches.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The growth, shape, and fruit of each of these two trees is regulated by its own law.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The almond life or peach life is the law.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The Spirit as the consummation of the processed Triune God is a law.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>He is life, so He also is a law.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>In verse 2 the Spirit is first in significance, life is second, and the law is last.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>However, in Romans 8 when life is applied, the law is first.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>In Romans 8:2 "the law" is the subject of the sentence and "has freed" is the predicate.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The law of the Spirit of life has freed us from the law of sin and of death.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>This is not the law of Moses but the strongest natural law.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>It is the strongest law, because it is not merely God but the processed Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Before His process in eternity past John 1:1 , God was "raw," having only divinity.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Through incarnation, the first step of His process, humanity was added to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>After incarnation He is of two elements, divinity and humanity.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Then He went to the cross and went through an all-inclusive death.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The element of His death was then added to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Three days after His crucifixion, He entered into resurrection; thus, another element, resurrection, was also added to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Divinity, humanity, crucifixion, and resurrection all are the elements of the processed Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>As the "raw God," He was life only to Himself, but as the processed God, the "cooked God," He can be life to us.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>In resurrection He is the consummated Spirit, the consummation of the processed God to be life to us.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>This Spirit is called the Spirit of life.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>As the Spirit of life, He does not only have a law; He is a law.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Today, it is this law that works in us.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Our Spirit Being Life</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The next crucial verse in Romans 8 is verse 10, which says, "And if Christ is in you, though the body is dead because of sin, yet the spirit is life because of righteousness."</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>In this verse, Christ is mentioned instead of the Spirit because the consummated Spirit is actually Christ Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>When this Christ who is the life-giving Spirit is in us, our spirit becomes life.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Our Mind on the Spirit Being Life</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>In the initial stage of salvation, the inmost part of our being, our spirit, is made life.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The other parts of our being are not yet life.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Romans 8:6, another crucial verse, says, "The mind set on the flesh is death, but the mind set on the spirit is life and peace."</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>From our spirit, the Spirit who is life spreads into our mind whenever our mind is set on the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Our daily condition should be that our mind is on the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>We must be such a people who always have our mind on nothing but the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>In order to live, we must have our mind on something.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Our mind on the spirit is life.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>This is transformation.</S>
