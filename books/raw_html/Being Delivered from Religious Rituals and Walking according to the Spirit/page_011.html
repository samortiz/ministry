        <h2 class="head1">NOT THE OLD RELIGION OR<br />
THE NEW RELIGION BUT CHRIST</h2>
<p>Our problem is that we follow methods instead of wisdom. Formerly, we met according to the old method. We came to the meeting and sat quietly until a brother called a hymn. Then an elder or responsible brother would say, &ldquo;Let us pray together, and then we can pray one by one.&rdquo; After the prayer an elder would announce that it was time to give testimonies. After half a minute of silence, another elder would encourage us to be bold because time is precious. If there was still no response, another elder would call on a certain brother to give a testimony. This brother would stand up reluctantly and give a rambling testimony. This was the situation of our meetings in the past. We all have been in such meetings. I praise the Lord that this time when I came to Taiwan, the old religion has been buried to some extent. However, although the old religion has been buried, a new religion has been brought in.</p>
<p>The disciples of John the Baptist also brought in a new religion. John the Baptist lived in a way of neither eating nor drinking, and his work was to baptize people. However, not long afterward, his disciples formed a religion of baptizing people. In John 3, before John was thrown into prison, his disciples were questioning a Jew about purification. The Jew might have said, &ldquo;We do not need baptism. We have the rite of purification. We wash our hands and feet, and we are clean.&rdquo; The disciples of John might have replied, &ldquo;Your washing is not good enough, because you just wash your hands and feet. The washing by our rabbi John is better. He buries you into the water.&rdquo; Thus, the disciples of John probably regarded baptism as the best rite of purification. This was a new religion. When John began to minister, he did not establish a religion of baptism. He baptized people and buried them in order to introduce them to Christ. However, based on this baptism, his disciples formed a religion of baptism. This religion continued to exist until the time of Acts 19:3-5. Up until that time some of the people did not care about going to Christ or being baptized into Christ; they only cared about baptism as a ritual.</p>
<p>Based on John&rsquo;s not eating and drinking, the disciples of John also set up the regulation of fasting. When they saw that the Lord Jesus and His disciples were feasting, they questioned the Lord, &ldquo;Why do we and the Pharisees fast much, but Your disciples do not fast?&rdquo; (Matt. 9:14). The disciples of John formed two new religious practices: the practice of baptism and of fasting. Their old religion was buried, but a new religion was raised up. The old religion was over, but a new religion appeared. Our way of meeting in the past was according to an old religion, but I am concerned that our present way of meeting has become a new religion. The saints have been trained to have a new way of meeting. The meeting begins with loud prayers, then there is a time for sharing, and finally there is some testifying. The brothers and sisters must bury these steps. We buried the old religion, and we must also bury the new religion. Any form of religion must be buried. The way to meet is to be in spirit, not to follow procedures. It is a matter of wisdom, not a matter of eating or not eating. Sometimes we may be loud, but sometimes we may not be loud. Sometimes we may have some sharing, but sometimes we may not have some sharing. Sometimes we may testify, but sometimes we may not testify. There is no regulation.</p>
<p>Formerly our prayers were long. A brother could pray for at least one or two minutes. Certain saints had the ability to pray for fifteen minutes. They prayed long prayers in every prayer meeting. Such long prayers caused everyone to sleep. The long prayers were so intimidating that other saints would not dare to pray. Only the co-workers, elders, deacons, and responsible ones were able to pray, but their prayers were routine and long.</p>
<p>Now there are no long prayers. Everyone prays short prayers. The saints proclaim, &ldquo;Praise the Lord,&rdquo; &ldquo;The Lord is good,&rdquo; &ldquo;The Lord is lovely,&rdquo; &ldquo;We eat locusts and wild honey,&rdquo; &ldquo;We wear garments of camel&rsquo;s hair.&rdquo; Is this kind of prayer good? Yes, it is good. However, praying short prayers has become a new regulation. Sometimes there is the need for someone to offer a long prayer. In the meetings everyone is loud, and everyone prays short prayers, but it is more enjoyable for there to be a long prayer between the short prayers. However, there should not be any regulation concerning this.</p>
<p>In the past when there was no regulation, we were at a loss and did not know what to do. It is difficult for the young people to give up being loud, but Jesus is the Lord when we are loud, and He is also the Lord when we are not loud. The Lord does not always want the older saints to be quiet. When the older saints insist on being quiet, they are the Lord, not Jesus. It is a precious experience for Jesus to be the Lord. Tonight He may want us to be loud, but tomorrow night He may want us to weep, to jump, or to remain quiet. There is no regulation.</p>
<p>May the Lord be merciful to us. The age has changed, and the old religion has been buried. No one should say that being quiet is right, nor should anyone say that being loud is right. Both are right, and both are wrong. We do not eat or drink, and we do not abstain from eating and drinking. We do not have meetings with long prayers, nor do we have meetings with short prayers. In our meetings we have both long prayers and short prayers. Hallelujah! We do not have an old religion, nor do we have a new religion. We only have the leading of the Spirit. We follow Christ and take Him as our wisdom. We have left religion, regulations, rituals, and methods. We have neither the old practices nor the new practices. We have Christ, we have wisdom, and we have the Spirit.</p>

 	<h2>Noise Words</h2>
 	<p>Common words, such as "and", "is", "but", and "the", also known as noise words, are bypassed in a search. The search string, the Spirit &amp; who, would result in an error since who, which stands by itself, is a noise word. The following is a list of noise words:</p>
	<p>$, a, also, an, and, another, any, are, as, at, be, because, been, being, both, but, by, came, can, did, do, each, for, has, had, he, have, her, here, him, himself, his, how, if, in, into, is, it, like, make, me, might, much, my, of, on, or, our, out, over, said, should, since, some, still, such, take, than, that, the, their, them, then, there, these, they, this, those, to, too, very, was, way, we, well, were, what, where, which, while, who, with, would, you, your</p>

<div id="myModalRanking" class="reveal-modal">
  	<h2>Ranking</h2>
  	<p>Rank is a value from <strong>0</strong> to <strong>1000</strong> indicating how closely a match scored or ranked against the original search string. Rank values are affected by the following factors:</p>
		<ol>
            <li><span>The total number of occurrences of the original search words/phrases in a portion of a book.</span></li>
            <li><span>Content that includes the search words in close proximity to each other are ranked above those that do not. Therefore, a portion of a book that has the search words in close proximity may have a higher ranking than another portion of a book that has a higher hit count but the words are not in close proximity to one another. Therefore, we also include a search word hit count for reference.</span></li>
            <li><span>The rank values are relative to each other. Therefore, it is not possible to interpret the RANK value as a percentage or group the rank values into high/medium/low ranges. Think of rank as a method to order the results for a specific search.</span></li>

 	<h2>Search Scope</h2>
 	<h3>Include All Word Forms</h3>
	<p>This option breaks out the search string into its individual words and generates all conjugations and declensions for each word in the search phrase. A search on the word, dwell, would search for dwell, dwelling, dwelling's, dwells, dwelt, and dwelled.</p>
	<p>There is no need to use ^ (inflectional search) or * (prefix search) when using the Include all word forms search scope.</p> 
	<h3>Specified Word Forms</h3>
	<p>This option searches for exact matches of the specified words or phrases used in the search string. Use of ^ (inflectional search) with a particular word in the search string will broaden the search for that given word in that all conjugations and declensions for that word will be searched. Similarly, use of * (prefix search) with a particular word in the search string will broaden the search for that given word in that all words with that prefix will be searched as well.</p> 
	<h3>Note</h3>
	<p>Common words, such as "and", "is", "but", and "the", also known as noise words, are bypassed in a search. A list of all noise words is as follows:</p>
