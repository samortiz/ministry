During this time of dispersion, Watchman Nee was burdened to published The Open Door, not as an official publication, but as part of his personal ministry to serve the scattered saints.</p><p> There were nineteen issues of The Open Door between September 1937 and September 1939. The Open Door resumed publication in 1948 under a new name, The Ministers. In addition to news about the co-workers and the churches, a column entitled "The Dynamics of Service," taken from a book of the same name by Paget Wikes, in Issue Nos. 7&mdash;13 and a single article entitled "The Worker God Is After in This Age" by T. Austin-Sparks in Issue No. 12 were also included. Since these articles were not written by Watchman Nee, they have not been included in Volumes 31 and 32.</p><p>With the exception of Issue No. 2, which is unavailable, all of the issues of The Open Door are included in Volumes 31 and 32 of The Collected Works. Issue Nos. 1&mdash;8 are contained in Volume 31, and Issue Nos. 9&mdash;19 are contained in Volume 32.</p><p>In Volumes 31 and 32 repetitive and inconsequential information was omitted, including addresses, lists containing the names of individual saints in transit because of the war, and the addresses of churches in various places. In some cases, repetitive announcements were also omitted. Efforts were made to retain the original headings even when the subsequent information was omitted and to designate the location of the omission.</p><p>In Volumes 31 and 32 there are also numerous Chinese names, both of places and persons. In order to help the reader distinguish between places and proper names, several general conventions have been adopted.</p><p>First, proper names have been presented in the traditional order of Chinese names, that is, family name first and personal name last. In many instances the personal name consists of two Chinese characters which appear as a hyphenated name in translation. For example, Watchman Nee's Chinese name is often translated Nee To-sheng. In order to distinguish between the names of Chinese places that also contain hyphens, the letter immediately following the hyphen has been lowercased in translation (for example, An Jing-tien, Bao Hsu-min, Chen Ke-san, etc.). As an exception to this convention, the more commonly known names of Watchman Nee's co-workers have been substituted for their Chinese names (for example, Witness Lee, Simon Meek, Philip Luan, Faithful Luk, K. H. Weigh, Ruth Lee, Phoebe Chang, etc.).</p><p>Second, in order to assist the reader in distinguishing between places and personal names, the letter immediately following a hyphen in the names of Chinese places has not been lowercased in translation (for example, Fu-Ching, Sien-You, etc.). As an exception to this convention, the spelling of the places that appear on the map of China in Volumes 1, 25, and 31 has been retained throughout Set 1 and 2. It should also be noted that many Chinese places also appear as just one word (for example, Foochow, Chefoo, Shanghai, Peking, etc.).</p><p>The names and places that appear in Volumes 31 and 32 will be consistently applied throughout the remainder of The Collected Works. Due to an editorial omission, the names and places in Volumes 25 and 26 do not always follow these conventions.</p><h1 class="title">ISSUE NO. 1</h1><h2 class="head4">(September 1937)</h2><h2 class="head1">AN OPEN LETTER</h2><p>To all the brothers who are partakers</p><p>of the gracious calling:</p><p>For years I have felt the need of a publication which could be used to communicate news of the work in all of the localities. A local newsletter belongs to a particular locality and serves a particular church. But we need a paper for the intercommunication of news which will serve all the localities, that is, one which will serve the work. The name, The Open Door, was chosen much earlier, and I had hoped that others would be raised up by the Lord to bear its responsibility. This was my hope because, on the one hand, there is the need, and on the other hand, my special stand makes it impossible for me to undertake the task myself. If this had been undertaken by someone else, it would have been merely personal and done by someone who was gifted to do it. But if I were to do it, it would become official and would be based on my position. Therefore, in order to avoid this, I dared not move for years.</p><p>I never believed that this newspaper would be issued under this kind of circumstance, at this time, and in this place. Now I must do what I did not wish to do. However, please keep in mind always, brothers, that this is a personal ministry and not the instrument of any organization. If any co-worker or church in any locality is unwilling to see their news appear in this publication, please say so in order that none might be offended in this matter. But I do wish that I could receive news from all the localities so that those who are concerned for them could make intercession.</p><p>The original intention of my recent trip was to go on to England and America. I did not know why, but I kept being delayed on the way. After spending ten weeks in Southeast Asia, I still had not entered the Indian Ocean. While at Penang, I felt the Lord wanted me to return to take care of some work before proceeding on to England.</p><p>The emphasis of The Open Door is the gospel work in all the localities. It seems that now is the time that the door for preaching the Word is open the widest, and we pray that God would cause us to make use of this opportunity. In this publication we will print:</p><p>(1) Articles concerning the principles of the work.</p><p>(2) News of gospel preaching in all the localities.</p><p>(3) The addresses of the workers (the apostles) on the move.</p><p>(4) The addresses of the meeting halls of the local churches so that the brothers who are escaping the war might know where to meet.</p><p>(5) The whereabouts of the brothers (the disciples) in the Lord at every place in order that comfort might be given to those who are concerned for them.</p><p>We are now temporarily publishing at Gospel Court, Lane 1, Hsiao-Dong-Jia, Hankow. In the future we may move to Ch'ang-sha, though this is difficult to predict. Our correspondence address remains at Hankow until further notice.</p><p>There is still one further matter. Because the itinerary of the co-workers in the various places is continually changing, it presents a problem to those who wish to write them. We wish to serve the brothers in this matter. Anyone wishing us to forward their mail may send it to the above address, and it will be taken care of accordingly.</p><p>This publication is not for sale. We trust in God for the supply of its need. Peace be unto you.</p><p>Your brother,<br />Watchman Nee</p><h2 class="head1">FOOTSTEPS AT PERILOUS TIMES</h2><p>"Those therefore who were scattered went throughout the land announcing the word as the gospel" (Acts 8:4).</p><p>The Lord Jesus commanded, "You shall be My witnesses both in Jerusalem and in all Judea and Samaria and unto the uttermost part of the earth" (Acts 1:8). But until today, we are still in "Jerusalem"; we have not preached in all "Judea and Samaria" yet, much less the uttermost part of the earth. Because God's apostles and disciples were hesitant to move out, He used the hand of Saul to scatter them "throughout the regions of Judea and Samaria" (8:1). Then He raised up an apostle&mdash;Paul&mdash;who was truly capable of answering His commission. During this period of persecution "the word as the gospel" was announced (v. 4). On the one hand, they were running for refuge. On the other hand, they were spreading the word.</p><p>During the past few years our work has mainly centered around the coastal regions. None of the places in the inland regions have seen God's full testimony. Although some brothers have paid attention to the work in various places, most are bound to the work in a single locality. I believe that God allows the present war to go on for our benefit. I believe His strategy today is the same as in the early days of the church. For this reason, I believe that we should produce the same result today as in those early days. I would speak as a brother and would suggest the following things:</p><p>(1) We all know that the church is local and that its administration and work are local. This is the time for the apostles (the workers) to turn the administration and work over to the local churches and for the local brothers to take up the responsibility of the local work and administration.</p><p>(2) Now is the time for the apostles to spend more time to labor in the inland regions. We should not have the concept that we must hold on to the coastal cities and go through tribulation with the brothers. We should realize that we are not running away from the tribulation; rather, we are going forth to preach the word. Actually, going to the inland regions under the present circumstances is more difficult and more uncertain than before. But we should trust in God rather than men, knowing that our provision and protection is from heaven. Those who do not look to God genuinely and absolutely are not qualified to work for Him.</p><p>(3) The responsible brothers in the various localities should remind the brothers in dispersion that they should not set their eyes too much on the war. During this time they should spend more time to preach the gospel and establish churches, just as Philip did in the region of Samaria. While it is true that the apostles should move out, it is also true that the disciples should move out.</p><p>I personally believe that God will use this war to expand and increase the sphere of His work. May our prayer be correspondingly deeper!</p><p>Finally, a word of reminder: Our urgent need is the preaching of the gospel and the establishing of local churches. We are not here to exhort others to leave the denominations. Those who pay attention only to the matter of denominationalism are not our brothers; they are not our co-workers and are not qualified to be our co-workers.</p><h2 class="head1">FOOTSTEPS OF THE CO-WORKERS</h2><p>Brothers Chang Kwang-rong, Ho Yueh-chiao, and Chou Shing-yi and Sisters Chang Chi-nien and Liu Hwei-fen are all in Shanghai. [Address omitted]</p><p>Brother Witness Lee and Miss Peace Wang worked in Tai-Yuan, Ho-Tsin, and Chu-Ou in Shansi province. They are probably in Hou-Ma Town now.

Their difficulties can be expected but cannot be felt unless one is actually going through the same trauma. When the saints in Judea were suffering calamities, Paul exhorted the churches to make special offerings on their behalf (1 Cor. 16; 2 Cor. 8&mdash;9). Indeed, your abundance should be "for their lack that their abundance also may be for your lack," for the divine principle is: "He who gathered much had no excess, and he who gathered little had no lack" (2 Cor. 8:14-15). May God grant us the grace to dispense grace to others.</p><p>At that time there was Titus. Today we have our Titus also. I have obtained the consent of Brothers K. H. Weigh and Lan Tsi-yi to serve as the receivers for such a fund. Their addresses are as follows: [Addresses omitted]</p><p>I will join with these brothers to distribute such a fund faithfully for the benefit of the brothers and the glory of God.</p><p>A servant of Christ,<br />Watchman Nee<br />September 19, 1937</p><h1 class="title">ISSUE NO. 3</h1><h2 class="head4">(P. O. Box 84, Hankow, January 1938)</h2><h2 class="head1">NEWS CONCERNING THE WORK</h2><h2 class="head2">A Letter from Hse Jung-jieh, Yunnan Province</h2><p>Brother X:</p><p>I left Tsinan the day you came to Hankow. I did not receive this news until I arrived in Hong Kong. I had to go to Canton for my passport, and after I returned from Canton to Hong Kong, I was sick for over ten days. This is the reason I did not write to you to relate everything to you sooner. I apologize and regret this very much! After we left Hong Kong, we had a peaceful journey and did not suffer any loss at Haiphong. Thank the Lord! My whole family, together with Sister Chen Hwei-sien and Brother Ma Mu, waited for our visas for five or six days in Ho-Kou. My family and Sister Chen arrived safely in K'un-ming on November 4. The Chou brothers are British subjects and were able to arrive a few days earlier. Brother Ma is still in Ho-Kou. A letter of certification has been sent, and perhaps he will be in K'un-ming by the ninth. Brother Hu Yi-min is still here. He does not want to remain here any longer; he will return home soon. My family wants to go with Brother Hu. I hope that I will see you so that I can be instructed concerning my future and the way I should carry out the work. I wonder when you will come? I hope very much that you will inform me soon.</p><p>I came to Yunnan this time because I need the help from Brother Hu. Moreover, I see clearly that my family should reside at Yeh-Ji where Brother Hu's family is. Brother Hu and I can then go ahead into Sikang and work there. Presently, I think we should establish a base at Yeh-Ji and move out from there. Later, if brothers and sisters come to work at Sikang or Tibet, they will find it less unpleasant, and they can work with peace of heart. Therefore, I shall go into Sikang from Yunnan. Going from Szechuan would mean greater hardship. Going from Ch'eng-tu to Ba-Tang would take more than a month. The trip would be inconvenient, and the expense would be more than what is required to go from Yunnan. Furthermore, both the people and the geography of Sikang are unfamiliar to me. Verbal communication will be difficult, and it will take a while to actually enter in. Therefore, I have to travel with Brother Hu so that I can learn Tibetan before I labor in Sikang. It has been very clear to me that the Lord has given me a great burden to work in Sikang and Tibet. But I am very weak. I feel incapable of bearing so great a burden and am not worthy of such a task. But the Lord has been dealing with me for a year and caused me to count the cost. I am truly a slow obeyer. May the Lord enable me to be more obedient to Him. Now I only know that as He calls, I will go. I do not know anything else and continue to look unto Him. If you come to Yunnan, Brother Hu Yi-min has requested that you purchase and bring two irons (for ironing clothes).</p><p>Everything is fine here, even though the catastrophe inflicted upon the nation has sent many people here. The cost of living has risen three or fourfold, and it is not easy to rent a dwelling. The Lord's more abundant grace is indeed needed so that He may receive the glory. The brothers and sisters and Brother Weigh's whole household are fine. Please do not worry. Please greet Sister Lee and Sister Chang. I shall stop my pen here. Peace be to you.</p><p>Your brother,<br />Jung-jieh<br />November 7, K'un-ming</p><h2 class="head2">Recent Status of the Work in K'un-ming,<br />Yunnan Province</h2><p>Brother X:</p><p>Both of your letters have been received, and I have been well informed of everything. Brother Hsu (with family), Brother Hu, and Brother Ma (who went there for business&mdash;Editor) departed on the fourteenth of this month for their first trip to Yeh-Ji. Yesterday I received their letter from Shakwang (the last bus stop), reporting that they had been safely led by the Lord all the way. Soon they should go on to Yeh-Ji. The Lord has started the good work Himself, and people have been saved into the Lord's name in the church here. Ever since I came to Yunnan, I have separated my personal life and work from the work of the local church. Every Lord's Day afternoon I preach the gospel at the Women's and Children's Hospital. The local church preaches the gospel every Wednesday evening. The director of the hospital has allowed us to use his facility for gospel preaching. Now the assembly has rented an appropriate place for the meetings, involving a monthly rent of twenty-five dollars and a security deposit of one hundred dollars. Every Thursday evening the church here conducts a Bible study meeting on the subject, "Christ and Him Crucified," and I bear much of the responsibility. In order to edify and strengthen the brothers and sisters, I plan to hold a special Bible study meeting soon. Thank the Lord for drawing a group of brothers, sisters, and sinners to hear His gospel. There were about fifty to sixty people in the Bible study and gospel meetings. Brother and Sister X have made much progress, fervently loving the Lord. The elder Brother Chou's wife has accepted Hueichen Hospital's invitation to be a resident physician there. The younger Brother Chou has not yet decided what he will do. The elder Brother Chou is doing some gospel work here for the time being; his wife is especially good in working with individuals. Brother and Sister Lin are also making progress in the grace of the Lord.</p><p>According to my latest observation, there should be a base for the work in K'un-ming. There is the real need for more workers to pioneer the work in the surrounding regions. I plan to go to the towns and villages along the railroad and highway in order to labor there next spring. Thank the Lord, I have met a young man, Mr. Chou Bao-jian, here. He studied two years at X school, and he is very much one with us. He is a native and has a gift for gospel preaching. He is very clear concerning his calling. From my many conversations with him, I know that he is a good brother. Mong-Tze is his hometown, and now he lives in K'un-ming. He often comes to the meetings. May the Lord lay hold of him. I have asked Brother Chen Ho-seng to bring you this letter. Brother Chen works with the radio in the airline company. He is a good brother and is very much acquainted with Mr. Wang Ming-dao. I very much hope that you and Sister Lee can come here to discuss how we should develop the work in the inland. Please cable me when you can come. Without further words, I greet you reverently.</p><p>Your brother,<br />K. H. Weigh<br />[Address omitted]</p><h2 class="head2">Hope for the East Fukien Region,<br />Lo-Yuen, Fukien Province</h2><p>Mr. X, my brother in the Lord:</p><p>You may have already received my previous letter. May the Lord bless you according to His promise. On the fourth of November I arrived at Lo-Yuen from the Lian River. After the meeting at Lo-Yuen, the Lord willing, I shall travel to Ning-Teh, Foo-An, and Shia-Pu. In the east Fukien region, the X denomination is predominant. But if it is the Lord's will, there is hope for some building work in the future. God led me to come here to gather the building material. Although the majority of the people know my standing, the leaders have gladly received me because I have caused no turmoil in their midst. Though the eastern part of Fukien province is politically unstable, we still have the peace in the Lord to labor on. Finally, I hope for your constant supplication. In a rush; peace to you in the Lord.</p><p>Your brother,<br />Chen Bi-yin<br />November 6<br />[Address omitted]</p><h2 class="head2">The Pioneer Work at Fu-Ching and Dong-Jang, Fukien Province</h2><p>Dear Brother X, greatly beloved in the Lord:</p><p>May the Spirit of the Lord doubly fill you, amen. I am grateful to the Lord that in this extraordinary time of affliction in the world, we are still lying calmly beside the brook of Cherith in Christ. Hallelujah! He is ever unchanging. Though the floods overflow, He still sits as the King. Under His wings we receive every new blessing. Truly blessed and memorable is our Lord forever! Amen. Thank the Lord for leading Brother Bin-shi to pioneer the work at Fu-Ching and Dong-Jang. The Holy Spirit has confirmed the gospel preaching with signs and wonders. More than ten households already have produced fruit of repentance and burned their idols. I also went to Dong-Jang after he had worked and saw the glory of the Lord. Praise the Lord. May glory be to Him! Amen. Dong-Jang is one of the five towns of Yung-Yi, ten miles from Hong-Luh and twenty-five miles from Yung-Tai and Yi-Du. It is the beachhead for the preaching of the word and for outreach into inland regions. We have rented a house and purchased the benches. Soon there will be baptisms and the breaking of bread. This is the time for the preaching of the gospel because the Holy Spirit is still saving souls there. Thank the Lord that when we are persecuted in Jerusalem, He opens the door for the word to go out in Samaria and sets our footsteps free. Truly the Lord is returning soon. There will be a great revival in the last days. Lord, in these days may You revive Your work! Amen.</p><p>We have rented a meeting hall in Sien-You but have not yet started the breaking of bread to remember the Lord. Many are saved in Sien-You, and there should be those who will keep the Lord's name to the end. The Lord willing, we will go ahead with everything in Sien-You. Brothers Ke-san and Tse-chung are both well and serving the Lord at Pu-Tien. The coastal regions in Fukien are well. Brother Fang Shi-rong, the responsible brother in Han River, has contracted tuberculosis. Please pray for him. Please pray also for me. How is your physical health, my brother? I remember you often. May the Lord grace and bless your family (2 Cor. 12:9; Heb. 12:2; Hymn #121).</p><p>Your brother,<br />Chen Jai-seng<br />November 10<br />[Address omitted]</p><h2 class="head2">Letter from Brother Chen Jeng-fan,<br />Foochow</h2><p>Mr. X, my brother in the Lord:</p><p>It has been a few months since we parted in Canton. Recalling our discourse there and reflecting on it today, I still savor its taste. Not long after our farewell, I left Canton and arrived at Foochow via Hong Kong, Swatow, and Amoy. After a brief conversation with the brothers, I left for the city of Yung. After working there for more than a month, I left again for the co-workers' meeting in Chuanchow. I had planned to work at Sien-You after the conference in Chuanchow, but a letter from the brothers in Foochow urged me to promptly return to take charge of the newly rented hall at Tai-Jiang-Xun. Honoring their wish, I consented without hesitation. I arrived in Foochow on the fifth of July and have been working until this day. In the past four months, in spite of the grave political condition, by God's grace the work has never ceased. Every night we see the working of the Holy Spirit. More than X people have signed their name upon believing. Although one cannot say they all are genuine, there is a good number among them who have a good testimony. Furthermore, among those who believe, the majority are from Yah-Mei-Jou, Jung-Dang-Hou-Jou, Jung-Ting-Jie, Chang-Hsia-Jou, and the nearby riverside regions. Most of them are workers of industry or commerce. Since they have no relationship with the denominational Christians, this work is a pioneering one. If a new work is to commence in the future, these ones can be considered the basic members. Recently, because of the need of the circumstances, the edifying work has started; there are now meetings in two places, with the breaking of bread and other work going on without conflict. The situation is very good. I am concerned about how they will go on in the future. If you have any foresight in this matter, I hope to receive your instructions.</p><p>Regarding the work here, I feel that we are short in several areas: (1) The meeting hall is too small and can only accommodate one to two hundred people; (2) there are too few brothers who can take responsibility directly; (3) being alone and weak, I may not be able to continue for a long stretch of time. Please beseech the Lord to raise up more responsible brothers and workers. Pray also for me so that I may be freed from living by Hagar's bottled water and may enter into the realm of living springs. How is the recent situation in Hankow? Please greet Brother Lan for me. Here we feel no impact of the war, all walks of life remain calm, and work continues as usual. In addition, my mortal frame is as healthy as ever. The Lord willing, I hope to see you soon that I may be taught and benefited. Brother Je-dun has been laboring in northern Fukien recently. Brother Bi-yin has gone to eastern Fukien. Brother Chun-geng is again visiting the brothers in Yu-Si. Brother Jai-seng has returned to Han River. Sister Shu-min is carrying out a two-week edifying meeting for the women here. Soon she will go to Fu-Ching and then to southern Fukien. Brother Chiu's whole household is fine. Brothers Shih and Kwang-hwa continue their business as usual. Brother Tien-yiang got married at Pu-Tien last month, and now he works at Shieho Hospital. Sister Soon Shi-jiang, having left Chai-Jing, has decided to wholeheartedly serve the Lord. Presently, she is staying temporarily at Brother Wilson Wang's house; her future has yet to be determined. Sister Peace Lu has left Kutien Hospital. She is also waiting for the Lord's leading. Sister Li Shiu-yi has rendered much help to the work in the gospel hall. I will write about the rest at a later time. May peace be with you.</p><p>A weak one in the Lord,<br />Chen Jeng-fan<br />November 9<br />[Address omitted]</p><h2 class="head2">Letters from Sister Bao Hsu-min, Foochow</h2><h2 class="head3">One</h2><p>Honorable X:</p><p>While I was en route to Wei-Yang from Kutien, I sent you a letter. I wonder whether you have read it. I arrived in Foochow on the fourteenth. Although I worked there for only six days, God blessed the people very much. They had begun their autumn harvest and were very busy. Nevertheless, their longing made them very enthusiastic, and they attended two to three meetings daily. Since the great harvest was approaching, we felt that it would not be good to continue our work, so we stopped the meetings and came here. The situation in the Tai-Jiang gospel hall is very good, and there are many new believers. I had planned to go elsewhere via Foochow, but some of the believers here wanted me to remain a few more days for the need of the new believers among the women. I also felt that I should render something to meet their need out of the love and compassion of the Lord, and I considered this as important as the work of personal evangelism. Therefore, a few women have gathered every afternoon at the Tai-Jiang meeting hall since the eighteenth. Sister Li Shiu-yi has been in charge of teaching them to read and recite hymns. I spoke to them on aspects regarding life. For the time being, we have decided to conduct this meeting for one week.</p><p>If the Lord opens the way, I am willing to go to the downstream region for a brief stay and then onward to southern Fukien. I also would like to stay at Ping-Yang for a longer time. I am now praying about this. Due to some difficulties that I encountered in seeking the Lord's path, I am afraid that I will have to stay here for a few more days. Perhaps I can also visit the rural vicinities around Foochow. The path before me is unclear; I can only proceed one step at a time. Although there seem to be many difficulties, I am very blessed within. I feel very strong and bold, and my heart is firmly secure and at rest. In spite of the work load, nothing seems to be burdensome and all is well. Although I have suffered from a cold recently, my living and work are not frustrated. Recently, Brother Lo Da-jun, from the meeting at Ching-Liu Township in western Fukien, heard that I had returned to Fukien and tried to invite me to labor in his place for some time. In order to go there from Foochow, one has to pass through four counties: Amoy, Changchow, Lung-Yen, and Lienchen. There are meetings in the first three places, but in Lienchen there seem to be only denominational churches. I was in Amoy and Changchow last year and also met the brothers who labored at Lienchen. If it is the Lord's will, there should be no difficulty (referring to the journey) for me to go there, except that I do not know who would go with me. Therefore, I am still praying. If I am assured that this journey is all gain and no loss, I will visit Yung-An on my way back (where I had been a teacher before), passing through Da-Tien County to Amoy and then to Ping-Yang. I have heard that Mr. Nee has returned to Shanghai. When you have a chance, please ask for his opinion concerning my path. I have planned, prayed, and waited, but I need to walk according to God's ordination. I wish to be more clear concerning all matters as befitting the proper principles. According to present circumstances, some can go with me, but I wish to do so according to God's way. Recently I read the newsletters and found out about the situations elsewhere. Truly, tribulation is a blessing in disguise. Thank the Father for gracing the brothers and sisters in other places!</p><p>This letter was written during three sittings. Some changes have occurred since I began it. The first page was written several days ago, while the first half of this page was written yesterday morning. It has been five days since the meetings in Tai-Jiang. The Lord really blessed the meetings according to the need. Some sisters still hope to carry on for another week, which may indeed happen. In the evenings I have a home-meeting (prayer-edifying) with some sisters in town. The house is borrowed; hopefully, we will not encounter any frustrations. Please pray for us and give us your comments. May peace be with you in the Lord.</p><p>Bao Hsu-min<br />October 23</p><h2 class="head3">Two</h2><p>Dear Sister X:</p><p>Through reading the local newsletter from Shanghai, I learned that you had gone to Hankow. Thanks be to the grace of the Father. I heard that there will be a co-workers' meeting in Hankow. May God bestow His grace and greatly advance His work through such a meeting, amen. Though I am here, my heart longs to be there. I had planned to go to western Fukien, but I was repeatedly delayed in going. Presently, I am still in Foochow sharing the same dwelling place with Miss Li Shiu-yi at the Gospel Hospital. I have been resting and having more contact with the academic circle. The activities of my heart, spirit, soul, body, and walk seem quite different from before. I wonder whether there is any danger in my endeavors. I hope very much to be taught by you face to face. For now, I feel stable and calm in heart, neither burning nor desperate. I can wait quietly for the Father's fresh grace. If you are familiar with my condition, please give me some guidance in writing. I would very much appreciate it. May peace be with you in the Lord.</p><p>Your sister,<br />Bao Hsu-min<br />November 20<br />[Address omitted]</p><h2 class="head2">News from Yen-Ping and Nan-Ya, Fukien Province</h2><p>Dear Sister X in the Lord:</p><p>It took me only two and a half hours to travel by bus from Jien-Ou down to Yen-Ping on the fifth of this month. Je-dun has come early to lead the meetings. I helped a little with the women attendees. Except for X, everyone was receptive. I saw how they longed for the truth and how they honored people like us. Nevertheless, I have told the Lord that I cannot do anything. The only thing that I can do is to offer myself into the Lord's hand for His breaking so that others might be fed. I thank the Lord for showing me that the work is the Lord's. When it is effectual, one should not be thrilled; and when it is not effectual, one should not be disheartened. One should just forge ahead according to the Lord's charge. Thank the Lord for leading me to live this sojourning life. May the Lord truly make me a wanderer to sojourn in this land with Him.</p><p>There is a certain missionary in Yen-Ping whose life is quite excellent and who is also desirous of the truth. She has a heart for the Lord, but she has been deaf for the past four years. I recall that Sister Hsiao Yu-yin was healed through a book written in English. Perhaps Brother David Hsu borrowed that book from someone. Please secure this book for me. Whether or not you can get the book, pray for this Western missionary sister. May the Lord be merciful to her and grant her grace to glorify His name. On the thirteenth of this month, I left Yen-Ping and took a one-and-a-half-hour bus ride north to Nan-Ya Village. This is the first place on the upper course of the river where the X denomination began its work. Most of the members of the denomination are spiritually dead. I have invited the women of the church to come together in the afternoon, and I have preached to them. Hopefully, some will understand salvation. May the Lord be gracious to us. After this, I will go to a village forty miles from here; from there I will return to Jien-Ou. I have entrusted my children to the Lord and am at peace and undisturbed in serving the Lord. Thank the Lord, my son Jia-en was sick, but he was healed the next day. Thank the Lord! I have received recent news concerning many brothers and sisters. May the Lord be gracious to you and may He empower you to serve Him. Peace be to you. Please greet Sister Chang for me.</p><p>Your sister,<br />Yu-bing, November 16<br />[Address omitted]</p><h2 class="head2">A Letter from Chen Ke-san, Fukien Province</h2><p>My Brother X:</p><p>Peace to you in the Lord. While I was in Pu-Tien, I received your letter. Thank the Lord for His grace. Since I was coming to Yu-Shi, I did not reply to your letter right away. May the Lord bless and remember you. May the Lord use Hankow as the Antioch of the inland regions. We look to the Lord to show us our future. The passport I had during the last three months is only good for traveling to Chuanchow, Sien-You, Fu-Ching, and Pu-Tien. Please continue to send The Open Door to Pu-Tien. Brother Tsai-seng went to Sien-You this time. I believe that he has already started the Lord's table meeting there. There are now over ten brothers and sisters who are ready to serve the Lord. Brother Shao-hwa has moved from Foochow to Sien-You to take up a teaching post. God's arrangement is always wonderful. Thank and praise Him. May the Lord use him in Sien-You. The Lord's grace be with you.</p><p>Brother Chen Ke-san<br />November 29<br />[Address omitted]</p><h2 class="head2">The Call of Lung-Yen, Fukien Province</h2><p>Dear sister in the Lord:</p><p>The region around Lung-Yen is at peace, and the work can still go on. However, I have felt quite lonely, and I am too weak to pioneer new regions. The meeting here needs much strengthening from men whom the Lord can use. (No one has been here before except Brother Nee, Brother Stephen Kaung, and Brother Chai Tze-chung, who were here last year. It is about two hundred miles inland from Amoy.) The need among the sisters is especially urgent. Most of the sisters in the meetings are uneducated, and there are very few sisters who can render the ladies any help. Please remember this work in your prayer. Greetings to you in the Lord.</p><p>Deng Tze-cheng<br />November 30<br />[Address omitted]</p><h2 class="head2">A Letter from Chai Tze-chung, Fukien Province</h2><p>Peace to my beloved brothers, Watchman and Tsi-yi:</p><p>Through reading The Open Door I have come to know a little about the situation among the brothers. Thank you. On September 22-24 Brother Ke-san, Jai-seng, and I prayed in one accord for the work in Foochow, Pu-Tien, and Sien-You. On the twenty-fifth Brother Tsai-seng went to Fu-Ching via Han-Chiang. I went to Sien-You from Pu-Tien, and Brother Ke-san conducted a Bible study in Pu-Tien. Brother Ke-san is still conducting a Bible study in Pu-Tien. Brother Jai-seng went from Fu-Ching to Dung-Jang. Brothers Chen Bing-hsi and Jung Chun-geng went with him. I heard that the Lord did some marvelous work there. After I left Sien-You, I remained in Feng-Ting for two days and returned to Pu-Tien on October 25. The Lord has been guiding us through all these endeavors, and we thank Him for His grace. Grace be with you.</p><p>Brother Chai Tze-chung<br />October 29<br />[Address omitted]</p><h2 class="head2">A Letter from Tang Shou-ling,<br />Shao-Shing, Chekiang Province</h2><p>Dear sister in the Lord:</p><p>The work around Shao-Shing has witnessed God's marvelous grace. The Lord has brought us safely through the meetings in Shao-Cheng, Hwa-She, and Wan-An-Chiao. Before us still lie Ji-Shan-Chiao, Shi-Ur-Dai (of the China Inland Mission), and Si-Shing. These meetings will be concluded in two weeks. We hope that the Lord will do greater things and that myself and all the brothers and sisters in various places will receive the benefit. Peace be to you.</p><p>Brother in the Lord,<br />Tang Shou-ling<br />November 1, in transit<br />(Since the war reached Wu-Kang, we have lost contact with Brother Tang's family.

I found out where you are only after receiving Brother Nee's open letter (in The Open Door) yesterday. Enclosed please find X dollars as an offering for the brothers who have lost their jobs through the fighting in Shanghai. The amount is small and serves merely to show the fulfillment of our duty. Please give my greetings to Brother Nee and thank him for not forgetting me. Although I live in Soo-Jia-Tsui, I sometimes travel to the two inland counties of Lian-Shui and Hwai-An. I also work in the region of Fu-Ning County. The past spring Brother Ji and I worked in Nan-Shu-Jou, Ling-Bi County, and Si-Jou in Anhwei province for a month or two. Recently, I have been working more often in the city of Lian-Shui. Please pray for this city. We are all well here. Thank Him for His grace. If you have the time, please tell us about your condition and the condition of your church. Peace to you in the Lord.</p><p>A young one in the Lord,<br />Chiu Ri-jien<br />[Address omitted]</p><h2 class="head2">A Letter from Chang Kwang-rong,<br />Shanghai</h2><p>Dear X:</p><p>I have received your letter of November 15, which was sent through Brother Yueh-chao. Since you and Brother Nee have left Shanghai, I have been going on according to the principle of separation between the church and the work. Last Lord's Day I delivered a message with much fear and trembling. I hope that Brother Tang Shou-ling and David Hsu will come to Shanghai, but they have not come, and I do not know where they are. Letters take a long time, and communication is difficult. I hope that you will pray for us. Please give my greetings to Brother Nee.</p><p>Brother Chang Kwang-rong<br />December 4<br />[Address omitted]</p><h2 class="head2">The Women's Work in the Refugee Camp,<br />Shanghai</h2><p>Sister X:</p><p>I received your letter yesterday from Mr. Ho. Presently, I am taking care of a women's meeting at the refugee camp in Jiao-Tung University. The number is around forty, and the condition of the meeting is quite good. I spoke for three days and then had to stop because of a cold. Some seminary students took my place and continued. We will see how the Lord leads us to go on. I have been using a series of hymns to teach the women to study the truth and to learn to read. I hope this series of meetings can last for a period of ten days. This is only the first attempt on my part to learn to do something.</p><p>There are about twenty thousand refugees in the Jiao-Tung University refugee camp. They are all local people living in and around Shanghai. The China Inland Mission workers have picked up part of the work from the International Relief Organization. They are preparing to have meetings for women and children, in addition to providing relief work. They expect me to render more help to the work there. This may be a good opportunity for me to do some work among the women. Recently, I have been reading the biography of Mr. Muller and have received much help in the matter of guidance and trusting in God. Since the Lord has put me on this frontline, I feel that I should follow those who are my seniors to go on in this one flow, even though I admit that I am far behind. Sister Roh-chen wrote and told us that Sisters Yu and Lee are still in Hong Kong because they have had difficulty entering Yunnan. I wonder whether you already know about this? Sister Ding Shu-shin left for Singapore a few days ago, and Sister An-sin went to Hong Kong on the same steamer. Peace to you in the Lord!</p><p>Sister Hwei-fen<br />November 27<br />[Address omitted]</p><h2 class="head2">A Letter From James Chen, Swatow</h2><p>My respected Brother X and Sister X in the Lord:</p><p>By the Lord's grace, I came to Swatow again on the nineteenth of last month and have been greatly encouraged through meeting the brothers and sisters here who are in tribulation. Although many of the brothers and sisters have scattered into the inland regions, it is a comforting thought to realize that they are all preserved in the Lord's peace. Recently, some heartbreaking events happened among us. Brother Liu Liang-wei passed away, and a few days ago Sister Sun Pei-fang also went to be with the Lord. Within a period of three months, we lost two precious believers, and our hearts were broken. It is surely excellent for those who have departed to be with the Lord, but the meeting in the Swatow cannot help but be affected by this. The door of the gospel around the Swatow and Chaochow regions is still open, and there is a calling from various places. I intend to go with a few brothers to labor in these places. But seeing the darkness all around and the coldness of man's heart, I wonder how a weak one like myself can meet the need. I ask you not to forget to pray for me so that the Lord can gain something, amen. Peace to you in the Lord.</p><p>Brother James Chen<br />December 3<br />[Address omitted]</p><h2 class="head2">A Letter from Brother Witness Lee,<br />Chefoo, Shantung Province</h2><p>Peace to you, dear X in the Lord:</p><p>Yesterday I received your express letter dated the nineteenth of last month. Thank you for your light concerning the apostles. The manuscript of the combined Issue Nos. 13 and 14 of The Christian magazine is ready and typeset. According to your instructions, I forwarded it by express mail to Shanghai the day before yesterday and charged Brother Ho Yueh-chao to send it to the printer. I wonder if mail from Shanghai will reach other places without difficulty. In this issue the "Notes on Scriptural Messages" column contains Brother Nee's message "God Interrupting Man's Speaking," the "Bible Study" column contains the message "The Work of the Holy Spirit in the Believers," and the "Footsteps of the Witnesses" column contains the account of "God's Vessel in the Welsh Revival," which was translated by Brother Stephen Kaung. All of these three articles are typeset in #3 characters, and the rest are in #4 characters. The "Testimony" column was contributed by Sister Chang Yi-hwa. This issue will cover the months of May through August. I will quickly put together another combined issue covering September through December. The Bible study here concluded last Friday. I had intended to visit Dong-Shiang this week but felt to delay visiting the village in order to put out more articles for The Christian and to have some fellowship with the brothers and sisters. A letter from Peking invited me to go there with my family, but I feel that I should work a little in east Tsinan for now. Thank the Lord that everything is peaceful and the meetings are as usual. Peace to you in the Lord. Greetings to Sisters Wang, Chang, and Tso.</p><p>Brother Witness Lee<br />December 9<br />[Address omitted]<br />(We have heard that it is difficult to send and receive printed material to and from Shanghai. Many readers of The Christian have moved because of the war, and there is no way for us to forward any mail to their new addresses. We are still considering whether we should print this issue now. If we publish it now, we intend to send it to the readers whose addresses are more reliable. We will send out the rest after we have received instructions from those who have moved&mdash;Editor.)</p><h2 class="head2">A Letter from Chang Yu-zhi, Chungking</h2><p>Dear Brother X in the Lord:</p><p>I received your letter a few days ago. I am grateful that you remembered my health! I have been here for two months already, but it seems as if the work has hardly started. I deeply feel that I am not qualified to work for the Lord. My spirit, soul, and body are all weak, and I suffer the loneliness of being without any co-workers. Without the grace of God and the prayer of the saints, I would not have been able to stand fast. Thank the Lord that since my arrival in Chungking, I have testified and preached the gospel to the Quakers, the China Inland Mission, Chiu-Ching Middle School, Shu-Teh Girls' School, and Kuan-Ren Hospital. The meetings were quite good, but there were no obvious results. Dr. X came to Chungking and spoke for a few days. A group of people were touched and signed their names. They became desirous of the truth. The local Christian Council officially invited me to be their speaker once a week. I took up their invitation for the gospel's sake. Last Saturday was the first time I spoke. In the near future I will borrow the chapel of X denomination and conduct a gospel meeting there; the date has not yet been set. I have been waiting for co-workers to come to Chungking to start together, but now I have given up such hope. I do not understand why I seem to have lost my ability to walk by faith. When I was in Tientsin, I was captured by the promise of not walking by my own wisdom but walking by the grace of God. I might have been somewhat foolish, but I was quite bold. I did not consider everything so much. I did not trust in my own wisdom, and everything seemed to be working for my good. Whenever I now try to do something, I pray much and seek God's will. However, the more I pray, the more confused I become, and the more I seek after His will, the more I am bewildered. Sometimes I put aside this endeavor and revert to my former way of "trusting not in my own wisdom but in God's grace." But even when I do this, there seems to be some kind of bothering within. There is no assurance in whatever I do. The result is constant regret and self-condemnation. Do you know where my problem lies? I have also thought that if I preach the gospel here and God saves a group of sinners, I will start a Bible study at my own place, and if God gains these ones, I will set up a local church. Perhaps this is my dream. But when I consider that the work is the Lord's and that I do not have to take charge of anything, I become more at rest. Our home meeting was held on the Lord's Day morning, but due to the fact that I have been frequently invited to preach in the denominations, we have changed the time of meeting to Sunday afternoon. Now I can preach in the denominations on the Lord's Day morning. I have told you of the condition of the work and of my own condition so that I can receive some guidance from you. I hope that you will pray for me. I have been physically tired the last two days; this letter was written on my bed. Please excuse my untidy handwriting. Peace to you in the Lord!</p><p>Brother Chang Yu-zhi<br />[Address omitted]</p><h2 class="head2">The Future of the Work in Szechuan</h2><p>Brother Chang Yu-zhi has not been feeling well lately. He needs some rest and our supplication. After Sisters Peace Wang, Phoebe Chang, and I arrived in Chungking, we met together to pray for the future of the work. We have decided to have a week of gospel meetings with the women in the Meditation Chapel of X denomination beginning January 3, 1938. We will have one meeting a day, and Sister Peace Wang will be responsible for the speaking. After the meetings, the Lord willing, Brother Yu-zhi will conduct another gospel meeting, which will be followed by Bible studies. After this, Brother Yu-zhi and Sister Peace Wang both feel to go to Ch'eng-tu.</p><p>Ruth Lee in Chungking<br />December 27</p><h2 class="head2">A Letter from a Western Missionary,<br />Wu-Yang, Honan Province</h2><p>Dear Sister X in the Lord:</p><p>I have received your postcard and the nine books. Thank you. Enclosed please find ninety-cent stamps for the price of the books. I recall the times that we were together in Hou-Ma seeking after the Lord. It was as if they were things of yesterday. How unforgettable are those times! Now I am in Honan and you are in Hankow. Thank the Lord that everything is in His hand. Thank the Lord that He has prepared a work in Wu-Yang. Today I started a girl's Bible class. The Lord willing, I will conduct such a class for two weeks, after which I may move on. The work of the Spiritual Work Band is sprouting, but everywhere there is much need of nurturing. Please pray for this. I hope that Rev. Yang Shao-tang can come. May the Lord lead him. What kind of light have you received in Hankow? Is there any work in Honan? When can we meet again? I hope that you will write to me when you are free. May the Lord be with you all the time.</p><p>Sister Rong Fu-tien<br />November 8</p><h2 class="head2">A Letter from Faithful Luk, Singapore</h2><p>Sister X:</p><p>I received your letter. Thank you. I have been in Singapore for a month, and I have been busy here and there without much achievement. The Lord loves me and opened the door of preaching for me. Thank Him! Miss Ding Shu-hin will arrive in Singapore next Saturday. Please pray much for us. I heard that Miss Chen Wan-ching is thinking about coming to Singapore. The brothers all hope that she can come. I also hope very much that she can come. I hope very much that X can send me a written copy of the light that you have received this time concerning the difference between the work and the church. (Brother Watchman Nee is busily editing the notes of the last Bible study in Hankow. Hopefully, we will be able to publish them as a separate book. For this reason, there is no need to send our brother a written copy&mdash;Editor.) Peace to you! Greetings to Sisters Chang and Wang.</p><p>Faithful Luk<br />The twenty-eighth<br />[Address omitted]</p><h2 class="head2">Letters of Philip Luan</h2><h2 class="head3">From Canton</h2><p>Dear Brothers Watchman, Yao-ju, Lan-seng, and Tsi-yi and Sisters Ruth, Peace, and Chi-nien:</p><p>Thank and praise the Father for His amazing grace. Through the prayer of the brothers and sisters, I have been protected to safely arrive in Canton. Brother Shuan Chang-ming came to the station to receive me. Everything is well. Please do not worry. Yesterday on our journey a few planes bombed the Jiang-Kou, Li-Dong, and Loh-Tong stations two hours ahead of us. The railway tracks were cut off in a few places and many supporting railway ties were damaged. Thank the Lord that we have not met with any danger. His deliverance and protection are complete. Praise His name! We met Mrs. Suen (Sister Zhu Ming-seng) this afternoon. All the brothers and sisters in Canton are protected by the Lord and are safe. Barring any unexpected circumstances, we will leave for Hong Kong tomorrow. I write this hastily and send you my greetings in the Lord. Please greet all the brothers and sisters in Wuhan for me. Miss Miao, Miss Tzo, Miss Mei, and Tze-sien all send their greetings to you.</p><p>Brother Philip Luan<br />December 10<br />[Address omitted]</p><h2 class="head3">From Hong Kong</h2><p>Sisters X, X, and X:</p><p>I arrived safely in Hong Kong at 3 p.m. on the eleventh. Some brothers and sisters went early that day across the harbor to wait for me at the pier. Had they not waited for me, I would have been in trouble, because I had a great deal of luggage and could not speak the local dialect. After I disembarked from the boat, all my belongings had to be inspected by the Customs Department. Thank the Lord for His grace. He has borne our burden. He has not only preserved us in peace on our journey but also granted us the rich enjoyment of the care and love of the brothers and sisters. This was the case in Wuhan, Canton, and Hong Kong. I witnessed the grace and love of the Lord. His love extends beyond all boundaries. This love is sweet and rich and something that the world can never know. Only the saved sinners can speak of its worth. Hallelujah! Thank and praise His holy name!</p><p>The work here has been much blessed by the Lord. Since the war started in Shanghai, many brothers and sisters have moved here temporarily from other places. Brother and Mrs. Chou En-kai, Brother Wang Dah-ho, and Mr. and Mrs. Chung Wen-jao are all here. There are also many brothers and sisters from Swatow and Amoy here. Thank the Lord that all those who have come have been protected by the Father and are safe. Yesterday I went with Mr. Nee Hwai-zhu to Macao to look for houses. I returned to Hong Kong from Macao that same day. I intend to send all the brothers and sisters to Macao who have come to the south for refuge. The cost of living in Macao is lower than in Hong Kong, and the rent is cheaper. The place is also quite safe. The house that we saw was at 12 Dong-Wang-Yang Street. It is a two-story house and the monthly rent is forty dollars. If this house were in Hong Kong, it would cost at least eighty to ninety dollars.</p><p>Macao really needs the gospel. While I was in Macao, I was deeply disturbed by the superstition and gambling going on everywhere. The prevalence of such activity has not been seen or heard of anywhere in China. Wherever one goes in Macao, he can see people burning incense and papers and worshipping demons. There are gambling houses at every corner. This is truly heartbreaking! I have heard that there are only two gospel missions in Macao, and that it is very difficult to have any evangelizing work. The power of the X religion is very strong and pervasive here, and it limits all other religious activities. I hope that the Lord will quickly send brothers and sisters to labor here. Please pray for this. Presently, Brother Joh-tze and Mrs. Ma Mu are living here. They are all fine. Praise His name. Peace to you in the Lord.</p><p>Brother Philip Luan<br />December 17</p><h2 class="head2">A Report on the Bible Study in Hankow</h2><p>There were only a few co-workers in Hankow this time. From November 22 to 28 there was a Bible study. Mr. Watchman Nee was responsible for the speaking. Sometimes he spoke twice a day. The subject was "Rethinking Our Work." There were eight messages: (1) God's Workers, (2) The Sending Out of the Apostles and Their Footsteps, (3) The Elders Appointed by the Apostles, (4) The Churches Established by the Apostles, (5) The Basis of Division and Unity, (6) Among the Workers, (7) The Workers and Finance, and (8) The Biblical View concerning Three Important Issues. (These are only the preliminary chapter headings. The book has not been fully polished, and there may be further changes to the chapter headings.) Although we have the notes, they are not complete. Mr. Nee is busily editing and polishing them and intends to publish them as a book. Although the content of this Bible study is similar to the one we had in Shanghai, as far as I know, the light that was released was clearer and the scope was more complete. We hope that through the prayers of many, this book can be published soon and that the co-workers can receive help from it. At times like these, we moan the passing away of those who have gone before us on the one hand and fear that we cannot catch up with what lies ahead of us on the other hand. May God be merciful to us, to the church, and to sinners so that we may redeem the time to follow the apostles' pathway. This may not make up for our lack of the past, but it may at least set our heart somewhat at peace.</p><p>Ruth Lee in Chungking<br />December 28</p><h2 class="head1">THE WHEREABOUTS OF THE CO-WORKERS</h2><p>Brother Philip Luan has moved to Hong Kong with his family.

After reading it, we were filled with unspeakable thanksgiving to our Father. At the same time, we were also filled with shame, because we have remembered our sisters so little. I can only ask the Lord to forgive us for the past and to lead us on in the future. I will now report a little concerning the matters you raised in your letter. Sister Chao Jing-tze has fled from Sung-Jiang to Zhu-Sin-Sung Paper Works of San-Fang-Kou in Li-Shui, Chekiang province. Thank God for preserving her. Sister Yu Fang-rue has returned to Shangtung. Sister Yin Hsia-chin is still living one floor above the meeting hall and is not in any danger. Thank God that Sister Lu Zheng-shien has written to inform us that she is completely recovered.

Thank the Lord that more sisters are engaged in personal work and more have come to listen to our preaching now. The Saturday sisters' meeting is more lively than before, and the time has been changed to 4 p.m. The children's meeting has not started due to the lack of a suitable place.

Brother You-an is still in Shanghai, and his son is studying at Jung-Fa. Brother Kwang-rong's whole family is safe. During the recent war that broke out in western and southern Shanghai, all the brothers and sisters in the Lord were preserved in peace. No one was hurt. Even the blind brother, Peter Ho, and his whole family were not hurt. Some brothers have moved out of east Shanghai; they are also safe. Brother Chu En-seng and his family have not moved out yet, but we trust that they are safe. Han-jing and Neng-sheng are still in Shanghai. Gong-dah, Chu Chen, Chen Jie-yu's whole family, Pei En-rong, Liu Hwei-fen, the elderly Mrs. Wang, and Mr. and Mrs. Luh Tze-ming are safe in Shanghai. Brother Jin-tang has returned to Shao-Shing.

I have to ask the Lord to show me what position I should stand on and what gift I have been given in the Body of Christ so that I may be faithful to the end and so that I may not overstep or restrict the gift of the Spirit. X is still sympathetic to us and still has us in his heart. There is hope for him to turn. May the Lord accomplish the work of unity. Your prayer before the Father will certainly be remembered. Jin Dong-chu is working in Shanghai at present. Brother Wu Sen-rong is safe in Hangchow. My family has returned to Ju-jih's house.</p><p>Brother Ma Di-seng<br />October 25<br />(Brother Ma has left Hangchow now. His correspondence address is yet unknown.)</p><h2 class="head3">Two</h2><p>Dear Mr. X, my brother in the Lord:</p><p>Since I preached the gospel at the temples, my inward being has been more in darkness. I have no confidence about anything pertaining to the present situation, and I feel that a multitude of believers is being tested generally in faith. The gold has changed its color, but perhaps God will grant us faith that is more precious than gold. He has promised "the proving of your faith, much more precious than of gold which perishes though it is proved by fire." In another place He says, "God is mindful of sending woes to men." In another place He says that in the last days, "because lawlessness will be multiplied the love of many will grow cold." God is testing the believers to see whether they meet the standard of "cast down but not destroyed." In other words, He is finding out whether believers will pass the test when they are put through a certain environment. Formerly a life of faith was required only of the workers. Now every believer has to live by faith. It seems that my prayer has done nothing except bounce off a blank wall, but I still insist that I will find my way out through prayer. Concerning the condition of the meeting, Brother X has been most zealous. He goes with some other brothers to the Army Casualty Hospital and the Refugee Camp often to preach the gospel. He is also faithful in his material offerings. Greetings to you.</p><p>Yours,<br />Si Meng-yu<br />October 29<br />(We do not know where Brother Si has moved to now&mdash;Editor.)</p><h2 class="head2">Lan-Si, Chekiang Province</h2><p>Dear respected older brother X in the Lord:</p><p>Jia-Shing and Soochow have capitulated, and ninety percent of the residents of Hangchow have fled. Brothers Chiu and Ma, together with brothers Jun-dao, Ming-jin, Lin-guei, Fang-chen, and Chen-yi, have left. Their families have also been sent to various places up the river. Brother Chiu's family is temporarily staying in Jien-Deh and Brother Ma's family has settled in Ju-Jih. Hu's family and my family are now in Lan-Si. Ah-lai, my sister-in-law, will go to Chou-Jia-Pu. The mother of Huang Tsai-ching and Si's mother have gone to Ju-Jih also. Brother Hsu Tseng-rong has gone to Chou-Jia-Pu. Mr. and Mrs. Feng-tien have come to Lan-Si with me. Senior Brother Ruan Chi-yu had not left Hangchow as of a few days ago. Perhaps he has gone to Chou-Jia-Pu already; I have no idea about it. Senior Mrs. Chang has taken the little ones in Ruan's family to Chou-Jia-Pu. Hou-ran went to Chang-Kou from Lan-Si yesterday and resumed classes at the new address in Hwei-Lan. We have given written notice that we will give up our rented meeting hall as of December 1. The furniture does not need to be moved out yet and can still be kept in Dong-Chie Road. Eventually we may have to pay a little storage fee. Brother Ma's and my belongings have been placed in storage already. We do not have time to move out Sister Miao's and your belongings. We are retreating with the very limited amount of money we have, and our future living is in the Father's hand. The business in the company has stopped, and in a few days we will gather together in Jien-Deh to consider any further move. My wife gave birth to our sixth child about fifteen days ago. Now I have two boys and four girls. May the Lord be gracious to us. Please keep us posted of your whereabouts. Peace be to you.</p><p>Your younger brother,<br />Yang-deh<br />November 23<br />[Address omitted]</p><h2 class="head2">Two Letters from Ning-Po,<br />Chekiang Province</h2><h2 class="head3">One</h2><p>Dear Brother X in the Lord:</p><p>The church in Ning-Po has rented a place for its meeting. The address is 7 Kwai-Shu-Fang, Kwai-Shu Road, North Shore. Brother Hsu is living there now. Every Saturday afternoon at three o'clock we have the prayer meeting. On Lord's Day we have a gospel meeting at nine o'clock. Due to the war, we temporarily stopped these meetings. We have not, however, stopped the bread-breaking meeting held at three o'clock on the Lord's Day. There are only a dozen or so brothers and sisters attending, and recently the number has decreased. But we understand that we are here to build up the Body of Christ and not to build up a meeting. We are all well through God's protection. Thank Him! Greetings to you in the Lord. Greetings to all the brothers and sisters meeting in Hankow under the Lord's name.</p><p>A weak brother in the Lord,<br />Yu Rong-fei<br />October 16<br />(Brother Yu has left Ning-Po by now&mdash;Editor.)</p><h2 class="head3">Two</h2><p>Sister X:</p><p>I did not receive your postcard dated November 16 until the twenty-sixth. Thank you for remembering me in the Lord. From the local newsletter in Shanghai, we learned of your move to Hankow. May the Lord preserve you in peace. We moved from Ning-Po to the villages for refuge on the fifteenth because planes bombed the train station of Ning-Po on the twelfth. The station is very close to my home, and my whole family was frightened. The bombing shattered and damaged over a hundred buildings and killed over a hundred people. We have been preserved in peace according to the Lord's promise. Presently, the table meeting has stopped. In Chen-Po-Du we have meetings on the Lord's Day afternoon where we pray and remember the Lord. Sister Yu-yin and her aunt, as well as senior Sister Chen, are all here. We should thank the Lord for the comfort He has provided us here in terms of clothing, food, and shelter. He is indeed our Shepherd, and we have no want! Sisters Ai-chuen, Wang Ho-yueh, and senior Sister Bi are scattered in the villages and are safe in the Lord. Brother Yu Rong-fei returned to the villages after the school suspended classes. Presently, we may be separated through earthly tribulations, but we look forward to the Lord's soon return when we will never be separated again in Him forever. What a joy that will be! Greetings to you in the Lord. Greetings also to Sister Peace and Phoebe. Sister Yu-yin asks me to send you her greetings also.</p><p>Sister Yu-hwa<br />November 28<br />[Address omitted]</p><h2 class="head2">A Family Letter to Sister Hsieh Jing-wen, Shao-Shing, Chekiang Province</h2><p>Dear Jing-wen:</p><p>In the future when you write to me you should mail to: Hwa-Ying Pharmacy, Dah-Shang Bridge, Shao-Shing. You should not mail directly to Tsao-Miao Lane. I have decided to move to Chou-Shan. There are brothers there who can accommodate us. My family will not be going alone; quite a number of sisters are going the same way with us. Personally, I will still travel in and out of the city and will be back and forth. Most of the time I will be in the Hwa-Ying Pharmacy. I am saying this only in anticipation of change. Whether or not we will put this into effect depends on the God in whom we trust and who is guiding our footsteps. May the loving Father and the living God spare us from fleeing for refuge. Peace to you.</p><p>Your father (Hsieh Tse-yuen)<br />November 17<br />[Address omitted]</p><h2 class="head2">Chou-shan Village, Shao-Shing, Chekiang Province</h2><p>Dear and respected Brother X in the Lord:</p><p>I have testified for the Lord in Nan-Sha and have spread the Lord's accomplished work on the cross to the men in the X hospital. Some of the soldiers have accepted the Lord Jesus Christ as their Savior. The meeting in Chou-Shan Village is going on as usual; there is no change in any way. God has been guiding His children on with miracles. He is worthy to be praised. We should shout Hallelujah! Please give my greetings to the brothers and sisters from various places when you see them. May the Lord strengthen you, and may His glorious light be manifested through you. May glory, kingdom, and power be unto Him forever and ever, amen!</p><p>A weak brother in the Lord,<br />Ma Ting-chi<br />November 12</p><h2 class="head2">Nan-Sha, Shao-Shing, Chekiang Province</h2><p>Dear X:</p><p>It has been a month since we parted in Shanghai. I trust that God has been preserving you in peace on your journey to Hankow. I returned home from Shanghai on the third of this month. My intention was to take care of my family business a little and then go back to Shanghai. But during those few days the war broke out and no train or steamer set off for Shanghai. Now my hometown Nan-Sha is also threatened by the war. I have not decided where to go yet. I want to go to Hankow or Ch'ang-sha but do not have enough money. Some brothers and sisters in Nan-Sha are faced with the same situation. There is no place for them to escape. If the situation becomes more tense, I intend to flee to the mountains. Please pray for this. I am afraid that mail and telegrams will also be cut off after a few days. If you write to me, please send it to Kao Yun-seng of Dang-Shan, Shao-Shing. Peace to you in the Lord.</p><p>Brother Chou Jin-tang<br />November 26<br />(This letter arrived on December 23, and it is too late to reply. However, we have received a letter from Shanghai that says that Brother Chou has perhaps returned to Shanghai via Ning-Po&mdash;Editor.)</p><h2 class="head2">Ping-Yang, Chekiang Province</h2><p>Brothers Watchman Nee and Chang Kwang-rong<br />in the Lord:</p><p>Since the war broke out, we have been thinking of you all the time. We can only pray for you before the Lord and ask that He be with you and sustain you, amen. Presently, Wen-Chow, Ping-Yang, and Tai-Shun are all safe. Spiritually, however, we are dry and short of edifying. We earnestly desire that you would be able to come and dispense to us what God has commissioned to you. This has been our eager expectation for many years. We wonder whether you have considered us in your schedule (2 Cor. 1:15-16)? We have forwarded a little sum to Brother Lan Tsi-yi. It is for the brothers and sisters in Shanghai who are suffering from the war.</p><p>Your brothers and sisters,<br />Bao Chung-shian, Tze-jing, Tso-shien,<br />Dao-huang, Hsu-ching, Lin-shiang<br />November 22<br />[Address omitted]</p><h2 class="head2">Ch'iao Tun Men, Ping-Yang, Chekiang Province</h2><p>Dear respected Sister X in the Lord:</p><p>Since the beginning of the war, both the south and north parts of the country have been greatly affected. I have been remembering the brothers and sisters living in the war zone day and night. A while ago I received the Shanghai local newsletter as well as The Open Door from Hankow and realized that the Father has bestowed wonderful grace to preserve us all in peace. This is more than I had expected. Thank the Lord! We have a little sum of money which we are forwarding to Shanghai. I wonder how the saints are doing there and how the meetings in Shanghai are. Have the saints who are relocating to Szechuan and Hankow arrived safely? Our locality lies on the eastern sea coast and is not a strategic place for the military. Presently, little has been affected here. Our only assurance will be when the Prince of Peace appears soon. The work in the few meetings around Ch'iao Tun Men is being taken care of by the two Wang brothers; I am merely their helper. Presently, there is a lack of responsible ones; the number of meetings and attendants has gradually increased. It is a pity that the shepherding work has been absent. Dear brothers and sisters, we are often driven by the circumstances around us. Although we are far away from each other, we hope that our prayers for one another will be all the more earnest so that we may not commit any errors. I wish you victory and peace in the Lord.</p><p>A brother in the Lord,<br />Chang Wu-seng<br />November 10, after recovering from illness<br />[Address omitted]</p><h2 class="head2">Yu-Si, Fu-Ching, Fukien Province</h2><p>Dear Brothers Nee and Lan in the Lord:</p><p>Peace to you in the Lord! In 1934 the Lord's servants Faithful Luk, Chen Jai-seng, and Chen Ke-san came here for some pioneering work. The next winter the Lord's meeting was established. Thank the Lord! Now there are over forty brothers and sisters breaking the bread. The responsible brothers are Lin Wei-tze (who has since left the country), Lin Shao-liang, and Chai Yi-sung. After we received the baptism of the Holy Spirit, God performed many miracles and works of wonder and has confirmed the words that have been preached by saving many sinners.</p><p>Brothers in the Lord,<br />Lin Shao-liang, Chai Yi-sung<br />November 26<br />[Address omitted]</p><h2 class="head2">Da-Chien-Chun, Kutien, Fukien Province</h2><p>Dear Brothers Watchman Nee and Lan Tsi-yi in the Lord:</p><p>I have received The Open Door which you sent. Thank you. May the Lord fill you up in everything. We thank the Lord because our meeting here has witnessed His grace. Presently, we have eight brothers and sisters remembering the Lord. On Thursday evening we have our prayer meeting. We hope that you will pray much for us and for me in particular. The Lord has separated me from among the sinners. Thank Him! Now I can testify for Him. May the Lord glorify His own name at this end time, amen. Please write to me often. May you have more joy.</p><p>Brother in the Lord,<br />Wu Ju-shan<br />October 5<br />[Address omitted]</p><h2 class="head2">Pu-Tien, Fukien Province</h2><p>The following is a list of local churches around this area and their addresses:</p><p>(1) Han-Jiang (Brother Fang Shi-rong is the responsible one.

Presently, Sister Roh-chen is still in Chung-Shan. Since Mr. Kaung and Mrs. Nee went to Hong Kong, we continue to have meetings every night at my home. I use Bible Studies for Beginners to teach the attendants. Mr. Kaung sent this book to me from Hong Kong. There are now thirteen people who are clearly saved. One of the brothers named Wu is working at my uncle's shop. After he received the Lord, he was filled with joy. Although others scolded and mocked him, he did not fight back; rather, he sang hymns.</p><p>Those in Sha-Yung Village, like my sister-in-law, her mother, and the two Mrs. Mas, cannot come to our meetings in the evening. For their sake, we have meetings every Tuesday and Friday afternoon from 1:30 p.m. to 2:30 p.m. at the house of my sister-in-law's mother. Bible Studies for Beginners is also used for these meetings. Village folks cannot read too well, but God has blessed this book. They have received much help from this book. May the Lord bless His own work and do great things here in this locality. Please pray for us. Thank and praise the Lord that He has been merciful to my family. All of Satan's work in my family has failed. My father's illness has gone, and my responsibility at home has been reduced. I have received much of God's grace during the past year. I am most unworthy, but God has placed me here to learn the lessons that I should learn. I have not learned them well, and I have often failed and faltered. I have failed Him. I am wicked, yet His love towards me has never changed. I cannot help but thank and praise Him! There are many things that I do not understand, and there are many things that I have to learn. Please instruct me as to what my future should be. I have very little experience in spiritual things, and I hope that you will give me much help and instruction. In Chung-Shan many people like to listen to Mr. Kaung's preaching. If he comes again, I am sure that many more will turn to the Lord. May the Lord lead him to come again so that many will receive God's salvation. Peace to you in the Lord! Greet Sister Phoebe Chang!</p><p>Sister Kuo Hai-jen<br />December 1<br /> [Address omitted]</p><h2 class="head2">Ping-Du, Shantung Province</h2><p>Dear X, God's faithful worker:</p><p>Peace to you in the Lord! I have not been able to talk to you face to face for two years, but spiritually I have always been with you. Last spring I was sent by the Lord to preach the gospel to over twenty counties in Shantung province. Since the military invasion in northern China in July of this year, soldiers have been everywhere. It has become difficult to preach the gospel in these places. Fifty to sixty percent of the businesses and residents in Yien-Jie have moved to other places. Most of the schools have suspended their classes. I took my family and moved to Ping-Du. I intend to go to the south and thought about starting a milk store. If there is a suitable place and if the almighty God permits it, I will move there for a few years. I hope that you can reply to my letter. Peace to your whole family. Please give my greetings to the brothers and sisters.</p><p>Tsou Sing-wu<br />[Address omitted]</p><h2 class="head2">Jiao County, Shantung Province</h2><p>Dear Sisters Ruth and Phoebe in the Lord:</p><p>Hallelujah, praise the Lord! He has heard my supplication and provided a brother to travel with me. He is Brother Tseng Jin-yi. He is going to Hwang County through Tsingtao and Chefoo. On the seventh we boarded the boat; Sister Cheng Feng-yi and Brother Shen sent us on our way. It was raining hard, and it hurt me to see them laboring so much. I could only thank the Lord on the one hand and accept their love on the other hand. After I arrived in Tsingtao, I stayed at my sister's house. On the morning of the thirteenth, I took the train, got off at a little after 10:00 a.m., and took the bus at 11:30 a.m. At 1:00 p.m. I got off the bus, and I arrived home by 3:30 p.m. Thank and praise the Lord, we have seen His guidance and provision in everything. The Lord has graced me and my whole family. The Lord stopped my father through someone's hand from doing something improper. It has to do with some family affairs. Humanly speaking, my father was fully justified in bringing the matter to court. But the gracious Lord stopped this action through a visiting friend. After I returned home and saw my father, I told him what kind of stand a Christian should take. We all felt that it was the Lord who had stopped this course of action. I am so happy. Thank and praise Him! Although men sometimes believe in Him foolishly, He nevertheless grants grace to those who love Him, and He stops them from doing things that they should not do. His love is truly wonderful! Praise Him! I will write again later. Peace to you in the Lord.</p><p>Sister Yu Fan-rue<br />November 15<br />[Address omitted]</p><h2 class="head2">Two Letters Written<br />on a Journey to Ch'ang-sha</h2><h2 class="head3">One</h2><p>Sister X in the Lord:</p><p>It has been five months since we parted in Shanghai. Through the Lord's protection we have been kept in safety. Are you busy? May the Lord bless you. My sister Jing-shia and I left Shanghai on August 19 for Wu-Shing. On the twentieth we experienced bombing by airplane in Sung-Jiang. But the Lord protected us, and we escaped the danger. We spent about three months in Hsieh Village in Wu-Shing. The fighting was approaching, and we left for An-Ji before Wu-Shing capitulated. After some time we left and walked several dozen miles a day through mountains and hills for three days. We eventually arrived in Hangchow. We took the night train across the Chien-Jiang and passed through Shiao-Shan and Lin-Pu, arriving at Jin-Hwa and Lan-Si. The journey took us over land and water, and we had no rest on the way. As soon as we arrived in Ning-Po, we heard that Jin-Hwa had been bombed. Then we left for Nanchang with four brothers, including Brother Chu Wen-yao and Sister Shen Hwei-min and others (for a total of seven). We waited for the train at Chien-Tang and slept outdoors, suffering the sun's heat for seven days before arriving at Ch'ang-sha. The journey was long and dangerous, but we were protected by the Lord. Thank and praise Him! After we arrived in Ch'ang-sha, we heard bad news again. We will stay here temporarily and follow the Lord's leading. What is your opinion about the present political situation? Where would be the safest place for us to go? Please instruct us. Peace to you in the Lord.</p><p>A brother in the Lord,<br />Chang Jing-yuen<br />December 17<br />[Address omitted]</p><h2 class="head3">Two</h2><p>Sister Lee in the Lord:</p><p>Peace to you! I wonder whether you have received the letter I wrote you from Lan-Si? I stayed in Lan-Si for a short time and left with the Chang sisters and the four sons of Chu Kwang-hwa for Ch'ang-sha. Along the way we encountered many difficulties, but we experienced the presence of the almighty God. He led us through many difficult crises. We are full of thanksgiving and praise to Him! We are prepared to move on, but we would like to know whether the route to Szechuan or to Hong Kong is the safest. What is the way to get to these places? Are there brothers and sisters from Hankow planning to move to Hong Kong? Would they be willing to take us along by passing through Ch'ang-sha? Please pray for us. I am separated from my family and by myself in a strange place. Sometimes I experience unspeakable suffering. I can only pray for God to comfort me. I could never have imagined that I would be separated from my family this way. Fortunately, I believe in the Lord and can still find joy and peace in Christ. Peace to you in the Lord. Greetings to Mr. Nee and Miss Chang.</p><p>Hwei-min<br />[Address omitted]</p><p>By the time the above two letters arrived in Hankow, I had moved to Chungking. Brother Lan sent them to me via airmail. After I read them, I thanked God for protecting them on the one hand, and I remembered them much on the other hand. I have sent a letter back to them, but the mail takes time, and I have no assurance that they will receive it. Yesterday, I received a letter from Hankow that said that Brother Chu Wen-yao is waiting for a train to go to Hong Kong.</p><p>Ruth Lee<br />December 30<br />in Chungking</p><h2 class="head2">Recent News of Sister Ma Min-jen,<br />Kuling, Jiu-Jiang</h2><p>Sister X:</p><p>My illness has improved.

They will wait for Brother Suen to take them to Chi-Li. If the situation becomes critical, Brother Chu and his family will move to the village to take refuge for a while. Brother Luk and his family have returned to Hong Kong. Mrs. Wu intends to go to Yunnan or to Hong Kong. Sisters Wang Juh-ching and Hsu En-shiu have left for Ch'ang-sha, where they will wait for a train to go to Yunnan. Sister Chang Yueh-hwa, her mother, and Sister Chen Mei-buo will leave on the Min-Chuen steamer for Yi-Chang, where they will change boats to Hankow. Most of the brothers and sisters in Hankow have left. Peace to you in the Lord.

Mr. Nee had a hard time trying to get his train ticket and did not leave until the eighteenth. Sister Wang Juh-ching went to K'un-ming with Sister En-shiu's family. They are now in Ch'ang-sha. According to a letter from Sister Hsu, Sister Juh-ching went to Yunnan on the twenty-sixth. My whole family is waiting for a train to go to Kweilin. Mrs. Luh Yu-tang has gone to Hong Kong on a British battleship. Brother Yang and senior Mrs. Yang will also go also to Hong Kong by bus. Brother Liu Kwo-hwa will move to Chungking with the pharmaceutical factory tomorrow. Sister Bi-kuen will fly to Hong Kong with a patient of hers. Most of the brothers and sisters in Hankow, both the visitors and the local ones, have left. Presently, Brother Zhang is still here; Brothers Chou You-seng, Ju Ju-yao, Hu Lan-seng, and myself are also here. The Open Door can be mailed out completely by tomorrow. The post office will no longer accept anything printed in Shanghai or Kiangsu. Mr. Nee has taken two thousand copies with him and is mailing them to the brothers and sisters in Hong Kong, Shanghai, and other war-zones.

Chefoo, Peking, Tientsin, Tsinan, and regions in Chekiang are not in the war-zone, and I have mailed the magazine to them directly from here. Brother Chang will leave for the southwestern part of the country within a week. Brother Yuen left for Kwangchow the night before last.

My heart was truly rejoicing in the faithfulness of the Lord. Since the news came about the war in Shanghai, I have been praying earnestly before the Lord that He would preserve His children in Shanghai, northern China, and along the coast just as He has preserved His chosen people in the past. Sometimes I felt that the Lord touched me to fast and pray. Thank Him that every time I went to Him and committed you to Him, my heart was at peace. It is a pity that there will be so many refugees wandering in tribulation. It would be wonderful if some could seize the opportunity to preach the gospel to them.</p><p>Recently, I have felt that the Lord's coming will not be delayed. I have been considering my future, whether I should drop my teaching job to serve Him full-time or serve Him the same way I am doing. Of course, the best way is to walk according to the Lord's will. Please pray for this. Southeast Asia, like all other places, has the need for workers to go forth to be thrust into the harvest. Sister Fang Chiung-ying desires to come here, but she must have a job before she can have an entry permit. If she applies for a tourist visa (which is good only for six months), it will be much easier. If anyone wants to work, he or she must have another co-worker to work together with him or her. Because of the war, the price of rubber here dropped by fifty percent during the first half of the year. The school has announced that the New Year recess will start on December 15. The Lord willing, by then I will go to Sarawak (the capital) to preach the gospel. That place is very dark. I have indeed worked less this term than last term, but the school owes me quite a sum of salary. Please give my greetings to Sister Wang, Sister Chang, and many sisters whom I know (Isa. 41:10, 13; 28:16; 26:12; 12:2-3). The Lord's grace be with you.</p><p>Sister Hwang Bi-gwe<br />Evening, October 14<br />[Address omitted]</p><h2 class="head2">A Letter to the Sisters in Shanghai<br />from England</h2><p>Dear sisters in the Lord:</p><p>The purpose of my writing this letter is to tell you how much we have been praying for the brothers and sisters in Shanghai! You have been on our hearts and in our thoughts! Although I have not yet written to you, I have never forgotten about you. I think of you all the time. May this letter bring my love and prayer to you. The Lord is your life, and He will protect you under the shadow of His wings so that you will prevail over everything. Psalm 91 is indeed written for you! Is it not? I am now attending the co-workers' meeting in Scotland. Many of the attendants are the Lord's servants from various countries. The Holy Spirit released many profound messages through Mr. Sparks. How I wish that you could hear them! We hope that Mr. Nee can be here by the beginning of September. I hope that I can meet him in London and have him stay at my house. I cannot greet the saints one by one by name in this letter, but every one of you is most precious in the Lord. In the name of the Lord whom we all love, I greet you. We all share the same life in Him! This letter shows you the oneness that is in the Body of Christ. Although you are in China and we are in England, our spiritual life makes us one Body in Christ. May the Lord bless you and preserve you, and may He shine His light upon you now and forever! Please give my special regards to dear Miss Lee and the sisters who are staying with her. Greet the brothers in the Lord!</p><p>Your sister in the Lord,<br />Lai-en-shi</p><h2 class="head2">The Church in Ch'eng-tu</h2><p>Dear Sister X in the Lord:</p><p>Thank God that He has led Ju-ru (Mrs. Zhao) to Ch'eng-tu safely. Last night the brothers and sisters broke bread and remembered the Lord in my home. There were twenty-three people, with a few brothers and sisters absent. We have decided to meet every Thursday afternoon at four for prayer in two locations: Mrs. Shen's home and at Shi-Sheng-Tze. On the Lord's Day we have the general meeting at 3 p.m. for the preaching of the gospel and for meetings on the overcoming life. The place is at Mrs. Shen's house. From 6:30 p.m. to 8 p.m., we have the bread breaking meeting in my house. Brother Rue-tze conducted a conference at the West China University last Lord's Day with much blessing from the Lord. Please pray much for the meetings here so that the Lord would open the door of the gospel. The girl students at the university indeed need the gospel. Mrs. Shen's home is an excellent place prepared by God for this work. I hope that you can come soon. The house we rented is very spacious, and there is a place for you. Please inform me as soon as the Lord frees you to come so that I may meet you at the train station. How is Brother Chang Yu-zhi's illness? May we pray in one accord for him. May the Lord bless you. Greetings to Miss Lee, Miss Chang, Mrs. Yuen, Sister Hsieh, Mrs. Lee, Brother Chang, and Brother Keh.</p><p>Brother in the Lord, Zhao Rue-tze<br />Sister in the Lord, Zhao Ju-ru<br />December 26<br />[Address omitted]</p><h2 class="head2">A Letter from Lin Kwang-biao, Shanghai</h2><p>Sister X:</p><p>At the beginning of last month, I heard that planes bombed Ning-Po. Because my mother and my two sons were there, I had to leave Shanghai to see them. But after arriving in Ning-Po, the coastal regions were blocked off, and I could not return to Shanghai. Communication did not resume until three weeks later. Although the city is no longer as busy as it was before the bombing, the situation is much better than at the time of the bombing. Thank the Lord! Although my mother and my two sons suffered much shock, they are safe. They do not want to come to Shanghai, and they have decided to move to the countryside for now. Although this cannot guarantee their safety, it is nevertheless more peaceful than in the city. In the city there are air raid sirens every day; one does not find this in the countryside. On the third of this month I left Ning-Po for Shanghai and arrived in Shanghai on the fourth. All the brothers and sisters in Shanghai are well. Please do not worry. The number in the meeting has dropped greatly. Some have left because of their jobs; some have left because they lost their jobs, but God has preserved the brothers and sisters here. May the Lord be merciful to us, and may He grant grace to afford much opportunity for many to hear the gospel. The Lord's grace be with you.</p><p>Brother Lin Kwang-biao<br />December 8<br />[Address omitted]</p><h2 class="head1">A WORD ON BEHALF OF THE EDITOR</h2><p>(1) Mr. Watchman Nee has been busy in various places for the work. Presently, he is traveling between Hankow, Canton, Hong Kong, and Shanghai. In the near future he may go to K'un-ming or England. Therefore, beginning with Issue No. 3, I will take his place as the editor. Although Mr. Nee still bears the responsibility of this publication, I cannot shrink from any blame for any imperfections that may appear during this period of substitution.</p><p>(2) Since I have to take charge of this publication, and since the war has made conditions so critical, I will try my best to publish news about the work and about the church, beginning with Issue No. 3. We can only wait for a later date to publish articles on the principles of the work. The "Question and Answer" column will have to be postponed. If we receive any questions, we will save the answers for these questions for later issues.</p><p>(3) Beginning with Issue No. 2, we have used #5 characters. If anyone cannot read it because of poor eyesight, we hope that others can read it to him and update him this way.</p><p>(4) The whereabouts of the co-workers are limited to what we know. We advise the co-workers to tell us ahead of time or as they travel concerning their itinerary so that we may publish them accordingly.</p><p>(5) Please note that we have published the correspondence address of each writer at the end of almost every letter in order to facilitate communication and to help those who are seeking refuge to find the meeting places easily.</p><p>(6) The war zone is so wide and conditions change day by day. We therefore ask the brothers and sisters to pay attention to a few things:</p><p class="indent1">(a) The co-workers, as well as many other saints, are very concerned and are very interested in knowing about the condition of individual brothers and sisters in and around the war zones! Please do your best to communicate your news to us. Letters are often delayed. It would be better if you could send us your report by express mail or airmail.</p><p class="indent1">(b) In your letter you should clearly mark the date and the month. The address must be clearly legible. If you are in another province, clearly mark the name of the province where you are.</p><p class="indent1">(c) As soon as you know of any change of address of any brother or sister, please inform us immediately, because we have no idea where the brothers and sisters have fled when fighting erupts. Once the news is cut off, we become very concerned. We also do not want to lose the mail by sending it to a wrong address.</p><p>(7) Presently, this publication is being compiled as we move around. It is still being printed and mailed out from Hankow. Those who want to subscribe to it should write directly to Hankow. Any news concerning the work or the churches should be sent to The Gospel Book Room, P. O. Box 84, Hankow. For the present time, if you send anything by airmail, you can send it to Mrs. Yuen in Chungking, who will transfer it to me.</p><p>(8) This issue was compiled at the end of December 1937. It will probably be published by the middle of January. All the dates and months, therefore, refer to the previous year. If possible, we hope to put out one issue per month this year.</p><p>Ruth Lee,<br />New Year of 1938 in Chungking</p><h2 class="head1">ANNOUNCEMENTS</h2><p>(1) This publication is temporarily published in Hankow. We have reserved a post office box. In the future any news of the work or the churches or any subscription or questions should be sent directly to: Gospel Book Room, P. O. Box 84, Hankow.</p><p>(2) Presently, the post offices in Shanghai and Hankow do not accept bulky, printed material. No book or magazine can be mailed out as is. Furthermore, mail takes a great deal of time and can sometimes be lost. We hope that the brothers and sisters will accommodate this inconvenience!</p><p>(3) Although Issue Nos. 13 and 14 of The Christian are ready, we are still considering whether or not we should print them now because mail service is so unreliable and because many readers of The Christian have moved. As soon as the address of a reader changes, you should inform the Gospel Book Room in Shanghai, and when the magazine is published, we will send it to the correct address.</p><p>(4) Concerning the relief offering for the brothers and sisters who are in need due to the war, these funds are for all the places, not for Shanghai alone. The monies received in the past from all the churches have been distributed by Brother Watchman Nee and the co-workers. Although the amounts were not significant, they were better than nothing. Now the war zone has spread, and there are even more unemployed or dispossessed saints. We pray that the Lord will grant us more grace to care for the brothers and sisters in tribulation. If you want to send any money, please send it to Miss Ruth Lee, P. O. Box 84, Hankow.</p><h1 class="series">* * *</h1><p>The emphasis of The Open Door is on the gospel work in all the places. In this publication, we publish:</p><p>(1) Articles on the principle of the work</p><p>(2) News of the work</p><p>(3) News of the churches</p><p>Temporarily we are situated in Hankow. We may move at any time. Our correspondence address is Gospel Book Room, P. O. Box 84, Hankow, for as long as the mail route to Hankow is clear. This publication is not for sale. We look to the Lord to supply all the needs.</p><p>We printed a little over a thousand copies for our first issue. We apologize for not being able to meet any back orders. We have increased the number of copies in Issue No. 3 to six thousand. Those who want it should write to us, and we will send it to you.</p><h1 class="title">ISSUE NO. 4</h1><h2 class="head4">(P.O. Box 84, Hankow, February 1938)</h2><h2 class="head1">NEWS CONCERNING THE WORK</h2><h2 class="head2">The Footsteps of Brother Simon Meek, Manila</h2><p>Dear Brother Watchman:</p><p>I gladly received and read your letter. I was comforted to find out about the condition of the co-workers in China through reading The Open Door. When will you travel abroad? It would be best if you could take the steamer that passes through Manila so that the brothers and sisters here may have the opportunity once again to receive your teaching and learn about the details of the work in China. I went on a trip to preach the gospel in October and sowed seeds in thirty-nine localities in ten provinces. A new assembly was raised up in one locality. A brother in business is responsible there. I hope I can go out again next spring. I am comforted by the fact that most of the brothers and sisters in the church in Manila are growing spiritually. Several brothers have moved from here to other places. Lei Chun-yung and Huang Lien-sheng have also gone to other places on business. This locality has lost its strong arms, but we hope that the Lord's Word and work will spread through them. When you have time, I would appreciate you writing to me. When Brother Luk passed through Manila, I was out and was away from home. He came ashore and stayed for several hours. When Brother Luk is finished with the work in Singapore, perhaps he can stay for a short time in the Philippines. Peace.</p><p>Your brother, Simon Meek<br />December 7, 1937<br />[Address omitted]</p><h2 class="head2">Letters from Singapore</h2><h2 class="head3">One</h2><p>Brother X:</p><p>Brother Huang Ren-shan (from Foochow) and I arrived in Singapore on the twenty-eighth of last month. There have been meetings here every night since we came. I spoke for nine evenings in the meeting hall. Next Monday I will preach on a rooftop at the invitation of my classmate, Mr. Lee Bang-han. Please pray for me. The brothers here hope that Brother Kaung will come quickly. Only then they will let me go. They said that you promised to ask him to come here in the past. Sister Ting will come to Singapore from X on December 4. The sisters want to keep her here for awhile. I deeply want to be taught concerning the difference between the church and the work; please guide me in this. Greet each of the co-workers for me. Peace!</p><p>Your brother,<br />Faithful Luk<br />November 28</p><h2 class="head3">Two</h2><p>Sister X:</p><p>The Lord has opened a greater door of grace for us in Singapore. This week we are in the gospel hall. When will the Lord send Brothers Nee and Kaung to us? We invite you to come south whenever you can. I ask you to place this matter in prayer. Sister Ting has already come here. Peace to you! Please greet Mr. Nee and the others also!</p><p>Wang Kai-sen and Faithful Luk<br />December 7</p><h2 class="head3">Three</h2><p>Brother Luan:</p><p>Just as I was thinking about you, I received your letter. Thank you very much. I heard that you were not feeling well. Have you already recovered your health? May the Lord strengthen you greatly, amen (3 John 2). I am comforted to hear that Miss Lee and the others are in Chungking. The letter you wrote to all the brothers and sisters was very clear; both myself and all the saints said amen to it. The new light which Brother Nee received in Acts 13 and 14 really released me. I have dreamt about this for more than ten years in my heart, and now Brother Nee has spoken it. I read it word by word and plan on reading it several more times. Please pray much for me and ask the Lord to save me from a vain life, empty works, and a false testimony, amen. I went to Yung P'ing Harbor to work for one week last week. The calling from the southern island is strong. May the Lord send you and the others to come. Peace to you! Greetings to your wife also! Greetings to senior Brother and Sister Nee.</p><p>Your brother,<br />Faithful Luk<br />January 5<br />[Address omitted]</p><h2 class="head2">A Letter from Sister Sun Wen-hwa<br />in Denmark</h2><p>Peace to my dear Brother X and Sister X in the Lord!</p><p>I really thank the Lord for your letter today. My heart was filled with sadness to learn that Brother Luan was so physically weak. Praise God that His children are always in His hands. The Lord always has a good intention for them. I praise Him for allowing me to learn a little of your situation. May the Lord greatly support you. I give you 1 Peter 5:6-7, and 9-10 and pray for you unceasingly in my heart. I went to England in August and stayed with Miss Fischbacher for six weeks. I attended a ten-day conference on spiritual growth there. The condition of the meeting was very good. We stayed in the country for another four weeks, praying in private and often mentioning your name. I wanted to write once, but I did not get around to it. I praise God for charging me with the work of prayer. I really want to speak with you face to face. These days Luke 21:28 has been a comfort to my heart! May the Lord bless all of you greatly. Greet each of the brothers and sisters for me.</p><p>Your sister in the Lord,<br />Sun Wen-hwa<br />October 11<br />[Address omitted]</p><h2 class="head2">A Letter from<br />Brother Witness Lee</h2><p>Brother Watchman, peace in the Lord:</p><p>It was a big loss that I could not meet you and all the co-workers at Hankow and receive your teachings. I hope to read in The Open Door about the light the Lord has given you. I have been studying the Hebrew language with the brothers and sisters here for the past four weeks. We finished last Friday. I had originally planned to visit the region around Dong-Shiang this week, but I felt later that I should still finish some of the articles for The Christian. I also felt that I should have some fellowship with the brothers and sisters, so I postponed my departure to the countryside. A letter from Peking invited me to go there with my family, but I felt that, for the present, I should do something in Jiao-Dong. Brother Chang, who was first in Chefoo and then in Tsingtao, is now clear about his calling. Although outwardly this brother does not appear to be able to do anything, his life before the Lord and his heart for the Lord are excellent. However, only that which passes through the test counts. He has a burden for the countryside around Jiao-Dong. A few days ago he was here in Chefoo. He will probably go with me into the countryside this time. May the Lord lead and bless! Another brother, Chang Tien-ren, is working in Yi County. This brother studied in the Yingkow Seminary and knew Brother Hwa Tien-min and the others as classmates. The brothers in Chefoo baptized him last summer. When I came to Chefoo this spring, he also came to stay in Chefoo. He came again to Chefoo a few days ago, and I got to know him better. Perhaps the Lord has His leading in this matter. Please pray for this. Brother Bi-Chen is now in his home town in Ping Yin County; Sister Sung is also in her home town. This region still has a need for workers. May the Lord remember this! I praise the Lord for His presence! Please greet Brothers Luan and Lan for me.</p><p>Your brother,<br />Witness Lee<br />December 9<br />[Address omitted]</p><h2 class="head2">A Letter from Sister Rong Fu-tien,<br />Honan Province</h2><p>Peace to my dear Sister X in the Lord!</p><p>Praise the Lord. I received your letter awhile ago and found that you were already in Hankow. We pray for you often. My heart truly misses you and hopes to know your most recent situation. How is the work? May the Lord use you much in these hours when He is about to come. Glory to His holy name. I really hope that the Lord will give us an opportunity to see each other again and talk about the Lord's grace. Praise the Lord, He sent Sister Kao Chui-lan to work with us last month. Praise the Lord's grace! There are many sisters who have just believed in the Lord here in our work. There are also more than one hundred people here every week, most of whom do not know the Lord. Please pray for them. Some brothers are preparing to preach the gospel to unbelievers for a week. May the Lord accomplish His work in the hearts of men. Will The Christian still be published? Kao Chui-lan wants to subscribe to it. Could you take the time to put in her subscription? I am really happy that you gave me Isaiah 41:10 when we parted. It is a comfort and a reminder to me to this day. Thank the Lord, no matter what dangers we encounter, we can find rest and protection in His almighty covering (Psa. 23:3)! May the Lord bless the work ahead of you, amen.</p><p>Your sister,<br />Rong Fu-tien<br />[Address omitted]</p><h2 class="head2">A Letter from K. H. Weigh, K'un-ming</h2><p>To Sister X in the Lord:</p><p>I received both the second and third issues of The Open Door. Thank you. We are looking for a meeting place because our old landlord is remodeling the building for his own use. Since the beginning of the war, the cost of housing has been exorbitant and rents have soared to three and four times their former rate. Thank the Lord for His grace in preparing two appropriate homes for Brother Huang and myself. (My house is well-lighted and airy and has seven rooms.) There has been a great increase in the numbers in the meetings over the past few weeks. Thank the Lord because He was not only lifted up on the cross but also lifted up by God to the highest heaven at the right hand of the throne of God, and He has drawn a group of people to Himself. This Lord's Day seventy or eighty came to hear the Word. (Of course, our numbers mean nothing. If the Lord wants to give us people, we thank Him. There will always be some who go back and are not willing to walk with us, but we do not find this strange because when the Lord was on the earth, He had revival meetings in which the numbers got smaller and smaller, like the one spoken of in John 6:66. After the three or more years of the Lord's work, there were only one hundred twenty with Him at His death, resurrection, and ascension, but the number of those who received grace by listening to His preaching exceeded several thousand. The faithful followers of the Lord are as few as the morning stars! Hence, we find no exception today.) The number at the table has increased from around fifteen to twenty-three. It is all the Lord's grace! The Lord Himself has done the work! There are many brothers and sisters who were saved by the Lord from Gentile households. Among them is a sister who is very much opposed by her family for believing in the Lord, but she overcomes by relying on the Lord, and she has a good testimony at home. There is also a couple who used to fully serve demons, the wife often being attacked by evil spirits. After believing in the Lord, she found victory through trusting in the Lord. She was very sickly, but the Lord has healed her. She is stronger every day. We really thank and praise the Lord! The church here will have a baptism meeting in the near future. There are many brothers and sisters who want to obey the Lord and testify of their death, burial, and resurrection together with the Lord. We are now preparing the baptistry and need about X dollars.</p><p>We heard that you and the others will not be able to come to K'un-ming until April. However, the brothers and sisters and I hope that you can come earlier. If you and Sisters Wang and Chang cannot come together, we would ask one or two to come earlier because the work among the sisters really needs you. There is much work among the sisters that I cannot do. Therefore, I ask you three to pray before the Lord and see what His will is. If His will is for you to come, I believe He will send His angels to protect you in all your travels (Psa. 91:11). The fact that Brother Chang Jing-yuan and two other sisters could arrive peacefully is the proof of the Lord's grace to us. Mrs. Yin Ren-hsian came here from Ch'ang-sha two or three weeks ago and often comes to the meetings. K'un-ming is now full of people from other provinces who have come to escape the war. There are many opportunities for the work here. Unfortunately, the harvest is great and the workers are few. May the Lord send many workers to come gather His harvest. Amen! Peace in the Lord! Please greet Brother Chang Yu-zhi and Sisters Chang and Wang.</p><p>Your brother,<br />Kwang-hsi<br />January 16</p><p>(Brother Weigh has already moved to 15 Shih-Ma Lane, Jin-Ma Street, Upper Floor Apartment, K'un-ming, Yunnan Province. Letters can be sent in care of Mr. Huang Tsung, Customs Office, K'un-ming, Yunnan.)</p><h2 class="head2">Lost Lambs in the Wilderness, Fukien Province</h2><p>Brother X:</p><p>Praise and thank the Lord, although the clouds of war are thick, we have been protected. We are safe, and we can serve the Lord as usual. This is His special grace! The Lord has already opened a door for us for the gospel in the inland region. We have all been led by Him to go inland. Brother Han Jin-siu went to Town 28 in Nan-An. It is a wilderness there, but one family of believers that used to meet in Tung- An moved there. Wang You-yi and Keh Lien-min have gone to Ban-Ling, Hu-Kang, in An-Hsi. There is already an assembly there, but the number of believers is few. Brother Chang Tung-yuan and I arrived in Juang-Shan (Juang-Shan Village in An-Hsi) on November 1. Some brothers have been meeting here by themselves for a long time. When we arrived, we had seven days of meetings for the believers. We really thank the Lord for it. There are many factories in the neighboring areas, and lost sheep are all over the wilderness! We are waiting for the Lord to open the door and lead us. Please pray for us. Rejoice in the Lord!</p><p>Your brother in the Lord,<br />Wang Deng-ming<br />November 18, 1937<br />[Address omitted]</p><h2 class="head2">Two Letters from Sister Bao Hsu-min</h2><h2 class="head3">One</h2><p>Peace in the Lord to dear Sister X:</p><p>I left Dong-Chang for Fu-Ching County on the fifteenth of the month. I did not return to Wenchow until yesterday. Tomorrow I will go to Shing-Hwa. The sisters in each assembly really need cultivation. May God raise up and send experienced ones soon. Thank the Father for selecting and calling a sister who loves the Lord and for preparing her to serve Him. This sister is still working in a hospital, waiting for God's leading. God has saved many people through her. May the Father Himself perfect her to be useful to God. 3 John 2.</p><p>Bao Hsu-min<br />December 21, 1937</p><h2 class="head3">Two</h2><p>Greetings to Sister X in the Lord:</p><p>Thank and praise the blessed Father and the gracious Lord who loves us. He really is our joy, glory, and hope! Hallelujah! This week I rested much in Pu-Tien and received much help from Mr. Chen Ke-san. The sisters want to have an edifying conference from next Monday to Saturday. May the Lord send blessing and grace through it. If the Lord is willing, I hope to be able to speak something on the aspect of life in the afternoon, especially concerning pursuit and revelation. Our emphasis will be more on our daily living. Please pray much for this. May the Lord gain what He wants to gain. May He give what He wants to give. Please greet Miss Chang and all the sisters with you. May you rest in the Lord's arms!</p><p>Your sister,<br />Bao Hsu-min<br />December 28, 1937<br />[Address omitted]</p><h2 class="head2">A Letter from Brother Chen Jeng-fan, Foochow</h2><p>Greetings to my brother in the Lord, Mr. X:</p><p>I received the letters you sent me, as well as The Open Door. I will be able to distribute the latter to the brothers in a few days. When the book arrived, I read it in one sitting. The content is very fresh. My spiritual eyes and ears were renewed, and I learned more about the standard of the work. I was very happy. May all the glory go to the Creator. The gospel work continues as usual, and the number who believe and receive increases daily. We had a Bible-study conference a month ago and many attended. We feel that our meeting place is too small. Some brothers have suggested that we expand our gospel preaching place to the area in front of the big temple. We are already moving this way, but we are still praying and do not know whether it will be accomplished. The Lord willing, I will go to Kutien around the Chinese New Year to have some meetings because they have recently rented a larger hall there. We can probably use it to gather all the believers in the whole county there for a conference. Please do not forget to pray for this. The situation in Foochow is still quiet. All the brothers are living and working in peace. May the Lord be merciful that my life would become a greater testimony to Him. Please pray much for me. I also hope to receive your letters often. Peace to you.</p><p>Your weak brother in the Lord,<br />Chen Jeng-fan<br />January 6<br />[Address omitted]</p><h2 class="head2">A Letter from Brother James Chen, Swatow</h2><p>Greetings to my beloved brother in the Lord, Mr. X:</p><p>I think you published my last letter describing something of the condition here. I would like to give you the latest report to dispel your concerns. On December 18 I received the Lord's marvelous leading through a brother's introduction to do some work in Jieh-Yang. Two brothers and one sister went with me. First we preached the gospel for six days in the West Gate Chapel. Although there were not many people, the spirit of the meeting was very good. We had the Lord's presence, and He worked with us. Later we were invited to the North Gate Chapel to preach the gospel, and we continued speaking for eight days. We must thank and praise the Lord for the door He has opened and the work He has started! Regrettably, our work did not give the Holy Spirit the complete freedom to express His power. For this we feel remorseful. May the Lord have mercy on me and perfect me more each day so that I would become a useful vessel to Him, amen. In my work I have experienced something from the Lord. I was very weak physically and spent most of the time lying down, except when I was preaching. I did not even walk much because I felt as if I would fall down whenever I began to walk. According to my physical condition, it did not seem that I could preach the gospel for two weeks. I thought that since the Lord had opened the door, it was an opportunity that could not be missed. Furthermore, I believed that the Lord's grace was sufficient for me. The Lord's grace is perfected in weakness, so I continued by faith. Thank the Lord, His word is faithful. Every time I stood up to speak, His power covered me. Once I stepped down, I was a sick man again. During this period of time I experienced the words: "Death operates in us, but life in you" (2 Cor. 4:12).</p><p>Now there are many places that have invited us to work. We are not lacking in opportunity, but we do not have the spiritual content and power to grasp the opportunity. If the political condition does not change, I really want to go to many more places. I also hope that the Lord would raise up His testimony in the region of Chaochow and Mei County. Brother Chen Wen-kwang has an illness of the throat; he is taking a vacation and has returned home to rest. According to man's view, it seems as if this region temporarily has lost a brother who can bear the responsibility. However, the Lord always has His good will. Elijah thought that he was the only one left among the prophets of Israel, but God still had seven thousand on His side, one of whom was Elisha. Therefore, we do not need to fear when Elijah is raptured; our only fear is that Elisha would not be raised up. The brothers and sisters here are all in peace. Everything is normal, so be comforted. Peace!</p><p>Your brother,<br />James Chen<br />January 7<br />[Address omitted]</p><h2 class="head2">Two Letters from Sister Huang Ro-chen</h2><h2 class="head3">One</h2><p>Greetings to Brother Kaung and senior Sister Nee:</p><p>Thank the Lord. He answered your prayer and brought blessing to the work here. The brothers and sisters are going on. Some have only recently received the Lord. We need more of God's children to bear the burden of prayer for the work in Chungshan. Thank the Lord, Kuo Men-ping, a friend of Brother Wu Ai-huei and a shepherd by trade, was clearly saved. Brother X has a real testimony. He is now persuading others to believe in the Lord all the time, and he is bearing the fruit of repentance. Recently, several young people have been coming to the meetings with him every night. May the Lord gain these ones. Sister Jing-sheng and Miss X's four cousins also have a heart to pursue the Lord. Thank Him. Two of them are often scolded by their family. Please pray for them. May the Lord bind Satan and save our sisters from all evil. There are six children who want to receive the Lord, three boys and three girls. The oldest is about thirteen and the youngest about nine. They pray by themselves and come to the meetings often. Thank the Lord. There are five saved sisters in Sha-Yong. Every Tuesday and Friday we meet in Sister Kuo En's home. There is also a group of women who come to the meetings and listen to the gospel but have not been clearly saved. May the Lord save them and cause them to receive salvation soon. Last night we had a prayer meeting in which almost everyone who attended prayed. We also prayed that God would send Mr. Kaung to Chungshan again. We really hope that God would send you here to work again and to lead these brothers and sisters on in the spiritual way. Brothers Wu Ai-huei and Kuo Men-ping brought three friends tonight&mdash;Chen Sheng, Ma Chu-wei, and Kuo Shan-kun. These three have been to the meetings many times. It seems that Chen Sheng and Ma Chu-wei are saved. They also pray at home. Wu, Ma, and Kuo are waiting to be baptized. There are also other women and children who rejoiced when they heard about baptism. If God leads you to come again, please notify us one week in advance. The brothers and sisters greet Brother Kaung. Peace in the Lord!</p><p>Huang Ro-chen<br />December 29</p><p>P.S. Miss Kuo greets you.</p><h2 class="head3">Two</h2><p>Greetings in grace to Sister X, Sister X, and Sister X:</p><p>Thank the Lord for saving sinners in Chungshan. There are more than twenty people, including men, women, and children (many among them appear to be saved). God's provisions are always the best. Miss Kuo's younger brother has an empty three-story house, and she and I have been living in it recently. The meetings every evening and on the Lord's Day morning are in the living room. We have already read more than half of Bible Studies for Beginners. Although the brothers and sisters have produced the fruits of repentance, they do not seem to have dealt thoroughly with sin. May the Lord Himself give grace that they would touch God with us in a deep way. This area is really dark; almost every family worships idols. The brothers and sisters have to be very careful to avoid eating food that has been sacrificed to idols. Some young sisters have been continually scolded by their families. Their futures are difficult. Please remember them in prayer. I often think that God has really graced me richly. I am physically healthy and do not have any difficulty in my environment. Furthermore, there is so much opportunity for me to learn everything. However, I am too wicked and need God's mercy because many times my heart is not sincere before God. May God have mercy on me so that I would always live in the light. Please give me more help and petition for me: "Come, my Savior, and help me,/Comfort, strengthen, and keep me;/Thou each moment wilt save me, /Thou art saving me now." Sister Kuo Hai-jen greets you. Peace in the Lord!</p><p>Your little sister,<br />Ro-chen<br />January 8<br />[Address omitted]</p><h2 class="head2">A Letter from Brother Philip Luan,<br />Hong Kong</h2><p>Peace in the Lord to Sisters Ruth, Peace, and Phoebe:</p><p>I believe you received my last letter. Brother Nee boarded the steamer for Shanghai yesterday (the tenth) at noon. While Brother Nee was in Hong Kong, he was busy editing The Normal Christian Church Life. He also held edification meetings on three Lord's Days in which he was responsible for all the speaking. Praise and thank the Lord, his speaking really helped many of the brothers and sisters. Brother Chu Wen-yao and his four brothers came to Kowloon yesterday. The Lord's marvelous grace preserved them safely all the way. Brother Lin Hung-en and his wife sent a letter yesterday saying that they had arrived safely in Manila on the twenty-eighth of last month and met with Sister Chai Teh-an and the others. I heard that Brother Simon Meek has already gone to the outlying islands to give conferences and has not yet returned to Manila. After Miss Tso and Miss Miao arrived in Shanghai, they both sent letters to me. Although they met with some storms on this voyage, they arrived in Shanghai on schedule, thank the Lord. Brother Witness Lee wrote a letter on December 31 saying that Chefoo is quiet and the meetings are continuing as usual. He has not yet gone out into the countryside. Brother Chao Jing-hwai and the others are still doing business in Chefoo. Brother Chao Bi-chen is now in Ping-Yin County of Shantung province. He is staying at the home of Brother Kao Lien-deng and others in Nan- Kung Village. Brother Chou Kang-yao and Sister Bi-Hsia and the others sent a letter from K'un-ming, Yunnan, saying that they are all safe. Sister Bi-Hsia is now helping some in a hospital and taking this opportunity to preach the gospel. Brother Mu Hue-chen came from Kaifeng to Hong Kong. He is waiting for the steamer to go to Wu-Chow. He is still working at the Salt Ministry. Senior Mr. and Mrs. Nee are doing very well. The others here and I have been preserved by the Lord and are healthy. Yesterday, we started to have a sisters' conference every morning at ten o'clock in Kowloon. Sister Yu Shu-jen is responsible for the preaching. I have heard that the circumstances are very good. The conference will last for a week or ten days. Please pray for it. The Lord's grace be with you.</p><p>Your brother,<br />Philip<br />January 11</p><p>P.S. Tze-hsien adds a note of greeting. Jing-wai writes a greeting.</p><h2 class="head2">A Letter from Brother Stephen Kaung,<br />Hong Kong</h2><p>Greetings to my beloved in the Lord, X:</p><p>Peace to you! I received your letter. Mr. Nee spent three Lord's Days here and began his return journey to Shanghai on the tenth of this month. He plans to print The Normal Christian Church Life in Shanghai. Mr. Luan's health has improved because the climate is good and he is also resting. I feel that the work in Hong Kong lacks spiritual weight. Please pray for this. I really hope that the brothers and sisters can have a closer touch with God. As far as number is concerned, there are so many people in the Lord's Day preaching meeting that the place we have rented is not big enough. There are very few local brothers. Miss Miao and Miss Tso returned to Shanghai ahead of the rest and sent a letter saying that they arrived safely. Miss Yu and Miss Lee are still here. Miss Yu held a week-long conference and is now continuing for another week. Brother Chu Wen-yao and his brothers arrived on the tenth of the month. They have not decided what they will do in the future. Miss Shen Hwei-min has also come. Brother Mu Hue-chen has arrived in Hong Kong and will leave shortly for Wu-Chow where he will assume his position in the Salt Ministry. Miss Chang Ping-ching, Miss Chang Tze-ping, and Miss Luh (from Amoy) of Kweilin have met each other and started a prayer meeting. The meetings in Canton are down to one session on the Lord's Day for the breaking of bread and for the exhorting of one another. On the particular Lord's Day that I went to Canton, more than ten brothers and sisters came to the table meeting. All the brothers and sisters in Taishan are well. Perhaps there will be an assembly soon in Macao because Brother Nee Hwai-tzu, Brother Chang Shi-wu, and Brother Liu Tien-an (from Foochow) are all there. Mrs. Faithful Luk will move to Southeast Asia soon. Brother Chen Ju-yen will also move to Southeast Asia shortly. Mr. Luk's most recent letter said, "Sitiawan has sent me several letters, and Penang has also sent me telegrams. I really cannot respond to their requests. I can only beg the Lord to send out workers. We have already rented a youth meeting hall here in Singapore four times a month on the Lord's Day from two to six o'clock for fifteen dollars a month." Please greet Miss Chang and Miss Wang for me and also greet Brother Yu-zhi. Please give my best to Mrs. Yuan. Peace in the Lord! Brother Chen Ju-yen sends his greetings.</p><p>A bondslave of the Lord, Stephen<br />January 12<br />[Address omitted]</p><h2 class="head2">A Letter from Sister Liu Hwei-fen,<br />Shanghai</h2><p>Sister X:</p><p>I received your letter from Mr. Ho last night. I read it carefully. Thank our Father for bringing me through the last few months so that I can count more of the Lord's grace and give Him more thanks. They have caused me to realize even more that God is faithful. The Tuesday women's meeting is very good. Many sisters come to work. There are also many outsiders. The Saturday sisters' meeting is very living. Many sisters stand up to testify. The refugee camp in Jiao-Tung University has not closed yet. Thank God. He brought the people from the countryside into Shanghai so that they would have the opportunity to hear the gospel. The newspaper reported that forty-nine refugee camps have closed for lack of funds. It is said that the International Relief Organization will open its sixth facility to meet the need. Thus, there is a lot of work among the refugees. If Sister Wang and Sister Chang do not forget, please have them greet Mrs. Yuan for me. Peace in the Lord!</p><p>Your sister, Hwei-fen<br />January 6<br />[Address omitted]</p><h2 class="head2">A Letter from Brother Shan Kai-fen,<br />Shaohsing, Chekiang Province</h2><p>Greetings to my beloved Brother X in the Lord:</p><p>Please forgive me in the Lord for my sin of laziness in not communicating with you for so long. Since the beginning of the war, the heart of the people in Shaohsing has been fearful, and the inhabitants of the city have fled. Nine out of ten houses are now empty. But the brothers and sisters in the Lord have been preserved by the Lord Himself and are at peace without concern. Some have fled to the countryside, while others are still in the city. The Lord's Day meeting continues as usual. Siao-Shan had several hundred shots fired at it, and at least two hundred people are dead or wounded. However, the Lord's children are preserved and not hurt. These are perilous days, but I deeply believe that He will preserve His own beloved children and bring us safely through. The day of the Lord's coming is near. As to my unfaithfulness, "If You, O Jehovah, marked iniquities,/Who, O Lord, would stand?/But with You there is forgiveness,/That You would be feared" (Psa. 130:3-4). A month ago I went with Brothers Shou-lin and Hsin-yih to the assembly in Nan-Sha. At that time we heard that Da-Chang had been lost and that Jia-Shing was in trouble. We were afraid that the Nanking-Hangchow Rail would be closed. The brothers hurriedly went back to San-Chiao-Bu, and I have not heard from them since. I am really concerned about them! Do you have any news about where they are? I still have one of Brother Chou's suitcases in my home, with two letters to him from Brother Chang of Chungking and Brother Hsu of Wu-Yi. I will not travel in the near future because of the recent political situation. My family has been graced by the Lord and is well. Please do not worry. Peace.</p><p>Your weak little brother,<br />Shan Kai-fen<br />December 14<br />[Address omitted]</p><h2 class="head2">The Gospel Work<br />in the Region of Ping-Yang</h2><p>Sister X:</p><p>The recent war clouds over Chekiang province are getting more tense. While Wenchow and Ping-Yang are still quiet, it is hard to tell what changes the future will bring. The brothers and sisters are living peacefully day by day through relying on the Lord's grace; they are not frightened. However, some brothers are having difficulties with their living, because business and industry have stopped. Praise and thank the Lord that in this difficult time the gospel work has an open door in every place, even though all occupations have stopped. In the last two weeks we few co-workers in the Bai-Sha region of Jiang-Nan held seven gospel meetings (during the night). Sometimes we borrowed someone's house, and sometimes we held the meetings in the open air. The number of attendants was more than one hundred every time. Sometimes it exceeded three or four hundred. The degree of concentration and attention among the attendants was unprecedented. We deeply believe that we will soon see some children of God raised up in this audience. Today we will begin to have several weeks of continuous gospel work in the area around Hu-Shan and in the region of Chao-Yang-Shan. (We made this decision in our prayer long ago.) At the beginning of this work, we really felt weak and did not know how to begin. We can only look to God with fear and trembling for His timely grace. Please do not forget to pray for this. Brother Chai Chi is often physically weak. Please pray for him. May the grace and peace of the Father be with you always. Greet Brother Watchman Nee, Brother Lan Tsi-yi, and all the brothers and sisters.</p><p>Your little brother in the Lord,<br />Chen Ching-fa<br />November 30, 1937<br />[Address omitted]</p><h2 class="head2">Two Letters from Brother Han Fu-sheng</h2><h2 class="head3">One</h2><p>Brother Tsi-yi:</p><p>We left Hankow on the sixteenth of last month and arrived at Lin-Tze-Kou after three days. The boat of the T'ai Ku company could not proceed because the water was too shallow, so they hired a local boat to take us to Yuan-Jiang. Yuan-Jiang usually has a small steamer that goes to Ch'ang-Teh, but it has not been selling tickets recently, and we heard of robberies along the way. We stayed in an inn for two days. Later, a Western missionary, a Chinese pastor, and a preacher of the Methodist Church warmly welcomed us and allowed us to move into their meeting hall. Their attitude toward us was very open, and they invited us to preach a few times. There were many who had a desire. I came to Yi-Yang by car a few days ago and waited for two days in Yi-Yang for a bus. I received Brother Sun Bao-chai's letter and learned that this road was difficult and with bandits, so it was not the right time to go forward. I could not go by water either, because the water level was too low. We decided to stay in Ch'ang-Teh temporarily. Dr. Qu went to Yuan-Jiang yesterday. It is hard to say whether he will hire a local boat or take the steamer. Brother Feng is doing his best to help us and has already found three places to stay&mdash;one in Brother Chu Teh-hsin's home, one in Mr. Chao's home (the responsible one in the Christian and Missionary Alliance Church), and one in Brother Feng's home. The area around Ch'ang-Teh is still peaceful, and the cost of living is very low. One measure of the best rice is six dollars. If Ch'ang-sha is not affected by the crisis, we can stay here for a long time. If the situation becomes tense, we are prepared to retreat to Chen-Jou. Brother Loh Yung-dien, who used to teach in Sui-Jou Secondary School in Jia-Shing, has escaped here to Ch'ang-Teh with seven poor, homeless students. Brother Lo married Miss Ma Ru-xun on the twenty-seventh of last month. When the seven students started out, there were a few who were not saved, but while they were fleeing, they all saw their sins and repented, believing in the Lord. They also received the outpouring of the Holy Spirit. Presently, we need a place to preach the gospel in Ch'ang-Teh. May the Lord open for us a door for the gospel here. We ask you brothers to be our backup in prayer. Peace and well-being in the Lord!</p><p>Your brother,<br />Fu-sheng<br />January 3</p><h2 class="head3">Two</h2><p>Brother Tsi-yi:</p><p>I received and read your letter. Dr. Qu has moved to Ch'ang-Teh. The rest are staying in Yuan-Jiang. They are all well. Brother Lo's private school has more than ten students, and more are signing up as time goes by. We still meet in Brother Feng's home. We hope that God will prepare another meeting place. May He begin working here. Please pray much for us. Six of Brother Lo's students are willing to walk in this way with us and seem to be very zealous! May they have not only a good beginning but also a good continuation. I ask the Lord that they be deeply rooted in Him. When they set out, the school gave them money to flee with; they do not need to worry about clothing or food yet. We are doing our best to arrange a place for them, but we have not found anything yet. I want to return to Yuan-Jiang before the Chinese New Year, but I have not decided yet. Peace in the Lord!</p><p>Your brother,<br />Fu-sheng<br />January 13<br />[Address omitted]</p><h2 class="head2">Two Letters from Brother Chen Hsi-wen</h2><h2 class="head3">One</h2><p>Dear Sister X in the Lord:</p><p>When I started out on my journey, it was not for the purpose of escaping the war. If it were, I would have escaped to Peking or Tientsin. In Tientsin I had the opportunity to study for awhile (French and spiritual books) while learning to preach the gospel. But I felt that I could not stay in Tientsin for too long. When I left Tientsin, I wandered aimlessly, not knowing where I was going. I went to the co-workers' conference with the original intention of receiving more spiritual truth and of dealing with my life's work before God. I wanted to see what God really wanted me to do before I decided where to go. For the past four years, I have had a question that cannot be answered. Should I serve the Lord while continuing in my occupation, or should I come out to serve the Lord full-time? Although I heard the call, I did not dare to acknowledge and answer it. This last summer I became completely clear; I should leave my job to serve the Lord full-time. However, it seems that there are two roads that I can follow in serving the Lord full-time (which I realized long ago). One is helping with the publications, while the other is preaching the gospel. I am not clear what the Lord wants me to do. Before I left Tientsin, one or two brothers and sisters asked me about the aspect of my work. I answered that if I did not help with the publications, I would go to the distant regions and learn to preach the gospel there. (It seems that I have a burden to do both, but practically, it seems that I must choose one because it is difficult to care for both at the same time.) It seems that, according to the Lord's present arrangement, I should take care of the publication work. Brother Nee once asked me where I planned to go. I only told him that I would temporarily go to Ch'ang-sha and then consider. I dared not tell him about going into the distant regions. Later, Brother Nee suggested that I join Brother Weigh in Yunnan. This was just according to the inward leading I had received, so I agreed. My parents have sent several letters to me and have provided the money for traveling because they want me to come home. (If I return to Fukien province, I must go to Nan-ch'ang where there is a bus that passes through northern Fukien to southern Fukien.) My inward feeling is that it is not God's will for me to return home right now. If I return home, I will be surrounded and incarcerated by my family's love. It will be difficult to leave if I want to. Returning home would give me a little of my own enjoyment, but I would not be able to serve the Lord. Therefore, I cannot go home this way. I am almost certain now that I should move away from home. Please pray for me often. In my travels with the other brothers and sisters, I learned many lessons and discovered many of my own shortcomings through quiet conversations. Once we have seen ourselves, we will never dare to raise our head to look at God or man again. But thank God, He always has a way of deliverance. May the Lord save me from my natural life of the old creation so that I would desire and pursue Him more and no longer do things loosely according to my own will, thus bringing shame to myself and failing to glorify God.</p><p>Brother Nee has already finished polishing The Normal Christian Church Life and has prepared a clean copy of the first seven chapters. There are still three chapters which Brother Nee will work on in Hong Kong. May the Lord bless this book. Whenever I read the Bible, I only see a few matters related to the spiritual life. But if it is something related to the objective truth (like prophecies, the truth of the church, etc.), I am afraid to get into it because I am afraid of wrong interpretation. This time while I was listening to the messages and preparing the manuscripts, I finally became clear about the differences between terms like teachers, prophets, shepherds, elders, and apostles. This was also the first time I had heard anything concerning the truth of the church. (Before I had only seen something concerning the meeting life, but even that was not clear.) I thank the Lord for it. When I get to Ch'ang-sha, I will report to you of the Lord's leading. May the Lord's love be with you, and may the Lord lead you in your way ahead, amen. Please greet Brother Chang, Sister Chang, and Sister Wang.</p><p>Your little brother in the Lord,<br />Chen Hsi-wen<br />December 29, 1937</p><h2 class="head3">Two</h2><p>Dear Sister X in the Lord:</p><p>I left Ch'ang-sha on the fifth of this month and arrived in Kuei-yang on the fifteenth. I leave for K'un-ming tomorrow morning. I still do not have a companion, but the Lord's grace is sufficient for me. I see His powerful leading and support in all aspects. I really thank and praise Him! May the Lord's love be with you always!</p><p>Your brother in the Lord,<br />Chen Hsi-wen<br />January 15, in Kuei-yang</p><h2 class="head2">From K'un-ming to Yeh-Ji</h2><p>Dear Brother Chih-I in the Lord:</p><p>Last night I received your two airmail letters dated November 15 and December 6. I read them through carefully and was very comforted! Brother Hu, Brother Ma, and I left K'un-ming on November 14 for Yeh-Ji Village in Wei-Si County (Brother Hu's home). On the trip from K'un-ming to Hsia-Guan in Da-Li, we took a three-hour bus ride. In Hsia-Guan we hired pack mules, so we were delayed for four or five days. In Hsia-Guan there is a China Inland Mission chapel, and we preached the gospel there a few times. It took us fourteen or fifteen days to get to Wei-Si from Hsia- Guan and another four days to get from Wei-Si to Yeh-Ji. We arrived in Yeh-Ji Village on December 7. God's grace enabled us to travel safely even though the roads were treacherous. Thank and praise the Lord! This area is in the region of tribal aborigines, so everything is inconvenient. There are no houses for rent. (Fortunately, Brother Hu has a house here.) We must plant our own vegetables to get something to eat. Sometimes an aborigine will bring some eggs or meat on his back to sell. Most of the time it is done by bartering. There is a lack of salt and tea here. The aborigines need them. Sometimes they will not take paper money but insist on silver. It is difficult for us evangelists, who do not have a settled home, to live in a place like this. This is nothing really, but a greater problem lies before us in that my wife will soon have a baby. I believe that God will grace us and bring us through! There is an X denominational church here, which is where Brother Hu used to work. When Brother Ma and I arrived, the X church was not very happy. They were especially jealous of Brother Ma because they thought that he was helping Brother Hu financially and because he also came out of the X denomination. For this reason, one of the X has repeatedly come to speak with Brother Ma to tell him that we should go somewhere else to preach the gospel. Thank the Lord, there is still the opportunity to preach the gospel to them. We must not give up any opportunity to preach the gospel. I am now learning Tibetan. Brother Hu has some family matters which are not settled, so we have not started on our journey. After my wife has her baby (sometime in January 1938), Brother Hu, Brother Ma, and I will go to Tibet. I have decided to go to Ba-Tang to take a look. If the Lord works and allows me to go, I will move my whole family to Ba-Tang and move from there to the outlying areas. If the Lord gives grace again, I will move into Tibet! This is my recent leading. The future is in the Lord's hands, so I can only look to Him!</p><p>I received the money order for X dollars in your airmail letter. Please do not worry about it. However, I must send this money order to K'un-ming before it can be cashed. The post office here can do everything but cash money orders. For this reason, it is not called a post office here but a postal agent. We can receive registered letters, etc., but we must go to the county seat of Wei-Si to receive money. It takes us three weeks to get from here to K'un-ming. Regular letters take two months to get here, and airmail letters take one month. Was Brother Luan's and Sister Miao's trip to Hong Kong and Szechuan interrupted? Did they come to Yunnan also? What has been their most recent move? I think of them often! Where is Brother Nee now? Please tell me. If he is still in Hankow, please greet him for me. I really hope that another inland co-worker can come to this remote region to work. The requirements for a successful co-worker in a remote region are faithfulness, courage, indifference to suffering, and perseverance through hundreds of hardships. God must give the grace to some to get through! If the Lord leads you, it would be wonderful for you to come to Sikang. It takes thirty-seven days to get to Ba-Tang from Ch'eng-tu, Szechuan. If you come from Chungking to K'un-ming and then go on to Sikang, it will take two months. However, the road through Yunnan is less steep. It would not be too much for you to come by way of Ch'eng-tu. May the Lord lead you!</p><p>We have not seen The Open Door and The Shanghai Local Newsletter of last month. We feel frustrated, yet because of the blocking off of communication, there is nothing we can do about it. Greetings to Brother Ju Yao-ju and to all the brothers and sisters in Hankow. Peace in the Lord!</p><p>Your brother,<br />Jung-jieh<br />January 1</p><h2 class="head2">The General Condition<br />of the Work in Chungking</h2><p>In January Sister Wang held a gospel conference for women which continued with a Bible study. Thank the Lord, some were saved, and some became clear about salvation. Brother Chang Yu-zhi is involved with prison evangelism work, which began January 24. The sisters also plan to go to the women's prison to preach the gospel. From February 1-10, Brother Chang Yu-zhi will borrow a certain chapel to hold a large gospel meeting for unbelievers. After the meeting he plans to continue with one week of Bible studies. In the second half of February, he and Sister Wang plan to go Ch'eng-tu. Please pray for this.</p><p>Ruth Lee<br />January 26, in Chungking</p><h2 class="head1">CONCERNING<br />THE NORMAL CHRISTIAN CHURCH LIFE</h2><p>Mr. Watchman Nee sent a letter from Hong Kong on January 6 about The Normal Christian Church Life. The following is a quote from his letter: "After coming to Hong Kong, I have been editing this book day and night, but it still is not finished. Because this book is very important, I do not want it to be incomplete. I have added much new material in hope of serving the children of God well. There are now ten chapters in the book. Nine are completed; one is not. I plan to go to Shanghai on the ninth. After the book is printed, I will return to the south. The printing costs here are very high, and the quality of the printing is not very good." (This book is now being typeset and printed in Shanghai. We hope it will come out soon.)</p><h2 class="head1">NEWS OF THE CHURCHES</h2><h2 class="head2">K'un-ming, Yunnan</h2><p>Greetings to my dear Sister X in the Lord:</p><p>I received your letter of December 26 a long time ago and read it carefully. When the brothers here and I heard that you, Sister Wang, and Sister Chang were coming to K'un-ming soon, we were overjoyed. Mrs. Yin Ren-hsian moved to K'un-ming recently. She knows Sister Wang very well. Many people from other provinces are coming to K'un-ming. We hope that the Lord will send more of His workers here to preach the gospel.</p><p>Brother Hsu Jung-jieh, his wife, Brother Hu Yi-min, and Brother Ma Mu all arrived safely in Yeh-Ji Village in the middle of December. The journey was an exceptionally difficult one, and Mrs. Hsu was heavy with her pregnancy. They really received God's special grace on this trip. He has answered the prayers of His children. I received a letter from Brother Ma, saying, "Thank the Lord, there is already a table meeting in Brother Hu's house. We had the first table meeting on December 19, 1937. We also had the first meeting on that morning. Please pray unceasingly with all the other brothers and sisters for the work in this area." I have moved to 11 Wen- Miao-Dung Lane. If letters are sent to the K'un-ming Customs Office, I will have a better chance of receiving them. It is not that hard to travel from Haiphong to Hong Kong; one only needs to have a passport from the special department of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Peace to you in the Lord.</p><p>Your little brother in the Lord,<br />Huang Tsung<br />January 9</p><h2 class="head2">Experiences on the Road from Hunan<br />to Kweichow to Yunnan</h2><h2 class="head3">One</h2><p>Dear Brother X in the Lord:</p><p>My younger sister and I left Ch'ang-sha on December 29 and have arrived safely in Kweichow. We are now waiting for the train to K'un-ming, according to Sister X's instructions. The road was very difficult, but we received the Lord's grace and peace. We have more than enough money for our traveling expenses, and we are not bothered by the change in climate. Please do not worry about us any longer. The road from Hunan to Kweichow is still peaceful, but there are not many buses. We had to wait, and we were delayed for a long time. It is the eighth day of our trip, and we are still not in Yunnan. The Lord has led me to travel a long distance to increase my knowledge of the world. I have discovered that the people in Kweichow are suffering much and really need the gospel. I pray that the Lord will send more workers. Peace in the Lord. Please greet all the brothers and sisters in the church.</p><p>Your little brother,<br />Chang Jing-yuan<br />January 8, in Kuei-yang</p><h2 class="head3">Two</h2><p>To my sister in the Lord, Sister X:</p><p>I have read your letter. Thank you for sharing everything with me! We have been preserved by the Lord and are safe. Are you busy with the work? I think of you. My sister and I experienced the Lord's provision in providing tickets to K'un-ming on December 28. We left on the twenty-ninth. I wrote a letter while we were waiting to change trains in Huang County, western Hunan, which I gave to a person from Hangchow, Mr. Lee, to mail for me when he passes through Chungking. We received much grace from God on this journey. After arriving in K'un-ming, I will have to work. Thank and praise the Lord! We spent New Year's Day in Huang County. We had to wait for the train, so we went into the city to sightsee. God's Spirit led us into a China Inland Mission where we met a Western brother, Mr. Bei. We spoke a little about the matter of meeting according to the principles of the Bible. He was very satisfied. We were there during their New Year's gospel meetings, and the Lord gave me an opportunity to preach the gospel once and to testify of the Lord's leading and protection in grace. Glory to God. Peace in the Lord. Please greet Brother Chang, Miss Wang, and Miss Chang.</p><p>Your brother,<br />Chang Jing-yuan<br />January 1, in Kuei-yang</p><h2 class="head3">Three</h2><p>Dear Sister X in the Lord:</p><p>I think you have received my previous letter. My sister Jing-hsia and I experienced the Lord's grace and leading and arrived safely in K'un-ming on January 12 at six o'clock in the evening. We took hospitality with Brother Huang Tsung and are temporarily staying in his home. The next day we met with Brother K. H. Weigh and Brother Chou Kang-yao and his younger brother. We asked Brother Chou to ask his wife to find my sister a position as a nurse. We heard that X Hospital likes to use Cantonese, so there may not be much hope. Sister Wang Ju-ching was delayed because her train broke down, arriving only one day ahead of us in Yunnan. In addition to waiting for the train in Huang County for five days, my sister and I rested for one day in Kuei-yang. Therefore, it took us fifteen days to travel from Hunan to Yunnan. I arrived in Kuei-yang on the evening of January 7. I joined the prayer the next evening at the China Inland Mission on Chi-Shan Lane in Kuei-yang. There I met a Western missionary, Mr. Chi, and the elder, Mr. Yeh Ts'ai. I also met Ms. Chen, who is a native of Kuei-yang. She attended our meetings in Shanghai in 1931. She hopes that some of the sisters in the Lord could go to work in Kuei-yang. If Sister Lee and the others go to Kuei-yang and want to stay in a hotel, they could stay in the Paris Hotel on Chung-Shan Road. This hotel is one of the cleaner ones in Kweichow. All the prices for the rooms are discounted. I read Sister Lee's letters in Brother Weigh's house and Brother Huang's house today and learned that she wanted to work in Kuei-yang and K'un-ming and that she was asking about the land and sea routes. Brother Weigh and I are answering her questions in separate letters. I am not clear about the condition of the Szechuan-Kweichow Railway, but I heard from fellow travelers that it is peaceful the whole way. The only trouble is that the mountains are steep and the way is winding. It is similar to the road from Kweichow to Yunnan. The cars shake and sway, and travelers often feel sick. I have heard that the southwest highway is more dangerous around Hunan and Kweichow. Bandits have appeared in the Ch'ang-Teh, Yuan Ling, and Huang County regions of western Hunan. The towns of Chen-Yuen and O-Chih-Bang in Kweichow are very dangerous places. I have also heard of buses and cars being held up. According to Mrs. Huang, Sister Wang Ju-ching heard that the bus before hers was held up twice. My sister and I enjoyed the Lord's presence on this trip and were escorted by angels, so we passed through the dangers as if journeying on smooth highways and did not encounter any mishaps. Thank the Lord for His grace, and thank the brothers and sisters for their prayers. I traveled for four days after leaving Kuei-yang. I first went to Yung-Ning and stayed in the Hsinsheng Hostel. It cost fifty cents per person for two meals and one night. The owner is Catholic, and the food was quite good. Next we went to Pan County and stayed in the T'ung-Hsin-Twei Inn on Ta-Fu Street. Although the rooms in this inn were large, the food was coarse. It would be better to stay in the small inn across the street. It costs fifty cents a person for two meals and one night. The third night we were in Chu-Jing. This place was better. It produces leeks and cauliflower and is famous for its noodles. I stayed in the Railroad Inn. It cost sixty cents per person for two meals and one night. I heard that there is much leprosy in Chu-Jing, so it is best not to eat their eggs and chickens. With respect to passport inspections along the way, women are treated better than men. At Ping-Yi they ask very detailed questions, such as one's full name, home, age, occupation, trip origin, trip destination, where one will live in K'un-ming, what one intends to do, etc. When we arrived in Chu-Jing near K'un-ming, we were interrogated again. When we arrived in K'un-ming, we were questioned four or five times. They did not open the large pieces of luggage, but they did look into the small bags. I prayed to the Lord and was exempted from examination. The only time I was questioned was in the city of K'un-ming at the gate of the Yunnan-Vietnam Railway. When they found out that I was a Christian going to 119 Peng-Shih Street, the officer said that was Hu Yi-min's place. I asked him whether he knew Hu Yi-min, and he said yes. Later, Brother Huang told me that when Brother Hu came, his face and appearance were so different that the people of Yunnan thought he was an X native, and they questioned him many times. After the brothers proved that he was Tibetan, the news was published in the Yunnan newspaper. In this way the whole city of K'un-ming knew him.</p><p>If Sister Lee comes to K'un-ming, she should know that paper money is not standardized here. If she can change her money at the Central Bank of Szechuan for ten, twenty, and fifty-cent legal bills, it would be best to do so. If she cannot, she should try to change it all into the new legal one-dollar bills. They are accepted more readily. It is not easy to use five or ten-dollar bills here. The stores do not change money, so you must change it at the Central Bank, but it is not easy to get money changed at the Central Bank. Each customer can only bring twenty catties [a Chinese measure of weight] of luggage on the buses. The rest can be carried as hand luggage if it is packed into small packages or carried in a small basket. The brothers and sisters here hope that Sister Lee can come to K'un-ming to work. We testified to the Lord's grace in the meeting on Thursday. Sister Wang Ju-ching did the same. We received the Lord's peace and grace, so please do not worry about us. Please send me a copy of the third issue of The Open Door. Peace in the Lord. Please greet Brother Chang Yu-zhi, Miss Wang, Miss Chang, and Mrs. Yuan How-tzai.</p><p>Your little brother in the Lord,<br />Chang Jing-yuan<br />January 17<br />[Address omitted]</p><h2 class="head2">Yuan-Jiang, Hunan Province</h2><p>Dear Brother X in the Lord:</p><p>I never thought that I would come to Yuan-Jiang. I had never even heard of Yuan-Jiang, much less considered coming here. However, things happened that we did not even dream of. I was originally going to go to Chi-Li, but instead I ended up here. I will explain briefly how it happened to comfort you. We left Hankow on the evening of December 16 and arrived in Cheng-Ling-Ji at noon on the eighteenth. Our cargo had to be inspected by the customs officers, so our boat did not leave Cheng-Ling-Ji until the morning of the twentieth. We went to Lin-Tze-Kou on the twenty-first. The captain said that the boat was not going to Shatow, so he hired another local boat for us. The boat went slowly because the water level was so low. We did not arrive in Yuan-Jiang until the morning of the twenty-third. We originally planned to take the next steamer to Ch'ang-Teh. In the beginning we stayed in a hostel, but later we discussed this with the people from the denominational church. Thank the Lord, we were given hospitality by them so that we could settle here. Pastor Hsu Wei invited us to preach the word three times. The audience said they were very touched. May all the glory be to God. Brother Han was too exhausted by the journey. After coming to Yuan-Jiang he got the flu. (Ninety percent of the people had the flu.) Fortunately, he is better now. Pastor Hsu says that they can give us hospitality until the middle of February because their chapel will be holding their annual Bible study then. Rent is higher than usual because many refugees have come to Yuan-Jiang. I had originally planned to write you a letter telling you everything, but I was not able to because of my health. Please forgive me. Peace in the Lord. Please greet Brother Chou, Brother Chu, and all the brothers and sisters in Hankow for me.</p><p>Your brother,<br />Chang Gun-jih<br />January 2, in Yuan-Jiang</p><h2 class="head2">Ch'ang-sha, Hunan Province</h2><p>Dear Brother Lan in the Lord:</p><p>Did you receive my last two airmail letters? I think of you often. The day after Brother Hsi-wen mailed his letter, he bought the tickets to K'un-ming through the Lord's marvelous arrangement.</p><p>Brother Jing-yuan took his sister to Yunnan on the twenty-eighth of last month. Miss Hsu En-shiu's entire family went to Kweilin at the end of last year. Sister Shen Hwei-min went to Hong Kong at the same time. Most of the brothers and sisters passing through along the way have all scattered. I received Brother Hsien-lu's letter yesterday that said Brother Han has arrived in Ch'ang-Teh. Praise the victorious Lord! He really guides in marvelous ways! Brother Feng said that there is a meeting in his home on the Lord's Day. They are now asking the Lord to prepare a proper meeting hall for them. I have been very busy since Gan-mu sent a letter with his date of arrival; I have been preparing his house for him. I really need your help in prayer for the two matters mentioned in the previous two letters! I will tell you the rest in detail later. I hope for your answer. Best blessings!</p><p>Ai-wu<br />January 7<br />[Address omitted]</p><h2 class="head2">Ch'ang-Teh, Hunan Province</h2><p>Brother Yu-zhi in the Lord:</p><p>After we said good-by, I think that the Lord must have specially protected, led, and used you to do the work that pleases His heart. I do not know whether you received the card I sent last time. I came to Ch'ang-Teh to escape from the war and met Brother Han Fu-sheng. We are now asking the Lord to give us an open door for the gospel. I married Sister Ma Ru-xun on December 27 of last year, according to the Lord's arrangement. We have now started a small school in Ch'ang-Teh to maintain our livelihood. I am still not clear about the Lord's calling. I feel that someone like me will never be worthy to do God's work. However, I deeply believe that if the Lord wants to use someone, that person will be able to obey the Lord. God is not a respecter of persons. As we were escaping from the war, we saw His glory all along the way. Now the five students are all saved. Praise the Lord! Brother Wang Wen-jiang received the outpouring of the Holy Spirit recently, and it is as if he is a different person. He says that the Lord has already called him. We are now asking the Lord to make arrangements for these five students. Perhaps they can follow the footsteps of Brother Han.</p><p>The result of this war is that many brothers and sisters have become scattered and lost. They really need God's special grace to preserve their spirits, souls, and bodies. Did you go to Kuei-yang? If there are any letters for my wife or myself at your place, please send them in care of Brother Feng Hsien-luh, Tung-Gong Print Shop, Court Main Street, Ch'ang-Teh, Hunan. I will stop right here. Many blessings in the Lord.</p><p>Your brother in the Lord,<br />Yung-dien<br />January 12</p><h2 class="head2">A Letter from Sister Chien Sin-sien<br />on Her Journey</h2><p>To my beloved Sister X in the Lord:</p><p>I greet you from my wandering journey. We have not yet been discharged. I left Hankow last year on December 27 and arrived in Ch'ang-sha on January 6. I waited on the boat for several days while we were waiting for orders. We finally left for Siang-Tan on the morning of the tenth. We had to stay on the boat for several days because the director of the Hunan-Kweilin Railroad had gone to Hankow, so there was no one there to give orders. Yesterday, I was finally able to move to a hospital temporarily (one established by the China Inland Mission). Perhaps I will be assigned to work in the region of Kweilin, but nothing has been decided. The future is in God's sovereign hand. I was on a private boat on this journey, so there were many hidden dangers. Thank and praise our God, He preserved us and brought us safely through. My father and mother are in Soochow, and I still do not have any news of them. I do not know whether or not they are alive. When I think about it, my heart grieves! But then I think that perhaps it is the Lord's will that I experience Matthew 8:22. I only want God to gain something. I am willing to care for nothing and pass through what He wants me to go through. However, I am weak; I can only pray that God Himself keeps me. May God completely gain me so that I may glorify Him. We will probably be here for two weeks. We will notify you of our future itinerary. Peace in the Lord. Please greet Miss Chang for me. Sisters Chang, Tsou, Lin, and Lee all send their greetings.</p><p>From a weak little one in the Lord,<br />Chien Sin-sien<br />January 15</p><p>(This letter was sent from Hunan-Kweichow Railway Clinic of the Hwei Jing Hospital, Hsiang T'an.)</p><h2 class="head2">An Isolated Brother</h2><p>Brother X:</p><p>I will begin by saying that I used to be a student of the arts. I did not believe in the Lord Jesus until 1931. After believing into the Lord, I dropped everything and became a full-time preacher. The X Church sent me to the X Seminary. Then I transferred to the X Seminary of the X denomination. Because of difficulties with a teacher, I was X from school and returned to my old home with the comforting of the Lord. I preached the gospel on the one hand and took up some jobs to maintain my living on the other. During that time, I gained the light of the truth and knew that what I believed was not complete and that my direction was in error. Therefore, I left the X denomination in a definite way. I am a loner by nature, but sometimes I thought that I did not have one real brother or sister by my side, and I felt sad. At the same time, I was too weak. It did not matter how hard I worked, there was never any fruit. Even my wife went the opposite direction from me. In these circumstances, I cried many times. It was probably Brother Liu Ai-wu in Ch'ang-sha who sent several copies of The Open Door to Brother Feng Hsien-luh in Ch'ang-Teh. Brother Feng passed on a copy to me. I wiped away the tears that were blurring my eyes after I read it. My heart was jumping for joy! Praise God! I know His good pleasure! He wanted to have a way (He has had it for some time now) to allow many of His lonely children to fellowship with one another. I am writing you joyfully to tell you and all the brothers and sisters that I am still here. I am pitiful, and I hope that you can come help me. My questions are: (1) If I am the only one here, how do I meet? (2) If I cannot eat the bread and drink the cup, what should I do? (3) I want to work, but how should I start? (4) How can I get in contact with brothers and sisters in other localities? I will only ask these four questions now. I will ask you the rest at another time. Peace.</p><p>Your brother,<br />Mei Han-ke<br />October 25, 1937<br />[Address omitted]</p><p>(Brother Han Fu-sheng is in Ch'ang-Teh. You can ask Brother Feng Hsien-luh to introduce you to him. It will be easy for him to answer your four questions&mdash;Editor.)</p><h2 class="head2">Tsaoyang, Hupei Province</h2><p>Sister X in the Lord:</p><p>I have not heard any news about you for a long time. I am very concerned about you! Brother Mu Hwei-chen passed through Hankow on his way to Kweilin. Have you seen him? By the Lord's grace, we not only got to see each other in Honan, but also had the opportunity to pray together in one accord. We also had a time of prayer together before we left Honan. We really did not want to leave. Do you have any news of where the brothers and sisters in Tsingtao and Chefoo moved to? Are you clear about where the Lord wants you to work? I hope to hear from you. I received a letter from Sister Chin in Peking saying that Brother Witness plans to go to Peking. She also said that Sister Chi's husband (Chi Tsung-sin) was saved. Oh, may the doors to the Lord's gospel be opened wide. We left Shansi province and came to Honan. Not long afterwards, we continued on our way to Tsao-Yang County, where we are living temporarily. My elder brother sent a telegram telling me to go to Ch'ang-sha and then to go home (Tientsin) together with my younger brother. Please pray for this matter! My eldest sister is in Wuhu, and we do not have any news of her. The same is true of my uncle. May the Lord grace you and the brothers and sisters who are with you, amen. Grace be with you. Please greet all the brothers and sisters in the Lord for me. Sister Yi-rong sends her greetings.</p><p>Your sister,<br />Wu Deh-shin<br />January 13</p><h2 class="head2">Tientsin</h2><p>Sister X in the Lord:</p><p>I received the letter that you sent in care of Mrs. Kwan. Thank you. Thank and praise the Lord. Sister Dai, Sister Chang, and Sister Shao are all in Tientsin, and they all come to the meetings. I have also witnessed God's work recently in the brothers and sisters. God is doing His own work through the present environment. The spiritual growth of several brothers is something that I must praise the Lord for. The brothers and sisters receive much help from them in both the Bible studies and the gospel meetings. Thank the Lord for gracing us! We are still remembering the physically weak ones in our prayers. We also mention Brother Luan. May God grace him. If God wills, He will cause him to become healthy; if not, may the Lord manifest His great power in man's weakness as He did in the apostle Paul. Brother Yin went to Ch'ang-sha about three months ago. The Lord is still using him there. Mrs. Yin will come north to stay for awhile. Please remember Sister Chang Hsiu-fong when you pray. The illness she contracted after childbirth cannot be healed easily. May the Lord be merciful to her and heal her. Thank the Lord, His grace to me is greater than what I am worthy of. I am "cold" so many times, but the Lord repeatedly draws me with His love. My heart cannot but be drawn towards Him. It is true that the Lord's love is deeper as time goes by, and His grace is greater as the years go by. Please greet the brothers and sisters in the Lord and the ones that I know: Brother Nee, Brother Luan, and Sister Chang. Peace in the Lord.</p><p>Lin Chang Pin-jeng<br />December 20, 1937</p><h2 class="head2">Swatow</h2><p>Peace to Sister X in the Lord:</p><p>I have received the twenty copies of The Open Door which you sent. Yesterday, I received thirty copies that were sent from Hong Kong. This is just enough to distribute to the brothers and sisters. It is a great comfort to learn of the news of all the localities and to know the condition of each of the churches from The Open Door. The meetings here are continuing as usual. Although the brothers have not grown in life much, they have finally learned to live by the Lord's grace and allow grace to carry them through. This is really something to thank and praise the Lord for! Brother James Chen came to Swatow last month. After holding a two-week Bible study, he and some of the brothers went to Yi-Yang to preach the gospel. I have heard that Satan worked mightily to try to close the door of the gospel. But if the Lord has opened the door of the gospel, who can close it? The brothers left a good impression, and they are prepared to go out a second time. We really thank and praise the Lord for this! They all came back today. They will rest for three or five days, and then they will go out again. Please remember them in prayer. Please send us The Open Door as it is published. I am sending you an order form and am wiring X dollars through the post office for printing costs. Please tell me when you have received it. Rejoice in the Lord!</p><p>Representing the brothers of the assembly in the Lord's name in Swatow,<br />Chai Gi-chen, Hsie Tze-shun, Zan Tsao-hua<br />January 10</p><h2 class="head2">Canton</h2><p>To my beloved sister in the Lord, Mrs. X:</p><p>I read your letter of the ninth, and it reminded me of the verse: "The things that are impossible with men are possible with God." When I saw you in Hankow, your speech, attitude, and dress all told me how I should learn to be a faithful witness for the Lord. On the one hand, I love and respect you for your change; on the other hand, I marvel at the Lord's power and commit my family more zealously before Him and ask Him to change them also. The beloved in the Lord are more dear than sisters in the flesh. I always feel that seeing a brother or sister in the Lord, or even hearing their voices, can give me great blessing and joy. Even if there is a yoke we must bear together, it is always light. When the need calls for our laboring together, we will always find the Lord's leading in our labor. We should pray for and remember one another. If our loneliness satisfies the Lord and our loss contributes to the Lord's gain, we are willing to be lonely so that the Lord may fully capture our heart! But no matter how willing we may be, we cannot satisfy or enable Him to gain anything if He does not give us grace to preserve us. In Canton all the meetings except the Lord's table stopped on September 21 because there were frequent air raid drills and the roads were often blocked. Many brothers and sisters moved to Hong Kong or the countryside after August 18. There are only a little over ten brothers and sisters left in Canton. There are air raids every day, but thank the Lord for His special grace. All is peaceful. May you have peace in the Lord. Please greet Brother Yu-zhi for me.</p><p>Sun Zhu Ming-seng<br />December 14, 1937</p><h2 class="head2">Yi-Lin Town, Northern Kiangsu</h2><p>Greetings to Sister X in the Lord:</p><p>It has been twenty months since we said good-by to each other in Shanghai. Thank the Lord that He wants us to learn to walk on the narrow way during this time. There have been miracles, and sinners have been saved because the Lord is with us. This is all out of the Lord's mercy, and we thank the brothers and sisters for praying for us. The church in Yi- Lin has been affected by the war in that more and more people are losing their jobs. They are poor, cold, and pitiful. I can only do my best and pray for them before God. The village assemblies in the region of northern Kiangsu are doing better than the cities and towns. They do not have the fear of airplanes, and they also have their harvest. They are not in any real hardship. Brother Chiu has taken the farm back since his mother passed away; he does not have any problems making a living. Brother Yung-feng is now farming ten acres of land, and his son, Wen-li, is the principal of an elementary school. They can still eke out a living. Brother Yung-t'ung opened a tofu shop this fall, and his business is doing well. His second son, Wen-fu, is learning to operate a sewing machine here. His third son, Wen-tseng, is helping out in the tofu shop. The rest of his children are still in school. Everyone in the family is well. This is a summary of their individual conditions. Please continue to pray for them. Peace to you. Peace to Brother Nee, Miss Chang, Miss Liu, and all the brothers and sisters!</p><p>Wu Wei<br />October 24, 1937<br />[Address omitted]</p><h2 class="head2">Shanghai</h2><h2 class="head3">One</h2><p>To my dearest brother in the Lord, Philip:</p><p>After coming to Lan-chou in November, I returned to Hangchow in the beginning of December for ten days. Business was suspended because of the air raids. In the middle of the month, most of the people moved out because of the rumors. Six of my colleagues and I went to take refuge in Ning-Po for a week. I left for Shanghai on the twenty-fifth and arrived on the twenty-sixth. I have been here for ten days. I met with Sister Miao and Sister Tso and learned that you, your wife, and Sister Jing-huai had gone to live in Hong Kong temporarily. This comforted me. Miss Tso tried to get me a job in the business management section of Dr. Stearn's new Paralytic Hospital. I heard that Dr. Stearn said I can do it for a short time, so I now have a temporary job. I am sending you this quick letter because I have to rely on the Lord more, not because I have lost my job. You do not need to worry about me. The future of the oil industry is up in the air. If this continues for a long time, it will be difficult to keep a job. I hope you will pray for me. I do not know how long I will stay here. All the brothers in Shaohsin have lost their jobs. Some in Shanghai have lost theirs as well. May the Lord provide. The brothers and sisters left in Hangchow are Ruan Chi-yu, Mrs. Ruan and their baby, Brother and Sister Ah-lai, Brother Lee Kwei-sien, Brother Huang Tsai-ching, and his old mother. May the Lord protect us. Brother Ma entrusted the utensils used for the table meeting to Brother Ruan before he left. The second time I returned to Hangchow, I also broke bread at the Ruan's house. Brothers Chiu, Ma, Ming-jing, Lin, Kwei, and Shih were in Jin-Hwa on the seventh of last month. Brother Jun-dao and Hao-ran are in Lan-Si. I do not know where the elderly Brother Hu from Lan-Si is. I do not know whether my family has left Lan-Si. Brother Kuang-hua and his wife have arrived in Shanghai. There was a fellowship meeting for brothers and sisters at Wen-teh Lane on January 1 which I also attended. There was a children's meeting last night. The Lord showed me His glory in the little boys and girls, and I was very delighted. Brother Chao Shih-guang preaches the gospel on the sixth floor of the Da-Sin Company. I went with Brother Kwang-rong yesterday afternoon to attend. There were two thousand people in the audience. The message was full of the power of the Holy Spirit. I also attended a Bible study yesterday with Brother Kwang-rong. I have already tracked down Miss Tso's younger sister. I sent her news in another letter, but I knew that you would worry. Therefore, I thought I should mention it. Health and peace in the Lord.</p><p>Your little brother,<br />Yang-teh<br />January 4</p><p>(I am temporarily staying in the Fang's home at 87 Ai Lai Ke Road in the French Concession. Although there is no work to do, I still go to the Mei Fu Company Headquarters at 94 Canton Road every day.)</p><h2 class="head3">Two</h2><p>Sister X:</p><p>I left Hong Kong on the twenty-third and was led by the Lord the entire way. I arrived safely in Shanghai on the twenty-eighth. Yesterday I received your letter of the twenty-fourth which was forwarded from Hong Kong. Thank you for your care in the Lord. I really beg the Lord that I may know Him more, that I may learn to spend my remaining time more watchfully, and that I may be more godly in my living. Please pray for me. I ask the Lord to guide me as to which road I should take in my future so that I might remain in His ordained will and never veer from His will. I do not want to choose the broad way of my own will. I only want the Lord to gain something and the Lord's will to be done. I also deeply believe that the Lord will accomplish my heart's desire for Him. Sister Li Li-ying has an intestinal infection. It is very serious. Please pray for her. She almost died a few days ago. God has heard my prayer recently, and she is somewhat better. However, she is still unconscious. Sister Shen Shi-hua's mother had a stroke, but she is better now. Peace in the Lord. Please greet Sister Chang, Sister Wang, and Mrs. Yuan. Greet Brother Yu-chih also.</p><p>Your sister,<br />Fu-ru<br />January 6</p><h2 class="head2">Shaohsin, Chekiang Province</h2><p>To my beloved brother in the Lord, Mr. X:</p><p>I received the large package you sent through Mr. Hsie. May the Lord give you faithfulness and prudence in distributing food among the poor in His household. The warplanes bombed Siao-Shan, and the city is completely burned to the ground. The people of Shaohsin are in terror. They are gradually moving to the mountainous country; the streets of the city are deserted and desolate. Most of the brothers and sisters in the city have moved to the villages in the hills, but Brother Shan Kai-fen is still responsible for the meetings. There are very few people in them though. Many believers have gone to the region of Ping-Shui, but they are scattered in all the villages. No meeting has been raised up yet. My third elder brother, Ji-pu, has also moved to Shi-Chien-Chun in Ping-Shui. (Mailing Address: Mr. Hu in Shi-Chien, c/o Loh-Ching-Mo Lime Store, West Road Intersection, Ping-Shui, Shaohsin.) My family also plans to move to Shi-Chien. We are still in Hua-She because my wife has not agreed yet. The church in Hua-She continues as usual; however, it is hard to make a living, and the environment is frightening. Brother Tang Shou-ling came to give a conference in the region of Nan-Sha, and the churches had great progress. I also went to visit them. There are many who practice living in Christ, rejoicing always, praying without ceasing, and giving thanks in all things. They also are putting their wandering thoughts under control. I received a letter from Brother Hsie Yin-seng of Shanghai saying that he had no news of his company's store in Soochow nor of Brother Kao Guo-jeng. The warehouse in Shanghai was destroyed, and he lost more than one thousand dollars. He has goods in warehouses in Huchow, Soochow, and Hangchow, as well as a house and furniture in Hangchow. If these are also damaged, he may be in debt. I hope you will remember him in prayer. With regard to the gospel work, it depends on the environment. There is a need in the region of Ping-Shui. No one has preached the gospel there because the people in the hill villages have deep-rooted superstitions. We hope the Lord will open a door for us for the gospel, and we hope that you will pray for us. Peace in the Lord. Greet Sister Lee, Sister Chang, and Brother Tsi-yi.</p><p>Your little brother,<br />Hu Ji-tang</p><p>(This letter was mailed from Hua-She, Shaohsin, Chekiang.)</p><h2 class="head2">Hong Kong</h2><p>To my dearly beloved in the Lord, Sisters X and X:</p><p>An airmail letter from Sister X and another letter from Sister X were recently forwarded to me from Canton. Last night I read Sister X's airmail letter. They have updated me concerning everything. Since my arrival in Kowloon, I have been very busy and do not have much time to write. This is the reason I have not written to you sooner. Thank you for your love and your constant remembrance of me. It really is the Lord's marvelous grace. On the first day of this year, I found myself weeping. May the Lord press me to pieces so that His life may flow out! If the Lord does not give grace, what can I do?</p><p>Thank the Lord for bringing me here so that I might have an opportunity to serve the Lord among the sisters. I did not want to come to Hong Kong, but after praying, I knew that the Lord wanted me here. It is a chance to learn to serve Him. After I saw this, I packed up and came immediately. As I was preparing to come, some bad news arrived. Some people were even moving back to Canton. The boats between Canton and Hong Kong are full of people every day. After I arrived in Kowloon, the Lord showed me that my coming was according to His good will. I am now living with Sister Chang, who is on her way from Foochow to Southeast Asia, and with  Sister Sung An-hwei from Tsinan, who came here to escape the war. We have all received the Lord's grace and are safe. I am really in fear and trembling before God, beseeching Him to preserve me and to give me a spirit of wisdom and revelation so that I would know how to serve the sisters with His love and how to handle everything. The brothers and sisters are all well. Peace to you in the Lord. Please greet Sister Chang Chi-nien and Sister Yuan Chou Jieh-min. That's all for now.</p><p>Sun Zhu Ming-seng<br />January 6<br />[Address omitted]</p><h2 class="head2">Yuchung, Kansu Province</h2><p>To all my dear elder brothers in the Lord:</p><p>I was overjoyed to receive The Open Door (second issue)! The only problem was that my issue came so late. I was late in learning about the travels of the brothers and late in my rejoicing. Please do not forget me, this weak little brother in the Lord, because I think of you always. When I read The Open Door, I saw that all the brothers and sisters were very busy with the work and that you were laboring physically and in heart. I was moved to tears! Although we are living in difficult times, you do not cease to labor, but joyfully preach the gospel in all places. You also care for the brothers and sisters in each locality who have troubles. This sweet love has really encouraged my heart. The area in which I live witnesses no suffering and no work either. How long will I be in this useless state? I really want to go where you brothers are. I would be happy to do even the smallest task, although I do not know when the Lord will allow it. When I was meeting in my home in 1935 (Yih-Shi, Shansi), I wanted to go with Brother Yang Shao-tang. However, there is much red tape in leaving Kansu, and my environment did not permit it. At that time I vowed that I would serve the Lord four years later. It has already been three years, but I have not seen any sign from the Lord of using me. I do believe I am still the Lord's. As long as what I do is for the Lord, I trust that I am working for Him. Please pray for my weakness. I would like to continue to order three copies of The Open Door. I am sending X dollars with this letter to meet the needs of the brothers and sisters who lack. Peace to you in the Lord.</p><p>Your little brother in the Lord,<br />Lee Geng-shun<br />January 9<br />[Address omitted]</p><h2 class="head2">A Letter from Brother Chu Wen-yao<br />on a Journey</h2><p>Sister X in the Lord:</p><p>I have received your letter. I really thank you for your care in the Lord. A few days ago I was hindered by the Lord from going to Chungking. At that time I was very puzzled and did not know what God wanted. Even though we can be wrong, God is never wrong. When I returned to the meeting hall, I suddenly received a telegram telling me to go home to Shanghai with the travel money enclosed. I really thank God. I am now ready to go to Hong Kong and then on to Shanghai. In my heart I do not want to waste too much time in the city. I want to go to Yunnan or the surrounding countryside. I am praying about it now. I do not mean to say that I can do anything, because I know I am not worthy. However, I ask the gracious Lord to have mercy on me. Please pray for me. Peace in the Lord! Please greet Brother Chang and Miss Wang.</p><p>Chu Wen-yao<br />January 3</p><p>(A letter from Hong Kong says that Brother Chu arrived safely in Hong Kong.)</p><h2 class="head1">MISCELLANEOUS NEWS</h2><p>(The following are excerpts from Brother Lan Tsi-yi's letters from the period between December 29, 1937 to January 22, 1938. He is from Hankow&mdash;Editor.)</p><p>(1) There is one matter to report that requires prayer in one accord. Since I left the orphanage in Hankow, the management was handed over to the X denomination. Not long ago the chief administrators of the denomination mentioned to Brother Yu Shiang-shan that they wanted to close down. However, most of the students in the school do not have homes to return to. Brother Yu was wondering what to do when he heard that the founder of the school, Mr. Lee Ju-shen (the manager of Liu-Ho-Gou Steel Foundry), had come to Hankow. Brother Yu wrote a letter to him and made an appointment to see him. Mr. Lee definitely did not want to allow the orphanage to be closed. If the denomination did not want to run it, he asked Mr. Yu to work out the details for dissolving the partnership with the denomination and then manage it himself. Mr. Lee would be responsible for all of the costs. He also asked Brother Yu to ask me to come back and run the school. Mr. Lee then gave Brother Yu some money on the spot and told him to save X dollars for use after the denomination stopped managing the place. He also said that the daily costs could be sent to him by mail and he would wire the money back. Brother Yu told me this last night and asked me to take the job. (Of course, this would be after all the rice in the school has been eaten and the denomination leaves.) I listened to him and only promised to pray about this matter. I really feel that God must initiate this matter. When God calls people, He bears the full responsibility and it is enough. I was personally called to this occupation, but I want to wait for God Himself to move. I only want to walk in God's way without going off. I am telling you this to ask for your prayers and any advice you can give me.</p><p>(2) Brother Chen Hsi-wen went to Ch'ang-sha on December 29. He really saw the Lord's marvelous arrangement and full provisions in the matter of buying his tickets.</p><p>(3) Brother Zhang Ji-wu left Hankow for Ch'ang-sha on January 2. He sent a letter from Ch'ang-sha on January 17 saying that he was planning to go to Kuei-yang sometime around the twentieth.</p><p>(4) Sister Ma Min-jen and a Sister Yao arrived safely in Hankow on January 3. On January 13 Mr. Luan sent a letter to Sister Ma Min-jen exhorting them to go to Hong Kong. She prayed about it and felt that she should go to Hong Kong and that I should accompany them. If I did not accompany them there, I would still have to go to Hong Kong for a very important mission. I plan to meet for a long talk with Mr. Lee Ju-shen concerning what to do with the orphanage. Then I will know how to make arrangements for these children when I return. Brother Yu also approves of my going to personally meet and discuss the practical matters with Mr. Lee. However, I am praying earnestly to see how God would lead me in this matter. Please pray earnestly for this. "This is pure and undefiled religion before our God and Father: to visit orphans and widows in their affliction" (James 1:27). This word is always in my heart. Sister Ma is waiting for a sleeper seat on the train. Whenever she is ready, we will set out. Please do not worry. But I do hope you will pray for us.</p><p>(5) Brother Wang Sin-sheng (Sister Wang's uncle) came to a meeting on January 3 and said that his wife had arrived safely in Yi-Yang. Brother Sin-sheng has found a job. They now live in the meeting hall.</p><p>(6) Brother Han Fu-sheng and Brother Zhang Gung-jih are both well in Ch'ang-Teh and Yuan-Jiang. Brother Zhang may still be able to find some work. (This needs prayer.)</p><p>(7) Brother Li Tsan-ting found a job in the Wu-ch'ang County government with the help of Mr. X. He has moved from the countryside to Hankow to work in the provincial capitol.</p><p>(8) The condition of the assembly in Hankow is very good. Although the brothers and sisters that were once here have all scattered, many new brothers and sisters have come.</p><p>(9) Brother Liu Chu-fei, Sister Liu Mei-jen, and Sister Liu Yu-jen left Hankow for Ch'ang-sha.</p><p>(10) Sister Wu's desire to leave Hankow has already cooled off. She is probably not going to go to Hong Kong in the near future.</p><p>(11) A Sister Chang Kuo Ji-jen has recently attended the Lord's Day meetings. Last week she came to remember the Lord with us. She mentioned that she knew Sister Wang. Brother Wang Ching-shan introduced his cousin's wife to us. She is also a good sister.</p><p>(12) Many of the brothers and sisters who lost their jobs in Hankow have now found work. Praise the Lord! He willingly inclines His ear to our prayer! He remembers His people!</p><p>(13) On the morning of January 22, Missionary Jieh came here from Chu-Wo in Shansi. She said that she would be going home by way of Hong Kong. She asked me about the time of the meetings, and tomorrow evening she will come to the table meeting. In Hankow she stays at the China Inland Mission Workers' House.</p><p>(The following are excerpts from Shanghai's Brother Ho Yueh-chiao's last two letters&mdash;Editor.)</p><p>(14) San-Chiao-Bu cannot receive letters directly. A person who came to Shanghai from that area said that Brother Chou Hsin-yih, Brother Tang Shou-ling, and their families were all in a place near there called Yah-Dan-Ou. They were all doing well.</p><p>(15) Brother Luh Tze-ming plans to move to Hankow because the Shanghai Youth Book Store has closed. He is still in Shanghai.</p><p>(16) The Christian will not be published for awhile. It is too difficult to send out because the subscribers have moved around too much.</p><h2 class="head1">LETTERS RECEIVED FOR OTHERS</h2><p>(1) Two letters from Lungkow for Ms. Chang Jia-yu.</p><p>(2) One letter from Hsinchih for Miss Lo Jing-hwei.</p><p>(3) One card from Chen Kuo-yang of Ch'ang-sha for Mr. Rui Di-min.</p><p>(4) One letter from Singapore for Brother David Hsu.</p><h2 class="head1">RECEIVING AND FORWARDING LETTERS</h2><p>It is difficult to correspond with co-workers in various regions because no one knows where they are or will be. We are willing, therefore, to serve the brothers in this matter. If you have a letter you want us to forward, please send it c/o P. O. Box 84, Hankow, and we will forward it.</p><p>Many brothers and sisters are moving around during these difficult times. If you have a letter you want us to forward, please send it to Brother Lan Tsi-yi, Gospel Court, Lane 1, Hsiao-Dong-Jia, Hankow. Please write the return address on the outside of the envelope.</p><h2 class="head1">A WORD ON BEHALF OF THE EDITOR</h2><p>We printed one thousand copies of the first issue of this publication. Because there are brothers and sisters who still do not know what our goal is in putting this publication out, we quote two paragraphs from Mr. Watchman Nee's An Open Letter:</p><p class="indent1">For years I have felt the need of a publication which could be used to communicate news of the work in all of the localities. A local newsletter belongs to a particular locality and serves a particular church. But we need a paper for the intercommunication of news which will serve all the localities, that is, one which will serve the work. The name, The Open Door, was chosen much earlier, and I had hoped that others would be raised up by the Lord to bear its responsibility. This was my hope because, on the one hand, there is the need, and on the other hand, my special stand makes it impossible for me to undertake the task myself. If this had been undertaken by someone else, it would have been merely personal and done by someone who was gifted to do it. But if I were to do it, it would become official and would be based on my position. Therefore, in order to avoid this, I dared not move for years.</p><p class="indent1">I never believed that this newspaper would be issued under this kind of circumstance, at this time, and in this place. Now I must do what I did not wish to do. However, please keep in mind always, brothers, that this is a personal ministry and not the instrument of an organization. If any co-worker or church in any locality is unwilling to see their news appear in this publication, please say so in order that none might be offended in this matter. But I do wish that I could receive news from all the localities so that those who are concerned for you could make intercession.</p><p>The letters in this issue have already clearly described the itineraries of the co-workers, so we did not make a separate column.</p><p>It is difficult for the post office to deliver the mail. A letter that is not sent by airmail usually takes more than a month to reach its destination. Therefore, some letters that are sent later arrive first and some that are sent earlier arrive later. Printed matter is even slower. Therefore, letters with important matters should be sent by airmail, if possible, c/o P. O. Box 84, Hankow. Thank you.</p><p>We may not be able to always get every issue of this publication into the hands of the brothers and sisters, so please pay attention to the points mentioned in the previous issues. We will repeat them again:</p><p>(1) Date your letters. Write the return address clearly and in detail. Include the name of the province.</p><p>(2) Please notify us immediately if your address changes. When a battle occurs in an area, we do not know where the brothers and sisters have fled. If there is no communication, we really worry. We also do not want to send things to the wrong address.</p><p>After reading Brother Hsu Jung-jieh's letter in this issue, we thank the Lord for him on the one hand, and we must pray for him on the other hand. It is easy to talk about many things, but you will feel the frustration only when you are put in his kind of situation. May we remember them in our heart often. Yeh-Ji Village does not handle money transfers, so if there are any offerings for them in the future, it would be best to send them in care of Mr. Huang Chung in the Customs Office in K'un-ming, Yunnan.</p><p>Brother Watchman Nee said in the first issue, "Actually, to go to the inland regions under the present circumstances is more difficult and more unsure than before. But we should trust in God rather than men and should know that our provision and protection are from heaven." Therefore, we hope that the brothers and sisters would not draw back because of the difficulties which the brothers and sisters have encountered in pioneering in the distant regions. On the contrary, we must rise up at the news and pursue on. When we sing the hymn, "Must I be carried to the skies on flowery beds of ease, while others fought to win the prize and sailed through bloody seas?" what effect does it have on our heart? Should we not say to the Lord, "In the name, the precious name, of Him who died for me, Through grace I'll win the promised crown, Whate'er my cross may be."</p><p>This publication is being edited in Chungking and printed and mailed out in Hankow. We cannot predict how long the editors will be here. Therefore, news of the work and the churches should still be sent to the Gospel Book Room, P. O. Box 84, Hankow. Localities that have access to airmail can send letters in the near future directly to Ruth Lee, c/o Mrs. Yuan, 4-3 Shang Chang Chia Garden, Chungking, Szechuan.</p><p>Ruth Lee<br />January 26, 1938, in Chungking</p><h1 class="series">* * *</h1><p>The emphasis of The Open Door is the gospel work in all the localities. In this publication we will print:</p><p>(1) Articles concerning the principles of the work</p><p>(2) News of the work</p><p>(3) News of the churches</p><p>We are temporarily publishing in Hankow. It is difficult to predict whether or not we will move. However, as long as Hankow does not have problems with the mail, our mailing address is still: Gospel Book Room, P. O. Box 84, Hankow. This publication is not for sale. We trust in God for the supply of its needs.</p><p>We only printed one thousand copies for the first issue. We cannot supply those who asked for earlier issues. We increased the print quantity to six thousand copies for the third issue. Whoever wants one can write and ask for it.</p><p>Whoever wants this publication must clearly write the name, address, and number of copies requested and send it to Gospel Book Room, P. O. Box 84, Hankow. Whenever a subscriber's address changes, please notify us so that we do not send it to the wrong address.</p><h2 class="head1">ANNOUNCEMENTS</h2><p>(1) This publication is being temporarily published in Hankow. Therefore, any news concerning the work and the churches in each locality, any subscriptions, and any questions should be sent directly to the Gospel Book Room, P. O. Box 84, Hankow.</p><p>(2) The Gospel Book Room has established a separate office in Hankow. Any province, city, or county that wants to buy books from this book room can buy them directly from Hankow. Those who live in Hankow can come personally to buy them at Gospel Court, Lane 1, Hsiao-Dong-Jia, Hankow.</p><p>(3) The post office no longer accepts large packages of printed materials, so once this publication is printed, we will send one or two copies by the quickest method to each locality. Then we will send a large number of copies to the responsible brothers in each locality and ask them to pass them out to all the brothers and sisters in the meetings. Then we will send them out according to the subscription lists. Therefore, the brothers and sisters in each locality should clearly write their name, address, and the number of copies ordered if they want us to send an issue to them directly. If you do not send us your address, please borrow a copy from the responsible brother in your locality.</p><p>(4) We will do our best to distribute offerings to the brothers and sisters in need. However, some localities do not accept wired money any longer; nor do we know where some of the brothers and sisters have moved to. Therefore, we ask God to care for the brothers and sisters in tribulation in these difficult times on the one hand, and we hope that the brothers and sisters who have news would send the details to us by airmail or express mail on the other hand. If there are offerings or letters, please send both to Brother Lan Tsi-yi or Miss Ruth Lee, P. O. Box 84, Hankow.</p><h1 class="title">ISSUE NO. 5</h1><h2 class="head4">(P. O. Box 84, Hankow, March 1938)</h2><h2 class="head1">NEWS CONCERNING THE WORK</h2><h2 class="head2">The Work in the Remote Regions,<br />Yunnan Province</h2><h2 class="head3">One</h2><p>To the brothers who have been called together in grace:</p><p>We had a week-long special gospel conference beginning February 7 at two o'clock every afternoon in the meeting place of the local church in K'un-ming (next door to the Tung Hsing Pharmacy, Tung-Ren Street). I was responsible for it, but Brothers Chou Kang-yao, Chou Hung-bao, Chang Jing-yuan, and Chen Hsi-wen all helped quite a bit. The Lord did a great work for the sake of His honorable name. Many people desired the Lord's word and came forward with enthusiasm. The brothers and sisters were busy bringing friends and relatives to the meetings, and everyone was very living. Every day the audience filled the hall to overflowing. There were not enough chairs, so new chairs had to be added. The only exception was on the twelfth, when it rained and the audience was slightly smaller. The Holy Spirit did a marvelous work, and most of the audience was touched. After the meeting the brothers and sisters prayed for those who wanted to receive the Lord. They also spoke personally with those who still did not dare to believe in the Lord, exhorting and encouraging them. The number of those who received salvation eventually became quite large. The last day saw the greatest number in attendance. We could see God's blessing from beginning to end. The Lord willing, we will have several special edification meetings beginning Thursday evening. This will render a group of lambs more understanding concerning the truth they must believe and the road they must walk after salvation. Many brothers and sisters are ready to be baptized into the Lord's name. May the Lord increase His work in the future by saving more sinners into the local churches to glorify His great name. We hope that the brothers and sisters in the Lord will not forget to help us through prayer.</p><p>Brothers Hsu Jung-jieh and Hu Yi-min are still working in Yeh-Ji. (I heard that Mrs. Hsu had a baby girl on January 19.)</p><p>Sisters Yu Su-jen and Rachel Lee arrived safely in K'un-ming on the fifteenth of the month. When they arrived at Ho-Kou, they had no trouble entering the territory because they were helped by Brother Chen Ho-sheng. They arrived at Ho-Kou one day and were able to leave the very next day. It was very different from my first time of coming to Ho-Kou. Brother Ho-sheng's job transfer to Ho-Kou certainly was the Lord's good arrangement. I hope that a local church will be built up there also. Brother Chou Hung-bao was sick with an intestinal infection, but thank the Lord for hearing the prayers of the brothers and sisters. He is completely well now, and he is able to go out to help with the work. I have heard that he will go to Luh-Liang (in the eastern part of Yunnan, about two or three days from K'un-ming) to work next month.</p><p>Brother Chou Kang-yao and his wife are temporarily doing some work for the Lord in the Hwei Tien Hospital. I have heard that the director of the hospital is very much in one accord with us concerning the matter of furthering the gospel in the hospital. He welcomes the brothers and sisters preaching the gospel to the nurses and patients. I have heard that Brother Chou will work in Chu-Jing in the near future.</p><p>Sister Chen Huei-sien is still in K'un-ming doing much individual gospel preaching and visiting. Her burden is still for the countryside, and if the Lord wills, she will go with Brother Chou to Luh-Liang.</p><p>Sister Hsiao Ru-chuan and an elderly sister, who loves the Lord, went to work in Mong-Tze, Lin-An (southern Yunnan) and Shi-Ping on the fourteenth of the month. Sister Hsiao is from Shao-Wu in the north of Fukien and has been working for the Lord in Yunnan for years. She has read The Christian and the other publications of the Gospel Book Room for years. Since the church in K'un-ming was established, she has voluntarily taken a stand with us based on the scriptural ground of the church.</p><p>As for my own work, I plan to go work in Mong-Tze, Jien-Shui, and Shi-Ping if the Lord wills. All of these places are in the southern part of Yunnan. Later, if the Chou brothers go to work in Chu-Jing, I will go and work with them for awhile. Thank the Lord, He has opened a door for us to preach the gospel in Ning-Er and Meng-Ke (in the southwestern part of Yunnan). My old classmate, Chen Jao-fang (a believer also), is in Ning-Er where he is working in the field of health. A Western sister of whom I have spoken before, Sister Hai, is in Meng-Ke. She is preaching the gospel there. If the Lord allows, I will also go there to preach the gospel.</p><p>The most difficult thing about the work in the interior of Yunnan province is the traveling. One must walk most of the way, ride a horse, or ride in a sedan chair. There are bandits in some areas who appear and disappear on and off and cause trouble. I hope that the brothers and sisters will pray more for the work in the remote regions and also pray that I would have the utterance to be able to boldly speak the mysteries of the gospel (Eph. 6:19). Peace to you!</p><p>Your brother,<br />K. H. Weigh<br />February 17</p><h2 class="head3">Two</h2><p>Brother Watchman:</p><p>I was helped in the second issue of The Open Door by your frank teachings in the Lord! The work of the local church has not started here. In the past, it was all my own work. We have recently rented a local house in Shi-Ping for a meeting hall, and I have rented a portion of it from the church because there were extra rooms. I am preparing to go out to work, but I have not been able to leave because some sisters are undergoing trials. After one sister believed in the Lord, her husband, who was on business, rushed home from another county. He promised to leave her alone if she would only deny her faith, but that he would kill her if she would not deny her faith. This sister would not back down because she hoped in the Lord's appearing. She was beaten and chased out of the home. (This was the first day of the Chinese New Year.) Although many people tried to reconcile the situation, it was to no avail. The brothers and sisters met that evening to desperately petition the Lord. Thank the Lord, the next evening, without any explanation, her husband asked the people to bring her back. He has not persecuted her since. The next day another sister received news from some people that her beloved son had been attacked by bandits on his way home for the Chinese New Year and had been cut into several pieces. It is impossible to describe this sister's grief. Thank God, He is still preserving her to stand in His grace. Through these circumstances the brothers and sisters have manifested the Lord's love. If the Lord is willing, I will go to Bao-Shiu to do pioneering work on the seventh of this month (Bao-Shiu belongs to the second region in Shi-Ping). My family will still stay in Shi-Ping. Peace in the Lord.</p><p>Your weak brother in the Lord,<br />Lin Kwang-chao<br />January 3<br />[Address omitted]</p><h2 class="head2">The Future of the Work<br />in Yi-Yang and Ch'ang-Teh, Hunan Province</h2><h2 class="head3">One</h2><p>Brother Lan:</p><p>The work in Ch'ang-Teh has already begun, so I will not return to Yuan-Jiang for awhile. Yesterday, I moved into the upstairs of the meeting hall. There is a room that I have rented myself. The rest of the building is shared by the assembly and the Chiu-Shih Tutorial School. They each pay half of the rent. The Lord really prepared this house for us. At this time it would be impossible to find a more appropriate building. We had a good meeting yesterday. The brothers and sisters were smiling and praising the Lord with joy. A brother said that he never thought that there would be so much work to do in Ch'ang-Teh. There is a group of newly saved brothers and sisters who really want to pray for the work in this locality. The present condition seems to indicate that the work will turn out to be very profitable here. I still need to find a building with a storefront for preaching the gospel. I would like to do a good gospel work during the Chinese New Year. I hope you will help me with your prayers. I have heard that the Lord has already raised up a group of brothers and sisters in one accord in Yi-Yang. I hope that Brother Chang is standing firm for the Lord there. We should spread out and not gather together in one place. Peace and well-being in the Lord. Greetings to Brother Chou You-sheng, Brother Hu Lan-sheng, Brother Chu, Brother Lee, and the rest.</p><p>Your brother,<br />Fu-sheng<br />January 24<br />[Address omitted]</p><h2 class="head3">Two</h2><p>I went to Yi-Yang on the ninth and took a private boat on the eleventh to Yuan-Jiang. The brothers and sisters (the refugees) in Yuan-Jiang are all safe in the Lord's grace. They are happy and comforted. The Lord has arranged for Brother Gun-jih to teach English at the T'ao Hua Lun Lutheran Secondary School in Yi-Yang. The principal of this school is Mr. Chen Kai-yuan, who was formerly a classmate of our brother at Shanghai University. They had no prior contact with each other. Their encounter in Yi-Yang is really of the Lord's leading. Through him the Lord resolved the burden of living for Brother Chang's family and also enabled him to stand firm for the Lord in Yi-Yang. There is an old sister who loves the Lord in Yi-Yang, Mrs. Chiu Jung-sheng. She has returned from Ch'ang-sha to the countryside for the Lord's sake. She plans to testify for the Lord with Brother Chang. She has taken the task upon herself of providing hospitality to all the brothers and sisters who pass through Yi-Yang. They began to have a prayer meeting last Lord's Day. I hope you will remember them in your prayer. Brother Chang may move his whole family to Yi-Yang. He is still waiting for the Lord's leading.</p><p>Brother Han is in Ch'ang-Teh. There is a start in the work. The Lord's table has already been established. I have heard that there are about twenty brothers and sisters. Brother Lo's school is set up. He has also started a Living Water Tea Room with the purpose of preaching the gospel. Elderly Brother Chu Teh-hsin is the manager and seven students are the waiters. May the Lord flow living waters out through them.</p><p>Your brother,<br />Lan Tsi-yi<br />February 24, in Hankow</p><h2 class="head2">A Letter from Brother James Chen,<br />Swatow</h2><p>After working in Jieh-Yang, I returned to Swatow to rest for a few days. I had already accepted the invitation of those in Pao-Tai, so I went there to work for a week. Although the opportunity in Pao-Tai is not as good as that in Jieh-Yang, the Lord taught me to "preach the word in season and out of season." After working in Pao-Tai, I was more tired physically. After ten days of rest and with the prayers of the brothers and sisters, I am much better now. I really thank the Lord for His grace! I have already decided to go out to work in the inland regions again on February 2. Four or five localities have already sent invitations. It will take more than a month to finish. I tremble at the thought of the importance of the work ahead. I can only finish the course to testify of the gospel of grace through the petitions of the brothers and sisters. There were a few brothers in Pao-Tai who sympathized with us. Two of them were baptized. I really hope that place will have an assembly also. The area is peaceful. The brothers and sisters are well and comforted. Peace in the Lord!</p><p>Your brother,<br />James Chen<br />January 30<br />[Address omitted]</p><h2 class="head2">The Condition of the Work<br />in Northern, Southern, and Eastern Fukien</h2><h2 class="head3">One</h2><p>Greetings in love to the brothers and sisters in the Lord:</p><p>I saw The Open Door and found out that the Gospel Book Room has a branch store in Hankow. I also found out to my comfort that the brothers and sisters in all the localities had been protected by the Lord! There are a few matters that I want to report to you; I hope you will take time to read them:</p><p>(1) Because The Christian is free, many who do not desire spiritual food and light send in a postcard asking for five or six copies per person (some ask for more than ten copies). They put them away and do not distribute them to anyone. I have seen this with my own eyes in the northern and eastern parts of Fukien. It would be better for each reader to personally subscribe. If many live in one place, the publications can still be sent to one place. They will not be wasted this way.</p><p>(2) Please send two copies of The Open Door to each of these places: (1) Ong Jeh-dun, Hung Shan Bridge, Foochow, Fukien; (2) Dr. Lee You-fu, Tung-Ren Hospital, Lien Shui, Fukien; (3) Christian Gospel House, Tung Tai, Lien Chiang, Fukien; (4) Gospel House in Hsiao-Yao-Hsia Store, Lien-Shui, Fukien; (5) Mrs. Chuang Shih-chi, Dong-Men Ji-Min Hospital, Shao-Wu, Fukien. The places mentioned above all have meetings or will soon have meetings.</p><p>(3) I have recently been led by the Lord to work in eastern and northern Fukien. The Lord has opened the door of the gospel wide for me. I preach on salvation and victory. May the Lord bless and give grace. May you be filled with the Lord's grace!</p><p>Your weak brother,<br />Ong Je-dun<br />January 28<br />[Address omitted]</p><h2 class="head3">Two</h2><p>Beloved brothers in the Lord:</p><p>Juang-Shan-Jen belongs to An-Hsi. It is located upstream from Pei-Shi at an important point. A few years ago Brother Chen Ju-yen worked here for a long time. Later, we could not take care of it because there were security problems. A few months ago Brother Ju-yen and Brother Wang You-yi passed through and worked for awhile. Brother Wang Teng-ming and I had seven days of meetings. We thank the Lord for this assembly. There are about fifty or sixty people in the meetings. There are still fields for our labor in the neighboring regions (in remote areas) which are waiting to be opened up. Please pray for them. Please send me The Open Door regularly. Peace in the Lord.</p><p>Your little brother in the Lord,<br />Chang Tung-yuan</p><h2 class="head3">Three</h2><p>To my respected and beloved sister in the Lord:</p><p>May God bless you and all the sisters more richly in all things through Christ. The sisters here (Pu-Tien) had meetings every afternoon from January 3-8. Sister Wang Yu-Ju and Sister Weigh Kwang-shing translated for me into the local dialect. Thank the Father for giving grace and blessing and for leading us through. On the seventeenth, the Lord willing, we will begin a week of meetings in Han-Jiang. It will be an edification conference for the sisters. Please pray for this, if possible. Brother Ke-san has already gone ahead to Feng-Ting to work. I have heard that some will be baptized there. Three sisters here want to quit their jobs to give themselves full-time to prayer and the ministry of the Word. May the Lord bless and use them much, and may He open a door before them. They are Sister Weigh, whom I mentioned earlier, Sister Fang Ching-ying, and Sister Chen Tien-leh. They have been saved for quite a long time. May God call out more servants who are able to match His heart's desire and answer His call (Matt. 24:45)! Praise and thank the God who is my all! He is light. He is salvation. He is strength. He is my shield. He is my hymn. He is my joy. He is my everything! Sister, may we meet together in His glory soon! 3 John 2.</p><p>Your sister,<br />Bao Hsu-min<br />January 11<br />[Address omitted]</p><h2 class="head3">Four</h2><p>I had just returned from the meeting place when I received your letter. Thank God, and thank you. I already have the second issue of The Open Door. I hope to receive the third issue soon.</p><p>Having been assured of God's leading and arrangement, I accepted the invitation of the brothers and sisters of the assembly in Han-Jiang and arrived on the fifteenth with Sister Weigh Kwang-ying. We began a sisters' conference on the seventeenth, which will tentatively last for a week. Four days of the conference have already passed. Every day there is a prayer meeting from 8:30 to 9:30 a.m. At 10:00 a.m. there is an edification meeting in which we discuss matters of the spiritual life. There is a meeting which starts at 2:00 p.m. to discuss questions related to the sisters' daily living. May the Lord bear the responsibility to work, oversee, bless, correct, and accomplish everything! I hope you can teach me many things. After the conference I will probably have two or three days to contact the sisters individually and talk with them. Because it is the traditional time of the New Year, I want to take this opportunity to pray for a few days with a few sisters who have already been called out, if the Lord is willing. If the Lord delays and keeps me away from home, I will wait for a clearer leading and then go to Sien-You and Feng-Ting to work, because the brothers and sisters there have invited me. Please pray for me. In the future my travels will be more from assembly to assembly; therefore, they will not be too strenuous. I will serve God mainly among the sisters and will have many companions; you do not need to worry about me. There are still two days of the conference left. There are many sisters who have come from the neighboring localities to attend the conference. I am sincerely waiting before God, hoping that He will work beyond our capacity and not be limited in His work by a narrow vessel. May He gain the sisters, and may they boldly dive in and get to know Him. Please greet Mrs. Yuan and the sisters who are with you! Brother Ke-san will go to Amoy and Kulangsu. Brother Tsai-seng has already returned. May we meet before the Lord soon. Peace and health in the Lord!</p><p>Your sister,<br />Hsu-min<br />January 20<br />[Address omitted]</p><h2 class="head3">Five</h2><p>Greetings in love to Sister Lee in the Lord:</p><p>I received and read your letter. You will soon go to Kuei-yang, which is a new place to you. I hope you will take care of yourself for the Lord's sake. When you have time, please write to instruct me so that I may be comforted. I am busy as usual. There is nothing much to tell you. However, the Lord's love and His marvelous leading are too great to be recounted. Praise the Lord! After returning to Fukien, my spiritual condition has been up and down for four months. Although I have no help but the Lord, He has promised, "I will not fail you or forsake you." Hallelujah! It is enough to have the Lord! The Lord opened the way for me this time to temporarily leave Jien-Ou. I passed through two places where I stayed for a few days testifying for the Lord. I finally came here to Chung-An. There is a sister who cares for the souls of her relatives and those in the countryside, and she asked for a special leave of absence from the administrators at the hospital to make the long journey for the sole purpose of paying back the gospel debt. I met her in Jien-Yang (one hundred and twenty miles from Jien-Ou). Although we had never met before, we felt like we were old friends. She asked me to come with her on this trip so that she might have my help in the joyful task of testifying to her relatives and family. As a consequence, I had her as a guide to take me to another county and city to testify. Because it was the end of the old year and the beginning of the new and because each household was very superstitious and busy, we did not have as many opportunities as we had in the other localities I passed through. However, the gospel was preached and all who were predestined to obtain eternal life believed. Chung-An borders Kiangsu province. It is near Wu-Yi-Yan. The scenery is outstanding, and they produce excellent tea here. A new road is being built that will connect this area with Kiangsu province. I hope that when communication is more convenient in the future, many who travel for the Lord will come to the northern region of Fukien so that many will understand salvation and enter into the Lord's name. I have not received the second issue of The Open Door. I think the postal service must have lost it. If you have any news of Sister Tso, please tell me. Sister Juang Shi-chi and Sister Lee Ju-lien left the coastal area four or five months ago and went northwest to Shao-Wu. Their goal is to testify for the Lord in their jobs. Sister Juang sent me a letter a few days ago asking about your recent condition. I have already told her. This letter is too short to hold all that I want to say, and I would have to go on and on. Peace to you! Peace to Sisters Wang and Chang. My two sons are still at boarding school. They have received the Lord's grace and are healthy. Their studies are improving. I know you care about them, so I am giving you their news.</p><p>Your sister,<br />Yu-bing<br />February 3<br />[Address omitted]</p><h2 class="head2">A Letter from Brother Hwa Shi-bin</h2><p>Dear Brother Yueh-chiao in the Lord:</p><p>I was led by the Lord three weeks ago to leave Ning-Hai and work in the region of Huang-Yen and Hai-Men. I have not had any news about the condition of the assembly in Shanghai and the brothers in Kiangsu, Shanghai, and Shao-Shing. I heard that the people in Shanghai were trapped in high inflation. I would imagine that the brothers in Shanghai must be in the same situation. I wonder what the situation really is. Is Brother Chang Kwang-rong still in Shanghai? Does Brother Chang still want to travel to Ning-Hai? I think about him often. Please greet him for me. Praise the Father that He has raised up many young brothers in Huang-Yen who love and pursue the Lord. They sit around me day and night asking how to walk in the Lord's way. Unfortunately, my spiritual life is immature, and my knowledge of the truth is too shallow; therefore, I cannot help them much. Fortunately, Brother Guan En-chiu is my companion. The Lord willing, I hope to go to Wenchow and the region of Ping-Yang. I look at the world situation, and I know that the day for the Lord to be glorified is near. However, the bride (the church) has not made herself ready. Many sinners have not been saved. My spiritual life has not matured. I really do not know how I can face the Lord. Please pray for me. Peace in the Lord!</p><p>Your brother,<br />Hwa Shi-bin<br />December 15</p><p>P.S. Brother Guan sends his greetings.</p><p>(This letter was mailed from Huang-Yen, Chekiang to Shanghai.)</p><h2 class="head2">Sheng County and Sin-Chang</h2><p>The condition of the church in Sheng County is very desolate. I visited several meeting places and preached the gospel. A few people were saved, but there were still many who needed God's grace. I met Brother Yu Cheng-hwa, who lives fifteen miles from me. We hope that there will be an assembly in Sin-Chang, Sheng County, but we are waiting for God to start it. Please pray for this. The Lord willing, I hope to go west after I stay in Sheng County for awhile. Please pray for me. I received a letter from Brother Hwa Shi-bin. The churches in the Ning-Hai area will have a conference beginning the third day of the Chinese New Year. They have invited me to attend, but I wonder what the political situation will be like.</p><p>Lou Chuan-en<br />January 12</p><h2 class="head2">The Work in the Region of Ping-Yang</h2><p>To my dear brother in the Lord, Mr. Watchman Nee, and to the brothers and sisters who work for the Lord:</p><p>We received a copy of The Open Door from Da-San-Yang. By reading it we become acquainted with all of your travels, and we thank and praise the Lord for this. May the Lord bless the work you do and the gospel you preach so that we may be able to fulfill the commission He gave when He sent us to the ends of the earth and so that we may hasten His second coming. We really thank the Lord for causing us to live in this poor and remote region of Ping-Yang where we are peacefully going about our business. Not only so, the Lord has given us grace that we never expected by sending His faithful servant, Brother Hwa Shi-bin, to Ping-Yang. He went to Hu-Shan, Yi-Shan, Wa-Yao-Tou, and Fang-Yen-Hsia strengthening the brothers and sisters in every place. Wherever he preached the gospel, sinners confessed their sins and believed in Christ. On the third and fourth day of this month, we pitched a tent in our locality of Chien-Chang, and he preached the gospel for one day and two nights. The audience poured in, and we had to enlarge the tent. Although the people were very crowded, they kept very quiet throughout the meeting and did not leave until it was all over. Brother Hwa spoke powerfully about how God loves sinners. Every day he sounded the call to those who were under the authority of Satan and about to perish. People in the audience would raise their hands to show that they believed. Thank the Lord, two new people have joined the Lord's Day, Wednesday, and Friday evening meetings. Their attitude is very serious, and they are sincere in obeying Christ. We still need your earnest prayer before the Lord. Pray that God would add saved ones to the church every day, bind Satan, and release the slaves of sin. Please send four copies of The Open Door so that we may constantly know of your travels and work and have fellowship with you in prayer. In this critical time, the remaining days of grace, the most important thing is to pray for one another and to keep in constant contact. May God give peace, and may His Son, Jesus Christ, be with you forever and ever, amen.</p><p>Your weak brothers in the Lord,<br />Ma Hsian-yi, Su Tze-san, Liu Sing-kwang, Su Sheng-chuan<br />January 19<br />[Address omitted]</p><h2 class="head2">The Co-workers' Meeting in Lan-Si</h2><p>Peace to my brother in the Lord, Mr. Nee:</p><p>I received both the money which you wired to me through the Bank of China on the twenty-fourth and your letter of the twenty-fifth. I passed on X dollars to Brother Chen Meng-jao and distributed the rest. Thank the Lord, and thank you. We still meet and work as usual. The children of God are all at peace. All the brothers and sisters who fled to Lan-Si have moved into the countryside. I am still in the city for the meetings and for attending to practical matters. We had a meeting from January 31 to February 4. Ten people attended (elders and co-workers) to consider the kind of work and way God would have us take. Praise God, He has already given us new light, new work, and a new way. From now on, the assembly and the workers, the work and the church, will be separate but will cooperate. In the past the assemblies rallied around the workers. In other words, the workers became the leaders in the church, and the church and the work were mixed up. Now we know that this is not the pattern left by the early apostles. Therefore, we hope to have a conference with the entire congregation to explain these matters to them more fully. There are eight local churches in this area (Lan-Si), one city, two northern townships, and five southern townships. Although there are responsible brothers in each locality who take care of the practical matters in the house of God, very few of the gifts spoken of in Ephesians 4:11 visit to edify the churches. May the Lord raise up some for His name's sake. Please pray for us. I have lived in Lan-Si for twenty years. Throughout these years I have been working for the Lord on the one hand, and practicing medicine on the other hand. However, in the past two or three years, I have gone out to work more and more, and my medical practice has dwindled. I have a feeling in my heart to serve God full-time. I have prayed about this for almost two years. Recently, the environment seems to indicate that God is moving in this direction. I have been more desperate during the past two months as I waited. Do you have any opinion that you can give me? (I know you are busy.) I am asking because I want to walk according to God's will. I hope to speak to you about the rest face to face. May the Lord give you more of His word and commission that you may help and serve us and, by doing so, help and serve the Lord Jesus Christ. May power, honor, and glory be to the Father.</p><p>Your brother in the Lord,<br />Ma Chuan-foo<br />February 8<br />[Address omitted]</p><h2 class="head2">The Women's Work<br />in the Refugee Camps in Shanghai</h2><h2 class="head3">One</h2><p>I go to the refugee camps every morning and return at noon. Every week I speak three times in the first camp to about two hundred people. I am also responsible for the preaching every day in the second camp. Mrs. Lee and Mrs. Lu also go along to help. Sometimes there are more than four hundred people listening, sometimes a little less. Although we have come short in the Lord's work because of our foolishness and unfaithfulness, the Lord still works beyond what we can do. He manifests His glory through the sisters' prayer behind us. One sister bears the responsibility of prayer in the background. Thank the Lord for raising up a supplicating one. He really heard her prayers. Although she never leaves her house, her work is more precious than that of many who run around. Praise the Lord!</p><p>Tso Fu-ru<br />January 27</p><h2 class="head3">Two</h2><p>The work at Jiao-Tung University refugee camp has been completed. Sister Tso has been gone for about two weeks, along with Mrs. Lee Han-shen and Mrs. Lu Tze-ming. We cannot say that God did not bless the work, but we fear that we were not faithful enough. Thank God, we saw His hand in the beginning and end of this work. May we fully trust in Jehovah day by day, and may we rely on His grace rather than on our own wisdom. We thank and praise God all the more for His glory, His faithfulness, and His acts!</p><p>Liu Hwei-fen<br />January 31</p><p>(The preceding two letters were sent from Shanghai to Chungking&mdash;Editor.)</p><h2 class="head2">The Bible Study in Shanghai</h2><p>Brother Watchman Nee was recently in Shanghai, and we invited him to conduct a Bible study on the topic of "The Truth Concerning the Outpouring of the Holy Spirit." The place was 34 Wen-teh Lane, Hardoon Road, every evening from 7 p.m. to 9 p.m., January 31&mdash;February 12. We saw God's blessing. Those attending the Bible study filled the room, and some received the promise of the Holy Spirit from God. We thank the Lord because His promise never changes. May the Lord give extra grace to each believer to receive all the gifts of the Holy Spirit which he should receive.</p><p>(Quoted from Issue No. 99 of the Shanghai Local Newsletter.)</p><h2 class="head2">A Letter from Brother Chai En-shang,<br />Shansi Province</h2><p>I am still waiting for God to give me a clear way. Please do not forget to pray for me. Last week there was a week-long Bible study. Many people desired the Lord. If the Lord allows, I plan to hold another Bible study the week after the Chinese New Year. Please pray for this and ask God to gain some. Sister Chang Chui-hsi of Tai-Ku sent a letter a few days ago saying that she was staying in a Methodist Church protected by the Lord. Thank the Lord, praise the Lord, this region is still peaceful.

I have benefited greatly. Praise Him! Two brothers and four sisters were baptized last Saturday. There really is work to do in Hong Kong, and the sisters really have a need.

We really have benefited much. I deeply feel that any work which does not issue from the Holy Spirit's revelation is dead. Even though something may be spoken, it will not benefit the hearer. Last week Sister Rachel preached the gospel for one week, and some were saved. We will go to Yunnan via Haiphong on February 20. Please pray for us according to the leading of the Holy Spirit.

Although you tasted much suffering and many difficulties, the Lord will not forget you, and your trip will not be in vain. I have been in Singapore for three or four weeks. I am ashamed to say that I am so mediocre that I cannot do much. The brothers and sisters in Singapore really hope that you and Brother Kaung can come and work here. The work on the southern islands has a great and desperate need. After meeting in this hall for two weeks, we have concluded nine evenings of meetings in the True Light Chapel of the Anglican denomination. Starting next Monday we will have four evenings of preaching on the rooftop to the Evangelistic Crusade. Greet Brother Chung Huang, Brother Kwang-tsao, the Chou brothers, and Sister Hwei-sian. May the Lord use you all very much! Peace!</p><p>Your brother,<br />Faithful Luk<br />January 10</p><h2 class="head2">Brother Lan Tsi-yi and the Orphanage</h2><p>Thank the Lord, my meeting with Mr. Lee with regard to the orphanage was satisfactory. He has promised to make up for the shortage in the budget, but he can only support us for one year. He has also agreed to move the orphanage, but he gave me the freedom to decide where we will move. I have been constantly praying for this matter, and I have clearly seen several things concerning this matter: (1) In order to answer to God and man, I cannot shrink back from my responsibility concerning the education of these children. (2) I cannot return to my old hired position in the orphanage. If I do, it will be completely against the leading I received when I quit. Therefore, I have decided to stand on God's side in receiving man's commission. The most marvelous thing is that Mr. Lee and Brother Yu's attitudes toward the commission are similar to mine. They say that they will do their best to supply the money needed to meet the financial needs. They will not interfere with the administration. On the one hand, I feel a great responsibility and cannot avoid being in fear and trembling; on the other hand, I am forced to take this way, so I must look to the Lord for the way ahead. May the Lord prove His faithful Word and precious promises (2 Cor. 12:9) in a weak and useless person like me. My problem now is the matter of moving. In the long run it seems better to move to a safer region, but in order to be close to the care of the brothers and sisters and in the center of the region of my personal work, it seems that I should not move from Wu-ch'ang. In my prayer I feel that it is best to settle ourselves in Wu-ch'ang. The other things that must be taken care of immediately include: (1) finding jobs for the older students, (2) hiring able brothers and sisters to be responsible for administrating and teaching, and (3) finding one or two productive means for income. Please pray for the future of this.</p><p>Your weak member in the Lord,<br />Lan Tsi-yi<br />February 24, Hankow</p><h2 class="head1">THE WHEREABOUTS OF THE CO-WORKERS</h2><p>Brother Watchman Nee left Shanghai on February 15 and arrived in Hong Kong on the seventeenth.

He has shown how He graces His children in many ways in the church in K'un-ming. We should give blessing, glory, wisdom, thanks, honor, power, and might to our God forever and ever, amen.</p><p>(1) The meeting hall: We used to rent a meeting hall at 39 Hwa-Shan South Road in K'un-ming. However, our landlord decided to build a house on some empty land nearby, and he wanted to use the building as a workplace for the carpenters. Therefore, we had to rent another meeting place. Because of the political situation, many people from other provinces moved to Yunnan, making it difficult to rent a proper building. The brothers and sisters looked to God and prayed. Thank the Lord, He is Jehovah-jireh. In a surprisingly short time, He led us to a new, well-lighted and well-ventilated building that can hold about one hundred fifty people. The location is also good. It is in the middle section of Tung-Ren Street in K'un-ming at the east end of Yen-Tse Lane. It does not have a number because it is a new building.</p><p>(2) The meetings: In addition to the table meeting and the gospel meeting on the Lord's Day, there are prayer meetings every Tuesday and Saturday evening at 7:00 p.m. There is a Bible study or testimony meeting every Thursday evening at 7:00 p.m. By the Lord's protection, these meetings have never stopped during the past year, starting in March. Before we found a meeting hall, we met in a brother's house. When we began the table last year, there were a little over ten brothers and sisters. Thank and praise God for His operation. The number of saved ones has increased gradually. Now more than thirty brothers and sisters attend the table meeting. Before Brother K. H. Weigh came to Yunnan, we had Brother Lin Kwang-tsao lead the gospel meetings on the Lord's Day. Afterward, three brothers led it in rotation. At that time there were only twenty or thirty people who would come to hear the gospel (including the brothers and sisters). Thank the Lord, the number has increased, and now eighty or ninety come to hear the gospel (including the brothers and sisters). From February 7-13 of this year, several workers for the Lord held gospel meetings in the meeting hall. Thank the Lord, many believed and received Him. Brother Weigh has decided that on the eighteenth of this month he will have some edification meetings for several evenings in a row.</p><p>(3) Marvelous miracles: When the brothers were preaching the gospel in rotation, a Miss Lee began to attend the meetings. When she was at home, a piece of earth fell from the ceiling and hit her on the head, injuring her brain. She frequently had headaches after this accident. She went to both Western and Chinese doctors, but to no avail. The doctors said that there was no hope of recovery. They exhorted her to give up her studies and take a long rest. When she heard this, she was desperate. Her classmate introduced her to the gospel meetings. Thank and praise the almighty God for leading her to come to the gospel meeting again and again. She received the Lord Jesus as her Savior. One day she was reading in Psalm 103:3, which says, "He pardons all your iniquities;/He heals all your diseases." When she read it, she realized that God was not only her Savior but also her doctor. She prayed desperately that God would heal her sickness and pain. Thank and praise God for listening to her prayer and healing her. Now she is normal and back in school. She also comes to break bread with us. There is another Sister Lee who had been oppressed by demons for many years before she believed in the Lord. She really felt that human life was a suffering. When the evil spirits acted up, she could not sleep for nights. She would lose her temper, get extremely angry, and even hit herself. It seemed as if she was possessed by a demon. Since receiving the truth and believing, she has become very peaceful and happy by relying on the Lord. She was once bound by Satan, but now she has received a wonderful freedom. These are the miracles that the Lord's grace has bestowed upon sinners. Hallelujah!</p><p>(4) Offerings: In the past the offerings from the brothers and sisters did not do much more than cover all the expenses; at the end of the year not much was left. But the church is the house of God, and there should never be a lack. When man has no way, God has a way. The deposit on the meeting hall is very large, and there was not enough in our bank account. The brothers and sisters prayed that God would touch His children to do their best to make an offering. Thank and praise Jehovah-Jireh, on the last Lord's Day before the Chinese New Year, there was enough money in the offering box, including two pieces of gold jewelry and the addition of our bank savings, to more than pay for the deposit and the rent. There was even quite a bit left over. Thank God that His grace exceeds our need. The furnishings inside the meeting hall are sufficient. The Lord supplied all the necessary things by touching His children to cheerfully give. Although what we have mentioned pertains to material offerings, it shows that the brothers and sisters care very much for the house of God.</p><p>(5) Baptisms: Since we began meeting in K'un-ming, those who have believed and been saved have not been baptized. If we continue to delay, it will not be very good. We have already prepared a metal baptistry framed in wood. A baptism meeting will soon be held. More than ten people want to be baptized. We hope that God will give grace on the one hand, and that the Lord will touch those who have not obeyed yet to be willing to render this testimony on the other hand (Mark 16:16).</p><h2 class="head3">The Footsteps of the Brothers and Sisters</h2><p>(1) Brother Chang Jing-yuan and Sister Chang Jing-shia arrived safely in K'un-ming from Ch'ang-sha on January 13.</p><p>(2) Sister Wang Juh-ching arrived safely from Hankow in the middle of January.</p><p>(3) Brother Chen Ho-seng, who used to work in the Euro-Asia Airlines Office in Peking, was transferred to their K'un-ming office as the radio operator. He was transferred again on January 9 to be the radio operator in Ho-Kou. When Sister Yu Suh-jen and Sister Rachel Lee came to Yunnan, they entered the province at Ho-Kou. They did not have any difficulty because Brother Chen was there to take care of them.

My heart often thinks about you. May the Lord bless your share of the labor in the work. I received your letter yesterday and read it. I am well; please do not worry about me. We stayed in Ch'ang-sha for more than ten days. We met the brothers and sisters in the meeting hall, fellowshipping, breaking bread, praying, and testifying together. I stayed in Brother Liu's place in the orphanage. We took the southwest bus and train route at the beginning of our journey. The mountain roads were steep, and the bus was on steep slopes. The higher we climbed, the more dangerous it became. We were racing into the fog, and we felt as if we had left the earth far behind and were closer to the Lord. We feel that Kweichow province is still very barren. It does not seem to have much vegetation. Apart from Zhu-cheng, we did not see any fertile soil. The Han people and the Miao natives live together, and development is slow. There is a great need for the gospel. Please pray for them. K'un-ming is at a higher elevation, but it is flatter and more fertile. It has bountiful produce and a good climate. It does not rain often. Winter is leaving, and the cauliflower is turning yellow. The peas are already full in the pods. Visitors coming for the first time often feel that it is very dry here. We have already acclimated and are doing well. We did not know anyone when we came, but we were thankful to have Brother Chung Huang's gracious hospitality. We stayed in his home for nearly ten days. Now the Lord has prepared a house for us to rent, and we are living in it. Prices are cheaper, so it is easier to make a living. We can live on what I brought for a while longer if we are thrifty. Thank the Lord for His grace, and thank the brothers and sisters for your prayers. All the brothers and sisters in K'un-ming are well. Peace in the Lord! Please greet the brothers and sisters in Hong Kong for me. Please greet Brother Stephen Kaung for me.</p><p>Your little brother in the Lord,<br />Chang Jing-yuan<br />January 26</p><h2 class="head3">Two</h2><p>To Sister X in the Lord:</p><p>I left Hankow on December 29 and arrived in Ch'ang-sha on the thirty-first. Thank and praise the Lord! On the afternoon of January 4, I was able to get my bus tickets without any problem. The buses to Kuei-yang were booked up to April 17. However, one person had made a reservation and did not come to buy his ticket on the fourth, so the ticket office sold me that ticket. My fare was sixty-one dollars and twenty-five cents to travel by bus to K'un-ming. If anyone wants to go to K'un-ming, they should definitely not buy their tickets in Kuei-yang. Some people do not know that they can buy combination bus and train tickets; therefore, when they get to Kuei-yang, they wait for two or three months and still cannot get bus tickets. On the morning of the fifth, I went to the West Station in Ch'ang-sha to wait for the bus. It was 11:30 a.m. before all the people crowded in. The bus did not go for very long before there was a problem with the tire. We waited several hours for help. I was secretly praying. The rescue bus arrived at 6:15 p.m. If it had not come, we would have had to spend the night in a small town nearby, which was certainly dangerous because bandits might have attacked us. We crossed the river into Yi-Yang around 7:50 p.m. and headed for Ch'ang-Teh. By the time we reached Ch'ang-Teh, it was already midnight. I went to the station the next morning to ask whether the bus to Yuan-Ling had come. I waited for one day. The bus to Yuan-Ling did not come until the seventh. We left at 9:00 a.m. and arrived at 5:30 p.m. I boarded the bus at 9:00 a.m. on the eighth and arrived in Zhi-Jiang at 3:00 p.m. We were in Huang-Shian by 5:00 p.m. I spent the ninth through the eleventh in Huang-Shian waiting for the bus to Kuei-yang. I left Huang-Shian at 10:00 a.m. on the twelfth and passed through Yu-Ping Station and Jen-Yuan Station, arriving at Huang-Ping Station at 6:00 p.m. Then I left Huang-Ping at 11:00 a.m. on the thirteenth and passed through Zhung-An, Lu-Shan, Ma-Chang-Ping, Sha-Ping, Kwei-Ding, and Lung-Li. I arrived at the Kuei-yang station at 8:30 p.m. From Hunan to Kweichow, the bus spent one whole day going through the mountains. I heard that the bus which left Ch'ang-sha on the sixth had an accident. Twenty of the twenty-five passengers were injured. But thank the Lord for bringing me through. I also heard the other passengers say that in those five or six days there were no attacks by bandits. The buses are usually attacked and robbed by bandits, who are usually natives of the Miao tribe. They particularly love to rob armed passengers of their weapons. I also thank the Lord that it did not rain between Ch'ang-sha and Kuei-yang because it is difficult for the buses to run when it is raining. I passed out gospel tracts on the fourteenth, and I did not want to leave. I also wanted to rest. I could not have left in any case, because there were only one hundred seventy-five seats on the bus that left for K'un-ming on the fifteenth, and my number was one hundred seventy-seven. It rained on the fifteenth. There were no buses on the sixteenth. There were no passenger buses on the seventeenth either, but I worked out a deal with the station master and was able to take a Corps of Engineers' bus to continue my journey. When we got to An-Shun area, the bus had a flat tire, so we had to wait for several hours. The rescue bus arrived at 4:30 p.m., and we continued on for about twenty minutes to the An-Shun Station. We left An-Shun at 1:30 p.m. on the eighteenth. It was already 5:00 p.m. when we arrived in Kwan-Ling-Chang. The driver said the bus could not continue. It was 7:00 p.m. before help arrived. We drove for several minutes up a deserted mountain and then had to stop at the top because the bus did not have water. All the travelers who had wash basins had to get out to fetch water. After we found water, we continued on our way. We arrived in Yung-Ning Station at 8:30 p.m. We started out again at 9:00 a.m. on the nineteenth and arrived at the Pu-An Station at 4:00 p.m. The driver did not want to continue, so we had to spend the night there. We left Pu-An on the twentieth at 9:00 a.m. and arrived at the Pan-Shian Station at 11:35 a.m. This was the last stop in Kweichow; the bus did not continue on. Pan-Shian has two bus stations, one for Kweichow and one for Yunnan. I had to register at the Yunnan Station to find out about buses. When I boarded the bus on the twenty-first, there were not any seats, so I had to sit on a suitcase. We left Pan-Shian at 9:47 a.m. and arrived in Ping-Yi at 11:50 a.m. The inspection was very rigorous. The bus did not leave until 1:30 p.m. We arrived in Chu-Jing at 3:25 p.m. I left Chu-Jing on the morning of the twenty-second and arrived in K'un-ming at 3:00 p.m. I went first to Deng-Shi Street to see Brother Huang. Then I heard that he had moved to Wen-Miao-Dong Lane, but I did not know the number. I could not find his house, so I had to stay in a hotel for one night. I looked for him again on the morning of the Lord's Day, the twenty-third. I found the place because I heard the sound of the brothers and sisters singing hymns to remember the Lord. The brothers and sisters were very surprised. Thank the Lord, the weather was good from Kuei-yang to K'un-ming (with the exception of Chu-Jing where it snowed for a few minutes). I also thank Him that I was not carsick except for one day, nor did I feel tired. I saw the Lord's grace in all things.</p><p>Your brother in the Lord,<br />Chen Hsi-wen<br />January 24</p><h2 class="head3">Three</h2><p>Sister X:</p><p>Our ship left Hong Kong at 4:30 p.m. on the seventh and arrived at Haiphong at 7:00 on the tenth. Brother Tseng, who works at Haiphong, helped us to go on and accompanied us to Ho-Nei (a three-hour train ride from Haiphong). We took a train to Ho-Kou on the morning of the thirteenth. Brother Chen Ho-seng met us at the station and took care of everything for us including acting as a guarantor. On the fourteenth we took another train to Ah-Mei-Jou. On the way we preached the gospel to a clerk with the Communication Broadcast Company and to an official with the railway. God cared for us through them all the way to our destination. We arrived safely in K'un-ming at 5:00 p.m. on the fifteenth. Some brothers and sisters were waiting for us at the station. We are now living temporarily in Brother Huang's house. Along the way we saw beautiful scenery with both mountains and streams. We passed through one hundred eighty tunnels on the three day railroad journey and crossed more than ten iron bridges over mountain valleys between Ho-Kou and K'un-ming. We fully enjoyed the beauty of nature and thought of the words of Psalm 19. We really felt happy. Mountains, streams, flowers, and trees all express God's glory in His creation and His wondrous works. Peace to you all. Greet the sisters.</p><p>Yu Su-jen, Rachel Lee<br />February 16</p><h2 class="head3">Four</h2><p>To Brother X in the Lord:</p><p>The ever-living God is constantly planning for His children. In my travels from Ch'ang-sha, the weather was mainly clear and sunny. When the bus I took left, nobody was going to K'un-ming. The bus should have gone to Ch'ang-Teh to stay the night, but it went on to Yuan-Ling. When we arrived, I found that a Mr. Chao was going to K'un-ming. He had left one day before I did (on the seventh) and should have been ahead of me. But God provided for me, and he was waiting for me. He assisted me the entire way. We arrived in Kuei-yang on the twelfth. On the thirteenth I happened to be reading the Bible in the hotel according to my habit of reading consecutively through the Scripture. It was really marvelous how the Word of God gave me great comfort. Exodus 23:20 says, "Behold, I send an angel before thee, to keep thee in the way, and to bring thee into the place which I have prepared." I held on to this word. On the fourteenth, I boarded the bus at dawn. The road from this point on was a little different. Sometimes there were no porters when we stopped for the night. On the seventeenth we ran out of gas deep in the mountains. It was already 5:00 p.m., and we were twenty miles from the city. All the men ran into the city, but I and a few other women travelers could only wait. When it was almost dark, the people who passed by on the road exhorted us to go into the city because bandits sometimes would appear in that area. The gas had not arrived at 7:15, and everyone was getting frightened. I could only pray. God placed His precious Word before my eyes again in Psalm 27:1, "Jehovah is my light and my salvation;/Whom shall I fear?/Jehovah is the strength of my life;/Whom shall I be dread?" I held on to God's word tightly. It seemed that the gas came at around 8:00 p.m., and we arrived in Pan-Shian safely. We left Pan-Shian a little after 9:00 a.m. on the eighteenth and arrived in K'un-ming at about 3:00 p.m. We were inspected countless times along the way. Some travelers were questioned at almost every station, but I was only questioned twice, once at An-Shun and once when we arrived in K'un-ming. I can say that God's special care was with me the whole way. The weather was very good. Although it rained for two days, it rained while I was in the bus. After the bus stopped, it never rained on me. Oh, I really must thank and praise God! I am now living with a friend named Hsu. Peace in the Lord.</p><p>A weak one in the Lord,<br />Chu Teh-hwa<br />February 21<br />[Address omitted]</p><h2 class="head2">Wu-Chow,<br />Kwangsi Province</h2><p>Dear Brother Lan in the Lord:</p><p>May grace and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ be to you. Since parting from you at the station, I arrived in Canton by the Lord's grace. Although I experienced many hardships and threats along the way, the grace of God was always sufficient. God protected, watched over, and upheld me more carefully and more completely than a loving mother protects her baby in love. I cannot deny the dangers of the Canton-Hankow Railway, neither can I refrain from praising our God, saying, "Jehovah will keep you from all evil; He will keep your soul. Jehovah will keep your going out and your coming in from now to eternity."</p><p>After the train passed through Ch'ang-sha, it would sometimes back up because there were too many trains on the tracks ahead. We would go forward for a day and backwards for a day. After four days and nights, we barely made it to Li-Dong in the middle of the night, because the #22 Canton-Wu-ch'ang Express traveling north had gone off the track at the entrance of the tunnel between the Ying-Teh and Li-Dong stations (about 64 miles from its point of origination); our train had to stop outside the tunnel. It could not go forward, and the passengers were free to get off the train. For awhile everything was in confusion. People were frightened, and we could not make out our way because it was night. There were no hotels and no place to stay the night. I had brought only two pieces of luggage with me, having shipped the rest of my things. Two people left their luggage with me and walked five miles to the southern end of the Li-Dong tunnel to take a train to Canton. Since I had been entrusted with their luggage, I had to be faithful. At dawn I hurriedly boarded a train back to Lien-Jiang and took the Jung-Yuan electric boat to Canton. I traveled for three days under the covering of His blood and did not meet up with any danger. I must honestly say that it was the Lord's covering. When I arrived in Canton, I had to wait for a few days at Brother Shuan's place because my luggage had not arrived. I also went to Hong Kong to visit the brothers in the Lord in Kowloon. The meeting in Kowloon experienced much blessing from the Lord. Because of this trip south, I was able to hear Brother Nee's message. He spoke on the topic of "The Question of Power and Wisdom" on the Lord's Day. The Scripture reference was 1 Corinthians 1:22-31. The main points of the message were: "The Bible manifests God's wisdom, while the Holy Spirit manifests His power. Many of God's children think that if they beg God to make them this and that way, they will become this and that way. They do not know that such prayer is like climbing a tree to get fish. The more they pray, the farther they will be from what they want. We are justified, not because we are worthy to be justified, but because the Lord Jesus, the righteous One who lives in us, makes us righteous. If someone asks who my righteousness is, I can immediately answer that the Lord Jesus is my righteousness. From this we see that we do not have to ask the Lord to make us righteous in this or that matter. We just need to allow the Lord to reign in us, for He is righteousness itself. The Holy Spirit has the power and can accomplish in us what we are unable to accomplish in ourselves. He can overcome what we are unable to overcome. Therefore, we do not need to beg the Lord to make us this or that. We just need to allow the Lord to do this or that in us." The Holy Spirit worked much on that day. The atmosphere in the meeting was attentive. The word was strong and piercing. Unfortunately, I did not write it all down, so I can only tell you the main points.</p><p>I arrived in Wu-Chow on the sixteenth, but the Salt Ministry was not set up yet. This was really unexpected. The only denominations here are the Christian and Missionary Alliance Church and the Baptist Church. This is only my second day here, but I have been invited to testify at the Christian and Missionary Alliance Church twice already. I spoke on the matter of life. They really desired it. What is the current situation in Hankow? Will you be going elsewhere? Has God given you some direction? Please write an answering note if it is convenient. May the Lord be with you! Greet all the brothers and sisters in the Lord.</p><p>Your little brother in the Lord,<br />Mu Hue-chen<br />January 21</p><h2 class="head2">Swatow</h2><h2 class="head3">One</h2><p>Peace in the Lord to our dear Sister X:</p><p>We have received special mercy from the Father and are in a peaceful situation. Whenever we think of the brothers who are fleeing from the war, we can only pray desperately for them before the Father. May the Father of mercies, the God of grace and mercy, shorten the days for the sake of His chosen people so that His children might be kept safe and at peace, living their lives in godliness. We enclose a money order from the Communication Bank for X dollars. Please distribute X dollars for us to the brothers and sisters who are in need. X dollars are for your personal use. The remaining X dollars are for Mr. X. May the Lord repay you for your labor. Peace in the Lord.</p><p>Your little brothers in the Lord,<br />Chen Fang-ching, Chai Gi-chen,<br />Hsie Tse-shun on behalf of the brothers<br />meeting in the Lord's name in Swatow<br />January 20</p><h2 class="head3">Two</h2><p>Here is a postal money order for X dollars. Please acknowledge the receipt. This was offered by a Christian to the Lord. The offerer's prayer was written on the envelope. It clearly said that it should be sent to P. O. Box 84, Hankow. We are just obeying the Lord's will and doing what the offerer prayed in sending the entire amount to you. Please distribute it in the Lord according to different needs.

The brothers and sisters here need edification. You know deeply that I have always lacked spiritual power. May God change me for His own glory and His great mercy's sake so that I will have the boldness to go on. Please pray for me and give me advice. Thank the Lord for using Sister Kuo to help me. My natural man is not completely dealt with yet, so there is still much friction. I really want the Lord to hold me tightly and to tie me up. My future and the time I will return to Hong Kong are all in the Lord's hands. I am waiting for the Lord's clear leading and arrangement. Please greet Miss Chang and Miss Wang for me. Peace in the Lord.</p><p>Your little sister,<br />Ro-chen<br />January 22</p><h2 class="head2">Canton</h2><p>Sister Ro-chen:</p><p>May you have peace in the Lord! I left Canton on the twenty-third of last month and went with a colleague and a few of his relatives to Wu-Chow in Kwangsi province. Then we went on west to Teng-Shian in Kwangsi. I was originally going to stay there for awhile, but I received a telegram telling me to return immediately to Canton. I arrived in Canton on January 1. There are now more than ten brothers and sisters in Canton. There are still three sisters in Rou-Zhi Hospital, Sister Liu, Sister Hsue, and Sister Yi. Puo-Zhi Hospital has two sisters, Sister Liu and Sister Tu. Sister Hung Chi-hwai from the Women's and Children's Hospital still comes often. Sister Lin Siao-ching and her mother are also here. Sister Liang Siu-jeng has not come for a long time because she is too busy with her job. Brother Huang and his wife from Hua-Di are in the same place. Brothers Mai, Wang, and Huang (Hua-shun) are all well. Peace to you and Sister Kuo.</p><p>Your brother,<br />Chang-ming<br />January 4</p><h2 class="head2">Sien-You, Fukien Province</h2><h2 class="head3">One</h2><p>Greetings in the Lord to our dear Brother Watchman and to all the brothers and sisters in Hankow:</p><p>We think that you probably are not familiar with Sien-You in Fukien province. However, thanks be to the loving Lord for doing a great work in this little place. God sent his servants Faithful Luk and Chen Jai-seng to begin a new work in February 1936. At that time a few sinners received grace and were saved. Later the brothers met in their homes and came together every Lord's Day evening to break bread in remembrance of the Lord. There were only five people. Last summer, the Lord sent His servant, Mr. Chai Wu-wuo, to work for more than a month, and a few more were saved. Because there were many people, we rented a place last fall where the brothers and sisters could meet, preach the gospel, and remember the Lord. Last winter, the Lord sent His servants to work among us, and twenty-five people obeyed the Lord and were baptized. There are now about forty-eight brothers and sisters in the table meeting. In the past month the Lord has done a great work, and more than ninety people were saved. We hope that the brothers and sisters will pray for us. May God encourage us with His love to be faithful in testifying strongly for Him so that saved ones may be added to our number daily, amen. Thank and praise God, it is still safe in Sien-You. We really remember the brothers and sisters in the war zone. We remember them each time we pray. We are remitting the offering from one Lord's Day of X dollars in a wire to Miss Ruth Lee to distribute for us. We are really ashamed that we are so lacking in love. May God stir up our heart of love more that we would glorify His name in the Body life until the day the Lord returns.</p><p>The church in Sien-You</p><h2 class="head3">Two</h2><p>We are sending a postal money order from the Lord's Day offering of X dollars and X cents in stamps. Please distribute it for us to the brothers who have a lack from the war or for the needs of the work in the remote areas. (This money has already been given to K'un-ming for the use of the work&mdash;Editor.)</p><p>The church in Sien-You<br />[Address omitted]</p><h2 class="head2">Han-Jiang, Fukien Province</h2><p>Peace to Sister Ruth in the Lord:</p><p>We wired X dollars through the local bank yesterday. It is the offering of brothers and sisters in the church in Han-Jiang for the use of those who are suffering from the war. Please accept it, check the amount, and then distribute it for us. Sister Bao Hsu-min began a one-week sisters' conference in Han-Jiang (tentatively). Please pray for it. The sisters in Han-Jiang need perfecting. If you have the chance and are led by the Lord, we hope that you can come to help us. (I will consider this matter in prayer&mdash;note from Ruth.) The brothers and sisters in the coastal region of Fukien are all safe. Please do not worry about us. Peace to you. Second Corinthians 12:9.</p><p>Your brothers,<br />Fang Shi-rong, Fang Kun-cheng<br />January 13<br />[Address omitted]</p><h2 class="head2">Chuanchow, Shi-Shee,<br />Fukien Province</h2><p>We have just wired X dollars through the post office. When it arrives, please accept and count it. Please distribute it for us to all the brothers in the war zone.

I received your letter of November 5. The mail service was suspended for quite awhile, so it took almost one month for the letter to reach me. When the fighting approached San-Chiao-Bu, God still graced us by leading us to flee to Ya-Dan-Ou, a valley in the mountains not far from San-Chiao-Bu. We are completely surrounded by mountains, so this gives us a taste of the words of Psalm 121. I served the Lord for more than a month in Shao-Shing and then went home to take my family and flee. With regard to the work, we acknowledge that the Lord is the almighty One; man can do nothing. Mr. Sun's whole family also fled to Ya-Dan-Ou. I think that your letter was delayed because the post office service was frustrated by the war. Many of my letters (some were sent to you) have been lost or delayed. May this letter reach you without delay. The brothers and sisters in Nanking have all fled. Unfortunately, all my books are there. If the Lord does not want me to keep those things, I just praise and thank Him. If this is just the beginning of the tribulation and we cannot stand it, what will the great tribulation be like? May we both be able to keep the word of endurance, and may we keep watchful that we may be preserved from the coming tribulation. I hope you can come north, but may God's will be done. I have not written all I want to say. May the Lord's grace be with you.</p><p>Your brother in the Lord,<br />Tang Shou-ling<br />December 12, 1937</p><p>(This letter was written by Brother T'ang almost three months ago.

I was able to borrow the second issue from Brother Wang Jin-tang and read it carefully. Then I found out that this publication contains news that is indispensable to the responsible brothers of a local church. Therefore, please send nineteen more copies of the second issue of The Open Door. Then send me twenty copies of each subsequent issue. I will tell you something of the condition of the church here. We have received perfecting from Brothers David Hsu, Chang Kwang-rong, Ma Chuan-foo, and Sister Miao Yun-chun over the past few years, and we have grown much. The Jesus Chapel in South Lion Lane of Wu-Yih now has the Lord's table, but there are not many people. There are already sixteen meeting places with believers in the Lord:</p><p>(1) Jesus Chapel, South Lion Lane, Wu-Yih. Responsible ones: Wang Jin-tang, Shao Tse-lin. (2) The church in Ho's house.

There are also two meetings in Lu-Bi and Yu-Yuan, which are still in the stage of infancy, so I will not mention them this time. However, saved ones are there also. It is difficult to work in this region because most of the people are poor, suffering farmers. However, God is not a respecter of persons. I hope that there could be a meeting to train co-workers (plus elders and deacons) in this area. I have not received any special assignment from the Lord, so I am still waiting on Him.

I have gone into the countryside to hold meetings several times and have seen the Lord's blessing. I really want to return to Shanghai, but I am not clear about the Lord's arrangement, so I am waiting. Our area has now become part of the war zone. Please pray for me.

Please greet the assembly in Hankow.</p><p>Your brother,<br />Yu Cheng-hwa<br />January 15<br />[Address omitted]</p><h2 class="head2">Sheng County,<br />Chekiang Province</h2><p>Peace to my dear brother in the Lord, Mr. X:</p><p>I have not written for a long time. I found out that you were in Hong Kong yesterday from Brother Ma Di-sheng. Thank the Lord very much for this opportunity to communicate with you....The brothers and sisters in certain places in Sha-Di are suffering more in places like Tou-Peng, Hsin-Wan-Di, San-Cha-Dai, Twelve Dai, and San-Tai-Chiao. (San-Cha-Dai and Tou-Peng are across the river from Hai-Ning.) The meetings in Shao-Shing stopped more than a month ago because most of the brothers and sisters had moved into the countryside. In the wake of the present calamity, I only hope that God protects, gives grace, and saves His children. I moved my family from Dong-Jieh Road to Tou-Peng on August 10, and on November 24 we moved back to our old hometown in Sheng County. My ancestral home is five miles from the major city of Sheng County. I do not know how many days Sheng County can remain safe. We can only rely on the protection of God's great power. The churches in this region have really been graced by the Lord. The assembly in Wan-An-Chiao has really progressed. The number of new believers is increasing. The assembly in Ji-Shan-Chiao in Yi-Rung has increased in their zeal for the preaching of the gospel. The assembly in Tou-Peng has improved in material offerings. The assembly in Si-Shing has improved in the matter of following the leading of the Holy Spirit. There is a table now in Sin-Wan-Di. The work in Sha-Di has come to a conclusion. Where are you going? How is your health? Peace in the Lord!</p><p>Your brother in the Lord,<br />Lou Chuan-en<br />January 12<br />[Address omitted]</p><h2 class="head2">The Condition of the Assemblies<br />in the Region of Shao-Shing</h2><p>The meetings in the city stopped a long time ago and all the brothers and sisters have fled into the mountainous countryside. Wherever they went, they did a good job testifying for the Lord. Praise the Lord! In south Sha-Di the outward situation is not very peaceful, but their spiritual life is higher than before. They have a very simple and unshakable faith, and they are very watchful to pray at all times. I am always encouraged by them. I really thank the Lord. They are all farmers by occupation, so their livelihood has not been affected much by the war. There are one or two who are in difficulty, but they do all they can to care for one another. They really live the Body life. There are already nine meetings in the Lord's name in this region. Six localities have the table to remember the Lord. The total number of saved ones is about one thousand. I hope that the brothers and sisters in the Lord do not forget to pray for them before the Lord. They passed through very hard times in the past because of the failure of the silk industry. Their past experience has taught them to rely on the Lord, to obey Him, and to love the brothers. I see how the Lord uses sufferings more than ease to edify us. The brothers in the assembly in Hsia-Fang-Chiao are mainly in the silk business, but they are different from those in Hwa-She. We are the ones who are most positively influenced by this war. The responsibility for the meeting here is completely borne by the local brothers, so we can get by smoothly. May the Lord uphold them daily. Because the locality of Jou-Shan is near the mountains and the water, most of the refugees from the cities have moved there (Mr. Hsie Tze-yuen is among them). Therefore, the number listening to the gospel is very great. There are more than one hundred in the Lord's Day meeting. There are also many new believers. The responsible brother there, Brother X, has made much progress recently. May the Lord continue to edify them. Jou-Shan and Hsia-Fang-Chiao still do not have table meetings. I hope that the brothers and sisters will pray much for them.</p><p>A slave of the Lord,<br />Shan Kai-fen<br />February 5<br />[Address omitted]</p><h2 class="head2">The Present Condition of the Church<br />in Shao-Xiao, Chekiang Province</h2><p>(1) The meeting in the city of Shao-Shing has stopped. Most of the brothers and sisters have fled to Jou-Shan and are meeting there. The rest are all scattered in the mountainous counties: Dan-Ju-Wu, Ping-Shui, and Shang-Zao. I have heard that they are doing individual gospel work. Lo-Kou in Ping-Shui has already begun a (temporary) meeting. (2) The assembly in Jou-Shan has more than one hundred people. Many are new believers. Brother Wu Ting-chi and Brother Hsie Tze-yuen are responsible for preaching the gospel. We hope to have a conference for several days in the near future. Brother Hsie will be responsible for the Bible study, and I will bear the responsibility for preaching salvation. Please pray for this. (3) Hua-She: They have been in great difficulty physically, but God's grace is rich and has brought them through, and they manifest more of a heart of gratitude and are more spiritually alive. We preached the gospel from the first day to the third day of the Chinese New Year. I was responsible for the speaking. Thank the Lord, the result was not bad. (4) Hsia-Fang-Chiao: There are between thirty and fifty believers, but they have not begun the table meeting yet. They hope to have an edification conference. They are undergoing more physical suffering than those in Hua-She. Therefore, I have already talked with the responsible brothers in Hua-She about the grace they have received. They intend to share some of it with the assembly in Jia-Zao-Wan.</p><p>(5) Sha-Di: (A) Wan-An-Chiao: The church has improved very much. They are pursuing more deeply, and they have the greatest number. At the message meeting there are three or four hundred people. At the table meeting there are about two hundred. When Brother Luan came, they received the outpouring of the Holy Spirit. Later, Brother Tang came to help them with deeper edification in life. We hope that there will be another outpouring of the Holy Spirit soon for all the new believers. (B) Tou-Peng: During the past three months, God has manifested special miracles and given the gifts of tongues, interpretations, and spiritual songs. The preaching has been with power. A brother, Chou Ah-fan, was completely healthy, but he was suddenly called to be with the Lord. Brother Chou loved the Lord most zealously. As a result of his death, a great revival broke out in the church, and the believers became very watchful. There were only joyful noises in the funeral. There was no sound of crying. Even the soldiers stationed there marveled when they saw it. The prayer of the sisters was especially spiritual. This is something I heard with my own ears. The meetings are a little quieter now. Probably the brothers are taking more roots in the spiritual life. (C) Jia- Zao-Wan: The believers are all poor, but they are very rich spiritually. One Lord's Day I conducted three meetings in the morning and evening. They were really hungry and thirsty. (D) San-Tai-Chiao: It is gradually being revived because some people have been going to the prayer meeting in Tou-Peng (Friday evening). (E) Ji-Shan-Chiao (or Yi-Rung): It is progressing steadily. Brother and Sister Kao Chi-luh are laboring there. (F) Sin-Wan-Di: A few brothers have been raised up by God. They preach the word with power and serve the Lord out of love, but they still pray for deeper edification. Brother Fei Chang-hwa asked Brother Chou Jing-tang to come and ask me to help them. How can an unworthy person like me help them? (G) Twelve Dai: God has already begun a work here. Perhaps there will be another local assembly and table soon. Last November and December, I went for three Lord's Days and held three private meetings. (H) Dang-Shan: At its invitation, Brother Kai-fen and I will go there next Lord's Day. Presently, it is still part of the China Inland Mission. May God bless this time of work. (I) Although there have been army corps in Si-Shing, Ning-Yuan, and Tien-Yuan many times, the believers' houses are still safe. They have not lost much. Brother Kao Jing-fu and I have agreed to go out together if there is an opportunity. We will go first to Liu-Li-Chiao, then to Kan-Shan, and finally to Si-Shing. There is a need in Liu-Li-Chiao and Kan-Shan, and Dang-Shan is about the same. (J) San-Cha-Dai: It is by the coast near Tou-Peng and San-Tai-Chiao. There has been an assembly in the Lord's name there for a long time, but the saints have not started the table meeting yet. Their condition is quite good, but they are somewhat immature.</p><p>The preceding is just a report of what I have heard and seen. May God give us the burden to pray for one another and to pray much for the assemblies in the localities mentioned above. The work in Sha-Di was worked out by the heavenly Father Himself, and God has worked through Brothers Luan, Shan, and Tang to revive, outpour, and establish the saints. The usual work of traveling around the area is done by Kao Chi-lu, Fei Chang-bao, Wang You-gen, and Kao Jing-fu. God has raised up many brothers to help. It really is true that God has mercy on whom He will have mercy. It is not of the one who runs the race, but of God who gives mercy. May glory and blessing be to Him forever! Amen. Peace to you! Greet the brothers and sisters in Shanghai!</p><p>Your little brother,<br /> Hu Ji-tang<br />February 3</p><h2 class="head2">Wenchow, Chekiang Province</h2><p>Greetings to Mr. X:</p><p>I received the money you wired from the bank. I know how you want to use it. I also know that the brothers and sisters in Shanghai have all been kept in safety by the Father. I really thank the Lord for His grace. Thank God for His overflowing grace in remembering a small one like myself. I also thank you for your love. May the Lord remember it much and repay you. I have been healed by God, and my sickness is gone. However, my body is still weak and needs rest and recovery. The situation has been kept in peace by God's gracious protection. Please do not worry about us. Peace in the Spirit!</p><p>Your little brother in the Lord,<br />Pan Huo-ling<br />February 7<br />[Address omitted]</p><h2 class="head2">Li-Shui, Chekiang Province</h2><h2 class="head3">One</h2><p>Greetings to my beloved Brother X in the Lord:</p><p>I met Miss Tso Guo-ying in the Jinhua Gospel Hospital on December 26. She said that she and some of her colleagues planned to go to Nan-ch'ang, because the hospital was closing. Miss Tso came to my home before she left for Nan-ch'ang the next day. I asked her if she needed anything. She said no. She boarded the train that day for Nan-ch'ang. I trust that she is safe now. I left Jin-Hwa on January 1 and came to Li-Shui. I have permission to use the new China Inland Mission Chapel (which has never been used). I am living in the dormitory of the mission's elementary school. Brother Hu Jeng-dao and I share a room and are very comfortable. The air is better than in Jin-Hwa, and I have more time to pray quietly before our Father. Thank the Father for His preparation. There are several missionaries from the China Inland Mission who are Westerners. They are all German. Pastor Chui, his wife, and two sons are also here in Li-Shui. The female doctors are all very godly. Pastor Chui is more than seventy years old. Mr. Chiu, Si Meng-yu, Chang Ming-jing, Chang Hao-ran, and Mrs. Chang are all here. We remembered the Lord on January 9 in Mr. Chiu's house. There were seven people there. Mr. Chiu has borrowed the office of the China Inland Mission's elementary school for his business, so he is very close to us. It is as if we are in one place. My family is still in Pai-Tou. Dr. Ruan, Brother Ah-lai and his wife, Huang Tsai-ch'ing, and Brother Lee Kwei-sien have all stayed in Hangchow and have not come out. May the Lord keep and protect them. May He also provide them with what they need. We are unable to communicate with them by letter. I heard that Miss Miao has already returned to Shanghai. Brother Yang-teh is still working at the Mei-Fu Company in Shanghai. Peace in the Lord!</p><p>Your brother,<br />Di-sheng<br />January 16<br />[Address omitted]</p><h2 class="head3">Two</h2><p>Greetings to my brother in the Lord, Mr. Luan:</p><p>When this war started, God said to me, "I am watching over them for evil" (Jer. 44:27). I was very frightened at that time. However, God showed me that believers and unbelievers should be different when they are faced with the same environment. While believers lose something in tribulation, they also gain something. There are many commandments and promises in the Bible that are now being fulfilled richly in the believers. These are things that we could not have gained in the days past. While I was praying for peace in this region, God said, "The time for the lovers of the Lord to be taken up to heaven is almost here." Works of power will be with us daily, as you once said. The Lord's love during the past months has been more than words can describe. If God gives me the opportunity, I will tell you about them in detail. I left Hangchow and passed through Fu-Yang, Tung-Lu, Jien-Teh, Lan-Si, Jin-Hwa, Yung-Kang, and Tsin-Yun; I am now in Li-Shui. During the first half of the year, I knew when I prayed that I would leave Ching Po High School. I asked the principal to release me, but he would not. After the war approached Hangchow, I came with Mr. Chiu to this place. I am now in the Chung-Teh Elementary School of Jesus Chapel, Tai-Shan-Gung Alley, Li-Shui. My wife and Samuel are in Sheng County. In my prayer and through the outward circumstances, I became clear that I should go to Kweichow. God keeps pointing to Sinkiang, Tibet, Tsinghai, and Kweichow, where the gospel has not been fully preached. God will not give the latter rains from heaven until the gospel has been preached to the ends of the earth. Christ's second coming is near. Perhaps we will not pass through the grave. The time has come for the church to be one.</p><p>I still marvel at the last conference in Hangchow. Everyone shed tears on the last day. These tears were shed because Hangchow was to pass through tribulation. Only Christ is Lord. The believers will all be tested so that they will all give up the things of the earth to gain the things in heaven. Allow me to tell you what is on my heart. Sometimes I do not know why God wants me to go where He sends me. I have asked the Lord why I must pass through the tribulation. There have been two times when I could have died in the past. One of those times I could have died painlessly without any worry. Thank God for answering me. I must finish the course God has set for me. In the future I will clothe myself with thanksgiving and crown myself with praise so that all the people I know will know how God has graced me. May the Lord come soon so that we will all see and hear Him! Hsu Tseng-rong is in Chou-Jia-Pu. Tao Chun-yen and the others are in Hu-Shu. Lee Kwei-sien is in Si-Wen-Che. Lou Chuan-en is in Sheng County. Yu Hung-fei is in Ju-Jih. Dong Tsen-teh is in Hankow. David Hsu is traveling back and forth between Wu-Yih and Jin-Hwa.</p><p>Humbly yours,<br />Si Meng-yu<br />December 5</p><p>(The meetings in Hangchow are now in Brother Ruan Chi-yu's home&mdash;Philip. Brother Ma Di-sheng sent a postcard from Li-Shui to the brothers in Hankow saying that Brothers Si and Chiu went with Brother Chang Ming-jing to Kiangsu. He does not know where they are now&mdash;Editor.)</p><h2 class="head3">Three</h2><p>Dear sister in the Lord:</p><p>I received your letter from Hankow and was filled with unspeakable joy! My living in the past several months has really been in a black tunnel. I have passed through many dangers, but thankfully the Lord's presence protected and constantly comforted me. Since I left Wu-Sung on October 31 for Hangchow, I stayed in town for fourteen days, and then I followed the people here from Hangchow on the fifteenth. On the nineteenth, we arrived in Jien-Teh, Chekiang and stayed for ten days. Later, I went with my elder sister to Li-Shui. We arrived on December 2. I really am not accustomed to life here. I have wanted to go to Shanghai for a long time, but the Father has not yet allowed me. I am still planning to go to Shanghai. I hope God will allow me to go and will open a way for me. I think that Miss Chang must be with you; please greet her for me. Where is Miss Wang? I miss her! Even though I am in this environment, I am together with you sisters every day in the Lord. I no longer have a home, so what will I do? God will decide! That's all for now. Peace in the Lord!</p><p>Your sister,<br />Jing-tze<br />February 18</p><p>(Sister Chao Jing-tze will be going to Shanghai soon. Letters for her can be sent c/o Ms. Cheng Yi-feng, 34 Lane 10, Hardoon Road, Shanghai&mdash;Editor.)</p><h2 class="head2">Lien-Shui, Northern Kiangsu</h2><p>Greetings to Brother X in the Lord:</p><p>Bei Chien-ji in Lien-Shui was attacked and robbed by bandits on January 26. All the brothers and sisters lost some money, clothes, and other possessions. The bandits wanted to shoot the responsible brother, Brother Kao Yu-kun, but he strongly trusted in the Lord. He placed his body, soul, and spirit in the Lord's hands and received the Lord's protection. Afterward, the brothers and sisters did not grieve. On the contrary, they were exceedingly happy and met every day. Thank the Lord! God did a special work and saved more than thirty new brothers and sisters. This is something to rejoice about! The condition of the churches in Sun-Chiao and Lien-Shui is quite good. Please do not worry about them. Lien-Shui has received The Open Door. Chien-Ji and Sun-Chiao have not received their copies yet. Please check your mailing records. Peace and well-being in the Lord!</p><p>Your brother,<br />Ge Chung-yi<br />February 17, under the lamp<br />[Address omitted]</p><h2 class="head2">Shanghai</h2><h2 class="head3">One</h2><p>Greetings to my respected sister in the Lord,</p><p> Miss Ruth Lee:</p><p>I received and read your letter of January 22. In it I learned that you (Sister Wang and Sister Chang) and Brother Yu-zhi are all well. I was very comforted. I also heard that the Lord had opened a door for the gospel in Chungking, so I was even more joyful. May the Lord give you more wisdom and power from above so that you may be fishers of men for the Lord. We here can only pray for you. The meetings continue as usual by the Lord's grace. The brothers and sisters are beginning to pick up the responsibility because they see that the local church is really theirs. Therefore, they are all learning to go the way of the cross for the Lord's sake. Brother Nee has been in Shanghai recently, and he is conducting a Bible study. It will last for about two weeks. Then he will go abroad to England. I have enclosed an announcement for the Bible study. Please read it. The children's meeting on the Lord's Day morning began last Lord's Day. It is at 262 Hardoon Road. We were planning to have a baptism soon, but after considering the situation, perhaps we will not be able to do it for awhile. The book The Normal Christian Church Life is still being proofread. May the Lord bless this book so that many believers and workers will know their own position and be able to stand firm in it. If they do, the church and the work will be recovered back to the beginning. Moreover, the number of people in the Bible study is more than ever before. The brothers and sisters in fellowship with us are not the only ones who come; there are also many outsiders, and the meeting place is not big enough. May the Lord bless this conference so that every believer may be edified. May the grace of the Lord be with you! Greet the brothers and sisters in Chungking.</p><p>Your brothers,<br />Du Tsong-chen, Wu Si-gu, Lin Kwang-biao<br />February 7<br />[Address omitted]</p><h2 class="head3">Two</h2><p>To Sister X in the Lord:</p><p>We received all your letters. Please do not worry about anything. Sister Chang Yi-hwa from Ning-Po sent a letter saying that they are all well. Sister Wang Ai-juan has already come to Shanghai and will teach in Hwei Feng Girls' School. Mrs. Shen Guang-ling has not been well recently. Mrs. Shen Chui-fen is very well now and can walk a few steps by herself. Sister Ho Shao-ying married Brother Chu Chen. Sister Yin Hsia-chin has not found a teaching job for next semester. I (Sister Yi-feng) will continue teaching as a tutor for Fu's family next semester. God has led me through everything. I really thank Him! I (Sister Yu-ying) will continue to tutor for Shen's family next semester. The last letter I sent home to Jia-Shing on November 4 has not been answered. I do not know where my father, brother, or sister-in-law are. God is never wrong in what He wants us to pass through. Please pray for them that they would write me a letter telling me how they are. Chi Wen-ju and Mrs. Zhu Ming-sheng's sister have come to Shanghai. Please do not worry. Sister Hu Hsi-hsin has not found a teaching job for next semester.</p><p>Sister Di Hwei-jia of Yi-Shing sent a letter after Mu-Wei Girls' School in Sung-Jiang was destroyed. In the past she had only heard people talking about trusting in God and believing that all things are God's will, but she did not understand them. However, now she has tasted it. She said one thing that really touched me, "Now is the opportunity to know what it means to live according to one's environment and to live in Christ. The visible things will all pass away, but the eternal things will never be lost." She also said that God loved her so much this summer that she was able to be baptized; this bears special significance for her. We have not received any letters from her since Yi-Shing capitulated. Please pray much for her and her family. Mrs. Hsu Chang Hsiu-feng can come to the meetings now. Peace in the Lord! Greet Sisters Wang and Chang for us.</p><p>Your sisters,<br />Yi-feng, Yu-ying<br />February 1<br />[Address omitted]</p><h2 class="head3">Three</h2><p>Sister X in the Lord:</p><p>I am praying to God to see whether He wants me to teach in the mornings. I am asking Him if He wants to give me a position as a teacher. If God does not want me to, I am willing to obey. May God direct me in the way in which I should walk so that He may gain me and so that I may not hurt His heart. Rather than sadden the Lord, I am willing to hurt myself. Thank and praise God. He poured His own love on me richly. I am very well physically. Sometimes I am weak, but whenever I go to God, all the weakness passes away. Last week Sister Yi-feng and I went out every day to visit the sisters because it was winter vacation. I really feel that some sisters are very dear before God. Visiting the sisters can really help ourselves as well as teach us how to pray. Thank God for gracing us in these past two weeks. God has shown us much light through Mr. Nee. He spoke about the matter of the pouring out of the Holy Spirit. It could not have been clearer. The outlines included: (1) the work of the Comforter in the Christian's heart, (2) the work of the Spirit poured out on our body, and (3) every believer needing to live a life "full" of the Holy Spirit. The last few days feel like days of showers. Many people have received blessing, but we do not know what fruit will be born in the future. There is the need for many supporting prayers.</p><p>Sister Chi Wen-ju arrived in Shanghai from Jien-Teh last month. I have already introduced her to a teaching post at Hsieh-Tsin School. Sister Wu Pei-shueh also has a teaching job at Hsieh-Tsin now. Altogether, six sisters are there. May they have a good testimony in the school to glorify God. Sister Ding Chung-jen is studying obstetrics at Dr. Ai's place on Hsin-Ja Road. She will graduate in six months. We have no news from Sister Jin Bao-jieh from Ping-Hu and Sister Di Hwei-jia from Yi-Shing. I have heard that Sister Wu Jen-han of Jiang-Yin is in Nan-Tung. Sister Liu Hwei-fen returned to Tientsin because her mother was physically weak. Mrs. Si Jiu-rong had a baby girl last week. Peace in the Lord. Greet Miss Wang, Miss Chang, and Mrs. Yuan. Sister Kao Ya-luh just came to see me. She said that her nephew has moved from Soochow to 106 Cheng Street, Jin-Kou Town, Wu-ch'ang. He does not need help financially, but if someone there knows him, it would be good if he could visit him. (A letter from a brother in Wuhan said that Jin-Kou Town was more than twenty miles from Wu-ch'ang, so they have not been able to visit him yet&mdash;Editor.)</p><p>Your sister,<br />Wang Yu-ying<br />February 12</p><h2 class="head3">Four</h2><p>Sister Ruth:</p><p>When will you and the others be coming back to Shanghai? Will you wait for Peace and then come together? I will not be able to go anywhere for awhile; I moved into the meeting hall last Wednesday. The Normal Christian Church Life is still being typeset. Mr. Lin Gang-biao and Mr. Ho Yueh-chiao are proofreading with me. Hua Feng Printing Company is not as big as it was before, but we are managing to get it typeset there. There really is not enough room to set everything up. Peace and health! Greetings to Sister Phoebe.</p><p>Yun-chun<br />February 21<br />[Address omitted]</p><h2 class="head3">Five</h2><p>Sister X:</p><p>Thank and praise God. After returning to Shanghai, my health recovered. Sister Li Li-ying is better now. She is resting at Sister Ku's place. Sister Wei Hsiang-yun of Soochow is now living in the meeting hall. Brother Lu Tze-shing came with her to Shanghai. My sister Guo-ying is working in Kiangsi at the Lin-Chuan Health Clinic. I have written and asked her to return to Shanghai. The brothers and sisters in Shanghai have really progressed and have been pursuing very much since Mr. Nee's last conference. Mrs. Huang You-gan has been healed in her body. Mrs. Tsan Wen-ming's little daughter was taken by God, but her heart is still peaceful. Mrs. Joseph Huang has improved spiritually since the death of her son. Peace in the Lord. Greet Sisters Wang, Chang, and Yuan.</p><p>Your sister,<br />Fu-ru<br />February 24<br />[Address omitted]</p><h2 class="head2">Anhwei</h2><h2 class="head3">One</h2><p>Greetings to my dear Brother Yao-ju in the Lord:</p><p>Your card of February 5 was received on the tenth. I was out in the countryside, so I did not see it until the twelfth. Thank the Lord! We are safe. We also thank you for your prayer. I went to Liu-Jia-Lou on the ninth (thirty-six miles west of the city, where there are fields and a village). The next day Brother Chang Yun-shiu arrived too, and there was a meeting on Friday night. Many sisters came from the neighboring villages, and there were more than ten men. Brother Chang preached the message. Brother Yuan Ling-shu and Brother Lee Teh-chi came together from Huang-Jia-Juang. (It is about thirty-six miles from the city and eighteen miles from where we were.) Brother Yuan went back to Huang-Jia-Juang in the afternoon to do visitation work. (Since Brother Yuan returned home from working in Shou County, he has been living in Huang-Jia-Juang, cooking for himself.) Brother Lee returned to Pai-Ma-Chun, which is about fifty-eight miles from the city. If the Lord allows, Brothers Chang and Yuan will both go to the meetings in Pai-Ma-Chun. Thank the Lord, there has been a table meeting in Huang-Jia-Juang for the last two Lord's Days. There has also been one table meeting in Liu-Jia-Lou. Please pray for the work in the places mentioned above. In July of last year, my personal desire was to move my family to the countryside, so I went to Liu-Jia-Lou to make preparations. God did not allow me to move, and I was sick for two months before I could get out of bed. We met in my home in the city until the city was bombed in December. I then brought my daughters to the countryside. The Catholic Church and the Gospel Chapel have set up a refugee center for women and children, so I brought my five children to live in the Chi Hsiu Girls' School in Nan-Kuan (the refugee center is in Chi Hsiu). My wife can take care of them and also care for the rest of our family, so I am able to go out into the countryside. Please pray for my whole family. My son, Da-re, has two or three brothers as companions. Thank the Lord for His grace. I hope you will discipline him for the Lord's sake and teach him often. May the Lord bless all the brothers and sisters in the assembly with peace. Amen. (Please send me one copy of the second issue of The Open Door.)</p><p>Your little brother in the Lord,<br />Huang Tze-hou<br />February 13<br />Mailed from Liu-Jia-Lou<br />[Address omitted]</p><h2 class="head3">Two</h2><p>Dear Brothers Lan,</p><p> Chou, Hu, and Chu:</p><p>Two months have passed quickly since I left you in Hankow. First, I went to Wu-Hu and stayed in the hostel for missionaries of the China Inland Mission. Later, I went to Yun-Chao. I then took a boat through Wu-Wei County to Lu-Jiang County. On February 10 I left Lu-Jiang County and went to Tung-Cheng. Lu-Jiang County is about thirty miles from Tung-Cheng, and we came by wagon. May the Lord lead me. The China Inland Mission is in this area. If the Lord is willing, I may leave Tung-Cheng next month and go somewhere else. I still have not decided where I will go. Perhaps I will return to Hankow. Our life and travels are all in the Lord's hands. Please pray much for me. Please pray for my family, too, because I cannot communicate with them now and do not know how they are doing. Greet all the brothers and sisters in Hankow for me.</p><p>Your little brother,<br />Dai En-tsao<br />February 18</p><h2 class="head3">Three</h2><p>Sister X:</p><p>I received and read The Open Door and got to know the condition of the brothers and sisters in each locality, thank the Lord! I have been in Ying-Shang for more than a month now. During the Chinese New Year, there is a gospel meeting for women in the China Inland Mission every day. I wanted to leave this place and go somewhere else, but I saw that so many wanted to believe in the Lord and were desperately in need of salvation; therefore, I forgot everything. If the Lord wants me to preach the gospel to the refugees in one place all the time, I am happy to do it. My spirit and heart are at peace all the day. Peace to you. Greet Sister Wang and Sister Chang.</p><p>Ji Hwei-jen<br />February 12</p><p>(This letter is sent from the China Inland Mission in Ying-Shang.)</p><h2 class="head2">Hankow</h2><h2 class="head3">One</h2><p>The current condition of the assembly in Hankow: In the past two months there have been meetings almost every day, but we never see God's manifested blessing! After Sister Wang Ju-ching went to K'un-ming and Sister Chen Bi-kun and Sister Wu went to Hong Kong, Hankow has become more lonely. The brothers have almost all gone. We have been preserved by the Lord, but what can we do, aside from learning to preach the gospel and taking care of the mail from the brothers and sisters every day? Since Brothers Kuo and Shang and Sisters Wu and Shang came to Hankow, we have been comforted very much. We still have the opportunity to give hospitality to saints from afar in these few remaining days of grace. Moreover, they have more growth in all areas than we weak and small brothers and sisters. Brother Kuo preached the messages on the last two Lord's Days. Brother Shang and his two sisters were even more zealous in gospel preaching. The day before yesterday was the Lord's Day (February 20). We had the Lord's table meeting at 7:00 p.m., and there were ten brothers and eight sisters. We are really very happy. Most of the brothers and sisters around the table were from far away. None of us expected to meet each other on that day. The price we pay for joy is very great. May we testify more of the Lord's grace day by day.</p><p>Your brother,<br />Ju Yao-ju<br />February, in Hankow</p><h2 class="head3">Two</h2><p>The brothers and sisters now living in the Gospel Court in Hankow (except for the local brothers and sisters) are: Brother Chou You-sheng (from Nanking), Sister Shang Yi-rung (from Tsao-Yang), Brother Kuo Pu-yueh (from Hou-Ma), Sister Wu Teh-hsing (from Tsao-Yang), Brother Wang Ching-shan (from Tsinan), senior Mrs. Wu (from Tsao-Yang), Brother Huang Da-rei (from Shu County), Sister Huang Shu-hsien (from Shu County), Brother Shang Jiu-tze (from Tsao-Yang), Sister Liu Yu-ying (from Shu County), and Brother Tsung Kung (from Sian).</p><p>Other brothers and sisters living in Hankow (in our fellowship): Brother Timothy Chou, Brother Chung Shuan-ching, Brother Luke Hsuan, Brother Yu Hsiang-shan, Brother Wang Yung-yuan, Brother Bai Kuang-liang (recently from Tsingtao), Mrs. Hsia Chang Yun-mei, Dr. Kao Yueh-ying, and Mrs. Bai (Brother Bai's wife).</p><p>Ju Yao-ju<br />February, in Hankow</p><h2 class="head3">Three</h2><p>The jobs of Brothers Ju and Hu: Brother Hu Lan-sheng started working in the YMCA a few days ago. Brother Ju Yao-ju was introduced to work in a "Wounded Soldier Assistance Organization" on a trial basis as a secretarial clerk. His testing period is over at the end of February, and if he does well, he will begin as a regular in March. Thank God for finding us some jobs. We ask the Lord to give us an opportunity to learn how to serve others and to ease the burden which the brothers and sisters bear for us.</p><p>Your little brothers in the Lord,<br />Hu Lan-sheng, Ju Yao-ju<br />February 15</p><h2 class="head3">Four</h2><p>A few letters from Brother Lan Tsi-yi: Missionary Hai of the Charismatic Crusade, who is traveling with three companions from the China Inland Mission and four from the Lutheran Church, is going to Hong Kong with us tomorrow. Through her kindness, she purchased three tickets for us. By God's good arrangement, Sister Ma, Miss Yao, and I will leave with them for Canton tomorrow at 10:00 a.m. (This was quoted from a letter from Hankow written on January 26&mdash;Editor.)</p><p>Thank and praise the Lord! His gracious hand held us and His loving arms covered us. All the words in Psalm 121 were fulfilled in us. We, who are so unworthy of grace, have received the greatest grace, and we cannot refrain from praising the Lord with a marveling heart! We began our journey by train on January 26 and arrived safely in Canton on the morning of the thirtieth. That evening we changed to the Canton-Kowloon train and arrived in Kowloon. The train went very fast. The train from Wu-ch'ang that traveled on the twenty-third to the twenty-fifth was only ahead of us by one day. We can only praise and thank the Lord! We also thank you sisters for your petitions.</p><p>Missionary Hai and the others will return to England on a ship which leaves on the eighth or the tenth. Mrs. Wu sent a letter yesterday saying that she was taking the train to Canton on February 1. The brothers and sisters in Hong Kong are all well. I will need a few more days here. If nothing new happens, I will return to Hankow after the Lord's Day after I meet with Mr. Lee. On the return trip to Hankow, I must pass though Ch'ang-sha and then transfer to Ch'ang-Teh and Yuan-Jiang. I will be delayed one week by this transfer. I will then return to Hankow from Hunan. God will have to give grace for my safety in traveling and the arrangements of all things. I hope you will pray for me. (From a letter sent on February 2 from Hong Kong&mdash;Editor.)</p><p>God's presence is so sweet! I have seen God's manifested grace in all aspects on this trip. At the same time, I have also seen the hunger and thirst among so many brothers and sisters in each locality, the need of the gospel among the sinners, as well as my own poverty and depravity. Through these I have gained some understanding of the Lord's desire in this age.</p><p>I took a sailboat to Yi-Yang with Brother Zhang on the seventeenth. I returned to Ch'ang-sha on the sixth. I had originally decided to return to Hankow the same night, but Brother Wu-ru insisted that I stay in Ch'ang-sha for two days of meetings with two special messages and one table meeting. This is a chance for me to receive grace before the Lord with the brothers and sisters in Ch'ang-sha. Praise the Lord! By the Lord's arrangement, I left Hunan on the evening of the twenty-first and arrived safely in Hankow on the twenty-second. (From a letter sent from Hankow on February 24&mdash;Editor.)</p><p>Through God's sovereign arrangement, Brother Liu Guo-jieh has found a job working for the Health Department.</p><p>Brother Liu Chu-fei and his uncle, Brother Liu Jing-hsi, are both in Ch'ang-sha with their families. Brother Chu-fei is working as a physician at the Ren-Shu Hospital. Their mailing address is Ren-Shu Hospital, Ch'ang-sha, Hunan. Witness Lee's second sister came to Hankow a few days ago and has already returned to Hsu-Chang. His third brother came to Hankow also. His sister came especially to bring her brother to the meeting hall to hear the gospel. Please pray for her brother.</p><p>Brother Gu Teh-chang has already found the meeting hall. He came to Hankow in December of last year but did not know where we met and could not find us. Brother Ju made a special trip to speak with him today. He is living in the Heng-Chung Cloth Factory at 1 Yung-Teh Lane. Sister Wang Shuai-hsin and her two younger sisters are both living in the upstairs of the Gospel Court.

He gave me a burden for the need to come to Hankow, so I came not long after. Hallelujah! He is Lord! There are lessons for me to learn here. Please pray for me. I am an ignorant and stubborn person, but God has loved me. How this has happened is unimaginable and inconceivable to me. May the Lord give me the heart to be faithful unto death in serving Him. Glory be to Him. Amen. Peace in the Lord. Greet Sisters Wang and Chang.</p><p>Your weak brother in the Lord,<br />Kuo Bu-yueh<br />February 9</p><h2 class="head2">Nan-ch'ang, Kiangsi Province</h2><p>Dear Brother Philip in the Lord:</p><p>Last year you stayed in Dr. Stearns's house in Shanghai. He spoke of you to me, but I did not have time to visit you. I left in August with a few brothers who were with the medical aid team. We went to Wusih and Nanking and worked there for three months. We took the train to Nan-ch'ang at the end of November. Last month the Red Cross changed its organization and regrouped the two groups of workers from our school into three medical units. We are temporarily working in Nan-ch'ang, but we do not know where we will be sent in the future. I met the following brothers and sisters in Nanking: Chou You-sheng, Liu Guo-jieh, Dung Shen-ying, and Liu Guo-hsiang. I also had time to attend a few meetings. After arriving in Nan-ch'ang, I met Brother Liu and Sister Dung. They went to Ch'ang-sha last month. I really miss the brothers and sisters in the Shanghai Medical College and Dr. Stearns, even though I know that they are under God's care. Have you received any letters from Dr. Stearns? Have his wife and son arrived in Shanghai? Is there still a meeting in Wen-teh Lane? I really ask God to specially protect everyone who belongs to Him in this age and to give us new light so that we may walk in His will. I am sending an order form to the Gospel Book Room to send me three copies of each issue of The Open Door. Please send me one copy each of Issue Nos. 92&mdash;94 of the local newsletter and the first issue of The Open Door. I will return them after I have read them. I know there is a shortage of them. Please tell Brother Chou You-sheng that I will send him the copy of The Light of Human Life which I borrowed from him in Nanking. Greet him for me also. This place is not too bad, but there is no meeting on the Lord's Day. Where is Brother Tang Shou-ling? Is Hankow still peaceful? Greet all the brothers and sisters for me, even though I do not know many of them. Peace in the Lord! Isaiah 26:3-4.</p><p>Your little brother,<br />Yu Nan-geng<br />January 5<br />[Address omitted]</p><p>(Dr. Stearns's whole family is now in Shanghai and is safe. The meetings in Wen-teh Lane continue as usual. Brother Chang Kwang-rong is still in Shanghai. We have not heard any news from Brother Tang Shou-ling recently. I will ask Brother Lan Tsi-yi to send you The Open Door and the local newsletters from Hankow&mdash;Philip.)</p><h2 class="head2">Hsiang-Tan, Hunan Province</h2><p>Greetings to Mr. X in the Lord:</p><p>I received your express letter and postcard. I intended to answer them a long time ago, but I have been cleaning out materials and other things, so I have delayed until today. Please forgive me for the Lord's sake. I wrote a letter to Miss Lee a long time ago. I also answered Brother Han and Miss Tso's letters when I received them. Please do not worry. Five other sisters came with me to Zhen-Chiang Hospital, and we are still together. They are all well. There is a seventy to eighty percent chance that we will go to Nan-ning in Kwangsi province. We probably will not stay together wherever we go in the future. We will probably spread out into four clinics, so we five will have to separate to four different places. I have no difficulties at present and am doing fine financially. However, I will have to pass through a difficult portion on the way ahead. Even though my heart is ready to break, I hope the union with the Lord is not broken. I only ask that God would keep me. Thank and praise Him. Since He has opened up this way for me, I hope that He will gain something from it. Peace in the Lord.</p><p>The weak one in the Lord,<br />Chien Sin-hsian<br />January 24</p><p>(This letter was mailed from the Hunan-Kweichow Railway Clinic, Hunan, to Hankow. Perhaps Sister Chien has already gone to Nan-ning, Kwangsi province&mdash;Editor.)</p><h2 class="head2">Li-Ling, Hunan Province</h2><p>Due to the many things entangling me and to the fact that I do not have a settled place, I can only send a simple greeting to the brothers and sisters in the Lord. I hope that you will forgive me before God. After the hospital was destroyed last year on December 9, I took a train with some friends to Ch'ang-sha in the middle of the night on the eleventh. On the fourteenth I transferred to the Ju-Ping line and arrived in Li-Ling. I am staying at the house of a friend's aunt. I have been here for more than a month. I contracted the mumps more than ten days ago and find it difficult to read or write. I really thank God that having Him in a difficult situation is better than not having Him in an easy situation. Therefore, I feel that this is a good opportunity to learn the lesson of worshipping Him. I usually have a quick temper, but now I am forced to endure quietly. I am telling you about my situation so that those in the Lord who know about it will remember me before the Father for my weaknesses.</p><p>Liu Su-fang<br />January 21</p><p>(Sister Su-fang: I hope you will tell us your mailing address&mdash;Ruth.)</p><h2 class="head2">Chungking, Szechuan Province</h2><p>Greetings to all the brothers and sisters in the Lord:</p><p>Grace, peace, and joy from the Father and the Lord Jesus to you! After the recent unfortunate event, God's special grace has been very great and marvelous among His children. God is edifying His children through the environment and is spreading His gospel so that many people in the interior and remote regions can hear of salvation. Praise Him! It was really the Lord's arrangement and grace for me to come to Chungking. After I arrived in Chungking, I met a few brothers and sisters in the Lord. Thank the Lord, God had already sent His servant Brother Chang Yu-zhi to work here before we came. Later, Sisters Lee, Wang, and Chang came. They mainly preached the gospel in the missionary schools and held Bible studies. Thank our Lord for gaining a few in these meetings. In addition, many brothers and sisters have come to Chungking, and we often meet together. The meetings are in Brother Yuan Hou-tsai's home at 4-3 Shang-Chang Garden. This is all God's doing; we have not done anything at all. We began the table meeting on January 30. There were more than ten brothers and sisters. Thank the Lord, although there were not many people, the taste was precious. There is a prayer meeting every Thursday evening at 7:00 p.m. and a preaching meeting on the Lord's Day at 3:00 p.m. (at present it is for edifying Christians). We remember the Lord at 5:00 p.m. Over the Chinese New Year, we preached the gospel for ten days in special meetings apart from the regular ones (February 1-10) at the Cross Chapel. Brother Chang Yu-zhi was responsible for the speaking. On February 21 we began to have a Bible study meeting every evening in the meeting place. Brother Chang Yu-zhi is also responsible for the speaking. The Lord has already blessed His work. We had the first baptism on the nineteenth of this month. (Five brothers, Lee Yun-hsuan, Huang Ai-san, Hsia Wen-gan, Liu Yi-peng, and Niu Jin-fang, were baptized.) We will go to the southern hot springs on the twenty-sixth of this month for the second baptism meeting (two brothers and six sisters).</p><p>Brother Ge Shien-shen, Brother Lee Yun-hsuan, and I are responsible for the meetings. The responsibility for the assembly is very heavy. We are so weak and powerless and are really not worthy of such a task. May the Lord give grace and bless us in spite of our weaknesses so that His church may be preserved. We really need your prayers and advice. Brother Ge Shien-shen went to visit his relatives in Chekiang on the seventeenth. He will return to Chungking in about two months. There are dangers along the way, but our Lord is with him, so he will not fall into danger. Please remember him often in your prayers.</p><p>The Lord has begun a good work here and is gradually raising up people. On one Lord's Day there were thirty brothers and sisters in the table meeting. Praise the Lord! May He add the saved ones daily to His church. May the Lord be with you all until the day of His coming.</p><p>Your weak brother in the Lord,<br />Liu Guo-hua<br />February 22, 1938<br />[Address omitted]</p><h2 class="head2">Tsinan, Shantung Province</h2><h2 class="head3">One</h2><p>Greetings to all the brothers and sisters in the Lord:</p><p>The brothers and sisters in the Lord in Tsinan (whom I know of, who meet at 10 Kuang-Chih Street, and the rest) are all safe. Please continue to pray for us. I believe that the Lord's blood has cleansed us, and we have been sealed. Please tell Liu Kuo-hsiang, Liu Kuo-hwa, and Liu Chu-fei that their homes and families are safe. Peace in the Lord.</p><p>Your brother in the Lord,<br />Yu Jia-chi<br />December 30, 1937</p><h2 class="head3">Two</h2><p>Dear Brother Watchman in the Lord:</p><p>Thank the Lord for really showing us that He cares for His children. In this time of distress, I have committed everything to the faithful Lord and watched His acts quietly. My faith was fully assured. Most of the brothers and sisters in Hong Kong are still safe. Although a few have had some slight problems, they have suffered no loss. On the contrary, we have received a great benefit. Now our meetings consist of a gospel meeting at 10:30 a.m. on the Lord's Day and a table meeting at 3:00 p.m. This coming Thursday (the twenty-fourth), from 2:00 to 4:00 p.m., there will be a new meeting for prayer and fellowship (to meet, shake hands, converse, etc.). However, this meeting is temporary. Once the political situation becomes stable, we will resume our prayer meeting at 7:00 p.m. on Wednesday, the sisters' prayer meeting on Friday, and the discussion meeting on Saturday evenings. I have received the second issue of The Open Door. The first message on the truth is really precious. God corrected many of our mistakes through His word. I am enclosing twelve order forms. We would like to order a total of fifteen copies. Please send them all to: Yu Jia Chi, Chi-Loo University Medical School, Tsinan, Shantung. Please remember us and the Lord's work often. Peace in the Lord.</p><p>Your little brother in the Lord,<br />Yu Jia-chi<br />January 16</p><h2 class="head3">Three</h2><p>To my son Guo-hwa (a family letter):</p><p>Everything is fine at home. Although we cannot see each other because of the political situation, we have God's leading and the Lord's presence, and we will never have wants. The brothers and sisters in Tsinan are all well. Sister Chung's family is well also. Thank the Lord.</p><p>Your mother<br />January 2</p><p>(This is one of Brother Liu Guo-hwa's letters from home&mdash;Editor.)</p><h2 class="head2">Chefoo, Shantung Province</h2><p>Greetings to Sister Lee</p><p>whom we are concerned for in Christ:</p><p>We received the second issue of The Open Door yesterday and were so thankful when we read it. We are sending an order form today so that you can send us the next issue. After you and Sister Wang came to my house and prayed for Rui-ying, we gained a deep impression of the Lord's love. Although we do not write often, we often pray for you by name before God's throne. Rui-ying's illness has not been completely healed, so we deeply hope you will pray for her. God has given Chefoo peace. Thank those who walk in the way of loving the Lord for the grace they have given. Peace! May the work go smoothly.</p><p>Qu Tze-yuan, Luan Rui-ying<br />January 11</p><h2 class="head2">Tsingtao</h2><h2 class="head3">One</h2><p>Peace to my dear brother Philip in the Lord:</p><p>Our hearts are filled with thanks and praise to the Lord who loves us! He has given us grace. He is the true and living God! When I pass out gospel tracts on the street, many people come over to ask for them as if they are asking for something precious. May the Lord give them grace so that they may gain comfort from those words. One day, while a few brothers and sisters were praying with me, we saw a short slip of paper before our eyes. The first sentence said, "Fear not...I am thy shield, and thy exceeding great reward" (Gen. 15:1). The second sentence said, "He is a shield unto them that put their trust in him" (Prov. 30:5). Hallelujah! Thank and praise the Lord! We knelt down and prayed for the brothers and sisters in each locality. Please remember the unbelievers here in your prayers. If the Lord allows, perhaps I will return home for a period of time. Please pray much for the brothers and sisters in Tsingtao. Please order seven copies of The Open Door for us. Peace in the Lord! Greetings to all the brothers and sisters in Hankow from all the brothers and sisters in Tsingtao. Greetings to Mrs. Luan.</p><p>Your brother in the Lord,<br />Chang Tze-jieh<br />January 10<br />[Address omitted]</p><h2 class="head3">Two</h2><p>X in the Lord:</p><p>I have not written you for a long time. I have often wanted to write, but I did not know what to write, so I have put it off until today. Thank the Lord! I read the last little paragraph of The Open Door today and found out that you were happy to hear our news, so I am writing this letter. Thank the Lord! Praise the Lord! He is the never-changing Lord! He will never forget those whom He loves! I am very unworthy, but it does not matter. When I was in Ling-Zi, I heard the rumors of war getting worse and worse every day. But thank the Lord, His doings are truly marvelous because He allowed me to do some work in Guang-Rao during that time. Outwardly I was helping people, but inwardly I was edified myself.</p><p>On December 4 Mrs. Shen and Mrs. Yuan Ling-shu safely arrived in Tsingtao with their daughters. Thank the Lord for edifying us every day. The Lord gave me the word in 2 Timothy 2:22 before I left. Since my arrival, it has been wonderful for us to be able to pray in one accord daily. May the Lord grant us grace upon grace. Peace in the Lord. Greetings to Sister Chang and Sister Wang. I received a letter dated January 1 from a brother in Ling-Zi saying that the county seat of Guang-Rao has been captured by bandits. Since Guang-Rao was lost, Ling-Zi is nervous. May the Lord preserve those who believe in Him in those two places.</p><p>Jing Sin-nai<br />[Address omitted]</p><h2 class="head2">Tientsin</h2><h2 class="head3">One</h2><p>Greetings to X in the Lord:</p><p>Thank and praise God for allowing the brothers and sisters in Tientsin to read The Open Door. We have received both the first and second issues and have passed them out to the brothers and sisters. Most of the brothers and sisters are living at temporary addresses. They move or leave Tientsin constantly. Communication by mail is also difficult, so the responsible brothers will subscribe for the brothers and sisters and distribute them accordingly. This way the publications will not be lost, and the saints in Hankow will be spared much trouble. Is this all right with you? (It is very good&mdash;Editor.) I am enclosing an order form for a total of eighty copies. I am wiring X dollars through the Bank of China for the Lord's work and the publication costs. Some was collected from the offering box for the work in Hankow, and some is local offerings for the expansion of the Lord's work in general. Please determine how it should be distributed. Let me give a little report of the assembly in Tientsin: Our address is still 82 Alley 6 Yao-Hua-Li, British Concession 21 Road, Tientsin. Thank and praise the Lord. Our meetings have continued as usual since the beginning of the war; we have not had to cancel even one meeting. Our meetings include edification meetings, gospel meetings, table meetings, prayer meetings, and Bible studies. Although we can grow cold and change, the Lord who loves us will never change; He will love us to the end. He manifests His wisdom, power, grace, mercy, and love to His children all the time. Truly, "Had we ten thousand thousand tongues, our theme of joy's but one!" Praise and thank our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ! The brothers and sisters are all well and safe in the Lord. Please do not worry. There are, however, a few who have lost their jobs. Please remember us in your prayers. We also hope that God's workers will come here often. May the Lord be with you until He comes. Peace and joy to all the brothers and sisters in the Lord! Amen.</p><p>Your brothers,<br />Lee Bih, Sia Si-ling<br />[Address omitted]</p><h2 class="head3">Two</h2><p>Greetings, Sister X:</p><p>I arrived safely in Tientsin on February 11. My mother's health is fairly good. The brothers and sisters in Tientsin are living and growing. They wrote a letter inviting Brother Witness Lee to come here, but Mr. Lee said that he did not have a burden to come yet. I also heard that the brothers and sisters in Peking invited Brother Philip Luan. Perhaps Mr. Luan will come soon. Thank God, He is never wrong. Brother Sia, one of the responsible brothers in Tientsin, mentioned that he wanted me to have a few days of sisters' meetings. I will be staying one or two months in Tientsin, so I will be praying with the sisters every Friday in the sisters' prayer meeting. The rest of the time I will have much contact with the sisters. Brother Hsia agreed to this. Sister Fu-ru also intends to come north. I have already asked others to look for a house that she can rent. We will see how God leads and arranges. Peace in the Lord.</p><p>Your sister,<br />Hwei-fen<br />February 14<br />[Address omitted]</p><h2 class="head2">Peking</h2><h2 class="head3">One</h2><p>Greetings to our dear Brother Tsi-yi in the Lord:</p><p>I received your letter. We have already received one hundred copies of The Open Door and distributed them to the brothers and sisters.</p><p>We prepared X dollars for the use of The Open Door a long time ago. However, wiring it was a problem, so we did not send it until the twenty-first. We sent it through the Shanghai Bank. Please follow it up. The condition of the assembly is quite good for the most part. Thank and praise the Lord! Please pray for the work here. Peace in the Lord. Please send subsequent issues of The Open Door to the meeting hall for us to distribute to the brothers and sisters. This will save you postage.</p><p>Your brothers,<br />Hsiao Lu-yuan, Ping Sin-wo<br />January 22<br />[Address omitted]</p><h2 class="head3">Two</h2><p>Brother Watchman:</p><p>May the Lord give you more spiritual gifts, power, and light, and may the number of believers increase and the work spread. Amen. Thank the Lord and thank you for your love. Yesterday, I received the second issue of The Open Door which you sent. I read the article on the principles of the work and felt that Christians today really need principles like this concerning the truth of the church. It also inspired me to write this letter. Thank and praise God that His faithful servant has already explained everything. Therefore, I am sending a subscription form to order one copy so that I may read everything. Please send me a copy of the first issue as well. I am enclosing my subscription form and one dollar for postage. Peace!</p><p>Your brother in the Lord,<br />Ding Jun-jih<br />January 26<br />[Address omitted]</p><p>(We printed only one thousand copies of the first issue, and they are all gone. Could you go to 5 Foreign Ministry Street and ask the brothers if they have a copy?&mdash;Editor.)</p><h2 class="head3">Three</h2><p>Peace to Mr. X in the Lord,</p><p>From The Open Door, I found out about the condition of the Lord's work in all the localities. Thank the Lord, He always takes care of His work. My heart was very happy because He is the beginning and the end. Since He raised up the work, He will also complete it. The assembly in Peking really needs the light the Lord brought in through The Open Door&mdash;the principles of the work. May the Lord lead us according to these principles. All the brothers and sisters in Peking are safe under the Lord's protection. No one has lost their job yet. This is the result of the petitions of all the brothers and sisters. Please pray for me so that the Lord would revive my prayer life and so that my inner man would be strengthened. I am sending X dollars. X dollars are for the publication of The Open Door; the rest is for the use of the Lord's workers. Peace in the Lord. Please greet Brother Nee.</p><p>Your little brother,<br />Chu Teh-yau<br />January 17</p><h2 class="head3">Four</h2><p>Sister Peace:</p><p>Thank God for His rich love and mercy. He never leaves those whom He has purchased by His blood! The assembly here is completely in God's hands. Every Saturday there is an edification meeting at five o'clock. I can always go. We mainly look to the Lord for His own work. On the Lord's Day morning there is a gospel meeting. Many people come to hear the word. Brother Hsu Zih-fang is being used by God to preach the messages. There are many brothers and sisters in the table meeting in the afternoon. Please pray for us much. May you be blessed with health in the Lord!</p><p>Your sister,<br />Shen Shi-shuan<br />January 16<br />[Address omitted]</p><h2 class="head3">Five</h2><p>Peace to Sister X in the Lord:</p><p>I received your letter of January 13. Thank the Lord that the sisters of Hsieh-Ho Hospital have had much improvement. More sisters are coming to the meetings, and the sisters in Peking are well. When we pray, we remember your work in the field and ask God to be with you so that you may express His glory in the regions of darkness. Sister Chiang writes sometimes. She is in Huang County, Shantung. She said that the Chinese New Year is a better opportunity to preach the gospel because the farmers have some free time. Praise the Lord! There are more prayer meetings at Foreign Ministry Street. We began a children's meeting on Friday about two months ago. Last Friday there were twenty-seven or twenty-eight children. It was really good. Brother Luan's last letter said that he may come to Peking to visit the brothers and sisters. We are eager for him to come. Everyone likes to hear him speak. Brother Wang Jien-tang from Tientsin is in Peking. He goes out every day for his personal business and the gospel. This morning he asked me to greet you. At one time we thought that you would be able to come to Peking. Now you are getting further and further away, so I do not know when I will be able to see you. May the Lord lead you. Please pray for what I mentioned above, and please pray for me. May God work in the heart of everyone who hears the gospel. Peace in the Lord. Greet the two sisters working with you.</p><p>Your little sister in the Lord,<br />Huang Jen-zhi<br />January 9</p><h2 class="head3">Six</h2><p>The condition of the assembly is really good now. There were more than seventy in one table meeting. However, the point is not how many people there are, but the godliness displayed in the worship. By this we know that God is among us. I left Hsieh-Ho Hospital on July 1 of last year. I am clear that it was God's will for me to leave. After coming out, I saw all the work before me, and I jumped into it. Now I am going to homes to visit women, both believers and unbelievers. I have been to more than two hundred fifty homes and have seen the glory of God. I am useless and cannot do anything, but God Himself works everywhere. Praise and thank His holy name.</p><p>Your little sister in the Lord,<br />Huang Jen-zhi</p><p>(This letter was sent from Peking to Hong Kong&mdash;Editor.)</p><h2 class="head2">Feng-Tien</h2><p>Greetings to Brother Luan in the Lord:</p><p>Thank the Lord for preserving us and gracing us to this day. Before we received The Open Door, the Lord had given us some light concerning how the localities should meet by themselves and how the local brothers and sisters should bear the spiritual and practical responsibilities. This is the only way to have real growth. Thank the Lord that His light shined more clearly on us when we received this issue of The Open Door. We can only rely on Him and ask Him to lead the localities into His grace. We pray constantly before Him for the believers in every place. May the Lord give grace to the brothers and sisters in every place. We thank the Lord even more because the faithfulness of the saints to the Lord has touched our hearts. Peace in the Lord.</p><p>Your brothers,<br />Chao Fei-wo, Sang Chen-kuang<br />January 21</p><h2 class="head2">Sian, Shensi Province</h2><p>Greetings to Mr. X in the Lord:</p><p>I received a copy of the first and second issues of The Open Door from my brother Shi-shun. Now I know about the condition of the work in all the localities and how the brothers and sisters are doing. I am really thankful. There were meetings in Sian last winter in Brother Chao Rue-tze's house. Brother Chao was here from Tsinan at that time, and I had temporarily moved there from Tai-Yuan. In the middle of November, I returned to my ancestral home (Hwai-Yuen, Anhwei). On January 20 my brother, Shi-shun, and I returned. Brother Chao had already moved his family to Szechuan. There are no meetings now. In the deepest part of my spirit and heart, I feel that I have lost a support without the meetings; I am very depressed. If the Lord allows, I hope to bring my family so that we can rent a house and begin to meet. It is easier to meet in someone's home. The Lord is omnipotent. I really hope you and all the brothers and sisters will pray for this matter so that it will come to pass soon. Please send all subsequent issues of The Open Door, beginning with the third issue, to me. If there are extra copies of the first and second issues, please send me one copy. Peace in the Lord!</p><p>Your weak brother in the Lord,<br />Liu Jih-wu<br />February 15<br />[Address omitted]</p><h2 class="head2">Ningsia, Kansu Province</h2><p>Greetings to my dear Mr. Nee and all the brothers</p><p>in Hankow in the Lord:</p><p>Thank the Lord, I unexpectedly received The Open Door a few days ago and really received much comfort and encouragement. I saw that God has seen the hungry lambs in the inland and remote regions of our country, and He is using the war to save sinners by sending out his servants. In Kansu and Tsinghai provinces, we really need and desire these workers. May the Lord send and lead some to come, amen. We hope that you will not forget us in Kansu and Tsinghai. We hope that you will follow the Lord's will to come according to His commission and feed His lambs "unto the uttermost part of the earth." May God have mercy on us in this matter. Even more, may His will be done. Please continue to send The Open Door. Peace in the Lord.</p><p>Your little brother in the Lord,<br />Wang Kuo-jing<br />January 10<br />[Address omitted]</p><h2 class="head2">Tien-Shui, Kansu Province</h2><p>Brothers and sisters in the Lord:</p><p>I received the second issue of The Open Door from Brother Duan Chai-ju. I really thank God that I have some news concerning the brothers and sisters. I am sending a subscription form and hope that you will send me ten copies in the future. The preaching brothers in the provinces of Kansu and Tsinghai also need them. I am settled in one place, so I can pass them on. I came from Tsinan with some brothers and sisters this spring. We hope you will help us through prayer. Peace in the Lord.</p><p>Your brother,<br />Kung Shou-ren<br />[Address omitted]</p><h2 class="head2">Yu-Jing, Kansu Province</h2><p>Greetings to Brother X in the Lord:</p><p>I believe you can love me as a younger brother in the Lord. I began working in the Independent Textile Store in 1928. This store is a wholesale textile business. In the past its yearly sales exceeded five hundred thousand dollars. Recently, business has declined, and workers have been laid off. The area of our business has also decreased. We are a branch store of the store in Ding-Si, so sometimes I am in Ding-Si and sometimes in Yu-Jing. When I first entered the business, I received a little more than ten dollars a year. I now receive seventy-five dollars a year. Although I do not earn much, the standard of living is very low, so I do not have any financial problems. There is only one thing that troubles me! I am surrounded by lying tongues! I have never had the peace to lie, so rather than tell a lie, I do not speak much. I am very free in Yu-Jing and can attend the meetings every week. However, the meeting in X is like a half-dead body. Some brothers need a co-worker to pray and read the Bible for them.</p><p>Your little brother in the Lord,<br />Lee Geng-shun<br />January 11<br />[Address omitted]</p><h2 class="head2">Hong Kong</h2><p>Sister X:</p><p>I heard that you had already arrived in Chungking. Forgive me for waiting to greet you until now. I heard my father tell his company in Hankow to send X dollars to you in January. Did you receive the wire? Are you safe in Chungking? Are Sisters Wang and Chang well? If you have time, please send me a note. The business in Hong Kong has received God's protection and blessing. It has doubled since last year. My father went to Singapore on January 2. He hopes to buy a store there. Please pray for him. If God is pleased, we will open a branch store. Although I am so busy, my health is still holding up. It is all the Lord's grace. My brother has returned to Shanghai. He will not open a store for the time being. Sister Liu Ching-dong is now helping me in the store. I will tell you the rest later.</p><p>Your sister,<br />Huang Shiu-bao<br />February 12<br />[Addresss omitted]</p><p>(This letter was sent by Brother Huang Tsao-ling's daughter Shiu-bao&mdash;Editor.)</p><h2 class="head2">Singapore</h2><p>Dear brother in the Lord:</p><p>I think you will want to know about the condition of the church in Singapore and Brother Luk's work. I will report some of it to you. We are now temporarily meeting at...Singapore. This is Brother Wang Kai-sen's home. (Brother Wang is one of the responsible brothers in this locality.) The number of people has increased, and the place is too small. We are looking for a meeting hall. There are more than fifty brothers and sisters, with more brothers than sisters. This is different from other places. There is a gospel meeting now at 10:00 a.m. on the Lord's Day and an edification meeting at 2:30 p.m. The table meeting is at 7:30 p.m. There are meetings every day from Monday through Saturday, such as the prayer meeting, the sisters' meeting, the brothers' meeting, the Bible study, etc. The Lord has raised up the work among us. The brothers sent a letter inviting Brother Ke-san, Brother Lien-jun, and Brother Stephen Kaung to come. We do not know what the Lord will do yet. Brother Luk will be leaving tonight (January 10) for Penang. He will return to Singapore in about ten days. We hope you will pray for all matters concerning us. May the Lord be with you until that day. Amen.</p><p>Your little brother in the Lord,<br />Huang Ren-shan<br />January 10</p><p>(This letter was sent from Singapore to K'un-ming&mdash; Editor.)</p><h2 class="head2">Manila</h2><p>Sister Ruth in the Lord:</p><p>Thank and praise our Lord for His faithfulness. His promise to me on January 1, 1937 was true. The eternal God is really our hiding place and shield. Praise His name! When I felt that I should travel south, I placed the matter before God. Thank the Lord for leading me step by step. I told the Lord that if it was His will for me to leave Shanghai, He should prepare someone to rent my house and furniture for a certain price. I went through several months of testing. It seemed that my house was not going to be rented, but I kept saying that what was difficult for man was not difficult for God; I was peaceful in my heart. Indeed, the Father had already made arrangements for me secretly! I not only rented my house for the price asked, but the timing was perfect. The lease on the tenant's old house was not up until December 20, and we could stay until that day. On the twenty-third, there was a boat to Manila and our passports were ready about the same time. I really saw the Lord's love. He is not a respecter of persons. He really remembers the orphans and the widows. The Lord prepared a job for Mrs. Chien and a home for Yi-tseng (Mrs. Chien's son). Thank the Lord, He really is the Lord who does beyond what we ask or think! Praise His name! We left Shanghai on December 23 and passed though Hong Kong on the twenty-fifth. We met with many brothers and sisters there. We really saw the Lord's love everywhere! We felt both thankful and ashamed in our hearts! We arrived safely in Manila on the twenty-seventh and are now living in my elder brother's house. May the Lord accomplish what He wants to do in His children. Please pray for me. Please greet Sister Chang and Sister Wang for me. Peace in the Lord. En-hung and my daughters all ask me to greet you.</p><p>Your sister,<br />Yun-chang<br />January 18</p><h2 class="head1">NEWS OF A FEW BROTHERS AND SISTERS</h2><p>Mrs. Han Fu-sheng is safe in her ancestral home in Wu-Jen, Kiangsu.</p><p>Brother Chang Hao-ran has arrived in Shanghai and will be teaching in a school.</p><p>Sister Hsiao Yu-yin, Sister Chang Yi-hwa, and Brother Chang Ho-nien are all in Shih-Lu-Tou Ch'en Po Du, Ning-Po.</p><p>(The above are excerpts from Brother Ho Yueh-chiao's letter of January 26&mdash;Editor.)</p><p>Brother Chu En-sheng passed through Shanghai. All the brothers and sisters are hiding out in the countryside around Chi-Hsien-Chiao. His store was robbed. Brother Chou Jin-tang has already come to Shanghai.</p><p>(The above is an excerpt from Brother Ho Yueh-chiao's letter of February 19&mdash;Editor.)</p><p>"We received a letter from Tang Shou-ling last night and a letter from Brother Chou Hsing-yih this morning. We found out they are both living in Mo-Gan-Shan (250 Mo-Gan-Shan). The Sun family, the Yeh family, and the Yu family are all staying with them. The letter was given to friends and carried to us. It was very simple. They said, `Our homes are gone, but we are alive,' and, `May the Lord open the way.' The letter was dated January 30, but we did not receive it until yesterday, so we do not know how they are doing now. We cannot send mail or wire money to them. We can only pray for them on the one hand, and ask some of our Western friends to see whether they can go to Mo-Gan-Shan and bring them out on the other hand."</p><p>(The above is an excerpt of a letter from the three elders in Shanghai, Du Chung-chen, Wu You-an, and Lin Kwang-biao&mdash;Editor.)</p><h2 class="head1">ANNOUNCEMENTS</h2><p>(1) The meeting place of the church in Fu-Ching moved from Luke Hospital back to 65 Siao-Chiao Street, Fu-Ching on February 18.

On the twentieth of this month, they will go south to Hong Kong and from there to Amoy.</p><h2 class="head1">A WORD ON BEHALF OF THE EDITOR</h2><p>The fourth issue of this publication was a half month late in coming out because the typesetting and printing workers took a vacation for the Chinese New Year. Beginning with the sixth issue, we hope that our paper will come out by the middle of each month.</p><p>Presently, this publication cannot publish articles concerning the principles of the work. Those who do not care for the news of work and the churches will find it boring. However, if we can take Christ's heart as our own, we will thank God and also pray much for the work and the brothers and sisters after reading this publication. I hope and pray to God that He would raise up many people who will pray powerfully in secret behind the work. They must be powerful before God in order to break down Satan's strongholds, overthrow every high thing that frustrates people from knowing God, and capture people's hearts so that they would all submit to Christ.</p><p>Some brothers have written letters saying that using the letter X to replace names and places is not so appropriate, so beginning with this issue, we will use the X less. Sometimes we will use the X to replace a person's name or a number so that we can avoid having man as our center and also avoid giving glory to man's will. Many brothers and sisters correspond with others with the intention of spiritual fellowship and the discussion of spiritual matters. However, we are afraid some people might gradually misunderstand and think that certain people have a special position or are higher than others, so we use X to replace the names of the people who receive the letters because love covers all things (it does not expose people's private matters). The writers of the letters have never had their names replaced with X because they are responsible for what they wrote. We thank God that all the localities and some individuals are mindful of the needs of the work and the saints, and we hope that all the saints would thank God for this. But we do not want a printed number to cause some to boast or to reveal who is rich and who is poor, thus turning the offerings into something that is not out of love or the leading of God. For this reason, we use X to replace any amount of money. The example given to us by the New Testament churches is also this way. According to Acts 4:37, Barnabas "possessed a field, sold it and brought the sum of money and placed it at the feet of the apostles." Second Corinthians 8:2 says that the churches in Macedonia in "the depth of their poverty abounded unto the riches of their liberality." Philippians 4:16 says, "You sent both once and again to my need." The brothers who brought this to mind did not mention this matter, but I am just taking this opportunity to give an explanation. (Of course, those who send money had to write the amount or they would be unable to wire the money.)</p><p>When more than one letter comes from one locality with the same news, we often publish only one of them. We do not publish letters that are not very important. We may delete some portions of your writing. There are also some letters which are good, but the editors do not feel inwardly peaceful about them and decide not to print them. Perhaps this is prejudice, screening, or an inward hindrance. We dare not say what it is, but we can only do what keeps our hearts at peace. We ask your special forgiveness for this. May God give grace that this kind of deletion would not hurt, offend, or bury anyone.</p><p>Before putting out this publication, I seemed to have two concerns: (1) Some people are still not clear about the Lord's calling, and others cannot give a testimony for them, but they consider themselves apostles after they have done a little work. Those who do not know these ones may see them as apostles; this will not edify people and is not beneficial to the entire church. (2) Some people are used by the Lord, but because their flesh has not been dealt with, they have too much fleshly activity. Mr. Nee has now given us the light concerning the local churches. A local church can prove those who call themselves apostles but are not. Thus, my first concern is no longer a problem. With regard to my second concern, I hope that the co-workers in every place and in all the local churches will do their best to send news to us for the sake of God's glory, mutual fellowship, and prayer. I also hope that the motive behind every letter is pure and that the reports are not exaggerated. Some apostles can be like Paul and do not need the recommendation of men. However, some apostles still need to be tested. They need the introduction of the co-workers who are ahead of them. Therefore, we ask the faithful co-workers to help us in both the positive and negative aspects of this matter so that we may publish the news with care.</p><p>Recently a co-worker (brother) sent a letter saying that one locality only knows that we preach baptism and leaving the denominations. They did not seem to have heard any of the other truths. I do not know whether someone has really preached this way or whether this is the misunderstanding of some dissatisfied ones. However, we must be careful, so I will quote some of Mr. Nee's words from the first issue, "Finally, a word of reminder: Our urgent need is the preaching of the gospel and the establishing of the local churches. We are not here to exhort others to leave the denominations. Those who pay attention only to the question of denominationalism...are not our co-workers and are not qualified to be our co-workers."</p><p>It is very difficult to mail letters. Some places have not even received the second issue. Beginning with the third issue, we have been using the quickest method to send one or two copies to each locality. We send the rest by surface mail. Therefore, we hope that when the churches in each locality receive this publication, they would immediately report the important points of all the news to the brothers and sisters so that they will not worry and will know what to pray for.</p><p>If there is any news that cannot be made public, please note it in your letters. If any letter must be given directly to Mr. Nee, please state this in the letter. Many letters come to Hankow addressed to Mr. Nee, but they contain news of the work or the churches. Some of the news has a time limit, but Mr. Nee travels constantly because of the work and is planning to go abroad; if we do not need to forward it to him, we can just publish it in this publication. (If letters for Mr. Nee are sent to the P. O. Box in Hankow, we ask Brother Lan to open and read them and then give them to the editors of this publication. This is the agreement we made with Mr. Nee.)</p><p>Finally, a brother in Hankow who proofreads sent us a letter saying that there were still many mistakes after the second proofing of the fourth issue, but that the printer had printed it before it could be proofed a third time. There were many mistakes in the fourth issue in both words and punctuation. We want to apologize to our readers for these mistakes!</p><p>Ruth Lee<br />March 5, 1938, in Chungking</p><h2 class="head1">A FEW REQUESTS</h2><p>(1) The co-workers and many brothers and sisters are really concerned about the news of the churches and individual brothers and sisters from the war zone and the areas neighboring it! Therefore, we hope you will do your best to send the news to us. Because the postal service is often blocked, we think it would be best if you could send your letters by express mail or air mail.</p><p>(2) Put a date on your letters. Without a date, we do not know when the news happened. Sometimes we cannot read the postmark.</p><p>(3) Write the address clearly and completely. If you are in a different province, write the province.</p><p>(4) When a mailing address changes, notify us immediately (if possible), so that we will still know where you are and not mail things to the wrong place.</p><p>(5) We edit this publication wherever we are, and we print and publish it in Hankow. Whoever wants this publication should subscribe to it by writing directly to Hankow. News of the work and the churches should also be sent directly to the Gospel Book Room, P. O. Box 84, Hankow.</p><p>(6) Please pray much for this publication.</p><h2 class="head1">ANNOUNCEMENTS</h2><p>(1) This publication is temporarily being published in Hankow. Therefore, any news of the work and the churches, subscription order forms, and requests for information should all be sent directly to the Gospel Book Room, P. O. Box 84, Hankow.</p><p>(2) There is a branch store of the Gospel Book Room in Hankow. Any locality near Hankow that wants to buy publications from our book room can buy them directly from Hankow. Those who live in Hankow should come to Gospel Court, Hsiao Tung 1 Alley. If Hankow does not have a certain book, Shanghai will send it by mail. However, we ask you to forgive us for the time it takes to mail.</p><p>(3) If anyone wants gospel tracts or wants us to print gospel tracts, please contact the Shanghai Gospel Book Room directly, P. O. Box 323, Shanghai. If anyone wants to request the brothers in Hankow to contact Shanghai, please write to them at Gospel Court, Hsiao Tung 1 Alley and ask the Hankow brothers to do it.</p><p>(4) Because the mail is often delayed (printed materials are even slower), one or two copies of this publication will be sent by the fastest method to all the localities. We will then send a large number to the responsible brothers of each locality and ask them to distribute the publication to each brother and sister. Then we will send them according to our subscription list. Therefore, if the brothers and sisters in each locality have not sent in a subscription form yet, please get your copy from the responsible brothers in your locality.</p><p>(5) All the letters for The Christian that are received in Hankow will be forwarded to the Shanghai Gospel Book Room to be recorded and answered. We hope that soon the mail will not be so much trouble and that the publication can be resumed.</p><h1 class="title">ISSUE NO. 6</h1><h2 class="head4">(P. O. Box 84, Hankow, April 1938)</h2><h2 class="head1">NEWS CONCERNING THE WORK</h2><h2 class="head2">A Letter from Brother Hsu Dah-weh, Chekiang</h2><p>To my brother in the Lord, Kwang-rong:</p><p>I received your letter of the thirteenth. I returned to Wu-Yi from Jinhua on the fifteenth. I went first to the Ho home in North County of Wu-Yi and was stranded there for eight days by the rain and snow, so I did not come into the city until the day before yesterday. If the Lord allows, I might go to Hsuan-Ping to do some work and then from there go to Wenchow and Ping-Yang to see the brothers. If I do not go there, I will go to Ning-Po or Shanghai. Presently, I cannot go to Shanghai, so I will lose this opportunity to see Brother Nee according to God's decision. I have really wanted to see Brother Nee and have considered writing a letter for some time. For the past few months, I have been traveling alone and have given God many opportunities to work in me. (Unfortunately, rotten wood cannot be made into anything useful.) Satan has come to attack me through the power of darkness, but the power of the victorious One has been sufficient to uphold me and take me through the valleys and the depths. The Lord's grace and love are limitless, and their preciousness and practicality are made all the more real! Over the past few months, I have come to realize that it is very important to live a life of faith in God and to have a living knowledge of God. It is not enough to know that we are weak; we must also know the power of His resurrection. I really feel that the heavenly power is so necessary, and the spiritual supply so precious. But one must have a living knowledge of Christ, the Son of God, to meet these needs. A negative realization of oneself is not enough. May the Lord have mercy on me! I dare not say that the knowledge of the truth is useless, but one must have the experience of life to prove it. Otherwise, the truth may be real, but there is nothing to attest to it. Of course, knowledge of the truth is useful in showing the direction. The knowledge of the truth can be compared to light, but life is the experience of walking in the light. Therefore, we should hold life and knowledge on the same level (2 Pet. 3:18).</p><p>In my solitude I really sense the dearness of the Lord! His sympathy refreshes my tiredness. I feel that it is not hard to be one in heart, but very difficult to be one in feeling. One need only to obey to be one in heart, but to be one in feeling, one must also have inward knowledge. Therefore, I really feel that if I am going to allow Christ to live out of me, it is not enough to have just brotherly love. I must have the heart of a father or mother. I like reading the Epistles of Paul because this kind of real emotion is expressed in them. The Lord is dear, not because He died on the cross in obedience to God's command, but because of the love He expressed through the cross and the enlightening He gave us through it. Therefore, He not only died for His earthly ministry, but also gave grace because He sympathized with our poverty. This is what I have been thinking of recently. In recent months I have been practicing walking. Thank the Lord, fifty miles is not a fearful distance to me now. There was a time when I would gasp at the thought of walking ten miles. The Lord's commission often carries us to unexpected places. A slave should always be prepared, lest he give excuse before the battle. When I consider how useless I am, I really feel that I owe the Lord too much and that time is too short! Oh, I can only press forward! Please remember me in your prayer. It is already cold. I will not continue. Peace in the Lord!</p><p>Your brother in the Lord,<br />Hsu Dah-weh</p><p>(This letter arrived in Shanghai on February 3. It was sent to Chungking and did not arrive until the middle of March&mdash;Editor.)</p><h2 class="head2">A Letter from Brother Ma Di-seng, Li-Shui</h2><p>There is only a China Inland Mission here in Li-Shui. There are usually between three and four hundred people in the meetings. Brother David Hsu came from Hsuan-Ping on March 4 and was invited by the China Inland Mission to speak in their village meetings for nine days (in three places). On March 18 he left to labor in Wenchow and Ping-Yang. Thank the Lord for His grace. I testified a few times at the China Inland Mission. May the Lord gain something.</p><p>Your brother,<br />Ma Di-seng<br />March 21</p><h2 class="head2">Prayer and Revival, Shanghai</h2><p>In the past three weeks God has done a new work among our sisters and has revived many people. Many prodigal sons have come back to the Father's house! The Lord has gained something, so we must rejoice with Him! Two or three people began to pray in one accord, and then the Lord began to work. Presently, the power of revival grows daily. There are many small group prayer meetings. The Lord has manifested His work time and again in the sisters' meetings. Many sinners have been coming to the Tuesday sisters' meeting. On Wednesday evening eleven sisters and two brothers were baptized. There was a meeting in a hospital in which all the nurses, doctors, and other employees who had life prayed together (more than fifty people). Thank the Lord, it was more than we had asked or thought; many dumb ones opened their mouths. There will be another such meeting next Wednesday afternoon. We are still waiting for God's direction as to how to go on. A group of married sisters wants to meet together to learn how to pray and work with God. There is also a group of sisters that are teachers who have the same desire. It is even more precious to see a group of sisters who are maids clustering together as prayer-companions. The Lord has promised and given revelation to a small number that He will revive His church! May we always humble ourselves and bow down before Him, not interrupting Him in any way.</p><p>There is one other joyful thing to tell you. Miss Chai has been healed. The minute she was healed, she immediately stood up and walked. For seven years she has not been able to read the Bible or bend her knees in prayer. But last night she was able to do both. The Lord is showing us His authority and glory in all matters! There is nothing we can say but hallelujah! Thank the Lord, Sister Tso has made much progress. The Lord is using her in many ways. Thank and praise the Lord! When we pray in one accord, we are able to shake the heavens and the earth and defeat the demons. I received a letter from Brother Simon Meek and the responsible brothers in Manila in the Philippines asking me to work there for a time. I had a burden to do this when I was in Hong Kong. I wanted to return to Shanghai to make arrangements for my mother, who is old, before going. However, the environment constantly prevented me. (I could not get my passport processed.) I placed the matter in the Lord's hands and waited. The most marvelous thing happened when I had the least hope. There was a special opportunity, and I received my passport without going through any red tape. I am ready to go, but I still do not know when I will leave because my present work is not finished. I hope He returns soon!</p><p>Yun-chun<br />March 18<br />[Address omitted]</p><h2 class="head2">A Letter from Brother Stephen Kaung, Hong Kong</h2><p>Dear Sister X in the Lord:</p><p>Peace to you! By the Lord's grace, I safely returned to Hong Kong on the eighteenth of this month. I went with the brothers this time and really gained the benefit. Thank God! I saw more than ten brothers and sisters in Ju Shiu Garden, Jung-Shan, whose freshness and "first love" truly charmed me. However, they have met with persecution and difficulties. Please remember them in prayer. Later, I returned to Macao where I passed out gospel tracts and preached the gospel outdoors. Brother Luan gave a message to the brothers and sisters. May God's kingdom grow in all localities. Brother Nee held a conference here from the twenty-fourth to the twenty-eighth of this month. He spoke on "What Kind of People Can Receive God's Reward?" They are "violent men" (Matt. 11:12), those who walk in the light of the "judgment seat of Christ" (2 Cor. 5:9-11; 1 Cor. 3:10-15; Rev. 1:15). Then he spoke on "The Importance of Light" (Matt. 6:21-23). If God wills, he will continue the conference beginning on March 1. All the co-workers in Hong Kong are well. Miss Huang Ro-chen and Miss Kuo Hai-jen have both come to Hong Kong to attend the conference. If God wills, I plan to return to Shanghai because my father has heart sickness.

I received the second issue of The Open Door a long time ago, and the third issue came a few days ago. I hope this letter gets to you quickly. (I received this letter on March 18&mdash;Editor.) The brothers and sisters living in Chefoo are all at peace in the Lord's grace! Thank the Lord! It is very quiet in the city of Chefoo. Both the work and the meetings continue as usual. The table meeting is now held after the edification meeting on the Lord's Day afternoon. The Bible study will temporarily discontinue. Only a few of the brothers and sisters who left Chefoo for other places went to the surrounding countryside. Those who did are all safe! Brother Chao Bi-chen left Chefoo for a faraway place&mdash;he went to his ancestral home in Ping-Yin County (southwest of Tsinan). I received a letter from him a few days ago saying that he is well, but I do not have any recent news from him. I think that he is under the Lord's care! Please do not worry about anything! During the Chinese New Year, we had a week of special work. The brothers preached the gospel in the mornings and conducted edification meetings in the afternoons. Thank the Lord. Originally, I had intended to go to Wei-Hai on the seventh of this month for a few days because a brother in Wei-Hai had invited me to go. However, it is not appropriate for me to go there because the brother who was responsible for inviting me has gone elsewhere. Brother Ch'ang-en is still zealous for the gospel. Recently, he has been doing some business on the side with two brothers. May the Lord guide him! I am not very clear as to what I will do! Please do not forget to pray for me! May the Lord bless you according Joshua 1:3! Peace in the Lord! Greet Sister Wang and Sister Chang!

The number of sisters in the assembly in Changchow has decreased because some families have dispersed to the inland regions. The assembly in Chuenchow has progressed because the believers there have faith. They are also expanding into the interior. Work was begun in Hwei-An, and an assembly was established. The assemblies in Shui-Tou and An-Hai are standing firm and have not stopped meeting. Thank and praise the Lord! All areas are being preserved safely by the Lord. Although a few of the believers in the assembly in Tung-An have moved to the interior, the meetings have not stopped, and they preach the gospel to the outsiders every week. Sometimes they engage in outdoor preaching, and sometimes they preach in the meeting hall. Brother Wang You-yi went to Pan-Ling, An-Hsi sometime ago to pioneer the work. Now there is an assembly there. Brother Han mainly travels in the region of Shui-Tou, An-Hai, Nan-An, and Chuenchow. He sometimes visits the brothers and sisters in Tung-An, Ding-Mei, Ho-Shan, Changchow, and Amoy. Brother Wang Deng-ming and Brother Chang Tung-yuan passed through An-Hsi and Chuangshan to work for one month. Then Brother Deng-ming returned to Tung-An, and Brother Tung-yuan continued working. Brother Keh Lien-min went to the region of Pu-Tien and Han-Jiang and worked for a time with Brother Chai Tse-chung. Then he returned to Tung-An and worked with Brother Han for awhile. Afterwards, he went to Pan-Ling and Juang-Shan, passing through Changchow on his way back to Tung-An. He ran into Brother Han who was bringing Brother Chen Bing-hsi to Tung-An to pray for Brother Wang Min-sheng's illness, and Brother Deng-ming had just returned to Tung-An, so they invited Brother Bing-hsi to hold a gospel conference in Tung-An for ten days. Apart from preaching the gospel, he did the work of healing sicknesses and casting out demons. Many people were healed by the Lord. Brother Han came this spring and held a message conference for seven days. Thank the Lord, He Himself does His good work!</p><p>Brother Keh will go to Ting-Mei to work, and Brother Han will go to the interior region of An-Hsi to work. Brother Chen Ke-san will leave Changchow and go to work in Lung-Yen. Brother Wang Deng-ming will soon go to Kulangsu to print gospel tracts, and then he will go to Shui-Tou, An-Hai, Shi-Shee, Chuenchow, Pu-Tien, and the region of Hwei-An to work. Brother Chen Bing-hsi is waiting for the Lord's will in Tingmei. The individual travels of the co-workers were started after they had prayed and understood the Lord's will. We hope you will pray much for us. May the Lord be with you. We will now give you the mailing addresses for all the co-workers: [Address omitted] (The church in Wu-Tu has already moved the meeting place to Brother Keh Shui-chuan's home in Wu-Lu County. He is the responsible brother and is Brother Lien-min's elder brother.)</p><p>Your brothers,<br />Wang Deng-ming, Han Jin-hsiu, Keh Lien-min<br />February 16</p><h2 class="head3">Two</h2><p>Greetings to Sister X in Christ:</p><p>I am sure that the loving, merciful Father has given you and all the brothers His rich, unsearchable, marvelous, indescribable grace through the Spirit of Christ. May He abundantly give you even more in the future so that all the glory might be to Him! Amen. After meeting in Han-Jiang for a few days, I moved to another house. God had prepared a comfortable place for me to give hospitality to a few sisters so they could get to know the life of prayer and fellowship. Sister Chen Wan-ching wants to come to western Fukien. May God fulfill her desire according to His best choice. Everything goes on as usual with me. Thank the Father God for His abounding grace. May God quickly accomplish His purpose through the work of faithful workers and the hastening of the saints' prayer. Amen! May the Father's kingdom come! Amen. Peace in the Lord!</p><p>Your little sister in the Lord,<br />Bao Hsu-min<br />February 22</p><h2 class="head3">Three</h2><p>Dear Sister X in the Lord:</p><p>I received your letter. Thank you! I will go to Sien-You County with Sister Wang Yu-ju on the eighteenth of this month. On the twenty-first, the Lord willing, we will begin a sisters' conference that will last a few days. Afterward, Sister Wang will go someplace else, and I will be able to stay there for a time. According to my recent observation and the condition of the need, it seems that only a few days of meetings would short-change the sisters too much. If there were more time, it might give God the opportunity to move His arm in this kind of work. I was in Han-Jiang for more than a month and met with the sisters before God many times. There was much blessing on this work. If possible, I would like to do the same thing in Sien-You. Personally, I have had a particular experience recently: I can work, but I cannot rest. If I stop working, it seems that some weakness or illness will come! When I force myself to go on as usual, even if it seems painful, there is no problem. I personally feel that (1) the days are short, and the Lord's coming is near, so we must hurry to repay our debt every day. When we are finished, we can go. (2) Since life overcomes death, and there is Romans 8:11, we would offend our gracious Lord if we did not try to experience it. (3) Since the past is gone, the future will soon be gone too. I do not know whether or not this is right. Is there any danger? Please pray for this and give me some instructions. Peace and health in the Lord!</p><p>Your sister in the Lord,<br />Bao Hsu-min<br />March 13<br />[Address omitted]</p><h2 class="head3">Four</h2><p>Greetings to Brother X who is greatly cared for by the Lord:</p><p>Since we parted, I have been remembering you in prayer, hoping to receive instructions from you soon. May the Lord be glorified in you and may He manifest His greater power through you. Amen. I went with Brother Chai to the conference in Sien-You, and we were blessed by the Lord. There is already the testimony of a local church in Sien-You with more than fifty brothers and sisters serving the Lord in one accord. They have all grown. I really thank and praise the Lord! Glory to Him forever and ever! Amen. Over the Chinese New Year, the brothers in Han-Jiang rented another hall on Lin Street to preach the gospel. I was there helping them. We were led by the Lord to do this for a month. The Holy Spirit worked among us, and sinners bent their knees and called on the Lord's name daily. Thank and praise the Lord! Glory to Him forever and ever! Amen. Brother Ke-san is in Changchow, and Brother Tse-chung is in Chuenchow. The meeting hall in Fu-Ching has moved out of Luke Hospital and back to its old address (65 Shan-Chiao Street, Fu-Ching). The coastal region of Fukien has been preserved in peace by the Lord. Please do not worry. May the Lord cause me to live a godly, proper life during these times of peace so that I do not make allowance for the lusts of the flesh. Amen. I will tell you the rest later. I hope you help us with your prayer. May the Lord grant you overcoming power (2 Cor. 12:9)!</p><p>Your brother,<br />Jai-seng<br />Twenty-third day of the first month<br />[Address omitted]</p><h2 class="head3">Five</h2><p>Peace in the Lord to my eldest brother, Jai-seng:</p><p>I received your card. I really thank and praise the Lord. When I see His doings, I know that the day of His coming is near. Hallelujah! The day we are hoping for will soon come. I hope we both will be faithful. The region of Han-Jiang has been blessed by the Lord. He has been saving sinners. May all the glory and praise be to our Lord Jesus Christ! All the brothers and sisters in Sien-You are rising up for the gospel. They are more willing to be responsible than they were before. The number of saved ones is still being blessed by the Lord daily. Most of them are elderly ones, rickshaw pullers, or illiterate country folk. There are barely enough seats in our gospel meetings every Lord's Day. From this we see that God is really not a respecter of persons! We have already made new chairs and have used them for two Lord's Days. We can seat one hundred twenty people, but we still have to add a few small chairs. Sien-You still needs a worker to come preach the gospel. Peace to you. Please greet all the brothers and sisters for me.</p><p>Your brother,<br />Kwang-yao<br />February 12<br />[Address omitted]</p><h2 class="head2">A Letter from Brother James Chen, Swatow</h2><p>Greetings:</p><p>I returned to the interior to work on February 2 with a few brothers and sisters. Thank the Lord that He was working with us. The result was that people were saved and edified. We were able to do a little, but if we had not had the Lord's presence, we would not have even been able to do that much! After we finished working in the first place, we were going to continue on according to our planned route, but it was as if we were "forbidden by the Holy Spirit to speak the word in Asia....They tried to go into Bithynia, yet the Spirit of Jesus did not allow them." Therefore, we were forced to return to Swatow. We are waiting for His leading concerning the future. May the Lord enable us to hear the Macedonian call. When the brothers were working in the interior, the political situation here was very tense. Thank the Lord, everything has eased off now. The brothers and sisters are all safe. I am reporting this to comfort you. My health has improved much recently. The Lord's grace is sufficient for us. This promise is a boundless treasure!</p><p>James<br />February 19<br />[Address omitted]</p><h2 class="head2">A Letter from Sister Huang Ro-chen, Chungshan</h2><p>Thank the Lord, on the ninth of this month, Brothers Kaung, Luan, Chen, and Ho (Nai-yee) arrived safely in Ju-Hsiu Garden. They left Chungshan for Macao the day before yesterday. The brothers preached the gospel for a few days and edified the brothers and sisters. Even though it rained steadily for a few days, God's blessing was full. I never imagined that God would care for His children in this way and would grant us such help. By God's grace I was able to secure Mr. Luan's advice this time. He said that we have received enough help from X. I said that every person is different. He exhorted me to lead the newly saved ones into the knowledge of the resurrected Christ in life. This way they could be led by the Holy Spirit, even if they did not have much knowledge. He said that the three most precious words in his life are: (1) God's will is my life; (2) God's glory is my joy; (3) God's arm is my strength. I do not know how much praise and thanks I should render to God for all the grace He has given me.</p><p>Your little sister,<br />Ro-chen<br />February 16</p><h2 class="head2">Letters from Brother Han Fu-sheng, Ch'ang-Teh</h2><h2 class="head3">One</h2><p>Brother Yueh-chiao:</p><p>The work in Ch'ang-Teh has been blessed much by the Lord recently. We see the Lord's own hand helping us in everything. Every evening nine people pray together in one accord. In my work over the years, I have never seen such prayer meetings. The Lord is really among us. We believe the Lord is going to do greater things than this. There are about twenty people in every Lord's Day meeting. Eight or nine break the bread together. We feel that the condition of every meeting is very good. We should really thank the Lord for this. We see that the door in western Hunan has been opened. According to Brother Chang's letter, the believers in Yuan-Jiang have already seen the light of the truth of the church. Yi-Yang also has some of God's faithful children standing firmly for the Lord's truth. I ask the Lord to give me the power and physical strength of an apostle to visit all the larger cities in the province of Hunan in this year. It is true that when man reaches his end, God begins. I really see that I am empty and useless. If God did not put the resurrection power in humble, useless vessels, we could never see His glory. I ask again and again that the brothers and sisters pray for me much. The brothers have formed a partnership to open a teahouse. All the pots and cups have John 4:13-14 on them: "Everyone who drinks of this water shall thirst again, but whoever drinks of the water that I will give him shall by no means thirst forever." We ask God to give us many opportunities to preach the gospel. Please do not forget to pray for the Living Water Teahouse. Peace in the Lord! Greet all the brothers and sisters in Shanghai. Please greet Brother Chang Kwang-rong, Sister Miao, and Sister Tso for me. How have Brother Ho Deh-gen and Brother Lin Dao-tze been? I remember them often.</p><p>Your brother,<br />Han Fu-sheng<br />February 7</p><h2 class="head3">Two</h2><p>Brother Tsi-yi:</p><p>The Living Water Teahouse was opened on March 2. We began to preach the gospel on the fourth. Today is the fourth day of the meetings. Many people come to hear the gospel. It rained last night and snowed in the morning, so the meeting was somewhat affected. Please pray for us much. The business side of the Living Water Teahouse is not bad. More than one hundred people come there to drink tea every day. Sometimes there are more than two hundred. However, we must sell dim sum before we can break even. We have not found anyone to make the dim sum, so for now we are only selling tea.</p><p>Your brother,<br />Fu-sheng<br />[Address omitted]</p><h2 class="head2">A Hope<br />for People to Go to Yaoan County,<br />Yunnan Province</h2><p>Miss Ruth Lee:</p><p>Ten years have flown by since we parted in Nanking. I have been so busy with my business and personal affairs that I have not been able to send you any news. I am very sorry! Yesterday, I received the second issue of The Open Door and received much benefit from reading it. I was also very happy to find how those who walk together with us in the way were doing. It comforted me very much. I was very happy to find that those in the way were willing to come thousands of miles to work for the Lord in Yunnan. The standard of living here is much lower. It only costs two dollars for a person to eat for a month. Even with miscellaneous expenses, a person does not need to spend more than four dollars a month. Even if a couple has three or four children, their monthly expenses would not be more than twenty dollars (two hundred old Yunnan dollars). They would be living very comfortably. If any in the way have the Lord's leading and want to come here to preach the gospel, I would welcome them very much and would be willing to do my best to help them. I have not had the opportunity to write directly to the workers in K'un-ming and in southern Yunnan. I only have their news from The Open Door. In the future please send me a copy of anything you publish. Peace to you in body and spirit!</p><p>The little slave in the Lord,<br />Chiang Shun-ching<br />February 16<br />[Address omitted]</p><p>(When Mr. Chiang was in Nanking, he often came to Mr. Kao Shi-ju's house and prayed with us. I really thank the Lord that I received this letter today! I hope the brothers and sisters who have been called to work in the interior of Yunnan will contact Mr. Chiang directly. It would be a great benefit to have Mr. Chiang as a guide&mdash;Editor.)</p><h2 class="head2">A Letter from Brother Yang Shao-tang, Chu-Wo</h2><p>Brother Pu-yueh:</p><p>I received your card and was greatly comforted! After the Bible study in Lin-Jin, the Holy Spirit stirred up a love for the truth in people. Then I went to the Hong-Dong Missionary School for three days. Although I was only there a short time, the Lord's word gave people a desiring heart. Praise the Lord! I am now preparing to live in Houma. Mr. Ma Bu-ching is also preparing to come. I want to spend a month by myself to pray and study the Bible. May the Lord preserve the quietness of my heart, spirit, and environment. The outward situation is very tense, but praise the Lord for giving us peace. I can still sit calmly to write to the brothers. Missionary Rung and Miss Chui-lan have returned. Presently, Missionary Rung is in Hong-Dong and Miss Chui-lan is in Hou-Ma. Perhaps they will both go to Wen-Hsi to work with Feng-mei, or they might come to live in Chu-Wo. If you have time, please let us know where you are before communication is hindered so that we can pray for you. With regard to the work in Honan, I feel in my heart and spirit a desire for deeper fellowship with the Lord and deeper light. Please pray for me! May the Lord bless you with peace.</p><p>Remembering you,<br />Yang Shao-tang<br />February 26<br />[Address omitted]</p><h2 class="head2">A Letter from Brother Duan Chai-ju, Tien-Shui</h2><p>Dear Brother Yu-chih in the Lord:</p><p>Since coming to the region of Lung-Nan and Tien-Shui in Kansu province, I have been meeting in the churches around here. There are more than ten churches, so I will not be able to go through them all until the end of the year. The Lord is working in every place. Unfortunately, I am a useless servant. I am dry in my spirit and lack love. However, what the Lord has given the brothers and sisters is precious and lovely. Most of the churches belong to the Independent denomination. The brothers are very poor. In some places there are many people, but they do not even have a meeting hall. When it is time for a meeting, they sit in the courtyard outdoors. They do not have chairs, so they put a few boards together to make benches. A few days ago, we were having the table meeting in one place when it suddenly started snowing. Three and four-year-old children and seventy and eighty-year-old grandfathers knelt on the ground together with us to break the bread and eat the Lord's supper in the snow and freezing cold. When I saw this, I could not stop my tears from rolling. May the Lord enlarge my heart to suffer for Him, and may I be more willing to travel for Him in poor regions, accommodate humble people, and remember the poor! How precious these ones are! Peace in the Lord! Please greet the brothers and sisters in the Lord for me.</p><p>Your spiritual brother,<br />Chai-ju<br />Twenty-second day after the Chinese New Year<br />[Address omitted]</p><h2 class="head2">Recent Work in Ch'eng-tu</h2><h2 class="head3">One</h2><p>Thank God for His grace. He brought us safely to Ch'eng-tu through the brothers' and sisters' prayers. I was on a bus for two days. Humanly speaking, I should have been dizzy with a backache, but God gave us exceptional peace. It was more than we could understand. After two days on the road, it was as if I did not feel anything. I was not tired, and my back did not hurt. I feel more and more that I am unworthy because God's grace treats me so well. The more I see my own corruption, the more I feel the greatness of God's grace! Indeed, when the prodigal son returned, he did not do anything but enjoy grace. I saw Brother Chao, Mrs. Chao, Mrs. Shen, and the rest. We were all rejoicing. I really hope to be edified and helped by the brothers and sisters here in Ch'eng-tu.</p><p>Yu-chih<br />March 4</p><h2 class="head3">Two</h2><p>We arrived in Ch'eng-tu yesterday at 3:20 p.m. Even though the seats on the bus had no backs, the Lord's grace was sufficient. He constantly graces people like us. He really is a marvelous Lord! Today Brother Chao Rue-tze said that not long after he came to Ch'eng-tu, he thought of preaching the gospel in a teahouse because the teahouses here can seat one to two hundred people. I mentioned that X was preparing to print a general gospel tract in Chungking. We hope it can come out soon. Brother Wang Yung-gui, who is studying medicine at Chi-Loo University, once passed out gospel tracts at many teahouses. Brother Tseng has also preached the gospel in those places when he was in the countryside. I have also heard that there are Westerners working among the natives in Sung-Pan (not far from Ch'eng-tu, where some tribesmen live), and they have learned to speak their language. Praise and thank the Lord! Although I cannot do anything, the very news of the Lord's work fills me with joy and praise! Mrs. Shen mentioned that there is a group of professors' wives at West China University, who have a meeting every Tuesday. They have invited me to go next Tuesday to give a testimony to them. May we decrease and the Lord increase!</p><p>Peace Wang<br />March 4</p><h2 class="head3">Three</h2><p>Thank the Lord, He has opened the door for the work. Both the Dong-Gwan Gospel Hall and the China Inland Mission have invited Brother Yu-zhi to preach. Hwa-Ying Girls' Secondary School, Jen Chi Women's Hospital, and the Baptist Women's Missionary School have given me time to go preach the gospel. I had three meetings with the sisters after I came here and studied a little with them about knowing the ways of God. The meetings have manifested God's presence and blessing. Next week I will begin to have a women's gospel meeting in senior Mrs. Duan's (of West China University) daughter's house (her last name is Tsou). Most of the people will be female students from West China University plus some of the professors' wives.</p><p>Peace<br />March 10</p><h2 class="head3">Four</h2><p>The gospel meetings in the Tsou home ended on the evening of the eighteenth. The audience was very good, but I do not know how they received it inwardly. Tonight we will begin some meetings in Mrs. Shen's house in order to read something such as Bible Studies for Beginners with the new believers. We will probably finish on the twenty-sixth. The China Inland Mission has asked me to testify next week. I have heard that their Western pastor, X, is a good brother. Brother Yu-zhi went and preached there once. Many of their sisters come here to hear the messages. Sister Liao En-rong, Pi Yung-chin, and Liu Shu-chin are all in Ch'eng-tu. They came last night to the table meeting. Several parochial girls' high schools and the Hsieh-Ho Women's Teachers' School have all given me some time to preach. Today I am going to Hwa-Mei Girls' School (under the Methodist Church). I have been to the Hwa-Ying Girls' School (under the Episcopalian Church) five times. Thank the Lord for opening the door! May what comes out of my mouth not cause His gospel to suffer! I need new grace and strength! I need His overshadowing as well as His restriction! I need Him to constantly save me from myself in the work!</p><p>Peace<br />March 21</p><h2 class="head3">Five</h2><p>If I delay going to Kuei-yang, perhaps I should still go to Tsi-Liu-Jing and stay for awhile. I will have to delay going to Ji-Jung and Nei-Jiang. Brother Yu-zhi will preach the gospel at Hsia-Dong-Da Street in Ch'eng-tu every evening at seven o'clock from March 30 to April 2. This week we must also go to the First Prison in Szechuan to preach the gospel to the men and women convicts. The Methodist Church has invited me to testify on April 3. May the Lord give grace.</p><p>Peace<br />March 28</p><h2 class="head2">A Letter from Sister Huang Yu-mei,<br />Cebu, Malaysia</h2><p>Sister X in the Lord:</p><p>Your letter arrived in twenty-four days. One can come here by boat directly from Hong Kong, Amoy, Swatow, Canton, or anywhere in the coastal region. If you take a ship from Hong Kong, the fast ones only take four days and nights to get to Singapore. The slow ones take a day longer. From Singapore to Cebu takes another three days and nights by boat. At the end of the year, the trip from Singapore to Cebu can be very stormy. I know that it is the Lord's will that I should give up teaching and serve God full-time. The people here all desire salvation. Although many are called X, they unfortunately do not know the slightest thing about salvation. There are two church districts here, Cebu and Shi-Li Street, with a total of forty-eight chapels. One chapel covers a great area. Sometimes one must walk half an hour between houses. Most people take the steamboat to go to church, but they still must walk a great distance. The mountain roads are difficult to travel. When it rains, one almost always has to take off his shoes before he can negotiate the mountain roads. If it were not for the Lord, no one would want to travel through them. Thank the Lord, I have already been to eleven places. If the Lord is willing, I plan to visit them all. My elder sister likes to come with me, but she does not have anyone at home to take care of things for her. She plans to hire someone to keep house for her. There is a new sister from Shing-Hwa who also feels the Lord's leading to go with us. We started last week with our luggage, but I was sick, and it seemed that we should not go. My sister was caught up with some things and had to go back. We plan to go to Hsia-Po this time. There is a sister there from Foochow. Her last name is Lin. If the Lord is willing, we will go to her house. She is a friend of my brother-in-law. I have heard that Sister Ding has come south. There are already five or six brothers and sisters who have come from China. I believe that the Lord has already opened the door here, but there cannot be any meeting other than gospel meetings. Please help us with your prayer for all these matters. Sister Fang Chiung-ying wants to come. Unfortunately, she cannot get a visa. I do not have a copy of the first issue of The Open Door. May the Lord give grace to you and to all the brothers and sisters who are working for Him in the coastal regions, the central region, and the western regions. I believe the feeling is true everywhere that the harvest is great and the workers few. May the Lord send people out! We must pray that the Lord will give me a co-worker who can speak the Foochow and Malayan dialect and can teach the people to sing hymns. Peace in the Lord. Greet Sister Wang and Sister Chang for me.</p><p>Your sister,<br />Yu-mei<br />January 7<br />[Address omitted]</p><h2 class="head2">All Things in God's Hands, Hankow</h2><h2 class="head3">One</h2><p>When I took the manuscripts for the fifth issue to the Spiritual Book Publisher to be typeset and printed, the first thing they told me was that there was a lack of paper, and the price had risen dramatically. At that time a roll cost twenty-three dollars, and people were still buying it frantically. I was troubled about the problem, but I also thought that the Lord would be responsible for His own work, so I decided not to buy the paper in advance. I just prayed earnestly and waited until the manuscripts were typeset and the paper was needed. Praise the Lord! The typesetting was finished today, and fifty rolls of paper had been sent to Hankow, so the price had fallen. It is now fourteen dollars a roll. Ordinary businessmen might think that this is very common in the marketplace, but we cannot help but praise the Lord because it is His doing! God led us through a special conference during the past week. This week there is a sisters' conference which is also of God's grace.</p><p>Lan Tsi-yi<br />March 16</p><h2 class="head3">Two</h2><p>God is now leading me to watch His working day by day. He is the Lord of works. I am resting in everything. I only need to stand aside to watch His glory and works.</p><p>Lan Tsi-yi<br />March 24</p><h2 class="head3">Three</h2><h2 class="head4">God's Attraction</h2><p>Thank and praise the blessed God! His faithfulness, love, and mercy enable me to live joyously during these days. Indeed, He is the only precious One. The Giver is much greater than all the gifts. His forgiveness is more abundant than our experience of holiness. He Himself is superior to His grace and love. It is very good for us to enjoy His grace and love, but it is so much better to personally enjoy Him. I want to completely and absolutely enjoy Him. The reality of my present condition is actually the opposite of what you expected because I have not progressed. On the contrary, I fail daily. What He gives me is like a spring breeze, but my experience is like the fallen leaves and dry, dead branches of the middle of winter! I do not know whether this is a suffering or a joy. You must know it. Are there not many old things in me? Therefore, the wise God continues to trim me. If I look back on my experience, I will be dragged into a den of tears! Thankfully, He attracts me with nothing but Himself and upholds me.</p><h2 class="head4">Our Attitude toward Those with Different Light</h2><p>We cannot say that we will never be wrong. We should also be careful for the sake of others. My past experience and today's light show me that my errors have been more than my obedience. I am afraid that our living unwittingly becomes a stumbling block to others! I really have nothing that is better than others. I do not submit more than others. Everything that I have comes from bathing in grace. There are still many areas where I need the Lord's forgiveness, mercy, grace, enlightenment, instruction, and perfecting. For this reason, I need the cross and the deeper work of the Holy Spirit in my attitude toward others. Only when I have new light will my experience become more real. Then I will be acceptable before the Lord. The flesh is hasty and lacks love! I need to wait and pray. The Lord needs to give us a proper attitude to receive others' opinions. I am afraid that it is easier for those who have received the light of the truth to fall into coldness and unkindness. I was this way before, so I hope you will be careful in this matter! The Lord gave a good testimony concerning the truth before Pilate. No one could find any fault in Him&mdash;hardness or impoliteness&mdash;with which to condemn Him. May we live Him out.</p><p>(The preceding two portions are excerpts from a letter written by a certain sister to a sister in K'un-ming&mdash;Editor.)</p><h2 class="head1">AN ANNOUNCEMENT BY BROTHER WATCHMAN NEE</h2><p>Four years ago, I publicly answered a letter from Brother Wang Kai-sen about a group of brothers being called the "Open Brethren" and whether or not they were a denomination. Not long ago when I was in Southeast Asia, a brother (an Englishman) in Tai-Ping wanted to prove that these brothers were not a denomination. After listening to him, I still believe that much of what I wrote before is correct. There is one point that he mentioned, however, that certainly is true. He pointed out that the phrase Christian Missions in Many Lands does not represent a mission board, because "missions" is plural. Furthermore, the word "in" is used instead of the word "of." Although I have seen people who consider this group an organization and abbreviate it as C.M.M.L., I believe my brother's word. Therefore, I am making a statement concerning this matter so that all the brothers will know the truth. We know that the churches in the Bible are local, so we cannot say and we have no need to say who is and who is not a denomination. All we have to ask is whether a church is a church in the locality. We cannot say whether the Brethren in a certain place are a denomination or not. We should determine this by the condition in that locality. May God give us grace, and I ask the brothers to forgive my inaccuracy. (Please read The Normal Christian Church Life when it is published.)</p><p>Watchman Nee<br />March 5, 1938<br />in Hong Kong</p><h2 class="head1">INTRODUCING THE NORMAL CHRISTIAN CHURCH LIFE</h2><p>Praise and thank God that although the ages pass away and environments change, His works are eternal. The truth He ordains cannot be worn away by time. The gifts He has given in Christ are new in every age. Therefore, in every age He raises up witnesses who are according to His heart to testify of His Son Jesus Christ. We must thank and praise God for this!</p><p>Many witnesses and specific testimonies are needed in all the churches today, but the most urgent testimony is a scripturally-based ascertaining of God's work, the church's organization, the principles of the apostles' work, and the establishment of the local churches. The main goal of this book is to meet this need and to resolve many difficult questions concerning the various aspects of the local churches.</p><p>The title of the book is Rethinking Our Work (The Normal Christian Church Life); it was written by Brother Watchman Nee. Its value is priceless, and its nature is special. It is based purely on the special revelation of God and the special light of the Holy Spirit. In my opinion this book can be called a constitution among the churches of God today. It is the outline of the organization of the local churches and a bright light to the apostles who go out for their work. It is a guiding star for Christian unity. My crude phrases cannot give a good introduction to the highlights of the book. I only hope that the readers will read it from cover to cover several times to obtain all the truth and blessings in this book.</p><p>There are ten chapters in this book. Every section of every chapter is based on scriptural facts and proofs. It explains the New Testament work during the apostolic age and the principles for establishing churches. It also provides detailed answers to many important questions about the work and the church. The nature of this book is particular, and its messages are important. We who serve the Lord full-time must read it. The elders who bear responsibility in each locality must also read it. Even more all the children of the Father should have a copy, and they should read and consider it again and again.</p><p>May all the brothers who read this book gain the light of the Holy Spirit, and may they realize that God's goal is not just for Christ to be the individual Christ but the corporate Christ. The center of all of God's work is Christ. He is the Lord of all, and He is worthy to be praised eternally. The readers should also know that God is still the rewarder of those who seek Him with all their heart. For this reason, I hope that all the brothers would not only receive the light of the truth but also become channels of life in the church today to the glory of God the Father until the Lord Christ returns. This is my earnest hope. Amen.</p><p>Philip Luan,<br />January 8, 1938, Hong Kong</p><h2 class="head5">The Table of Contents of this book is as follows:</h2><p>Chapter 1 The Ministry and the Ministers<br />Chapter 2 The Apostles<br />Chapter 3 The Setting Apart and Movements of the Apostles<br />Chapter 4 The Elders Appointed by the Apostles<br />Chapter 5 The Churches Founded by the Apostles<br />Chapter 6 The Basis of Oneness and Division<br />Chapter 7 The Work and the Churches<br />Chapter 8 Among the Workers<br />Chapter 9 The Question of Money<br />Chapter 10 The Organization of Local Churches</p><h2 class="head1">NEWS OF THE CHURCHES</h2><h2 class="head2">Ji-An, Kiangsi Province</h2><p>Greetings to the brothers and sisters in the Lord:</p><p>The brothers and sisters from the assembly in Hangchow have mostly scattered into all regions. Brother Si Meng-yu, Brother Chang Ming-jing, and I have moved from Li-Shui, Chekiang to Ji-An, Kiangsi. There are seven or eight brothers with the sisters in their families, so we can still meet and have the table. Brother Ma Ti-sheng and Brother Chen Yi-liang are in Li-Shui. Brother Ruan Chi-yu and Brother Lee Kwei-sien are in Hangchow. The region of Chou-Jia-Pu was burned to the ground. The brothers and sisters there need our petitions. Please send us a letter telling us about the brothers who are living in Nan-ch'ang and Ch'ang-sha. (Brother Yu Nan-geng is in Nan-ch'ang; see Issue No. 5 of this publication.

Just a small number remained in the city. On November 9 and 11 of last year, it seemed as if there was a continuous air raid alarm from morning to night. Thank the Lord, the bombs did not come near us. The brothers and sisters who were in the city took a boat and left for another place on the fifteenth of November. In our group there were Brother Jin Fang-lien and his family, Brother Chin Yao-ching and his family, Brother Lu Tze-shing and his family, and Sister Wei Siang-yun, for a total of about thirty people. We were divided into two boats that were going to Wusih together. We met with great danger along the way. Brother Jin's boat was destroyed by a bomb, but thank the Lord, the lives of his whole family were preserved. After this we separated. Brother Jin and the others traveled for fifty days and arrived safely in Shanghai on January 10. We continued ahead and have been living in the countryside around Wusih for three months. Thank the Lord for His grace. Brother Chin Yao-ching and his entire family have now returned to Soochow. Brother Lu Tze-shing and Sister Wei Siang-yun arrived safely in Shanghai on February 18. As I look back on the past months, I have to thank the Lord for His great grace in enabling us to safely pass through all kinds of hardships and dangers on the road, both in our environment and in our living. We only have news from the brothers and sisters who left before November 11. After November 11, with the exception of Mrs. Chui and Mrs. Chai, whose families had safely arrived in Shanghai, we have not heard anything from the rest. We heard that Brother Shen Guan-min and his family are in Lan-Si, Chekiang, and that they met up with bandits. (This is Brother Lu Tze-shing's oral testimony after arriving in Shanghai. We thank God for it, but we also hope to hear news from the rest of the brothers and sisters&mdash;Editor.)</p><h2 class="head2">News of the Brothers and Sisters<br />in Several Places</h2><h2 class="head3">One</h2><p>"Sister Wu Jen-han's mailing address is [omitted].

A sister has taken her to the Red Cross Nursing School to get a job washing clothes and taking inventory. The rest are living in the meeting hall temporarily. Sister Jin Bao-jieh has arrived in Shanghai. Brother Chang Hwei-zhi left Shanghai on March 23 and arrived in Hankow by way of Hong Kong and Canton.

His wife had a nineteen-day-old baby at the time, and they had to flee into the mountains on very steep roads. It was a great suffering to them, but the Lord's grace cared for them in every aspect. Although they have nothing, neither do they lack anything. The entire family arrived in Shao-Shing in the middle of February, and they are now living in Dan-Ju-Wu.

There are daily prayer meetings in the river regions in the brothers' homes. The numbers in the meetings are growing. The work of the Holy Spirit continues to revive us.

The Lord is our only support.</p><p>There are six local churches in Nan-Sha: Wan-An-Chiao, Si-Shing, Ji-Shan-Chiao, Jia-Zao, Tou-Peng, and Hsin-Wan-Di. Altogether there are more than one thousand people in the meetings. More than four hundred partake of the table.</p><p>Although there was bombing in Hsiao-Shan, God preserved His own children from harm. Yen Bai-yin's father-in-law was able to bring out two Gentile children, even though he is more than seventy years old. One sister had five buildings in town which were left standing. We praise Him! The God of Abraham is our God! He is our God today! He is the God who is coming soon! We must sing hallelujah. We will sing hallelujah forever. Amen.

Please send it with their names on it. There are more than twenty churches in our county. The largest locality has between eighty and ninety people, and the smallest only two or three. The rest have around twenty or thirty. They are very cold spiritually.

May the Lord also come in glory to rapture those of us who are waiting for Him. May the Lord give us grace and strengthen us to glorify the Father during our sojourn here on earth. Please greet Brother Yu-zhi and Brother Stephen, whom I met in Shanghai. Please greet all the brothers and sisters. We are all members together of Christ, even though we have never met. Please greet senior Mrs. Nee. I keep the words that she spoke to me in the Shanghai Gospel Book Room in my heart. Where is Mr. Shan Kai-fen? (Please read the news in this issue to find out&mdash;Editor.)

Some of the brothers and sisters have already moved from the countryside back to the city. The meetings in the city continue as usual. I moved back to the city from the countryside yesterday.

Sisters Jiao Wei-jen and Chang Jing-shan are still living in Hwai-Yuen. The people in the church there are all safe. I believe you are praying for us just as we are praying for you.

I hope that by the presence of the Lord's grace, your body and spirit have been blessed with peace. I received the Local Newsletter and The Open Door. Through them I learned about the travels of the brothers and sisters and the news of the work in all the localities. Thank you. May the Lord bless this publication work which enables those in Christ to have fellowship and to love one another in a practical way. Through such a publication, there can be the mutual exhortation, comforting, and care, as well as the promotion of the gospel in one accord to the glory of the Lord's name, amen! After leaving Shanghai on January 14, I arrived in Fukien on the sixteenth. I stayed in Foochow for one week and returned to Han-Jiang on the twenty-fourth. I was cared for by the Lord's grace and arrived home safely. I am writing so you will know and not worry. I am now at home without a job. Please pray much for my future.

May the Lord cultivate me so that my suffering life will grow. I want to be faithful in this way and follow Him to the end! Where is Brother Tang Shou-ling? (Please read the fifth issue of this publication for the news from Brother Tang&mdash;Editor.)</p><p>Your little sister in the Lord,<br />Chou Gi-chen<br />March 1<br />[Address omitted]</p><h2 class="head2">Yi-Yang, Hunan Province</h2><p>Dear X in the Lord:</p><p>I received and read The Open Door and learned about the hardships of the brothers and sisters in each locality and how God preserved them. The Lord is worthy to be praised, amen! I deeply believe that God's children will know His love, faithfulness, and power better because of what they have suffered. I also believe that God wants His children to serve Him better and to preach the gospel of grace in every place. At the end of last November, God gave me a word when I left Tsen-Jiang: "Thanks be to God for His indescribable gift!" (2 Cor. 9:15). God led me and my family according to His promise safely out of Tsen-Jiang through Jiu-Jiang and Hankow to Yuan-Jiang. In Yuan-Jiang, I found out that Mr. Chen Kai-yuan (formerly of Shanghai University) was the principal of the Yi-Yang Lutheran High School (a distance of ninety miles from Yuan-Jiang). I made a special visit to him and asked him to find me a job. The next day I received a word from God, saying, "Jehovah will complete that which concerns me" (Psa. 138:8). A few days later I received an answering letter from him inviting me to teach two classes of English in the junior high section. (I am now concurrently teaching another class in a girls' secondary school.) I came to Yi-Yang on February 17 of this year. Thank God for giving me an opportunity to testify in the school. Many of the teachers and students in this school desire the truth and like to listen to the Word. There are already several sisters in Yi-Yang (Mrs. Chiu and the rest) who were under the care of Brother Yu Cheng-hwa. They have prayed earnestly before God for the work in Yi-Yang and have asked Him to send workers. When they got the news that I had come to Yi-Yang, their hearts were filled with praise to the Lord because they thought He had heard their prayers. However, I really feel weak. I am not worthy to be His worker, so please do not forget me in your prayers. Pray that I would be a holy vessel, able to glorify His holy name, amen. There are more than ten brothers and sisters here. There is a prayer meeting every Lord's Day afternoon. After that meeting we study the Bible. We use Bible Studies for Beginners as our text. I hope that through the grace of God, I will lead sinners to the Lord, edify the brothers and sisters, and grow in life myself, despite my weakness. Every Saturday afternoon we take turns preaching the gospel in the brothers' and sisters' homes. The number of those who desire the Word is gradually increasing. Praise the Lord! May God continue to bless His work and cause all the work to be according to His heart's desire. Please do pray for us. The address of our meetings is 5 O-Yang-Chih, Er-Pao, Yi-Yang. Peace in the Lord! Please greet all the co-workers.</p><p>Your little brother in the Lord,<br />Zhang Gung-jih<br />March 13<br />[Address omitted]</p><h2 class="head2">Chungking, Szechuan</h2><p>Greetings to all my dear brothers and sisters in the Lord:</p><p>May you have peace! May we through grace run the race that is set before us in Christ. May the Lord grant us the grace to follow Him faithfully without flinching. The meetings here continue as usual. There was a ten-day conference beginning on March 7. Although this conference suffered the attacks of the powers of darkness, it still went on peacefully, thank the Lord. The Lord prepared everything for us, and He satisfied and comforted those who looked to Him. He also made us realize what poor failures we ourselves are. May the Lord deal with us more deeply so that His church may be revived. A nightly Bible study began on March 28. Sister Ruth Lee is still responsible for it. We are studying Genesis 25. We hope that through the earnest petitions of many brothers and sisters, Satan's frustrations will be foiled, and we will all have a receptive and submissive heart that seeks for something more than knowledge.</p><p>We really feel the importance and necessity of prayer. May we all pray earnestly for one another so that we would stand firm in this raging storm and glorify the Lord's name. Sister Lee and Sister Chang and the other brothers and sisters are all well. Brother Chang Yu-zhi and Sister Peace Wang are working very well in Ch'eng-tu. If the Lord allows, they will return to Chungking next month. Sisters Lee and Chang have said that they will go to Ch'eng-tu next month. Sister Han Feng-yi arrived in Chungking from Hankow on the sixth of this month. She left by bus on the fifteenth for the Kuei-yang Medical School to continue her studies. We have already received a letter from her saying that she arrived safely in Kuei-yang. Sister Wei Cheung-sien also came to Chungking and left for Kuei-yang on March 28. We hope you will pray for her. Brother Yuan How-tsai came to Chungking from Hankow on the twenty-fourth because his sister died. He returned to Hankow on April 1 with his elderly mother. Brother Liu Yi-peng went to Ch'eng-tu on business and will return to Chungking shortly. Finally, please do not forget to pray for the assembly here. May we testify for the Lord and glorify His name. May the Lord be with you forever and ever!</p><p>Your weak members in the Lord,<br />Lee Yun-sien, Liu Kwo-hwa<br />March 27<br />[Address omitted]</p><h2 class="head2">Sui-Yuan Province</h2><p>The churches here have been deeply blessed by God. His work is proceeding on as usual. The brothers and sisters have all been protected by God. Thank the Lord, I was sent out by the Lord to Bao-Tou. If God opens the way, I am willing to come see you shortly. May the Father bless His own work. We petition, pray, thank, praise, and give glory to our Lord and Father for each other. Greetings to all the brothers and sisters in the Lord.</p><p>Lee Jin-biao<br />February 8<br />[Address omitted]</p><h2 class="head2">Sian, Shensi Province</h2><p>Greetings to my brother in the Lord, Mr. X:</p><p>Thank God. By reading The Open Door, we can learn the news about the brothers and sisters in every place and about the apostles, and we also see God's marvelous leading of His children and His multifaceted care through miracles of love. Hallelujah! There is a group of brothers and sisters in Sian that have the same burden concerning the need for a meeting. There were some difficulties at first in finding a place, but God worked them all out for us. There was a meeting of the brothers and sisters last Lord's Day (February 20) at 4 Chao- Jia Lane, Dong-Kwan&mdash;that is Sister Lee Kwei-rong's home. More than ten people attended. Most have come here because of the war. We will begin to have the table to remember the Lord this next Lord's Day. We do not have a gospel meeting yet. May the Lord give us grace for everything. May the Lord's name be glorified. Please pray for us. Peace in the Lord!</p><p>Your sister in the Lord,<br />Yuan Hai-lian<br />February 22<br />[Address omitted]</p><h2 class="head2">Fen-Jou, Shansi Province</h2><p>Greetings to X:</p><p>Although we have never met, we are born of one Spirit in the Lord. I have been saved for six years, but spiritually I am just a six-year-old child and am still quite ignorant of the Lord's purpose. Every time I pray, I believe that God is protecting Brother Hsu Jung-jieh, Brother Tang Shou-ling, and Brother Chao Rue-tze and his wife. However, I still worry about them. While I was worrying and hoping, I suddenly received a copy of The Open Door. When I read it, I found that the first news was of Brother Hsu and then of Brothers Tang and Chao. I also learned about the situation of the other brothers and sisters in the work. I must joyfully give thanks and praise to the Lord, and I must thank you. However, I cannot stop worrying about Brother Tang. May the Lord protect and lead him, amen. Perhaps I will go to Ch'eng-tu, Chinghai, or Tibet. I will see how the Lord leads. Please pray much for me so that I would follow you to glorify His name. Please pray for my family also (my mother, my wife, Ling-wei, and my children, Ching-sin, Yueh-ling, Jieh-sin, and Hsu-sin) because they are all still in the war zone (Fen-Cheng, Shansi). May God protect them. I will tell you the rest later. I greet you with peace.

In my heart, I do not want to live in Hong Kong. But since the Lord has loved me so much, in these last days, I should love Him and take up my own cross to preach the gospel. I do not understand Cantonese or English, so I would not be able to testify for Him. I would be willing to go to Hunan or Szechuan for the following reasons. First, I would have the opportunity to do some holy work. Second, both male and female students can study in schools set up by the Lord. Third, I can follow the example of the apostle Paul's work. If the Lord prepares a brother in the Lord as a partner with me in business, we could set up a milk processing plant or some other business. If the Lord does not allow me to do business, I am also willing to preach the gospel for a living. I believe that God is trustworthy. Property and money cannot be relied on in this evil world. I have given everything to Christ and will follow His leading. My father sent a letter from Ning-Po asking me to return to manage the family business and property. According to the flesh, I would be well off in clothing, food, and lodging, but I really do not want to enjoy the pleasures of sin in Egypt. I would rather lead a life of suffering in the wilderness together with the Lord. I hope that you will pray for me. Wherever the Lord allows me to go, I would ask you to please send me a letter with clear directions. There has been no communication for the past two months in eastern Shantung, so I do not know anything. It takes twenty days for a letter to get here from Chefoo. May the Lord's grace be with your wife and children, amen.</p><p>Your little brother in the Lord,<br />Tsou Shing-Wu<br />February 27<br />[Address omitted]</p><p>(Brother Tsou: Where do you want to go in Hunan or Szechuan?

The Lord heard our prayers in the past. I believe that the Lord will also continue to grace me unceasingly. I received a letter from Sister Cheng last month and learned about the condition of the assembly in Shanghai. It is too bad that the mail service is so inconvenient; it has prevented me from receiving more of the Local Newsletters. How discouraging it is to be kept away from the knowledge of the brothers' and sisters' situations! I hope that the Lord will give me another chance to enjoy meeting with you before the Lord. I feel really dry and long for the sisters' meetings. Praise the Lord. His presence is with me. Have Mr. and Mrs. Luan already arrived in Chungking? Are Mr. and Mrs. Yuan doing well?

It helped me spiritually and also gave me much urgently needed news. Thank the Lord! In this time of war, there is more of a need for putting out this kind of publication. Through it God's children can communicate with each other, instead of worrying about one another. Brother Yu told me something about the situation of the brothers and sisters in Tsinan, but I did not know where they had gone and wanted to find out something about them by any means. Thank the Lord. This publication completely dispelled the worry from my heart. I know that they are all safe. My sister, Ms. Wen You-sin, and I have not left Tai-An yet. We are all safe because we work for the Methodist Church. We are believers, and we obey the authorities; therefore, we do not worry; rather, we have peace in our heart to rely on the Lord and remain here. All the denominations have set up refugee centers for women and children. They have met the need of many believers and refugees. I am very busy working for a women and children's center. Please do not worry about me. I greet you with peace in the Lord! I have not had any news about Brother Shao Teh-sen of Canton and Mr. and Mrs. Pan Hwei-sheng of Nanking. Please print something about them in The Open Door. Sister Liu Shu-yuan is safe in Gao-Mi. She is recovering from her illness. Where are Brother Lee Tze-jung and Brother Witness Lee of Chefoo?

It costs about five dollars for a sack of flour, but God has not allowed us to lack physically. We do feel very dry spiritually, however. This is because there are too few meetings. It is not convenient to meet at night, and we must work during the day. Our gospel meeting on the Lord's Day is not so good because we dare not open the gate and invite many people to come listen. We have the table meeting in the afternoon to remember the Lord. Everyone is very discouraged because the work is not prospering. When we were in this kind of situation in the past, we could get the help from workers or brothers and sisters from outside, but now all fellowship with the outside has stopped except through letters and prayers. Please pray much for us and the Lord's work. Perhaps God wants us to learn a lesson during this time that we have not had the opportunity to learn before. May the Lord lead us with the Holy Spirit and grant us a view of His will.</p><p>We see so many living dead people here. Almost everyone is dead. Then we think of the Lord's marvelous grace and His death and resurrection for men. The two things are such a contrast. We are compelled to inquire of the Lord concerning the way to begin the gospel work here. Should we be bold or should we go slowly? Should we do it little by little in the meetings or shout it out loudly outside? May the Lord give us a heart of wisdom and power. Please pray for this matter. Even the brothers and sisters feel dry because there is no one to rise up to teach and shepherd. We can only rise up ourselves and strive along with God (there are not many who will strive). Perhaps this is a blessing. (If you strive with God, this striving will certainly produce positive results. If a few are willing to strive before God and continue to pray, revival will be waiting at the corner&mdash;Editor.) I see so many who are dry; some have even fallen. (Water from a waterbag is exhausted quickly. But if God opens our eyes, we will see the springs. Gen. 21:15-19; Judg. 15:18-19&mdash;Editor.) We can only ask God to care for those whom He has redeemed with His life. Please pray for us. We have had news from Tsingtao, Peking, and Tientsin but have heard nothing from the brothers and sisters in Tsou County. Do you have any news of Brother Liu Tien-min, Brother Chen Buo-heng, and Brother Sun Shi-bih? (We have not received any news from them for several months. We hope someone who knows about them will tell us&mdash;Editor.) O Lord, may You come quickly! Peace to you in the Lord. Greet all the brothers and sisters.</p><p>Your brothers representing the church in Tsinan,<br />Chen Shi-chen, Ren Yi-cheng, Yu Jia-chi</p><h2 class="head2">Kuang-Rao and Tsingtao</h2><p>I received a letter from Brother Sung Jing-sheng of Kuang- Rao. He said, "It is very peaceful here now. The brothers and sisters are all safe. There are still some who fled to the countryside who have not returned, but all are safe. Mr. Nieh of Mao-Wang Village (Brother Dao-hung) and the brothers and sisters there are all well. That village was not bothered one bit. We really thank the Lord!" Brother Lee Sheh-sin (Lee Tze-jung) and his whole family are in Tsingtao. They are not far from the meeting hall and are safe. Brother Chang Tze-jieh often goes to elderly Brother Wang's house to visit him. Sister Wang's two brothers are also in Tsingtao.</p><p>Nai Tsing-sin<br />March 1<br />[Address omitted]</p><h2 class="head2">Chefoo, Shantung Province</h2><h2 class="head3">One</h2><p>Peace in the Lord to X:</p><p>I received your letter of February 26. With regard to your inquiry as to whether The Dynamics of Service could be published in The Open Door instead, of course, there is no problem. With regard to your request that I write a little, I dare not promise you anything. I can only say that if the Lord gives me a burden, I will not refuse. Have Sister Wang and Brother Yu-zhi gone to Ch'eng-tu? May the Lord bless you all and your work in the outlying regions! We are all safe by the Lord's grace. Thank the Lord. The brothers and sisters are all well. They have been affected slightly in their jobs, but they can still get by. Thank the Lord. Peace in the Lord!</p><p>Your brother,<br />Witness Lee<br />March 15<br />[Address omitted]</p><h2 class="head3">Two</h2><p>With regard to the sisters in Chefoo, Sister Jin-gui often accompanies me. On Saturdays, Mrs. Hsu Kuang-yueh comes with us to the Sin-Sheng Factory. Mrs. Luan meets there and teaches the sisters to read some easy lessons (they have just learned to read). In addition to the Sin-Sheng Factory, Sin- Feng also wants us to come visit those who have believed or want to believe. Teh-Tai and Hung-Yuan also want us to go. All of these places are asking us to go once a week, and we have been to all of them already. The families are also much more strengthened. There are more seeking ones now than before.</p><p>Hsiu-fen<br />[Address omitted]</p><h2 class="head3">Three</h2><p>Thank the Lord, our brothers and sisters have been preserved by the Lord in safety. The meetings and the work have not been hindered. The Lord really heard our prayers. After Brother Witness returned to Chefoo from Hankow, there were three weeks of Bible studies. Thank the Lord, we really saw the Lord's blessing and presence. Many of the brothers and sisters in Chefoo were edified. On the Chinese New Year, we had a special edification conference for the believers. It lasted for a week. We saw the Lord's presence in this conference. The attendance in every meeting exceeded three hundred. The condition of the assembly in Chefoo has been very good recently. May the Lord lead us to live in His light.</p><p>Chao Jing-hwai<br />February 7<br />[Address omitted]</p><h2 class="head2">Mi-Yang, Honan</h2><p>Peace to my dear brother in the Lord!</p><p>The church in our locality plans to hold a revival conference from April 27 to May 1. The brothers and sisters in the church also have been led by the Lord in one accord to write a letter to you. We hope that Mr. Watchman Nee or Mr. Witness Lee would be willing to suffer the hardship and be sent by the Lord to Mi-Yang to help us. If they are unable to come, we would like any other spiritual servant or handmaid who is much used by the Lord to come. (But we do not know their names.) This letter will at least let you know about the church in Mi-Yang and its needs. Perhaps you will be led to sympathize with us and pray for us. If it is the Lord's will for one of His servants to come but the time we have set is not convenient, we can change our schedule to one week earlier or one week later. If the conference is blessed by the Lord and there is a feeling that it is too short, we can lengthen it according to His will. If you have not come to Honan before, you can take a train to Chu-Ma-Dien. You can stay at the Assembly of God on Gung-Ho Street east of the train tracks and come on to Mi-Yang early the next day. We are waiting for your reply.</p><p>The Lord's little servant,<br />Liu Ming-cheng<br />March 22<br />[Address omitted]</p><p>(Mr. Watchman Nee is abroad. We will forward your letter to Mr. Witness Lee and ask him to answer it directly&mdash;Editor.)</p><h2 class="head2">K'un-ming, Yunnan Province</h2><p>The work here has been blessed by God very much. Last Lord's Day (March 6) five brothers and eleven sisters were baptized. Many of their testimonies proved God's marvelous works and salvation. We can only thank Him and give all the glory to Him. This week (March 7-12) there will be a gospel meeting every afternoon at two o'clock. (Sister Rachel Lee will be responsible for it.) There will be a sisters' edification meeting every evening at seven o'clock. (This is the first of its kind in K'un-ming. Sister Yu Su-jeng will be responsible for it.) May the Lord do a more thorough work. There is some joyful news. Brother Yin Tzu-lan and his wife will soon come to Mong-Tze, Yunnan from Hong Kong. Mong-Tze is a large city in Yunnan. It has good communication, and the climate is good. It is just a little warmer than K'un-ming. May God use our brother to raise up His testimony there. Thank God for opening a way for our sister Wang Ju-ching. She is already head nurse at the Tung-Ren Hospital here. The old meeting hall is next door to the Tung-Ren Hospital, and the doctors and nurses there sometimes come to hear the word. Sister Wang is there, so we hope that she will be able to lead them to know the Lord. Sister Chang Jing-shia is often asked by patients to be their home nurse (because doctors recommend her). Brother Chang Jing-yuan has not yet found a suitable job. I have heard that he has a burden to go out to the neighboring towns with Brother Chen Hsi-wen to do the work of passing out tracts and preaching the gospel. Sister Chu Teh-hua does not have a job yet, either. May the Lord open a way for her soon. Brother Chou Kang-yao and his wife are really laboring in one accord for the furtherance of the gospel. Brother Chou has preached individually to many air cadets, and several of them have been saved. Brother Weigh will probably take a trip to Shi-Ping in the near future. Sister Yu may go with Brother Weigh to that region of Yunnan (Mong-Tze, Shi-Ping, and Lin-An) to work. Please pray for this.</p><p>Your little brother in the Lord,<br />Huang Tsung<br />March 14<br />[Address omitted]</p><h2 class="head2">Kuei-yang, Kweichow Province</h2><p>Dear Sister Ruth in the Lord:</p><p>Thank the Lord for His great grace. He knew that Kuei-yang lacked workers to preach the Lord's salvation, and He answered our prayer. He moved some of you and placed this thought into your hearts. I pray that the Lord would impart some spiritual gifts to you so that you might bring them to us. May the Lord use you to bear much good fruit to the glory of His name. When you leave Jun-Yi Station on your way here, send a telegram or ask the people in the Gospel Chapel to telephone us. Christian greetings to you. Greetings to Sister Wang, Sister Chang, and Brother Chang.</p><p>Your sister in the Lord,<br />Chen Hsu-kuang<br />March 11<br />[Address omitted]</p><h2 class="head2">Lien-Jiang, Fukien Province</h2><p>Greetings to my dear X in the Lord!</p><p>We are together with you and all the brothers from all localities in Hankow in spirit, even though we are separated physically. Foochow has already been bombed three times, but the Lord has preserved and protected us. Our almighty Lord is certainly able to care for the brothers and sisters during this war. We are believers in the Lord, and our hope of glory is much closer under this kind of situation. The Lord is already at the door, hallelujah! We remember the brothers and sisters in difficulties in the Lord. We also remember the Lord's work. We are hereby respectfully forwarding X dollars. Please take the time to distribute it for us. Thank you. Please do not forget to pray for the work in the region of Lien-Jiang, Fukien. May the Lord revive His church and save sinners. Glory to the Lord's name, amen! Whenever it is convenient, please instruct us and send us the word which you put out there. I cannot write all that I want to say. When we meet face to face we can further our communication. May the Lord's grace overflow to you! Greet all the brothers and sisters in the Lord for me! Revelation 22:20; 2 Peter 1:2, 11, 5-7.</p><p>Your weak sister in the Lord,<br />Chen Shu-ying<br />March 17, 1938<br />[Address omitted]</p><h2 class="head2">Swatow</h2><p>We remitted X dollars through the postal service today. X dollars are for The Open Door, and X dollars are for the brothers and sisters who are in difficulties. This money came from the offering box. Please use it according to the wishes of the offerers and distribute it for them. Thank you! The meetings here continue as usual. There is a message meeting on the Lord's Day morning at half past nine. The Lord's table meeting is at three o'clock in the afternoon. (We used to preach the gospel, but we have stopped for awhile.) There is a sisters' meeting at seven o'clock on Tuesdays. Thursday evening is still the prayer meeting. Most of the brothers and sisters who left Swatow have returned. Only a few are still living in the countryside. We went into the interior to work three times. Thank God, He was with us. We hope to go work there many times in the future. We are now waiting and praying for the Lord's leading. Please pray for this matter much. Brother Chen Wen-kuang sent a letter recently saying that since he returned to Fukien, his health has begun to improve and his voice has returned somewhat. We really thank and praise our Lord who hears our prayer!</p><p>Mrs. Liu has been very sad since the death of Brother Liang-wei because of their relationship. She is somewhat comforted because he was so peaceful when he died. The shipping business has been blessed by the Lord. Sister Lin Lee Tsuo-yu plans to go to Singapore. She is still living in Sister Chai Lan-jen's An Chuan Birth Clinic on Sin-Shing Street. Has The Christian been published recently? (We are preparing to print it&mdash;Editor.) If you publish anything, please send us some copies.</p><p>Your brothers in the Lord,<br />Chen Fang-ching, Chai Gi-chen, Hsie Tse-shun<br />[Address omitted]</p><h2 class="head2">Canton</h2><h2 class="head3">One</h2><p>Sister Phoebe:</p><p>Most of the brothers and sisters have left Canton for other places. Some have gone to Hong Kong. Some have gone to the countryside. There are a little more than ten people left here. We have stopped all meetings except for the table meeting on the Lord's Day because of the difficulty in transportation. In the past few weeks the brothers and sisters all agreed to resume the Thursday prayer meeting. Even though there are not many people, we are very much in one accord. We used to borrow a brother's house for all the meetings. Last Thursday Brother Shuan suggested that we borrow another house for preaching the gospel and for meetings. We are still praying. If the Lord is willing, He will do it. Please greet Sister Lee and the sisters living with her. Peace in the Lord!</p><p>Your sister, Du Ai-jen<br />March 22</p><h2 class="head3">Two</h2><p>Dear Sister Ro-chen in the Lord:</p><p>There have not been many patients in the hospital recently because of the turmoil. I am not busy at work. I have received God's grace and am physically stronger every day. Thank you for your prayers in love. I often remember you before the Lord. I believe the Lord hears prayer and will give you grace. Peace in the Lord!</p><p>Your sister, Liang-yi<br />February 19<br />[Address omitted]</p><h2 class="head3">Three</h2><p>Since the start of the war, we feel we must love the brothers and sisters with the Lord's love. Although our strength is limited, we will not fail God's word on brotherly love if we do our best. We cannot shut our eyes or excuse ourselves from the distress of our brothers and sisters. If we do this, how can we glorify God? I am wiring a small amount of money. Please accept it for the use of the brothers and sisters in need. Our locality has been blessed by the Lord, but we are really lonely. Please pray for us and for the church. Greet the brothers and sisters in Hankow and in all the localities for me.</p><p>Your brother,<br />Yun Fung-zhan<br />[Address omitted]</p><h2 class="head2">Hankow</h2><p>I received letters from Brothers Yu Dao-shen and Chu Loh-yuan from Chui-Jia-Juang, Lin-Zi, Shantung. They said, "The meetings in Lin-Zi continue as usual" (March 3).</p><p>Brother Chou You-sheng has found a job in the Hankow Central Savings Association. He was recommended by Brother Timothy Chou (March 11).</p><p>Sister Shang Yee-rong is clear about the Lord's calling and has decided to remain in Hankow. There are now twenty people living in the Gospel Court. All are in the Lord's grace and are getting along fine. Mr. and Mrs. Chang Jing-yu have left Hankow for Szechuan (March 15).</p><p>Two sisters arrived from Nan-Shu-Jou today. One is Miss Yuan Jing-hwa. The other is Sister Wang who wants to go to Siang-Ya Hospital in Ch'ang-sha. Sister Yuan will probably not go any place else. She will settle in Hankow. There are flights on the Hankow-Ch'eng-tu route every day. One can arrive in one day and make a complete trip in two. There is a flight to K'un-ming every three days. The round trip can be made in six days. There is no airport in Kweichow, so the trip must be made through Chungking. It takes more time. The Hankow-Yunnan airline flies every Wednesday and Saturday from Hankow and every Monday and Thursday from K'un-ming (March 18).</p><p>Yesterday afternoon at 2:20, Sister Wu Deh-shin and her elderly mother, Sister Kao, Brother and Sister Pan Hwei-sheng, and Brother Wang Ching-shan were in a group of nine people who took the Hankow-Canton train to Hong Kong. From Hong Kong Sister Wu will return to Tientsin. Brother Wang Ching-shan will go from Tientsin back to Tsinan. Brother and Sister Pan will return to Hwei-An County in Amoy which is their ancestral home. Sister Kao will return to Foochow (March 24).</p><p>Yesterday morning Brother Chu An-kuang brought seven students of the Yih County Agriculture Reform College from Yan-Cheng to Hankow. We have provided them temporary lodging at the orphanage. Each person has to pay X dollars a month for room and board. Brother Tsung Kung and his family of seven have also moved into the orphanage. They pay the orphanage X dollars in room and board every month. We really need to pray for their future and ask the Lord to open a way for them. Sister Liu Su-fang's illness has been healed by God, and she has already returned to Hankow (March 28).</p><p>(The preceding portions are all excerpts from Brother Lan Tsi-yi's letters&mdash;Editor.)</p><h2 class="head2">Hong Kong</h2><p>Brother Nee went to Southeast Asia on March 5. From there he will go to England. Brother Chao Shih-guang and Brother John Wang are both leading the meetings in Hong Kong. Praise the Lord! I have received much help from them (March 15).</p><p>Mrs. Sun Zhu Ming-seng returned to Canton last Tuesday. Sister Chen Bi-kun accompanied her. Sister Chen returned to Hong Kong yesterday. She will go to work in Yunnan at the end of the month. My health is improving, but I have not finished my studies for this semester. Please pray for me (March 20).</p><p>(The preceding portions are excerpts from Brother Philip Luan's letters.)</p><p>Brother Wang Lien-jun is in Hong Kong now. Mr. Chao Tze-wei was sick. Senior Mrs. Nee went to pray for him, and his sickness was cured. He was also saved. Miss Hu and Miss Dai and two other overseas missionaries are living with Mrs. Lin An-teh at 12 Granville Road, Floor 3, Kowloon. They really care about the work in Chung-Shan and pray for me often. Mrs. Lin An-teh greets Miss Chang. (This is an excerpt from Sister Huang Ro-chen's letter of March 7.)</p><p>I came from Chung-Shan to Hong Kong on the twenty-sixth of last month. Sister Huang came one day before me. I received much help in Hong Kong through listening to Mr. Nee's preaching. Sister Huang and I are staying in Mrs. Nee's house. We have received much care and help from the brothers and sisters. This is the Lord's grace. Thank and praise Him! We can probably return to Chung-Shan the day after tomorrow. We will stay in Chung-Shan for a few days before taking a trip to Canton. (This is an excerpt from Sister Kuo Hai-jen's March 7 letter.)</p><p>My lungs have had the proper pressure since I received the shots from the air needles. However, a special condition arose in my right lung, and it became hard, so the doctors stopped the shots. I have a bronchial infection, and my coughing continues, which hurts my lungs. The doctors operated on my lungs (they wanted to remove the nerves). My nerves were removed on December 8. That night I could not stop spitting up blood. Fortunately, I was not in any danger, thank the Lord. I have been very well since entering the hospital. The only difficulty is that I do not speak the language, so many things are inconvenient. I have really lost all hope in medicine. I only hope in my Lord. I confess that God's will is never wrong. The ability to run around is the Lord's grace. Being able to lie down is also the Lord's grace. We are all living in His grace. May the Lord increase my heart of submission. Please pray more for me that I would not just be wasting time lying down but could obtain that which the Lord wants me to obtain and learn what the Lord wants me to learn. I want to submit to His discipline and overcome all sufferings. (This is an excerpt from Sister Ma Min-jen's letter of March 28. Sister Ma's mailing address is [omitted].)</p><h2 class="head2">Manila</h2><p>Dear Sister X in the Lord:</p><p>We are in my elder brother's home. We want to rent our own house, but my brother will not allow us. He not only obliged us to stay in his house but also says that it is God's arrangement and that I must obey. May the Father accomplish His will in this house. I have completely placed the future in the Lord's hands. My brother recently suggested that we have a home prayer meeting. I really thank the Lord. There is now a prayer meeting every Friday evening in my brother's home. We have had it twice already. Please remember this in your prayers. My brother believes in God and in His love. He believes that God hears prayer, but he has not yet seen the relationship of the blood to himself. He really needs the work of the Holy Spirit. It would be best for the assembly here if you and Sister Miao Yun-chun could come among the sisters. It would really be beneficial to the believers if Brother Witness Lee could make a trip here. We are praying for this. Sister Chai Teh-an will go to Singapore soon because the brothers and sisters there sent a telegram inviting her. She also felt that she should go. Thus, Manila is losing a worker and sister who really knows the work of the cross. I am really sad in my human emotion because I am losing a sister who is in one accord, but I can only say "amen" to God's will.</p><p>I have obtained one copy of the second issue of The Open Door; through it I have learned about the work in each place. The believers today are scattered in many places. I really feel that this type of publication is very precious. May the Father give His children the burden and strength to pray. Since the power of darkness is so fierce and the believers are tempted on all sides in their pilgrimage through this world, we really feel that praying for one another is so important. Peace in the Lord. En-hung and my two daughters send their greetings. Greet Sister Wang, Sister Chang, and Mrs. Yuan in the Lord.</p><p>Your sister in the Lord,<br />Lin Hsue Yun-chang<br />February 4<br />[Address omitted]</p><h2 class="head1">TWO LETTERS RECEIVED<br />AFTER THIS ISSUE WAS EDITED</h2><h2 class="head2">One</h2><p>Greetings to X in the Lord:</p><p>I read this month's issue of The Open Door and realized that the brothers and sisters in the Lord wanted to know where my younger brother, Tang Shing (Brother Tang Shou-ling) is. Thank the God who loves us. Through believing in His name, we have been given authority to be the children of God. This is why all the brothers and sisters in the Lord care about my brother as if he were their own flesh brother. Last night after dinner, I received a copy of the Weekly Newsletter of the Chinese Methodist Church from my cousin. In it I learned that my brother and his family are all at 228 Mo-Gan-Shan. Mr. Sun Wen-yuan and his family are at No. 254 of the same place. Praise the Lord. He is trustworthy. He really is our keeper, as it says in Psalm 121. When I did not know where my brother was for several months, Proverbs 14:26 really comforted my heart: "In the fear of the Lord is strong confidence: and his children shall have a place of refuge." Every time I was discouraged and worried about my brother, the Lord comforted me with that verse. Hallelujah! His Word is faithful! Even though the post office in Mo-Gan-Shan is not reachable, there are no barriers of time and space in the fellowship of the Lord. I believe that what the Lord has arranged for us is more perfect than anything we could dream of. I also believe that soon the brothers and sisters near Mo-Gan-Shan will be able to visit and comfort my brother. Please pray for them much so that they would love the Lord faithfully and glorify His holy name. Please pray for me so that my faith would increase and so that I would not cause the Lord to sadly say, "You of little faith, why did you doubt?" Peace in the Lord.</p><p>Your sister in the Lord,<br />Ma Tang Mei-jen<br />March 29</p><p>(This letter is from Brother Tang Shou-ling's elder sister. She used to live in Shansi and is now in Ch'ang-sha. We were not only comforted by this letter but were also helped.)</p><h2 class="head2">Two</h2><p>X in the Lord:</p><p>Both transportation and the post office have been blocked, so the brothers and sisters in Pu-Dong do not have any exchange of news with the brothers and sisters in Shanghai or the other localities. We were cared for by the Lord and safely arrived in Shanghai. We found out that the brothers and sisters in the Lord were worried about us. This inspired us to thank the Lord's love for its length, breadth, height, and depth. The brothers and sisters in Nan-Chiao and Chi- Hsien-Chiao all suffered the loss of property in this war, but their bodies and spirits were preserved by the Lord without harm. God heard the prayers of the brothers and sisters. Our hearts are full of thanks for the Lord's boundless grace! We are remitting X dollars donated by Brother Yang. X dollars of it are for printing The Open Door. X dollars are to be given to the brothers and sisters who are in difficulty because of the war. Peace in the Lord. Greet all the brothers and sisters in the Lord. Please pray for Brother Chuang Shu-lian's and Brother Chuang Jeng-yi's families because all are not saved.</p><p>Your little brothers in the Lord,<br />Chu En-sheng, Chuang Jeng-yi<br />March 19</p><p>(This letter was mailed from Shanghai to Hankow.)</p><h2 class="head1">A WORD ON BEHALF OF THE EDITOR</h2><p>Time is of the essence for news. The post office's handling of printed material is very slow. In this publication: (1) We will not have a definite number of pages. We will do our best to put all the news into it that we receive while we are in the editing process. We hope that our readers will pray much for the work of God, the workers, and for the churches in all the localities. (2) Sometimes we will not print the column on the travels of the co-workers. Please find out where they are by reading the news of the work and the news of the churches.</p><p>Beginning with the next issue, we will begin publishing the translation of The Dynamics of Service. (It concerns the principles of the work. We will print one of the ten chapters in each issue.) This is a special announcement.</p><p>Some localities have sent offerings. Some of these offerings are for the work, and some are for the brothers and sisters who are in need because of the war. Brother Lan Tsi-yi and Sister Ruth Lee have received them and distributed them according to the needs of each locality (as far as we know them). We can only thank God and ask Him to care for the ones who care for others. May God bless those who receive the gifts.</p><p>Some brothers and their families are still in the war zone, like the Tang, Chou, Sun, Yu, and Yeh families who are still at Mo-Gan-Shan. Brother Ruan Chi-yu and a few other families (see the letters in this issue) are still in the city of Hangchow. We have not heard anything from the co-workers and the churches in northern Kiangsu for a long time. Some localities can receive mail but not wires of money. We need to pray for all these matters.</p><p>We received a letter from Brother Watchman Nee after he arrived in Singapore. He is feeling well after having a tooth extracted. We hope you will pray for him.</p><p>Ruth Lee<br />March 30, 1938, in Chungking</p><h2 class="head1">A FEW REQUESTS</h2><p>(1) Please put the date on your letters.

I spontaneously sang hallelujah when I saw this situation. I went to Bao-Shiu to work for one week and have now returned to Shi-Ping. Had it not been for the Lord's intervention, it would have been impossible to preach the gospel there. I felt it was especially difficult for several reasons. First, the people reject outsiders no matter where they are from. They ignore you (which subsequently leaves you without a place to stay). If you want to rent a house, it is even more difficult. Second, strange rumors are spread, such as, "If you believe in Western religion, you will end up in such and such a way." Before I went to Bao-Shiu, I met the chief of the Bureau of Public Safety. He was happy to give me hospitality, so I worked there for a week. I could not rent a room, so I only preached salvation through the Lord's grace and returned to Shi-Ping.</p><p>Lin Kwang-tsao<br />March 22</p><h2 class="head3">Ku-Jiu</h2><h2 class="head4">One</h2><p>I boarded a train in Shi-Ping on March 30 and went to Ku-Jiu. The population of Ku-Jiu has increased rapidly, and the cost of living has gone up tremendously. It seems like a good opportunity to preach the gospel. The first day I went out, it seemed that I did not have the assurance of anything. There seemed to be a great pressure to live in the inn. It was almost as if I could not move. I did not know how God wanted to start the work. The second day God marvelously arranged for me to meet some brothers. Although they do not have as much spiritual wisdom as the brothers from other provinces, they have an honest love and invited me into their homes. I met a good brother. He is a (Western) doctor and sympathizes with us much. Now I have a Bible study in these brothers' homes every evening. The topics are all on matters of life. May God hide me so that others may only see Him working.</p><p>Lin Kwang-tsao<br />April 3</p><h2 class="head4">Two</h2><p>After we left K'un-ming on the seventh, we arrived at six o'clock in the evening in Ah-Mi-Jou. We left Ah-Mi-Jou at six o'clock in the morning on the eighth and arrived in Bi-Se-Zhai at eight o'clock and changed trains for Ku-Jiu. When we arrived in Mong-Tze, Sister Hsiao Ru-chuan welcomed us at the train station. We spoke joyfully with her and then boarded the bus for Ku-Jiu. We were preserved by the Lord along the way. He provided seats for us on even the most crowded trains. We really thank and praise Him! When we arrived in Ku-Jiu, Brother Lin Kwang-tsao and Mr. Gung En-lung (who was recently saved in a clear way) came together to receive us into Mr. Gung's house. It was the Lord's sovereign arrangement for Brother Lin to meet this brother here. They now have a Bible study every evening. There are a little more than ten people in attendance. We hope that a local church can be established by next Lord's Day so that we can start breaking bread to remember the Lord. This Lord's Day we began a traveling table meeting to remember the Lord. (The brothers and sisters who are clearly saved can attend this meeting to break bread and remember the Lord.) Brother Gung is a good brother arranged by the Lord to bear responsibility in Ku-Jiu. He is willing to donate a room for the use of the meetings. During the day three of us go out and preach the gospel outdoors, once in the morning and once in the afternoon. There are usually sixty to seventy people listening in the street. We take turns preaching. The audience pays close attention. May the Lord Himself save sinners. We do not know when we will leave this place, but we plan to work for at least another five or six days. After the work is finished, we plan to go to Shi-Ping to visit the brothers and sisters. If the Lord opens the door for us, we then plan to work in Lin-An, Mong-Tze, and the surrounding areas.</p><p>K. H. Weigh, Chen Hsi-wen<br />April 9</p><h2 class="head4">Three</h2><p>The three of us went out into the streets for seven afternoons passing out gospel tracts and preaching. We hung up pictures and sang short songs. The bustling crowds would gather to listen as we shouted out the gospel. We took turns speaking. When one was preaching, the others would stand by his side and pray quietly. The audience came in groups and took turns listening. Some went, but others stayed. Each time we preached, two to three hundred people stopped to listen. We have not seen an outward result yet; we do not know whether anyone has received the word at this time or whether they will receive it later. However, we thank and praise the Lord! This is probably the first time the gospel has been preached outdoors in Ku-Jiu. No matter what, Christ was proclaimed. We believe that His inward working is never in vain. The Lord also gave us an opportunity to testify to those in the government. On the evening of April 10, we had the first table meeting in Ku-Jiu with Brother and Sister Gung. It was sweet even though the number was small! On the fifteenth we had a special gospel meeting in Brother Gung's house for the neighboring women. Three or four people raised their hands to show that they wanted to receive salvation. We had a meeting for more than three hours on the afternoon of the seventeenth. The first half was for preaching the gospel, and the second half was for a message on the Lord's second coming. Many brothers and sisters received this kind of truth joyfully. There was a table meeting in the evening. There were five brothers and two sisters from that locality in addition to the three of us. Six or seven of the brothers and sisters in Ku-Jiu have seen the truth of the local church and want to walk in the truth. May the Lord lead them through His own leading. On the last Lord's Day evening, we prayed together in one accord and committed the newly established church in Ku-Jiu and the responsible brothers (Brother Gung and Brother Ruan) to God and His word of grace (Acts 20:32). We left Ku-Jiu by train on the eighteenth and went to Shi-Ping. (It is a day's train ride from Ku-Jiu to here.) We are looking for God's own leading concerning the work here. We need to rise up to pray more for this, and we need the brothers and sisters in all the localities to pray as well. We will tell you the rest later. May the Lord's love be with you. Amen!</p><p>Your brothers in the Lord,<br />K. H. Weigh, Lin Kwang-tsao, Chen Hsi-wen</p><h2 class="head2">Soon to Enter Sikang Province</h2><p>Brother Huang Jung sent a letter from K'un-ming on April 20, saying, "Brother Hsu (Jung-jieh) and Brother Hu (Yi-ming) will soon put their luggage on their backs and enter Sikang province to preach the gospel. We have heard that the roads are dangerous and that the bandits are very numerous. We need to pray earnestly for our brothers who are pressing on without caring for their health and safety."</p><h2 class="head2">The Work in Ch'ang-Teh, West Hunan</h2><p>My health has not been good lately, so I plan to rest a week. I have stopped the Bible study for beginners temporarily. I am not completely clear about the way I will take in the future. In the past few weeks, the brothers and sisters have become low in spirit, and I do not know why. It is as if they have fallen into mud and cannot pull their legs out. I feel much pressure inwardly. I can see that the flesh is totally useless. If God does not give grace, who can bring anyone into spiritual reality? After passing through this trial, I have really seen that if the apostles do not have the power, all their work will become an outward endeavor and will be dead and burdensome. I really ask for God's mercy. I do not know why God has chosen such a useless vessel as myself. If I were not clear about God's call, I would throw up my arms in resignation. Many people have repented during this time of preaching the gospel. Some are students. Others are businessmen. Some are even opium smokers. There are also some who were possessed by demons. The Living Water Teahouse is next to a theatrical troupe, and one of the troupers marvelously received the Lord. He came to me one evening and said that he had been praying for a long time, asking Jesus to open the way for him to make a living doing something else. He no longer felt right about singing in the troupe. I felt that his word was sincere. Unfortunately, he moved to another place today, so I did not have the opportunity to care for him!</p><p>Han Fu-sheng<br />April 5<br />[Address omitted]</p><h2 class="head2">A Letter from Brother Chiu Ri-jien,<br />Northern Kiangsu</h2><p>At the end of last year, I went to Bai-Chien-Ji in Lien-Shui County to work. Brother Yin Ke-chu went with me. The Lord revived several of the people and saved several entire families together with some sinners. This spring I worked there again for a total of sixteen days. The number in the meetings every Lord's Day is approximately fifty or sixty. The Lord saves, the Spirit works, and we are just empty vessels. After working in Chien-Ji, I was led by the Lord to go to Hwi-Dun. This place is about fifty or sixty miles from the city. Three or four years ago, there was no one there to testify for the Lord. Then a sister in the Lord was persecuted for the Lord's sake, and His name was made manifest. The Lord continued by raising up two brothers and five sisters to testify for Him. When I arrived, I had the burden to preach the gospel. I did so every afternoon, conducting some edification and prayer meetings in the evenings. They were all under the Lord's blessing. Twenty to thirty people are clear about their salvation. There are more women than men. This is the first proper beginning of the work in Hwi-Dun. Thank and praise the Lord for this!</p><p>Your little brother in the Lord,<br />Chiu Ri-jien<br />April 3</p><p>Please send all letters and books to my home in Soo-Jia-Tsui, Lien-Shui County, Kiangsu.</p><h2 class="head2">The Gospel among the Miao Tribe,<br />Chekiang Province</h2><p>Pu Men is in the southernmost area of Ping-Yang. It is a small country village among the steep peaks of the high mountains. It is rarely visited by workers. (The workers only go to Fang-Yen-Hsia and Yi-Shan in Jiang-Nan. It is not that they are unfair, but the roads are difficult. However, there is a more convenient way of taking the steamer up Sha River and disembarking in Hsia-Guan.) There are four assemblies here. However, there is a lack of people doing the watering, so it is very difficult to go on. What a pity! During the past two years, the area has been directly and indirectly controlled by bandits, but we have all been safe under God's protection. Thank Him. God opened a new way for us during the Chinese New Year gospel conference. We went to preach the gospel to the Miao tribe. There are three areas where these people live: Niu-Pi-Ling, Fu-Jang, and Hua-Yang. (Of course, there are also others who are scattered elsewhere. Hua-Yang belongs to Fukien. It is in the northernmost part of the province.) The closest is about twenty miles from Ma-Tsan, and the farthest is thirty miles away. The mountain roads are steep and dangerous. The steep paths are difficult to travel, and this area is very backward. These tribesmen have never heard the gospel. (We really have sinned against the Lord and them as well.) For years this has been a stronghold of bandits. A few of us went with Brother Lin Sheng-wu. After praying, we went out first to Niu-Pi-Ling. They were like birds scared of a bow because they had been harassed and harmed by bandits the year before. They were suspicious of us and dared not receive us. We managed to rent a house from them. During the day we preached the gospel door to door and gave them our individual testimonies. They were afraid to even take gospel tracts. In the evening we held gospel meetings. At first fifty or sixty people came to listen to the word. Later, the numbers decreased. Most were merely curious. Although they did not seem to have a heart, we were not discouraged. We believe that the Lord will not make our work vain. Later, we went to Fu-Jang and Hua-Yang. The people in these two places live closer together, so it was easier to contact them. We worked in the same way. Thank the Lord that He Himself worked. They listened solemnly to Brother Lin's preaching (even a broken vessel helps) and were touched. More than ten desired to believe. Unfortunately, the road is far, so they cannot have frequent contact with us. In the last two weeks, five have come to Ma-Tsan to listen to the word. We pray and hope that a church can soon be established in that locality so that the hundreds of surrounding homes would not perish (3 John 2).</p><p>Your little brother,<br />Fan Pei-jen<br />April 5<br />[Address omitted]</p><h2 class="head2">A Letter from Brother Chen Chin-fa</h2><p>I was with Brother Hwa Shi-bin in Huang-Yen for a twelve-day conference from February 27 to March 10. The main points of Brother Hwa's messages were on God's eternal, unchanging plan and how it is being carried out throughout the ages until it is realized. I spoke on Exodus and the believers' experience. Every morning during morning watch, I spoke of the things that happened before and after Moses was called. Thank and praise the Lord. He really loves us and wants to work with us. Hallelujah! Amen. Brother Huang Li-chuan and I held a ten-day conference from March 15 to 24 at the China Inland Mission in Rue-An. Brother Huang's messages explained John 4 in detail. We all received an abundance of new light. I preached on the two different principles in the Bible&mdash;the divine and the human. I still do not know of any results. We have no intention of thinking about it all the time. We have just put it into the Lord's hands. A few days after the work in Rue-An was over, Brother Hwa Shi-bin and Brother David Hsu were invited to work for five days in the independent church in that city. I heard that the results were good. When the conference was about to begin, there were some who vehemently opposed. Thank the Lord, they understood gradually and in the end completely welcomed them. There were also brothers from the Hsun-Dao Chapel in Tang-Kou who heard the brothers and were moved by what they heard. They have firmly invited them to work in their place. We are praying about this matter now to see what the Lord's mind is. Brother Hsu and Brother Hwa came to Fang-Yen-Hsia to rest after finishing the work in Rue-An. Yesterday (April 4) Brother Hwa left for Sha-Po to work there for three days. He will return to Fang-Yen-Hsia afterwards. Brother Hsu is now staying in Pei-Ling School. He will hold a five-day conference in Fang-Yen-Hsia starting tomorrow. Brother Hsu will be responsible for the preaching. Brother Hwa might go to Wenchow to stay for awhile. Brother Hsu plans to travel among the localities in Ping-Yang. He has not decided on how long he will stay. I hope you will pray for these matters.</p><p>Your weak brother in the Lord,<br />Chen Chin-fa<br />April 5<br />[Address omitted]</p><h2 class="head2">Letters from Brother Hsu Dah-weh,<br />Chekiang Province</h2><h2 class="head3">One</h2><p>Since leaving Ning-Po in September of last year, I have been traveling back and forth in the upper river region of eastern Chekiang for six months. It has not been convenient for me to communicate with you because I have been traveling mainly in the high mountains or deep valleys where news does not travel and communication is difficult. I left Li-Shui by grace on the eighteenth and came to Yung-Jia. Here things are slightly more restful. Thank and praise the Lord. I read The Open Door and was comforted to know about the brothers' and sisters' travels. Brother Pan Huo-ling of Yung-Jia and Brother Chai Chi of Ping-Yang are both physically weak and need our prayers. For the past six months, God has placed me alone away from home. The lessons I have learned from such sufferings are very precious. Sometimes I am very lonely in spirit. Sometimes I even suspect that I have fallen away and have been forsaken by the Lord. Thank and praise the Lord! His unchanging love always encourages me on! It is late at night now. May the Lord teach me to go on faithfully. Please pray for me.</p><p>Your brother in the Lord,<br />Hsu Dah-weh</p><h2 class="head3">Two</h2><p>I left Yung-Jia on the twenty-fifth of last month and went with Brother Hwa Shi-bin and Brother Huang Li-chuan to Rue-An. I held a conference with Brother Hwa in the independent church in Rue-An. Then I went with Brothers Hwa and Huang to Ping-Yang to visit the brothers on the second of this month and held a conference for five days in Fang-Yen-Hsia. Today I came with Brother Hwa and Brother Chen Chin-fa to Hsiao-Nan County of Ping-Yang. We will work for two or three evenings in Mo-Cheng. The Lord willing, we will visit the brothers in Shan-Men of Bei-Jiang County. After returning from Shan-Men, Brother Hwa will probably return to Ning-Hai. I am still waiting for the Lord's leading. I have been traveling for a long time. I really need to be calm before God and give Him a chance to trim me.</p><p>Your brother in the Lord,<br />Hsu Dah-weh<br />April 11</p><h2 class="head2">A Letter from Brother Chen Meng-tsao,<br />Chekiang Province</h2><p>I received the fifth issue of The Open Door. Thank God! He shows us more about the work and the travels of His servants so that we now have fresh burdens in our prayer and are more in one accord with all the saints. There were four days of meetings in Shui-Ting that began on March 27. God used Brother Ma (Chuan-fu) to do some work in saving people. Praise the Lord for saving several people. From the thirty-first of last month to the fourth of this month, He arranged a conference of four days and five nights for the entire church of God in Lan-Si in which He spoke concerning the differences and relationships between the church, the work, and the workers through the mouth of His servant, Brother Ma. He also handed over the charge of God's commission to His children. Praise and thank God. In the past we knew only that the brothers bore the responsibility for the practical matters. We now see that God wants to call them to bear the spiritual yoke as well as to build up the Body of Christ. What is lacking now is the gifts in Ephesians 4. May God give more of these kinds of gifts to His church. May He raise up more elders and deacons like those in Titus 1 to govern His house. I have recently received a clear charge from God to do some pioneering work in Si-Bei County of Lan-Yi. The people there live very close together, but the gospel is seldom preached. Brother Hu (Bu-dao) and I will go to Tieh-Lu-Tou and Huang-Ni-Shan to work for a time during the middle of this month. (The first place is about thirty-five miles from the city and about fifteen miles from the assembly in Ju-Ge. The second place is more than twenty miles from the city.) Then we will pioneer in Hou-Ren, Gan-Shi, and Nu-Bu, the Lord willing. Please remember this in your prayer.</p><p>The southwestern portion of Chekiang, including the two counties of Chang-Shan and Sui-An, have cried for Brother Ma to go and work there. The brothers in Wu-Yi want Brother Ma to go and help with the work among the young people. Those are probably the two places he will go to in the next two months. There was a baptism in the church in Lan-Si on the thirty-first of last month. Fifteen brothers and eleven sisters were baptized. May they have a good testimony from now on. The brothers and sisters who came to Lan-Si to escape the war have gradually passed safely over the border. The family of Shen Guan-min from Soochow is the only one that is still staying in Shui-Ting Village in Lan-Si.</p><p>Your brother in the Lord,<br />Chen Meng-tsao<br />April 9<br />[Address omitted]</p><h2 class="head2">Letters from Brother Hu Ji-t'ang,<br />Chekiang Province</h2><h2 class="head3">One</h2><p>Yesterday, I read the third issue of The Open Door and rejoiced to learn that the work in the remote areas is actively being pursued. Brother Hu Yi-min invited me to go with him last year, but my business and family entangled me, and I dared not agree rashly. However, I am very concerned about the work, and it seems as if I have already gone there. I am asking the Gospel Book Room to pass on X dollars for the gospel work in Yunnan. Please use it for the front lines. It is such a small amount that it can only show my support and oneness. (We have already sent it to K'un-ming to be forwarded to Yeh-Ji&mdash;Editor.) The region of Taichow in Chekiang is mountainous and close to the sea. Taichow, Ling-Hai, Huang-Yen, Hai-Men, Luh-Chiao, Hsien-Ju, and Tai-Ping all have many denominations. Tai-Ping has the most. The China Inland Mission constitutes eighty to ninety percent of the denominational churches. Each chapel has between one hundred and four hundred members. The work here has been mainly carried out by the local believers. Thank the Father for His grace. I came to Huang-Yen with Brother Shan Kai-fen on December 18. Brother Shan preached a few times in Shi-Ju-Dien Chapel and Jin Ching Harbor Chapel, but he did not speak the local dialect, so he went back to Shao-Shing before I did. I stayed and then went to Hai-Men. Brother Hwa Shi-bin and I held a five-day conference there. Brother Hwa Shi-bin then went to Shi-Tang-Tou in Tai-Ping to hold a conference there. I was invited to Yang-Fu-Miao to hold a conference for three days and then went to Pu-Jiao-Tou for five days. I arrived in Da-Fen today. I will hold a conference for five days and then another five-day conference in Lin-Hai. These dates are already set. I will let God Himself lead me as to the future. I have really seen God's own leading and blessing in the work in the past. May glory be to the Lord's holy name!</p><p>Your little brother,<br />Hu Ji-tang</p><h2 class="head3">Two</h2><p>I received the fifth issue of The Open Door. The number of pages in this last issue has increased, and they all told of the Father's blessings upon the work in all the places. I give much praise and thanks to the Lord, but I was also warned very much. I have been working with two Western missionaries, Mr. Milton and Mr. Mullen, at Hai-Men and Da-Fen. We have become more intimate with each other in acquaintance and in fellowship. I believe that many misunderstandings were cleared up. The work in Da-Fen was blessed by God much more than I expected. From there I went on to work in Lin-Hai for five days. Thank the Lord, several intellectuals and Buddhists came and were happy to hear the word, receive the Bible, and diligently search everything. How can an ignorant one such as I handle such work? May the glory and blessing go to our heavenly Father and the Lord Jesus Christ, amen. The Anglican Church in Lin-Hai wanted me to hold a conference there for seven days. However, I feel that if I work without stopping, it will not be good for either my spirit or my body. I reluctantly agreed to speak for three days, two messages a day. During these three days, my spirit was bound and my prayer could not get through. On the evening before the first meeting, I had a dark vision in my dream and intended to cancel the meetings. But the announcements were made. If I did not go, it would be unfaithfulness on my part. But if I went, I would feel quite unable to fulfill my task. I was in quite a bind. As a result, I failed in my work. However, God is my joy. I gained a good brother through these meetings, Brother Hsie Xiao-you, the principal of the Jing-Ai Elementary School. He has been reading the publications from the Gospel Book Room for many years. He also has The Open Door. He said he has been helped by reading The Christian and other publications. I will return to Shao-Shing tomorrow and tell you about my future plans later.</p><p>Your little brother,<br />Hu Ji-tang<br />April 14, mailed from Pu-Ji Hospital, Lin-Hai</p><h2 class="head2">The Beginning of the Work in Chang-Pu,<br />Fukien Province</h2><p>God led Brother Chen Bing-hsi to Chang-Pu to pioneer the work there. He met several times in Yeh Jeng-kuang's home in Pu-Yi. It was a very good opportunity. Later, a Presbyterian minister invited Brother Bing-hsi to pray for a sister and to cast out a demon in her. The Lord graced him, and the demon left her. Thank and praise the Lord. After this he had a conference in a Chinese Methodist Church in the city for four days. The brothers and sisters pursued the Lord with a pure heart and happily received the truth he preached. I hope they will run in the straight way under God's leading. On March 22 we went to the eastern section of Chang-Pu to work in Fuo-Yun Village. There has been prayer for this place for many years, and God has begun working here. (There are seven or eight localities around this area, all of which would like us to go to them and work among them.) We have already had eight days of meetings here. (About one hundred people come to hear the word each meeting.) Many families burned their idols and wooden gods. They have left the false for the true. The Spirit's operation in them is really marvelous. There were also many sick ones who were healed of their illnesses after being prayed over and anointed with oil. However, the work of Satan was also very strong. We overcame him in the end by relying on the authority of the cross. May God the Father have mercy on us and give grace to the people of this region so that they may have more opportunities to hear the gospel. May the devil's work be destroyed. We hope that the Lord will send His workers here soon to release all the truth so that these people may be edified. After the ten days of work, we will work in Hu-Si, Lung-Wen-Shi, Jiang-Kou, Chien-Ting, Chi-Hu, Ma-Ping, Jiu-Jen, and Liu-Ban. May the Lord raise up His work that the truth may be released. May He call out His faithful children in every place and establish a local church in every place. Glory to His name, amen. We hope the brothers and sisters will pray much for the work here. We ask for your instruction. Please send us two copies of The Open Door.</p><p>Your little brothers,<br />Yeh Jeng-kuang, Lan Deng-hwei<br />April 1<br />[Address omitted]</p><h2 class="head2">Soon to Go to the Philippines</h2><p>Last summer I received a letter of invitation from the Philippines asking me to go there for the work. I have been praying concerning this matter because I have not had the Lord's clear revelation. Brother Simon Meek recently sent me another letter mentioning the invitation. After a period of prayer, I understood that God wanted me to go. Thank the Lord, I am weak, corrupt, incapable, and unworthy, but I am now enjoying grace in Him. I only ask that the Lord strengthen me all the time so that I may work out my own salvation in fear and trembling. I also ask that I would become more conscious of my corruption, nothingness, and total inability. I want to know Him, the power of His resurrection, the fellowship of His sufferings, and to be conformed to His death. Indeed, this is the highest goal and the highest life. But should I not have this aspiration in the Lord? I am the last and the weakest of the co-workers. For this reason, I am asking X to bear some of the burden with me and to please pray for me before the Lord for grace. Please teach and encourage me so that I may be preserved all my life to stand firmly to glorify the Son of God, the Lord Jesus, who gave His life and shed His blood for me. Thank and praise Him. His great love has made me His slave forever. I am in the process of applying for entry to the Philippines. I hope to leave soon. There are at least one hundred fifty thousand Chinese in the Philippines. Most of them come from Changchow and Chuenchow. I hope that the churches in the Philippines can have the same testimony as the churches in China. I also hope that the work there can be completely mingled with the work in southern Fukien so that the brothers who return home from there can help the churches in every place.</p><p>Your little brother in the Lord,<br />Wu Ren-jieh<br />March 29<br />[Address omitted]</p><h2 class="head2">A Letter from Sister Bao Hsu-min,<br />Sien-You, Fukien</h2><p>There were not many people in the edification meetings for the sisters in Sien-You, but it was of the Lord. Thank Him for manifesting His presence and His co-laboring. In the morning we added a meeting for preaching the gospel and simple Bible study. Sister Wang (Yu-ju) was responsible for it. Thank and praise the Lord. He gave Sister Wang good health and a good voice; she was able to preach messages and do translation for several days without getting tired. There will be a meeting to preach salvation to women in the future. We are still before God about it. Please pray concerning this. Yesterday, I received The Normal Christian Church Life from Shanghai. I really thank God for His mercy in allowing His children to see His light more clearly. I am doing my best to read it through with prayer, and I also ask God to bless this book and give grace to all its readers. I hope that those who care for God's work and the church and who are willing to keep the truth will be able to obtain this book. May the Lord return soon!</p><p>Your little sister in the Lord,<br />Hsu-min<br />April 2</p><h2 class="head2">The Work in Northern Fukien</h2><p>I have read the fifth issue of The Open Door. I know that the Lord cares for each of His people and keeps them safe. He also opens the door for the gospel to us in every place. We really thank the Lord! May He greatly revive His work in these years! I left Ku-Tien last month and went north to Sha County to work for a few days. I returned to Yen-Ping on the third of the month. The evening I arrived I began a conference in Yen-Ping with three meetings a day. There is a good opportunity here. However, the northern part of Fukien is really pitiful. It is very desolate! Therefore, we who are in the valley must hope that the co-workers on the mountain would be faithful to raise your hands for us. Please ask God to raise up His work in every place and to send more workers to continue His work. May His eternal purpose be quickly accomplished. Sister Ong Yu-bing arrived yesterday from Jien-Ou. She will render some help to the women's work. After her work in Yen-Ping, she will go north. I will probably continue moving south.</p><p>Your brother,<br />Chen Bi-yin<br />April 6<br />[Address omitted]</p><h2 class="head2">The Work at Yi-Hu, Swatow, Kwangtung</h2><p>On the twelfth of this month, two sisters, another brother, and I went to Yi-Hu to do some work. Thank the Lord. We witnessed the work of the Holy Spirit in this conference. Some people were saved and others were edified. Two marvelous things occurred during this time. A cloth merchant who was a nominal Christian came to listen to the word on the first day. He did not receive anything. The second day he went into the countryside to sell his cloth. He tried to sell for a long time but could not make any sales. While he was suffering, in his heart he prayed, "O God, if You want me to listen to the messages, let me sell ten dollars worth of cloth." After this prayer, he immediately sold ten dollars worth of cloth. He came back right away to listen to the messages. He was saved that evening. There was another person who had left the truth for more than ten years. He had even burned his Bible and hymnal. He returned to the Lord during this conference. His whole family now comes to hear the word. There were eight days of meetings in this conference. We returned safely home on the twenty-first. The brothers and sisters here are at peace. Brother Chen Wen-kwang's health is much better. Perhaps he can come to Swatow in a little more than a month.</p><p>Your little brother,<br />James Chen<br />March 30<br />[Address omitted]</p><h2 class="head2">A Letter from Brother Chang Tze-jieh,<br />Tsingtao, Shantung</h2><p>There are many new ones in our meetings now. The meeting hall cannot hold them all. Seven or eight have confessed the Lord since the Chinese New Year conference. We thank the Lord because almost every day people seek us out to ask questions about the truth! Praise the Lord! He gives us unexpected joy. Since Tsingtao passed through the war, I receive new light when I read the Bible. My prayer is also much sweeter. Every time I mention the name Jesus, I feel so sweet, and I feel that the Lord is so close to me. I thank the Lord not just for the new believers but also for new co-workers. Brother Ju Fu-sheng came here from An-Dong. He and his wife are both nurses. Sister Ju was saved less than two weeks after coming to Tsingtao. Brother Ju also received the outpouring of the Holy Spirit. We prayed to the Lord in one accord for a person who had been sick for eighteen years. He had wanted to come to Shantung to do other things, but now he has decided to serve the Lord. There is one other matter concerning myself. The Lord definitely wants me to work in the remote regions. When Brother Hsu Jung-jieh came to Tsingtao from Tsinan, his first words were, "Brother, I hope you will go, too." Later, I told Brother Hsu that I wanted to go to the northeastern border near Russia. When Brother Hsu left, his last words were, "Brother, I'll be waiting for you there." May the Lord lead my way. I really would like to fly there now.</p><p>Your little brother in the Lord,<br />Chang Tze-jieh<br />March 23<br />[Address omitted]</p><h2 class="head2">A Letter from Brother Duan Chai-ju,<br />Kansu Province</h2><p>Four sisters came from Sian to Kansu to preach the gospel recently. Several brothers came also. Several days ago, they had a meeting in a home in Huo-Shih-Chun with much blessing from the Lord. On March 10 they held a home meeting in Gan-Gu. Many brothers and sisters were touched and burdened for the outreach missionary work. May the Lord give us strength to do His work. I will not go west until this work is finished and will go to Tsinghai when I have the Lord's clear leading. I hope X will often send me letters of encouragement and instruction.</p><p>Your brother in the Lord,<br />Duan Chai-ju<br />March 5<br />[Address omitted]</p><h2 class="head1">WHEREABOUTS OF THE CO-WORKERS</h2><p>(1) Brother Chen Ke-san will go to Feng-Ting, Pu-Tien, Sien-You, Foochow, and Yu-Si to work in the near future&mdash;Pu-Tien, Fukien.</p><p>(2) Brother Chai Tze-chung will continue to help the believers in Chuenchow&mdash;Pu-Tien, Fukien.</p><p>(3) Brother Deng Tze-cheng went to visit the brothers in southern Fukien for awhile and is now working in western Fukien&mdash;Lung-Yen, Fukien.</p><p>(4) Brother Lan Jin-yang is continuing to work in Dong-Yuan, Tseng-Mao&mdash;Fukien.

Brother Tang Shou-ling, Brother Sun Wen-yuan, Sister Yu Siao-ke, Sister Yeh Chui-chung, and their families are temporarily staying on the mountain. The situation on the mountain can still be called peaceful. There is still food; however, it is not a place where one can live permanently. Therefore, the Tang and Yeh families want to come back to Shanghai. The Sun and Yu families have not decided where to go. I was originally going to travel with the brothers and sisters, but God gave me a clear leading and miraculously opened a way for me to come, so I came before Brother Tang and the others. In this time of emergency, it is very difficult to get out of the war zone to a safe place. I thought that since God had opened a special way for me, I should go ahead and take it. If one family can leave, there is one less family to worry about. Brother Tang was hit by bandits in the chest with the handle of a rifle. The wound was very serious at the time, but thank God for His grace; it healed quickly. Although we have passed through many experiences in the past half year, including burning, robbery, plots, sickness, and dangers, we have clearly seen God's gracious doings in all these things. God's presence, protection, and faithful promises and the power of His will were more real to us. I rejoice the most in the fact that I had an opportunity to absolutely seek God and to touch Him in all these things. I was also able to quietly read His Word. In reality, this was God's answer to my prayer. I had been praying to God for some time for a rest of six months to a year. We never stopped meeting during our time of fleeing the war. Brother Tang conducted a Bible study on Revelation. He gave us much new light and showed us that the day of the Lord is pressing close. I deeply believe that we passed through everything so safely because of the brothers' and sisters' prayers. Therefore, please continue to pray for the brothers and sisters left on the mountain. It is almost impossible to send letters to Mo-Gan-Shan unless you find someone to take them for you. A few days after I came back to Shanghai, some people went there, so I gave them some money to take to the ones there. I will stay in Shanghai temporarily. I am considering where I will go next and will tell you when I am clear. My mother and sister send their greetings. They are very healthy now. Peace in the Lord. Greet Sister Chang, Sister Wang, and Brother Yu-zhi. Please greet all the brothers and sisters in Chungking.</p><p>Your brother,<br />Hsing-yi<br />April 18<br />[Address omitted]</p><h2 class="head2">Shanghai</h2><p>Dear X in the Lord:</p><p>Sister Jin Bao-jieh from Ping-Hu has arrived safely in Shanghai. The Lord really cared for her and protected her along the way during her flight to safety. (Her own story is printed in the Shanghai Local Newsletter, Issue No. 100. We will not repeat it here&mdash;Editor.) We had a baptism meeting recently, and more than ten brothers and sisters were baptized. We are wiring X dollars for the work in Szechuan, Kweichow, and Yunnan. Please ask Brother X to distribute them. X dollars are from a brother in Chefoo, and the rest is from the church in Shanghai. (We have received the money and will give the full amount designated for Yunnan to Yunnan. We distributed some of the money for Szechuan and Kweichow to the work in western Hunan and Hankow. May the Lord bless these barley loaves and this new ear of grain so that other localities will also receive His blessing&mdash;Editor.)

It is really terrible that the communication is so poor. My company has temporarily stopped doing business because of the war. My health has been bad for more than a month. You can imagine the condition the church is in under such circumstances. Please do not forget to pray for us! I received the letter you sent through Ming-hwei. I sent a letter in reply, but I am concerned about whether it will get to you. (It has not arrived&mdash;Editor.) I hope to receive some instructions with regard to my present situation. Greet Sister Wang, Sister Chang, and all the brothers and sisters in Chungking. May you be blessed with health in the Lord.</p><p>Your brother in the Lord,<br />Wu Wei<br />[Address omitted]</p><h2 class="head2">Soo-Jia-Tsui, Northern Kiangsu</h2><p>Dear Brother X in the Lord:</p><p>All the churches in northern Kiangsu are still under the Lord's blessing. There are several more churches than there were two years ago. This is the Lord's special grace. Brother Ji is still in Soo-Jia-Tsui. I have been away from home for the most part since the fall of last year. Thank and praise the Lord. He constantly leads me. It is not beneficial for a worker or for a church to have the worker stay in one place for a long time because (1) the Lord's gifts are kept from spreading to other places, (2) it becomes difficult for gifted local ones to rise up to serve the local church, and (3) it becomes a sect subconsciously, with certain churches belonging to certain individuals. The article on the principle of the work in the second issue of The Open Door is very important. I have not decided where I will go next. I did not receive the second issue of The Open Door. I have already received the fourth issue. Peace in the Lord!</p><p>Your little brother in the Lord,<br />Chiu Ri-jien<br />March 30</p><h2 class="head2">Shao-Shing, Chekiang Province</h2><h2 class="head3">One</h2><p>Brother X in the Lord:</p><p>Last October, I fled from Hangchow to Chou-Jia-Pu in Shi-Siang. I stayed there for more than a month. My wife gave birth to a child one night. When I desperately needed help, a woman suddenly came from the mountain and helped me. This really was God's provision for me; glory be to Him. After nineteen days I took my family into the mountains. Unfortunately, it rained the whole time, the roads were winding and muddy, and my child kept slipping and falling. Thank God for His protection. We finally arrived at a place in the mountains. We stayed in a gospel chapel for three Lord's Days. Then my family and I walked to Yi-Chiao. It was about thirty miles over mountain roads. This was on the road back to Shao-Shing. It was not easy to travel with a little baby. It was especially difficult because the boats had all stopped running. I could only pray silently for God's leading. He indeed made marvelous provisions! I met someone from my home town. It was actually one of my neighbors. He was just hiring a boat to go back home. If we had arrived two hours later, he would have been gone. We were able to ride in the boat with him straight home. At this point my heart overflowed with praise: "Eye has not seen and ear has not heard...things which God has prepared for those who love Him." Where is Brother Luan? Please greet Miss Miao and Miss Tso. Please send me The Open Door beginning with the first issue so I can read them all. May you be blessed with the Lord's presence.</p><p>Your brother,<br />Hsu Tseng-rong<br />March 28<br />[Address omitted]</p><h2 class="head3">Two</h2><p>Greetings to X in the Lord:</p><p>On February 24 I received a letter from Ning-Hai. I was very happy. The brothers are scattered because of the war, and it is difficult to get messages to one another. When I received your letter, it was as if I were seeing your face. I was so comforted! Your remembrance of our brothers and sisters in Shao-Shing is with the same burden as our remembrance of the brothers and sisters in other localities. Although the brothers and sisters in Shao-Shing were all forced to scatter to other places, they are all safe and well. Please do not worry. The only problem is that Miss Chang Shi-jeng was in Li-Zhu originally. A few months ago I hired a boat to go and visit her, but I discovered that she had moved to Hsie-Jia-Chun in the area of Lou-Gung because Li-Zhu was too dangerous. It is difficult to get messages to her, and there is no way to communicate with her. We are not lonely in Jou-Shan. Every Lord's Day there is a meeting in Brother Ma Ting-chi's home. Mrs. Lau from Hsiang-Li comes every Lord's Day. The number of believers from Jou-Shan itself has increased quite a bit. God Himself did the work. Oh, praise the Lord! We need to pray much for one another. May God always give grace and protect us and all the other brothers and sisters. Peace.</p><p>Your brother in the Lord,<br />Hsie Tze-yuen<br />[Address omitted]</p><h2 class="head2">Dan-Ju-Wu, Chekiang Province</h2><p>Greetings to Brother X in the Lord:</p><p>Although the Lord's people were scattered in every place as the war spread, the Lord's gospel followed them into the mountains, bays, and coastal regions. Praise the Lord! I used to live in Shao-Shing, but I fled to my ancestral home (Dan-Ju-Wu) because of the war. In these few months several people have been saved through God's grace. There is now a home meeting every Lord's Day in Dan-Ju-Wu. There is also a prayer meeting every night. May God be with our work and may He also send more workers to reap His harvest. Please send six copies of The Open Door to this address.

Although we have passed through many difficulties and hardships, we have seen God's saving power in delivering us from danger. Thank and praise the Lord! The brothers and sisters returned from Hsiao-Shu to Hsie-Chun in three groups. All were safe. Eighty percent of the houses in the village were completely destroyed by fire. The houses of the believers, however, were mostly preserved by the Lord. Brother Zhang Lin-yu's house and store were burned. The whole town of Ma-Yao was destroyed. The only buildings left standing were the Presbyterian Church and the Apostolic Faith Church. Although Hsie-Chun is no longer in danger, it is not yet stable. We ask the brothers and sisters to please pray for us. Peace in the Lord.</p><p>Your brother,<br />Huang Bao-kuang</p><h2 class="head2">Jin-Hwa, Chekiang Province</h2><h2 class="head3">One</h2><p>Greetings to the brothers and sisters meeting in the Lord's name in X:</p><p>Although I have never met you, we are connected because of the Lord Jesus' precious blood, so I dare to write this letter and tell you of my news to comfort the hearts of the brothers and sisters who are concerned. I left Nanking with my mother and brother last August 25. We have been taking refuge in Jin-Hwa, Chekiang, for seven months now. We were blessed by God's great grace and are very safe. In the past few months, I have deeply felt the pain of severed fellowship with the brothers and sisters. Praise and thank our dear Father. He is with us always and everywhere. He has not left us orphans but leads us in His love. A month ago my mother and I went to stay with my aunt and uncle in Tang-Si. My uncle is a pastor in the Baptist Church there. He is a brother who loves the Lord and is regenerated with His life. We gain something every Lord's Day in the services. I received two copies of the fourth issue of The Open Door. I was very comforted to read the news of the work and the brothers and sisters in all the localities. Please continue to send two copies of every issue. I am sending X dollars for the cost of printing The Christian in the future. I am also sending X dollars in postage stamps for use in sending out The Open Door. Peace and joy in the Lord.</p><p>Your sister in the Lord,<br />Yang Wen-jeng<br />March 25<br />[Address omitted]</p><h2 class="head3">Two</h2><p>Greetings in the Lord to Brother Chou:</p><p>My mother and I have not tasted the Lord's table in the eight months since we have been here. Our hearts are really panting like deer thirsting for water. We have been earnestly asking the Father to give us a taste of His table so that we may worship God in one accord with the brothers and sisters. It seems as if the Lord has answered our cries. My brother sent a letter from Shanghai recently, saying that he wanted us to come to Shanghai. However, the road is very dangerous, and he is afraid that it will not be convenient for two women to travel without accompaniment. If this is the Lord's answer to our prayer, He will protect us for His name's sake. We have nothing to fear. We have not decided when we will leave for Shanghai. We are still praying. Thank God. My younger brother has finished college and is now working in the accounting office of Guang-Hua University in Szechuan. I have not heard any news concerning Brother Tang, and I am very worried about him. I ask the God who does not fail and loves to give grace to bless his whole family as well as the brothers and sisters in San-Chiao-Bu. May the Lord send His angels to encamp around them. How is Sister Chou Ming-hsien? Do you have any news of the Yuan sisters, An-hsi, Ruth, and Shun-ying? If you know anything about them, please tell me. May you have peace and joy.

Through The Open Door I have learned about the situation of the brothers and sisters and the condition of the churches, and feel very comforted! The region of Ping-Yang, Tai-Sun, and Fu-Ding is still very peaceful. All the works of the church continue toward the brothers and sisters and toward the Gentiles. Wenchow experienced terrible bombings. The brothers and sisters all fled to the countryside, so the church in the city became very empty. It is now gradually being recovered. Please do not worry. There are many poor brothers and sisters who experience much lack in their living. Some of the brothers in the region of Muo-Cheng, Ping-Yang, and Nan-Gang used to work in the pottery factories. The pottery industry has completely shut down because there is a blockade on shipping. As a result, these brothers have suffered the loss of their jobs. Thank the Lord. Although they are suffering, they are still relying on the Lord wholeheartedly, and they are living from day to day. This was how they lived in the past, and it is how they will live in the future. The Lord is the Alpha and the Omega. He is our only eternal trust. He is to be praised!</p><p>Your brother,<br />Chen Chin-fa<br />April 4</p><h2 class="head3">Two</h2><p>Greetings to X:</p><p>We feel so privileged to receive The Open Door, Issue Nos. 1-5. Please do not worry. The truth that Brother Nee presented in the second issue is very precious. We read it several times. We also see that the brothers are not afraid to suffer for the sake of the gospel. They dare to go into the remote regions, and we should remember them in prayer. We are sending X dollars for the printing of this publication. We hope you can send us an extra copy of future issues.

We were led by the Lord to hold a conference in Chuenchow on March 16. We thank and praise Him for the grace and leading He gave through it, and we trust Him for our future in the course we must run and the work we must accomplish. Dear brothers, we are deeply conscious of our many shortages and failures in the past and of our weak and pitiful condition in the present. Thank the Lord! His grace is sufficient for us. We can please Him through His grace. Dear brothers, please pray much for us. The work in all places in Fukien has been cared for by the Lord since the beginning of the war. The churches in Lung-Yen, Changchow, Kulangsu, Ho-Shan, Tung-An, Din-Mei, Wu-Lu, Chai-Lin, Shui-Tou, An-Hai, Ban-Ling (An-Hsi), Shi-Shee, Chuenchow, Tseng-Mao (Hwei-An), Feng-Ting, Sien-You, Pu-Tien, Han-Jiang, Yu-Si, and Fu-Ching have all been preserved. The number of saved ones has increased. The regions of Dong-Jang of Fu-Ching, Dong-Yuan of Hwei-An, Juang-Shan of An-Hsi, Ying-Du of Nan-An, and Gu-Jai of Tung-An are new fields for the gospel. We hope that the Lord will revive His work in An-Hsi, Yung-Chun, Deh-Hua, Chang-Pu, and many places in western Fukien. Our conference ended on the evening of the twenty-third. We had three mornings of fasting and prayer with the brothers and sisters of Chuenchow. We deeply believe that the Lord heard all our prayers. Glory be to Him. Peace in the Lord.</p><p>Your brothers,<br />Wang Deng-ming, Chen Ke-san, Chai Tze-chung,<br />Deng Tze-cheng, Han Jin-siu, Lan Jin-yang,<br />Wu Den-jieh, Keh Lien-min<br />March 24</p><h2 class="head3">Two</h2><p>All things really work together for good to those who love God. He is the Savior and the Creator. He opened a way for us to pioneer the gospel into the interior regions. He has begun a good work, and He will finish this work until His day. May the kingdom, authority, and glory be to God. The assembly here received X dollars of the Lord's money. We want to designate it for the use of the work in Szechuan. Please distribute it according to the Lord's leading.</p><p>Your little brothers in the assembly in Chuenchow,<br />Yang Shi-chao, Wu Ren-jieh<br />March 25<br />[Address omitted]</p><h2 class="head2">Kulangsu, Fukien Province</h2><p>Greetings to X in the Lord:</p><p>Although southern Fukien experiences tension at times, we are still at peace. The meeting in Amoy has stopped for a long time now. It has not been recovered. The meeting in Kulangsu has been preserved and continues as usual. Sister Yien-tze hurriedly returned to Pu-Tien two weeks ago because her nephew was dangerously ill and had not yet believed in the Lord. Sister Yuan-yi is still physically weak. We really need to pray for her. Peace in the Lord.</p><p>Your weak sister,<br />Chen Wan-ching<br />March 21<br />[Address omitted]</p><h2 class="head2">Wu-Yang, Honan Province</h2><p>Brothers and sisters in the Lord:</p><p>We have received every copy of The Open Door. Thank you and praise the Lord. We have been edified by it very much. Missionary Rong and Sister Kao Chui-lan returned to Hou-Ma, Shansi, on February 14. They only sent one letter from Hou-Ma to us before the roads were closed. We do not know how they are doing now. We ask the brothers and sisters in the Lord to pray earnestly for them and for the Spiritual Band. May the Lord stretch out His almighty hand to cover His children and all the co-workers who love the Lord from China and from the West. Peace.</p><p>Your little brothers,<br />Yang Sin-sheng, Chu Huai-an, Wang Hua-min<br />[Address omitted]</p><h2 class="head2">Tsingtao</h2><p>Thank the Lord! He really loves us and keeps us safe. God's grace has led us to remain in Tsingtao all the time. Three families left because the brothers lost their jobs. More than ten of the rest have also left. Brother Lee Shi-sin (Tze-jung) has not left. Brother Kao Guei-shu's family and Sister Tan's family have not left either. There are still a few brothers who cannot leave, so there are more than ten people. God protects us every night. Although we have heard people speaking negative things, we still sleep peacefully. I really worry about the brothers in northern Kiangsu. I have not heard news of them for a long time. How is southern Fukien? How is the region of Ping-Yang? We do pray for them, but we would also like to know their real condition.</p><p>Chang Tze-jieh<br />March 23</p><h2 class="head2">Chefoo</h2><p>Peace to my dear Brother X in the Lord:</p><p>The brothers in Chefoo have all been kept safe by the Lord's grace. The meetings continue as usual. We have moved the evening meetings to five o'clock, so they have not been hindered. Brother Witness is still working in Chefoo. The meetings have been really blessed recently. There are many people in every meeting. There was a baptism meeting last Lord's Day. Sixteen people were baptized, five of whom were brothers; the rest were sisters. There are still many who want to be baptized, but we feel that they are still not clear and have asked them to wait awhile. May the Lord be with us always so that we may live for Him. May the Lord protect you in peace! Greet all the brothers and sisters in Hankow.</p><p>Your brother,<br />Chao Jing-hwai<br />April 1<br />[Address omitted]</p><h2 class="head2">Tientsin</h2><p>X in the Lord:</p><p>Brother Wang (Jian-tang) has not found a job yet. Sister Feng Chang Xiu-feng entered the Hsieh-Ho Hospital in Peking a few days ago. Her illness will probably require surgery. We still must pray for her. Brother Liu Heng-teh is still in Tientsin with his original job. He comes to the meetings often. Mrs. Tang has moved to Yao-Hua-Li. The house number is 416. Mrs. Po has returned to Tientsin. Sister Dong is in Chefoo. She is engaged to Brother Chiao Fu-ya. Brother Chui Tze-fang has not recovered from his illness. Sometimes he is well, and sometimes it flares up. We still do not know what kind of sickness it is. Every week there is a fellowship meeting for the brothers and sisters. We hope to have a baptism meeting soon and hope Brother Witness Lee can come. We have invited him several times, but he does not have a clear leading before the Lord, so he has not agreed to come yet. Please remember the brothers and sisters here in your prayer. May God cause us to pick up the responsibility for the assembly before Him in a good way. May we further the gospel in one accord. May we stand in the position that the overcomers should stand in on the earth today. Thank God for showing us that everything of ourselves is foolish and unclean. If it were not for the Lord's love, when could we ever be counted worthy to come before God? May the Lord have pity on us and grace us to learn the proper lessons. We do not want to remain in the same "grade" again and again. Please greet all the brothers and sisters that I know. Peace in the Lord.</p><p>Lin Chang Pin-jeng<br />April 4<br />[Address omitted]</p><h2 class="head2">Shensi Province</h2><p>Brother You-sheng:</p><p>Thank God for always leading me. Although I have passed through dangers, I have not been harmed. Since God cares for me every minute, I am always at peace, and my affairs prosper. I am very concerned about the news concerning Brother Tang and the other brothers and sisters. I really hope to learn about their news and situation! I have been in Shensi for almost three months. I was not busy for the first two months. There is a denomination here. Its beliefs are very pure, so I go there often to meet and talk with the people. When I first came to this hospital, I was the only believer. God gave me the boldness several times to testify among the people. There are now more than ten believers. There is a meeting every Lord's Day in my office. There is also a gospel meeting every Thursday for the patients. God has blessed His work in this hospital. I really thank Him! I only have the first issue of The Open Door. I did not receive any of the rest. May we remember each other in prayer. I hope we can see one another soon. May God lead us. Please greet the brothers and sisters in Hankow for me.</p><p>Your brother in the Lord,<br />Ching-hua<br />February 8<br />[Address omitted]</p><h2 class="head2">Bin-Jou, Shensi Province</h2><p>Greetings to my brother in the Lord, X:</p><p>I received The Open Door and was happy to see some news of brothers that I know, as well as the condition of the work. I was called by the Lord two years ago, but because of my personal situation, I was slow to submit. I did not feel peaceful to remain in my work, but whenever I preached the gospel, my heart was filled with joy. I came to Pinchow to work in the government's Highway Engineering Office. I wanted to quit twice to go preach the gospel, but I was not bold enough to quit and work for the Lord. I often prayed to the Lord and debated with Him, saying, "If You do not want me to work, take away my job. I am not praying to submit to You. If You want me to do something, You do it. If You do not want me to do something, hinder me. Lead me according to Your will." To my surprise the construction project was changed a few days later. They stopped paving the road, so my job was terminated. At the time I planned to go to Hankow via Ch'eng-tu. When I got to Brother Tze-sien's place, I intended to spend some time with the brothers in the Lord and be edified, as well as to learn some hymns and to understand more of the Bible, after which I would begin my work for the Lord. Otherwise, I felt that I would not be worthy to work for the Lord. Later I felt in my heart that I should stay in Bin-Jou for two weeks because some at the Gospel Chapel wanted me to stay. (Last year when I arrived in Bin-Jou, the American, Pastor Nieh, returned to his country, and I was called upon to help them in their meetings many times.) I temporarily moved into the Gospel Chapel. A few days later the order came to prepare for the resumption of the construction project, and I had to stay for awhile. Less than two weeks later, another order came to stop the work again. They wanted to transfer me to Bao-Ji to work on a bridge. The people at the Gospel Chapel cried aloud and tried to keep me there, so I prayed all night with four believers. At three in the morning, the Lord told me, "If you are clear about giving up your work, tell them that you are quitting and come out quickly." I then decided to not work any longer, and the next day I quit my job. On the third day after I came to the Gospel Chapel, Sister Chang Sin-deh and Sister Tsou Hwei-deh received the outpouring of the Holy Spirit. Chu Cheng-deh and Kuo Ming-deh received the outpouring of the Holy Spirit next. The tongues, prophecies, and spiritual songs which they uttered all had clear translations.</p><p>With regard to the few people in the Gospel Chapel in Bin-Jou, other places had given them the name of Ice-Jou [homonyms in Chinese]. This was an exaggerated way of saying that they were cold to the point of being below zero degrees. The condition of the last few days and the Lord's blessing have proven that through one as humble, useless, foolish, and immature as I, the Lord's church has been helped. Brothers and sisters, please pray for me and the church in Bin-Jou. I know that my condition and my work in the Lord are something that Brother Jung-jieh, Brother Tze-sien, and Brother Shou-ling would want to know about. I have just started walking in the Lord's way and am very immature, so I ask the brothers and sisters for advice to prevent me from taking the wrong way. I would like you to write to me. With respect to the work of the Holy Spirit, I believe that tongue-speaking is something outward. It is more important to be filled inwardly in the aspect of life. The filling of the Holy Spirit includes speaking in tongues, but those who speak in tongues do not always have the inward filling of the Holy Spirit. If I am wrong, please instruct me. Peace in the Lord and greetings to all the brothers and sisters in the Lord.</p><p>Your little brother in the Lord,<br />Chang Kuang-tai<br />April 10<br />[Address omitted]</p><h2 class="head2">Nan-ch'ang, Kiangsi Province</h2><p>Dear Brother X in the Lord:</p><p>We have not seen each other since we parted in Nanking. I really miss you in my heart. Thank the Lord. Although we are physically separated, the fellowship of God cannot be broken. We have been in Nan-ch'ang for four months. Our work is not busy, and we sometimes preach the gospel to the wounded soldiers. Although there is not much fruit, the Lord's word is never in vain. Some have already believed seriously. I know that I am not faithful enough to the Lord. I have let many good opportunities slip away. May God have mercy on me that I would be diligent and zealous for Him. We did not have any meetings until January 16 when the brothers and sisters here met together. We have continued meeting since that date. We have been very encouraged because God has so richly graced us. We sing hymns, pray, exhort, testify and study the Bible together. Thank God for His leading and blessing; we can receive His grace and care at any time and at any place. Sister Chou Yi-mei, Sister Pan Hsueh-mei, and Brother Yu Wei-liang of Chi-Loo University, Shantung, attend the meetings. Brother Chang Jao-tung, Brother Ma Lung-rue, and Brother Hsiao Wen-bing of the Shanghai Medical School also come. Brother Yu Mong-ling, Brother Lin Sung-nien, and Sister Min Guo-jun are in the meetings also. Our unsaved friends sometimes attend too.</p><p>There is one recent occurrence that is worthy of report. Sister Chou's elder brother was a zealous believer at one time, but he drifted away from God because of his environment and situation in recent years. In the beginning he never came to the meetings, but a month ago, Brother Chang prayed for him for quite awhile. We also remembered him in our prayers. He has returned to the Father through God's power and love. Praise God! When a prodigal son returns, even the angels rejoice. We really need the prayers of the brothers and sisters to strengthen us to stand firm before God until the Prince of Peace returns. We mention you constantly in our prayers and ask God to grant you special care. We received news from Shanghai that the meeting was continuing as usual in the hospital. May God bless them there. Dr. Stearn has resigned from the Red Cross Hospital and has taken another job. Do you have any news from Brother Tang Shou-ling? Please greet Brother Liu Kwo-jieh. Greet all the other brothers and sisters in the Lord. Peace in the Lord.</p><p>Your little brother in the Lord,<br />Yu Nan-geng<br />March 27<br />[Address omitted]</p><h2 class="head2">Nan-ning, Kwangsi Province</h2><p>In these days, so much has happened, but our God is faithful. What God Himself has ordained, no one can change. Therefore, even though we passed through the darkest, stormiest days, the victorious Lord still led us to this place. (We arrived in the afternoon of March 28.) The situation here is that the region from Nan-ning to Tsen-Nan-Guan belongs to us. Within this area there are three or four clinics. Sisters Chou and Lee went to work in Yi-Kou on the thirtieth. I will probably stay in the main clinic in Nan-ning. In the future it is possible that I will go away briefly for short periods. These two sisters will be mobile. I will still go to Siang-Tan tomorrow to return some articles. Then I will return to Nan-ning after a few days. I will report to you after I return.</p><p>The weak one in the Lord,<br />Chien Sin-sien<br />April 2<br />[Address omitted]</p><h2 class="head2">Ch'ang-sha, Hunan Province</h2><p>Dear Brother X in the Lord:</p><p>My uncle (Liu Jing-si) has already arrived in Kuei-yang. (He arrived on March 31.) Thank the Lord! The Kuei-yang Hospital Admissions Department gave my uncle a job. My aunt and uncle left for Ch'ang-Teh on March 12. They waited two weeks in Ch'ang-Teh for a bus. On the twenty-sixth, they were able to buy direct tickets to Kuei-yang. God's arrangements are too marvelous! Thank Him! The bus from Ch'ang-sha to Ch'ang-Teh on the twenty-fifth (which was scheduled to go directly to Kuei-yang) had only four passengers. It stopped for the night in Ch'ang-Teh because the bus broke down, so my uncle and aunt were able to get tickets the next day. They had too much luggage, and the Highway Department was not going to allow them to take it all, but the four passengers had so little luggage that my aunt and uncle were allowed to take all of theirs. We really praise the Lord because He constantly graces His children. Kuo-Siang, Mei-jen, and Yu-jen are all safe. Please do not worry. Peace in the Lord.</p><p>Your brother in the Lord,<br />Chu-fei<br />April 7<br />[Address omitted]</p><h2 class="head2">Chungking, Szechuan Province</h2><h2 class="head3">One</h2><p>Dear X in the Lord:</p><p>We have received every issue of The Open Door. We thank the Lord that He has established you in this work. This type of publication is necessary now. Thank the Lord for giving it to us. We are sending X dollars, X dimes, and X cents for use toward the cost of printing. It is a small amount, but it represents our oneness with you. May the Lord bless your work more deeply. May the Lord be with you always. Amen. Peace in the Lord!</p><p>Representing all the brothers and sisters in the church in Chungking,</p><p>Your brothers,<br />Lee Yun-sien, Tien Bi-sin, Liu Kuo-hwa<br />April 25<br />[Address omitted]</p><h2 class="head3">Two</h2><p>Greetings to X in the Lord:</p><p>I received The Open Door twice and read both issues. Thank and praise the Lord. He really showed me that He is calling His children to do His holy work. This calling is one throughout the entire country. It is progressing by the inspiration of the Holy Spirit, and it is real. In addition to praying for the work, may the brothers and sisters in each locality be like the ones on whose behalf Paul gave thanks and whom Paul exhorted and comforted (see 1 Cor. 15:57-58). Amen!</p><p>The Lord's little worker,<br />Lo Jen-shuan<br />April 20<br />[Address omitted]</p><h2 class="head2">Kuei-yang, Kweichow Province</h2><h2 class="head3">One</h2><p>Brother in the Lord, Yu-zhi:</p><p>There are too few people in Kweichow for the Lord's work. Kuei-yang only has one China Inland Mission. The pastor is more than seventy years old. Truthfully, Kuei-yang does not have one worker who really preaches the gospel. The Lord has prepared the meeting place for you to preach the gospel. May the Lord's Spirit lead you to come to Kweichow.</p><p>Your brother in the Lord,<br />Chen Heng-chiu<br />April 1<br />[Address omitted]</p><h2 class="head3">Two</h2><p>If your work is not finished, you must, of course, continue until you arrive at a goal. If you could come in May, that would be good. Pastor Zhia Yu-ming will come to preach the gospel in Kuei-yang. It will probably be in April or May. The general situation in Kuei-yang is as follows: It has the highest standard of living in China, especially in the daily necessities. Food and lodging cost about as much as in Nanking and Shanghai. The people are all filled with the sins of a big city, but there are not as many places for them to go to sin. The city is too small for it. (The population is a little more than one hundred thousand.) The weather is mild but very rainy. There can also be great changes in temperature. There is only a Gospel Chapel from the China Inland Mission in the city. (There are also two Catholic churches.) Its worship service has forty-five people at the most. Ordinary meetings have anywhere from a few to twenty in attendance. These are all the Christians in Kuei-yang. However, they all love the Lord. Therefore, the offering every week is more than X dollars. In comparison with some localities in other provinces, where the number of people is in the hundreds but the collection is only a few dollars, this is really much better, isn't it? There are two families where the entire household has believed in the Lord. They are the Yeh family and the Cheng family. Our church recently rented a large building with three floors on a major street. It is very suitable for conferences. I think that the Lord has prepared a place for you to work. The building we rented is like the one in Kuling. It can be used for preaching the gospel and as a bookstore. Unfortunately, we do not have any books to put out. If you have books, please bring them or send them. Please write to the Shanghai Gospel Book Room and ask them to send a large quantity to sell. What do you think about this? I am now working in the Department of Agricultural Reform in Kweichow. May the grace of the Lord be with you always.</p><p>Your brother in the Lord,<br />Heng-chiu<br />April 6</p><h2 class="head2">From Chungking to Kuei-yang</h2><p>Beloved sisters in the Lord, Miss Lee, Mrs. Yuan, and Miss Chang:</p><p>Thank the Father that I arrived safely. Please do not worry. We left on the thirtieth and spent three days on the road. Although we passed through danger several times, I did not feel at all afraid, because God was with me. The road we took was in the steep, high mountains. On the second day, we were winding around the highest, biggest mountain. We made twenty-four turns. We traveled for two hours before we got around this mountain. There were small villages along the way where we could eat and sleep. The first night we slept in the County Girls' School in Chi-Jiang County. The principal welcomed us. The hospitality was good. However, the second night was very different. There were no houses to take lodging in, and the bus got stuck in a hole, so we were in danger. Fortunately, there were small rocks in the mud that held the wheels, or many people on the bus would have been killed or injured. Thank and praise God. How great is the length, breadth, height, and depth of God's love! We are weak and very immature children in the Lord. There is not much spiritual growth in me. I desire and pursue all wisdom and knowledge in the spirit. I deeply hope that the sisters in the Lord will help me that I may be perfected. When I think of the testimonies that I heard in Chungking and the two times I dined together with you at the Lord's table, my heart is extremely happy. When will Sister Lee and Sister Chang come to Kweichow? May God lead you. If you can come soon, we will be happier. Peace in the Lord.</p><p>Your weak sister in the Lord,<br />Chang Chiung-sien<br />April 2, in Kuei-yang</p><h2 class="head2">K'un-ming, Yunnan Province</h2><p>Brother Lin Yau-huei has been transferred to Wu-Chow. He left K'un-ming on the tenth of this month. We had hoped that Brother Lin would not be transferred, because there are not many responsible brothers in K'un-ming. However, God's will is higher than man's will. We deeply believe that God wants to raise up His testimony in Wu-Chow through Brother Lin and Brother Muo Hue-chen. Therefore, we happily said, "Amen!" Brother Hu Shuan-ming (from Lung-Si, Fukien, who works in Parliament) arrived in Chungking on the sixteenth of this month. He is a good brother. We hope that he can be edified much with the brothers and sisters in Chungking. Brother Lee Shiang-chen and Sister Hsiao Ai-kuang arrived in K'un-ming recently from Ch'ang-sha. They are both students at National Southwest University. Brother Chen Ho-seng in Ho-Kou married Miss Liang in March. They are serving the believers who travel through Ho-Kou. They are exceptionally diligent. May God Himself repay the love they have shown for His name's sake. I heard that Brother Yin Tzu-lan and his family and Brother Chou Hung-bao left Hong Kong on the nineteenth for K'un-ming. I have already rented a very spacious house for Brother Yin. (The rent is a little high.) I deeply believe that God prepared this house for our brother. Thank the Father for manifesting evidence that He graces His children. The S. W. University's Engineering College was originally going to be in Mong-Tze but has suddenly been changed to K'un-ming. Therefore, Brother Yin was able to come. I believe that God has His good will in causing Brother Yin to come to K'un-ming.</p><p>The assembly here has been blessed by God very much. Seventeen brothers and sisters were baptized into the Lord's name in March. Not long afterwards, more brothers and sisters wanted to be baptized. The meetings have been preserved by God since Brother Wei and Brother Chen went to Ku-Jiu. They are progressing day by day. I hope that God will give a great revival to the church in K'un-ming so that more saved ones will be added to His church. The fourth prayer request published in the fifth issue of The Open Door concerning Sister Wang Juh-ching has been answered. God has opened a way for her to be the head nurse in the K'un-ming Tung-Ren Hospital. Sister Chang Jing-shia can also work permanently at the Hwei-Dian Hospital. Brother Chang Jing-yuen follows the Lord's leading and sometimes goes into the neighboring villages to preach the gospel.</p><p>Your little brother in the Lord,<br />Huang Tsung<br />April 20<br />[Address omitted]</p><h2 class="head2">Surabaya, Southeast Asia</h2><p>Dear brothers and sisters in the Lord:</p><p>May the grace and peace of God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ be with you. Amen. The Lord's coming is near. The churches in all the localities are being revived. The Lord has also begun a good work in all the localities of Southeast Asia. The church in Surabaya was very desolate, but thank the Lord for His marvelous grace; He is not a respecter of persons. He gathered His children here like a mother hen gathers her chicks under her wings. The Lord has given us a place to remember Him here. However, most of the brothers and sisters are very immature. They really need to be fed with spiritual milk. We are newborn children and, of course, we love and desire milk. May the Lord give us the pure spiritual milk that our spiritual life may grow. We have four brothers and three sisters here. There is a prayer meeting every Saturday evening. Every Lord's Day morning we have a meeting to remember the Lord. We have not started to break the bread. We meet freely with the brothers and sisters together because our number is so small. If there were more people, we could not meet like this because we do not have a name or an organization. We would be unable to continue. (Please read chapters five and ten of The Normal Christian Church Life carefully. You will not have any problems&mdash;Editor.) Brothers and sisters, we would like you to pray much for the work which has been newly raised up. Please pray also for the immature believers here. We bless you with peace.</p><p>Your little brothers in the Lord,<br />Chen En-shen, Tai Hsi-shung,<br />Wang Fen-hsing, Wang Kuang-ze<br />March 17<br />[Address omitted]</p><h2 class="head1">MISCELLANEOUS NEWS</h2><p>Sister Tang Mei-lih sent a letter from Shanghai on April 11 saying that Sister Lee Shi Sai-ho fell out of a car and was injured.

It cannot be sent to most of the localities in Kiangsu and Chekiang. Many readers have moved but have not notified us. Of course, we must bear some responsibility in this respect because The Christian is not published on schedule many times, and it is easy for the readers to forget.

All letters concerning the churches are published in the column "News of the Churches."</p><p>(2) Beginning with this issue, we are publishing a translation concerning the principles of service. We are in a time of emergency, and the mail is often blocked. We are doing our best to put all the news into the publication, because many news items need to get to the readers in a timely manner. The editor is aware of the increase in the number of pages, but we feel that it is best if the brothers and sisters can learn all the news from every locality as early as possible.</p><p>(3) Some of the letters are very ordinary. The reason we did not delete them is that we can see how God graces our brothers and sisters. They also bring in a kind of closeness. In one letter there was a request to bring an iron. The editor was planning to delete the sentence, when she suddenly thought about the word in 2 Timothy 4:13: "The cloak which I left in Troas with Carpus, bring when you come." We decided to keep the sentence about the iron. Practical daily events are not altogether unspiritual. If it is a spontaneous, honest letter, does it not add a little of the flavor of the house of God?</p><p>(4) One brother may be concerned about something that another brother is not interested in at all. Another brother's concern may mean nothing to a third brother. Therefore, the editor can only objectively think about all sides and do her best to enable the brothers and sisters to communicate their news with each other. Our past experience shows that the brothers and sisters have been comforted by this publication. Even the editor has learned about many brothers and sisters whom she has never seen before and has begun to care for them, too. Even some brothers who had questions about us because of rumors that they had heard have had their misunderstandings resolved through this publication. Therefore, the editor dares not restrict the news of the churches with boundaries of locality or truth. We only hope that through the letters from every place, love and oneness in Christ can be expressed.</p><p>(5) In the news of the work, there are naturally many paragraphs which are in the nature of reports. The editors would like to quote a few sentences from The Normal Christian Church Life:</p><p class="indent1">The Bible shows us that it is not only permissible, but necessary, to give reports of the work to those who pray for us and are in one accord with us. However, reports are not advertisements, so they should not be in the nature of advertisements. It is precious to give the children of God reports of messages and other news. However, if the nature of the report has been corrupted with a motive, it is not acceptable to God. On the other hand, there is no example among the apostles of unnatural reticence or soulish seclusiveness of a better-than-you-are sort among God's children. It is all a matter of motive. All things are pure to the pure. Nothing is pure to the impure. [Translator's Note: The preceding paragraph is based on the Chinese edition of The Normal Christian Church Life.]</p><p>Therefore, we hope that the motive of those who send in reports and the attitude of those who receive them are both pleasing to God.</p><p>(6) The many difficulties, needs, and requests for prayer are not intended to be given to every reader as a burden. A heart of love feels no burden. "For if the eagerness is there, it is acceptable according to whatever one has, not according to what he does not have" (2 Cor. 8:12). Therefore, it is not a question of doing or not doing something. It is a matter of having the heart. If one does not have the heart, it will not be beneficial even if one does it. If one has the heart, one prayer, one small offering, or one drop of sympathy can strengthen, comfort, and encourage others.</p><p>(7) The editors would like to speak a word of mutual exhortation to the co-workers. Our basis for our dealings with any person or matter should be love. We should reject our own "self." We should break our own "heart." We often shout the slogan of the cross, but it is better to bear the mark of the cross in our body. Not all the co-workers used by God are our co-workers by the narrowest definition. However, when we contact them, if we do not have the heart to receive instructions from them, we should at least have a heart of blessing toward them and ask God to bless them. We are merely using the light of the truth to serve the churches. We do not want to overstep the boundary which God has given us and trample on another's work. If one is humble and considers others stronger than himself, it will be easy for him to receive benefit from others.</p><p>(8) Finally, this issue was prepared and edited during travels. The final copy is then sent to Hankow for printing. The punctuation marks are often misread by the print shop, but we cannot correct every error.

May the Lord Himself lead you. What is the situation in my home county of Ching-Shih County, Tsen Hai? Is there an assembly there? Are there co-workers and brothers there?

There has been a Bible study every morning except on the Lord's Day since the fourth of the month. We are studying the important points of the gospel. It is for the young people. We have had more than ten meetings. We probably need to continue. Brother Lee Bih passed through Chefoo on his way back to Tientsin on the tenth of the month. I met with him. At that time I told him that, if the Lord allowed, I would go to Tientsin at the beginning of May. I do not know how the Lord will arrange the environment. Please pray for me! I received a letter at the beginning of the month from the Baptist Church in Huang County asking me to hold a conference there. I was not able to go because I had already scheduled the Bible study meetings.</p><p>Your little brother,<br />Witness<br />April 21<br />[Address omitted]</p><h2 class="head2">The Travels of Brother Chang Tze-jieh, Tsingtao, Shantung Province</h2><p>I have been out working for more than a month. I have been in five places and have stayed for at least four days in each place. Thank the Lord! There was no frustration in all the places we went. The messages which I preached were mostly about knowing God's truth. People have been edified indirectly through the tense environment. The brothers and sisters in Gao-Mi, Ching-Jou, Lin-Ti, Guang-Rao, and Tsinan are all safe. They have not backslidden. On the contrary, they are working more zealously and looking for the Lord to come quickly. Of the brothers in Tsingtao, only Brother Hsu Xiao-feng has gone to Shanghai, and Brother Wang Hung-kai has gone to Wen-Deng. The number in the meetings has not decreased. There are also a few newly saved ones. One is very stable. Perhaps God will want him to bear responsibility in the future. I might go to Chefoo. I hope to receive some help there. God has revealed Christ on the cross to me twice, so I wept twice. If the Lord wants me to go to Sikang, I can only submit to Him. According to the flesh, I hate to leave Shantung, especially Tsingtao. May the Lord give me the grace to completely obey and walk in His will.</p><p>Your brother in the Lord,<br />Tze-jieh<br />May 5<br />[Address omitted]</p><h2 class="head2">Meeting of a Few Co-Workers in Northern Kiangsu</h2><p>We trust by the Lord that you continually remember us and are concerned about our situation before God our Father. For this reason, we are writing this letter to tell you about the matters concerning us so that your hearts may receive comfort and joy. The God who bears our burdens has heard our prayers and answered the prayers of His children. Glory to Him forever and ever! Amen.</p><p>In the region north of the Yangtze River, the churches of God seem to be boats on the sea. In the past few years many storms have suddenly arisen, and the churches have almost been covered by the waves. We have had failures, weaknesses, foolishness, and unfaithfulness in these situations. However, God allows these things to happen for His purpose. "We know that all things work together for good to those who love God." If there were no storms, how could our weaknesses be exposed? How could the Lord's ability to rebuke the wind and the waves be manifested without a storm? Therefore, we praise the Lord for allowing these things to happen to us. We hoped that the co-workers could come together for fellowship. Thank the Lord! We did not plan for it, but He gathered us together in Yi-Lin on April 6. We met together that evening. The Lord was with us. He caused us to remember the truth we received in 1928. It was all the Lord's grace. At the same time, He showed us that we each come short of the glory of God. If we do not put ourselves aside, if we do not keep the flesh and the enemy from having an inch of room in us, it will be difficult for the Lord to accomplish His work in northern Kiangsu. Thank the Lord. He is victorious. He overcame not only the enemy but also us. On the next morning, we met again. The Lord told us to go out together in one accord to visit the churches in each locality. Thank God. He gave us a heart of oneness through the Holy Spirit. Please pray for us and ask the Lord to preserve us until He comes.</p><p>Your brothers,<br />Ji Yung-tung, Chiu Ri-jien, Wu Wei<br />April 19<br />[Address omitted]</p><h2 class="head2">The Revival Work, Shanghai</h2><h2 class="head3">One</h2><p>God Himself is working among us as never before. (This is in reference to our locality.) Two weeks ago the women's gospel meeting was changed from Tuesday afternoon to Saturday afternoon. One reason for the change was that there were not enough sisters to care for the many sinners who came on an individual basis, and more sisters could get off work to help on Saturday. The other reason was that we had hoped to use this opportunity to revive the sisters and to bring out what they have so that they will not become stagnant in their growth. Thank the Lord. After making this change, we were blessed by the Lord in two aspects. The number of saved sinners increases daily. The sisters are also involved more with the individual work. There are about two hundred in every meeting. We hope that the gospel preaching will soon be taken care of completely by the local sisters so that they do not have to look to the workers for the work. (We feel that a local church which relies only on the workers, without the local saints rising up, is just an empty shell.) Presently, we ask the sisters who have made a breakthrough with God to do the preaching first. Although not everyone can preach the truth of the gospel, everyone should be able to tell about the effect of the gospel on them. Thank the Lord. He has done a deep work in people's hearts. The sisters realize that this is a business of God's house. Some volunteer to give themselves to the Lord. Others are spending their money for the souls of sinners. Some readily agree when they are asked to speak. This wonderful condition really causes us to say, "Hallelujah." The sisters' meeting has been changed to Wednesday afternoon at four-thirty. Because the work of those who pray privately has increased, God has manifested His marvelous grace among us all. Presently, we read the Bible and pray every Wednesday in the meeting. We are reading (not expounding) the Gospel of John. We are paying special attention to the matters concerning the Lord Jesus. Thank the Lord. He has given us much light. We speak to one another about what we have seen and gained. In this way we build up one another. About two hundred people come to that meeting. Every time we meet, more people come. Twenty-one sisters and seven brothers were baptized tonight. The Lord's Day morning message meeting is so crowded that all the seats are filled, and there is no room for standing. There are many who come in and then turn around and walk out. Last Lord's Day we changed the time of the Lord's table meeting to three o'clock in the afternoon. (It was inconvenient for the sisters to come to a meeting at night.) We might have three places with table meetings soon.</p><p>Miao Yun-chun<br />May 6<br />[Address omitted]</p><h2 class="head3">Two</h2><p>The revival among the sisters is continuing. The condition is really good. Many people have been raised up to take responsibility for the work of prayer. There are many small prayer groups. Everyone brings more into the group, and the revival keeps spreading. The local sisters are responsible for the Saturday gospel meeting. Sometimes they ask us for help. God has raised up evangelists among them. It is marvelous the way sinners are saved. One very ordinary sentence causes people to repent and believe. God has used the sisters' daily conversation to bring others to Him and has worked through their testimonies. Sick people have been healed. Many sisters have seen their place of service in the house of God. They are all in one accord for the furtherance of the gospel. Some do individual work, while others do visitation work. Some spend more time in prayer. Some donate their money and their services for the Lord. Some invite friends for dinner. Some bring people to the gospel meetings. Viewing all of these, it really fills our hearts with praise to the Lord!</p><p>Everyone feels that the time is near. What we do today cannot make up for any loss in the past. This is why we must treasure the present all the more. It is as if God has placed the same heart in each one of us. Everyone is prepared to meet God. This condition could not have been brought about by anyone except God Himself. I really hope that I will not hinder His work of revival. We really need to continue to pray that He would work freely without human limitations. May all the glory be to Him!</p><p>Tso Fu-ru<br />May 10<br />[Address omitted]</p><h2 class="head2">The Sha-Di Region of Shao-Shin,<br />Chekiang Province</h2><p>I have been through San-Tai-Chiao, San-Cha-Dai, Tou-Peng, and Kan-Shan in the Sha-Di region during the past month. Everywhere I witnessed the Lord's work. What I did was merely receive His grace. Praise the Lord! The local church in Wan-An-Chiao of the southern part of Sha-Di in Shao-Shin has really been blessed by the Lord. The numbers continue to increase. There is no room in the meeting place. They have rented two bungalows in the neighboring locality of Dang-Shan-Wan. They had a conference on April 3-4. They invited me to take care of the speaking. Brother Fei Chang-bao preached the gospel. There were almost seven hundred people listening to the gospel. The atmosphere was good. Their ordinary meetings are very much according to the principles outlined in The Normal Christian Church Life. This shows that the Lord's anointing has been teaching them in all things.</p><p>When there is not a conference, the number of people who come to hear the messages is more than one hundred. Most are received in Wan-An-Chiao. After the conference in Dang-Shan-Wan, there was a conference on the sixteenth and seventeenth in the locality of Twelfth Dai. Brother Kao Jing-fu, Brother Kao Chi-luh, Brother Fei Chang-bao, and I were responsible for the messages. Approximately six hundred people attended the conference. By the grace of the Lord the audience was edified, and the speakers were edified even more. I have been home recently. In the beginning of May there will be a conference for a few days in Si-Shing. I was invited to be one of the speakers. May the Lord have the authority in me that I would be more useful in His hand.</p><p>Your brother,<br />Shan Kai-fen<br />April 20<br />[Address omitted]</p><h2 class="head2">Villages in Tai-Shun, Chekiang Province</h2><p>The entire county of Tai-Shun has about two hundred villages. It is divided into four regions. The whole area is remote and mountainous. Transportation is very inconvenient. The work is very difficult, so only a little more than forty localities have established churches. In the past few years no one has been raised up to preach the gospel; therefore, no new local churches have been established. Thank the Lord! On the ninth day of the Chinese New Year, there was a meeting in Hsia-Dong-Si to discuss the gospel work. Some brothers were raised up to accompany Brother Lee Shu-ren of Ping-Yang. They left from Shi-Si on January 30 and preached the gospel in Region Three for more than twenty days. They preached in twelve villages. During the day they preached the gospel door to door and passed out tracts. In the evening they borrowed a house, gathered an audience, and announced the gospel. Many received the truth. Every evening they spoke to audiences of one, two, and even three hundred people. They were very orderly and serious. Praise the Lord! Some brothers have decided to go to the area around San-Men-Yang in Region Four to begin preaching the gospel. We look to the Lord for His leading. Please pray for us much.</p><p>Your little, weak brother,<br />Wang You-gao<br />Twenty-second day of the third month</p><h2 class="head2">Tzi-Liu-Jing, Szechuan Province</h2><p>There will be a few days of gospel meetings in the auditorium of the Ren-Ji Hospital starting May 19. There may be a few days of Bible study meetings afterwards. We work in the schools and in the homes during the day. In the future we will preach the gospel to the miners and in the markets. The door for the work is open wide. We deeply believe that God wants to work.</p><p>Chang Yu-zhi<br />May 18</p><h2 class="head2">Shi-Ping, Yunnan Province</h2><p>To the brothers and sisters in the Lord who are co-workers:</p><p>We would like to tell the brothers and sisters all that God has done through us according to the pattern of the apostles (Acts 14:27; 21:19). We would also like to tell how God opened the door of the gospel for us. First, we give all the glory to God. Second, we hope the brothers and sisters would know how to pray for us. Third, we want to let the brothers and sisters who are concerned about the work in the remote areas know where we have been and the condition of the work. We left Ku-Jiu on the eighteenth of last month and were led by the Lord to arrive safely in Shi-Ping. We had an edification conference for the brothers and sisters from the evening of the twentieth to the evening of the twenty-seventh. The attendants in the meetings were mainly sisters. (This is because there are only four or five brothers here, with many times that number of sisters.) Most of the people in the meeting cannot read, except for the students. It was slightly difficult. However, the Lord brought us through. It seemed that most of the audience received the word. May God do a deeper work within them that they may gain the life of Christ more richly. We went to the streets beside all the city gates every afternoon from the twenty-first to the twenty-fourth to preach the gospel outdoors. The atmosphere was not very open. They have never welcomed Christianity. It was God's grace that we could openly bring the gospel to them. We borrowed the meeting hall for three gospel meetings on the afternoons of the twenty-fifth to the twenty-seventh. The brothers and sisters brought their friends and relatives to hear the gospel. We also saw God working. Some declared their faith in the Lord during the meeting. May the Lord gain them that they may not just be saved but may pay the price to walk in the way of victory to glorify the Lord's name. Amen!</p><p>The director of a certain newspaper was touched by the gospel he heard on the street. He made a special trip to visit us, and we had a long conversation with him. We also gave him some books on salvation. He later expressed that he had completely received the Lord. He is now reading the Bible and is coming to hear the messages. On the morning of the twenty-ninth, Brother K. H. Weigh and Brother Lin Kuang-tsao went to Lin-An and preached the gospel outdoors at the city gates and at every busy place in the city. Thank the Lord. Some people received the gospel on the spot. Some people were coming to the city from the countryside and had an excellent opportunity to hear the gospel. During the last gospel gathering, the Lord made a marvelous arrangement, and we met a brother in the Lord. When he saw us, he was happy to invite us into his home to stay there temporarily. Because the next day was the Lord's Day and we had a burden to hurry back to Shi-Ping, we did not accept his invitation. The Lord has begun a work in Lin-An. If He allows, Brother Lin will soon go there to continue preaching the gospel. Brother Weigh and Brother Chen Hsi-wen will leave tomorrow and go first to Mong-Tze and then to Kai-Yuan. Finally, they will go into K'un-ming. Brother Lin Kuang-tsao will continue to work in this region. He feels that the harvest is great and the workers few. He is often conscious of his inability and loneliness. May the Lord send one from among the co-workers with a burden for the gospel to the remote regions who will come to Shi-Ping and work with Brother Lin Kuang-tsao in all the localities in southern Yunnan. Brother Kuang-tsao feels that there is a desperate cry from this region and hopes that all the brothers and sisters will bear the responsibility to pray. In the church in Shi-Ping the majority of the brothers and sisters know that they must learn to follow the Lord and not look to man. The work that we have just finished needs your prayer as a follow-up. May the Lord's rich grace and great love be with you. Amen.</p><p>Your brothers,<br />K. H.

I went south to Yen-Ping on the fifth of this month. I stayed for a week and fellowshipped with the sisters. On the twelfth I took a steamboat for nine and a half hours to Hung-Shan near Foochow. Thank the Lord for giving me a good opportunity to testify for Him to my family, relatives, and neighbors. We had a total of five days of meetings. I spoke nine times and finished only this afternoon. May the Lord cause these word-seeds to fall into the soil of good hearts that they may grow and bear fruit to the glory of the Lord's name. Amen. I have been away from Fukien for four years. On the trip home I have done my best to visit the brothers and sisters in the Lord. My heart is very happy. Tomorrow I will go to Yung T'ai. I plan to go to Min-Ching at the end of the month. If the Lord is willing, I will then go north to Xia-Yang, Yang-Kou, Shun-Chang, and Shao-Wu. Please help me with your prayers. Thank the Lord. I am well and am very interested in the work. I am always learning some lessons. These experiences will teach me more about how I must serve the Lord in eternity. Shao-yun and Chia-en continue their studies as usual. Although I travel from place to place, they are all safe under the Father's care, so I do not have any distractions. Praise the Lord! Peace in the Lord.</p><p>Your sister,<br />Liao Ong Yu-bing<br />April 22<br />[Address omitted]</p><h2 class="head2">Taishan, Kwangtung Province</h2><h2 class="head3">One</h2><p>On March 24 God the Father led senior Mrs. Nee, Mrs. Tseng Wen Feng-chi, Sister Lei Wei-rong, and me to leave Hong Kong. We traveled safely the entire way to Taishan. The day after we arrived, we prayed, and God gave us the word in Joshua 5:14: "As the Captain of Jehovah's army...I now come." Thank the Lord! He was the captain of the ten-day conference. There was a prayer meeting and edification meeting every morning from March 17 to April 5. Senior Mrs. Nee was the main speaker. The Holy Spirit worked every day. Mrs. Nee worked in Taishan for seventeen days. She and Sister Wei-rong then went to Hong Kong on the eleventh. Mrs. Tseng and I are staying temporarily for the work. We do not know when we will go. May you remember us often before the throne.</p><p>Your sister in the Lord, Lin Wei-shi<br />[Address omitted]</p><h2 class="head3">Two</h2><p>Last month the Lord led Mrs. Nee Wen-shiu (senior Mrs. Nee) to Taishan. The Lord used her greatly to work in Taishan. Spiritual truths were released through her. Every day cold sisters were revived. The Holy Spirit was poured out every day. One elderly sister, Mrs. Chen, had a hunchback and walked with difficulty. Mrs. Nee prayed for her, and she became straight immediately. This was really a great miracle. We should give glory to God. Mrs. Tan, who did not know how to read, can now read some characters and has learned to sing some hymns. Mrs. Lin, who had tuberculosis, is now completely healed. Several others were healed as well. God used miracles and wonders in Taishan to prove His power and strength. The name of the Lord Jesus was exalted and sinners repented during this time of gospel preaching. The Lord Himself did everything. Glory be to Him!</p><p>Your sister, Lei Wei-rong<br />April 19<br />[Address omitted]</p><h2 class="head2">Singapore</h2><p>Brother Nee has left. The X dollars that Brother X offered for the brothers and sisters in Hankow who are escaping the war were sent the day before yesterday to Brother Lan in Hankow. After returning from Malaga, I had three small Bible studies with the brothers. I combined the X dollars and X cents that I received there with another X dollars and sent it to Hankow. Although it is not very much and cannot solve the problem, I ask my Lord to bless these five loaves and two fishes. I hope you can go to Hong Kong to wait for a boat to Southeast Asia after you finish your work in Chungking, Ch'eng-tu, Kuei-yang, and K'un-ming. You can go to Manila and then come to Singapore. I sent a letter inviting Brother Meek to place this matter in prayer. The Normal Christian Church Life gave me much light. Although the work is of the apostles, we must exhort the brothers and sisters in each locality to be "always abounding in the work of the Lord." Do you agree? (Indeed.) Brother and Sister Leland Wang will go to Surabaya soon for one month. The church there was started through a few brothers from Shing-Hwa and Brother Lin Wei-zhe. They rented a hall and began meeting. Brother Wei-zhe has since returned to China on business. They hope that Brother Leland and I can continue the work there. One of the toes on my right foot has been in pain for years. I went into the national hospital yesterday because they had to pull the toenail off. I will be in the hospital for approximately two weeks.

It seemed that all hope had been lost a few times when I met with dangers, but the almighty God led me through the valley of death. I am also very thankful for the desperate concern that the brothers and sisters had for me. Thank you for praying for me. You can now change your prayers into praises. God opened the way for me to come down from the mountain on April 19 and arrive in Hangchow on the same day. I stayed there for nine days before there was an opportunity to safely come to Shanghai by car (the twenty-eighth). Hallelujah! It really is God's marvelous miracle! I am temporarily staying above the meeting hall. My wife and children are staying at my parents-in-law's house. My mother is staying with her sister-in-law. It is difficult to narrate what we went through. The house and furniture which I had rented in San-Chiao-Bu were burned and destroyed. Long before this happened, I had taken my family to Yah-Dan-Ou for refuge, so we were not killed. We later moved to Mo-Gan-Shan because there was a wave of banditry in Yah-Dan-Ou. I was held up by bandits on February 25. They robbed me of money and clothes (a limited amount), and then hit me with a rifle and wounded me. It really was the grace of God that the wound was in the exact center of my chest above the sternum. The doctors said that if the blow had hit me slightly to the left or right or up or down, it would have been fatal. At the time, the wound was very bad. My entire chest swelled up and got red. God did a marvelous miracle and did not allow it to worsen. It got better in a few days. My health is the same as before, except that I tire more easily. The nine days in Hangchow were worse than the time on the mountain. We slept on hard concrete. There was nothing to eat but very coarse food. We were all sick by the fourth day. When we came to Shanghai, we carried our luggage ourselves. We carried it on to the car, off the car, over the pedestrian overpass, and put it into the bus ourselves. I am afraid that we really did not have any extra strength. Unfortunately, these sufferings cannot be counted as suffering for the Lord's sake. I went to see the meeting place in Hangchow once. The walls were broken down, and the building was in complete ruin. Brother Ruan Chi-yu is still in Hangchow. His faith remains strong. I was strengthened much in my half-hour conversation with him. Mr. Sun Wen-yuan's family, Brother Chou Hsing-yi's family, Miss Yeh Chui-chung's family, Mrs. Yu Siao-ke's family, and my family were all on the mountain. We had the Lord's Day meetings and often had prayer meetings. We only had "a little strength." I personally did nothing more than sow a few seeds of the gospel into some sinners and contact some Gentiles and seekers. Mrs. Sun was very diligent in the gospel. She took Miss Yeh to many people's homes. I was overjoyed after I read The Open Door and learned that the co-workers were all under God's protection. Once the burden that had been weighing on my heart for six months fell away, I became very released. I hope that the Lord will bring us face to face with one another. Please pray for Brother Chou Hsing-yi. He was robbed just as I was. He is very weak physically. As I write, his fever is rising. It seems that he has contracted malaria. I think it is the cumulative effect of all that we have gone through. Please pray for him.</p><p>Your weak brother in the Lord,<br />Tang Shou-ling<br />May 2<br />[Address omitted]</p><h2 class="head2">Shanghai</h2><h2 class="head3">One</h2><p>(Parts omitted.) Brother Tseng Da-guang's wife contracted encephalitis after giving birth to twins on the twenty-second of this month. She passed away on the twenty-sixth. Sister Lie Shi Sai-ho was knocked over by a boy riding a bicycle on the sidewalk last Wednesday. At the time it was very serious, but after a few days of treatment, she recovered completely and has already returned home safely. God saved the boy through her.</p><p>Lin Kwang-biao, Tu Tsoung-chen, Wu Si-you<br />April 30<br />[Address omitted]</p><h2 class="head3">Two</h2><p>Dear Sisters Wang, Lee, and Chang in the Lord:</p><p>Praise and thank God our heavenly Father for separating us from the worldly people through His rich love and mercy. Through The Open Door we have read how all the brothers and sisters have richly received God's grace. Our hearts are full of praise to the Lord. Since our hospital moved to Feng-Lin-Chiao, we have not had many patients because we are too remote, and transportation is inconvenient. We have moved our outpatient clinic to Fu-Hsuin Road and Ch'eng-tu Road. Many people lost their jobs, but the sisters are still here. Sister Lin Meng-bin returned to Foochow, and Sister Zhang Ju-sian went to the Red Cross Hospital. We still do not know where Sister Di Teh-jia is. Sister Wang Mei-lin's elderly mother came to Shanghai from the countryside of Tai-Chang. Her elderly father is more than eighty. His arthritis is so bad that he cannot move, so he is still in the country. May the Lord who bears our burdens enable us to sing new songs to Jehovah in difficult environments. Shi-kwai's mother was released from the hospital on March 20. This was a miracle! He heard our prayers. Thank Him! She is well now, and she is the same as a normal person. Glory to God! Shi-kwai's father met God this time. Sister Chen Shiu-yu and Sister Yeh are both well. The Lord has increased the number of saved ones with Sister Tseng Ji-ai and Sister Chang Ju-hua. There is also a Miss Chu. They all have a heart to pursue the Lord. Please pray for us. We do not hope to do a great work for the Lord, but we do hope that we do not shame the Lord's name. Peace in the Lord.</p><p>All the sisters<br />in the Shanghai Women's and Children's Hospital<br />April 11<br />[Address omitted]</p><h2 class="head3">Three</h2><p>Thank God for His grace in enabling me to write this letter. Thank you for praying for my illness. When my illness was at its worst, people did not believe that there was any hope. Even I had lost hope in myself. However, God gave me a word through Sister Tso&mdash;Psalm 118:17. This word caught hold of me. I am physically stronger than I was before. I have been back at work at the hospital for almost two months. God showed me that I should live completely for Him when I got encephalitis in Hangchow. This time God gave me the word in Psalm 118:17. Although I have already placed my all into God's hands, my flesh is lazy, so I often live in a state of confusion. May God edify me more.</p><p>The smallest in the Lord,<br />Li Li-ying<br />April 11<br />[Address omitted]</p><h2 class="head2">San-Ban-Gang, Northern Kiangsu</h2><p>Greetings to the brothers and sisters who inherit grace with us:</p><p>Every time we receive The Open Door, we praise God unceasingly. The Lord began to work in San-Ban-Gang three years ago. Brother Hu Siao-lan from the church in Dong-Gou came to visit us occasionally. Last winter there were more than one hundred twenty believers. Forty-six of them had been baptized into the Lord's name. We still must ask the Lord to work and lead us all forward until He comes. Peace.</p><p>Your smallest brother,<br />Huang Wan-jin<br />March 16<br />[Address omitted]</p><h2 class="head2">Mo-Gan-Shan, Chekiang Province</h2><p>Thank God for constantly gracing us during the six months we lived as refugees. He always covers us. I think that Brothers Chou Hsing-yi, Tang Shou-ling, and Chou Fu-en and their wives have already told you about our condition in detail, so I will not say too much. We especially thank God that we suffered no loss through hardships, even though our houses in San-Chiao-Bu were burned and we were robbed twice. We can even say that we did not feel frightened by all these things. Praise the Lord! The meetings of the brothers and sisters have never stopped. I believe that God's grace will never change. I really am thankful for the prayers of the brothers and sisters in Shanghai and every other place. Before the Lord we often remember the brothers and sisters that have met with similar hardships. We can only feel for them and respond to their needs in prayer. I have written these few lines hastily because someone is going to Shanghai, and I wanted to greet you. I really think of Brother Stephen Kaung. Please greet him for me. May God keep you safe.</p><p>Your weak sister,<br />Sun Chen Yao-jen<br />April 30, 1938<br />[Address omitted]</p><h2 class="head2">Gao-Mi, Shantung Province</h2><p>Greetings to all the brothers and sisters in the Lord:</p><p>I received Issue Nos. 1&mdash;5 of The Open Door. The Lord's light really shined into my heart. Because the Lord is working in every place to save souls, our hearts are filled with thanks and praise. We thank the Lord even more that through this printed communication, the brothers and sisters are able to fellowship with each other during this time. We truly admire the saints' heart for the Lord and feel ashamed for ourselves at the same time. There is not a meeting in Gao-Mi that is truly according to the Scriptures. On March 2 Brother Chang Tze-jieh was led by the Lord to meet in Gao-Mi for seven days. He preached the gospel in the morning, and some were saved. He did some building work in the afternoon. It seems that the Lord has begun to work. We meet every morning at ten o'clock for prayer. We preach the gospel on Wednesday and Saturday mornings at eleven o'clock. There are not many people in one accord with us. We really need to wait before the Lord to deal with everything. We must know His heart's desire, seek His will, and wait for His arrangement. Please pray for us and ask God to establish our faith. May God gain us more. Peace in the Lord.</p><p>Your little brothers in the Lord,<br />Wang Shu-ge, Ju Sung-shan, Hu Shen-fu<br />April 26<br />[Address omitted]</p><h2 class="head2">Chou County, Shantung Province</h2><p>After receiving and reading Issue Nos. 3 and 4 of The Open Door, we learned about the condition of the work in all the places in China and about the travels of the brothers and sisters. We really thank and praise our God! The brothers and sisters here were scattered into the countryside three months ago. We have passed through all kinds of dangers in the past one hundred days, but we thank our God for leading us through safely. No one was lost. We are unable to meet publicly now. We preach the gospel individually and meet in homes. Please pray for us. Although we are living in the country, we can still go into the city to pick up letters at the post office.</p><p>Your little brothers in the Lord,<br />Liu Tien-min, Chen Bo-heng<br />April 11<br />[Address omitted]</p><h2 class="head2">Tai-An, Shantung Province</h2><p>Peace to the dear brothers and sisters in the Lord:</p><p>Thank the Lord! He has really led me beside the still waters and made me to fear no evil, though I have passed through the valley of death. Although I lost my job in the past six months, I do not have any material shortage. Once some bandits tried to take my life when I was out in the countryside, but God protected me. They could not find me. Praise the Lord! God has led me to work in the Buo-Ji Hospital in Tai-An. There are brothers and sisters here in one accord with us. However, we still do not have a suitable place to meet. I believe that God will arrange it. Please pray for us. May Christ's name be exalted here soon. Blessing, glory, and riches to Him. Amen.</p><p>Your weak brother in the Lord,<br />Wang Yong-hai<br />April 20<br />[Address omitted]</p><h2 class="head2">Fu-Ping, Shensi Province</h2><p>To Brother You-sheng, my co-inheritor of grace:</p><p>It has been almost a year since we said good-by to each other. Although I have passed through many dangers and travels, I have gained peace and protection in the Lord. May glory and praise be to our Father forever and ever. When I first came to work in this hospital, no one who worked here believed in the Lord. There are nine believers now. Some had heard the gospel before. Some have just been saved recently. They all desire the Lord's truth. We have a prayer meeting every night to learn how to love the Lord. Some have gained much benefit and strength from this meeting. We have a Bible study every Lord's Day evening. We also allow unbelievers to attend that meeting. We still do not have a meeting to break bread and remember the Lord. Although we feel that we need to establish the table, there is a great Power that has been saying to us, "Wait awhile, it is not time yet." This matter really needs the Lord's light. (If you want to establish the Lord's table, you must first understand the nature and realm of a local church. Please read The Normal Christian Church Life concerning this point&mdash;Editor.) We will soon have a baptism meeting. We are looking for a place to baptize people and are waiting for the Lord's arrangement in everything. There is a denomination here that has been established for almost forty years. There is only one lukewarm believer in it. The churches in the countryside are very good. In one locality a believer, who only had twenty plots of land and had six or seven members in his family, gave an offering of six hundred dollars to build a meeting hall. We should admire such lovers of the Lord. If the Lord allows, I hope to travel to Hankow soon. I am still waiting for the Lord's leading. I have received every issue of The Open Door and was comforted much by it. Please greet all the brothers and sisters in Hankow for me. Peace in the Lord.</p><p>Your weak brother in the Lord,<br />Li Ching-hua<br />May 12<br />[Address omitted]</p><h2 class="head2">The Recent Condition<br />of Brother Liu Ai-wu, Ch'ang-sha</h2><p>The church in Ch'ang-sha has not had a local person raised up to be an elder. I cannot release my burden for the meetings, so I feel that I should remain in Ch'ang-sha temporarily. Brother Lan Tsi-yi wanted me to completely drop everything regarding the meetings in Ch'ang-sha when I was in Hankow. He asked me whether I could go to Hankow to help with the Gospel Book Room and to rest. However, I do not have any inward leading to take his suggestion. The ministry which I have received from the Lord is to serve the orphans. The Lord has not yet given me a vision concerning this work, yet I have had the faith to do it all along. Many times the brothers have seen that the burden of caring for my family is heavy and have exhorted me to do some other work. Now some brothers exhort me that it would be better for me to get a job. Yet I was not touched. Glory be to our rich Father. Since He led me to leave the orphanage, the flour in my jar and the oil in my pitcher have never run short. With regard to my health, I had a relapse of my illness in July of last year. I spent more than a month recovering and have not had a relapse since. My condition seems to be much improved from last year. A brother from Chi-Loo University (an internist) gave me a physical examination. He could not see any sign of tuberculosis during his careful examination. In my working and moving about, I have found my physical strength much weaker than before. I used to walk nineteen to twenty-two miles a day and work the entire day without feeling tired. Now I find it difficult to walk for three miles, and I must rest after working for an hour. I do not know what attitude I should have toward my health, the church, and my future. I am telling you these things with the hope that you will render me help with your direct words.</p><p>Your little brother in the Lord,<br />Liu Ai-wu<br />May 12<br />[Address omitted]</p><h2 class="head2">A Letter from Brother Han Fu-sheng<br />during His Illness</h2><p>I was transferred from Ren-Shu Hospital to Siang-Ya Hospital five days ago. Everything is progressing well. Because my illness is so peculiar, I had to go through many tests. This has been a real suffering to me. At first the doctors said that I had a tumor in my lungs. Then they thought that water in my lungs had made my chest swell. They have attempted to draw off fluid many times, but with no result. Last night they discovered a pocket of pus under my ribs when they poked me with a needle. Surgery is a necessity now. Please pray for me. Ask the Lord to give me grace to get through this. My heart is still peaceful and secure. I am resting in the Lord's bosom. I have given everything to the Lord, so I have nothing to be anxious about. I deeply believe that whatever happens to me is the Lord's will. He would not allow me to suffer unnecessarily! My mouth praises the Lord unceasingly for giving me an opportunity to enjoy His grace and love more! Hallelujah!</p><p>Han Fu-sheng<br />May 16</p><h2 class="head2">Yu-Si, Fukien Province</h2><p>We received all twenty copies of The Open Door which you sent and have distributed them to the brothers and sisters. Thank the Lord that we can still receive the news concerning the travels of the brothers and sisters and the work, even though we are in an unstable environment. We really gain great comfort from it. By the Lord's grace, the church here has been under His leading. However, the brothers need more growth in spiritual life to stand firm for the Lord. Please pray for this. The locality of Dong-Jang is eleven miles from here. The Lord's servants, Chen Jai-seng, Chai Tze-chung, and Chen Ke-san, have gone there to work, as have other brothers who love the Lord. A meeting has been raised up there. They preach the gospel every Lord's Day afternoon. God has really blessed the work, and the number of saved ones has been increasing. There are many sisters who are especially diligent in serving the Lord. We are sending an offering of X dollars from the brothers and sisters in our locality by postal wire. Please distribute it to the brothers and sisters in need. May the Lord give us more love in our hearts to the glory of His name. Brother Lin Wei-zhe returned from Singapore in February.</p><p>The brothers who meet in the Lord's name in Yu-Si,<br />Lin Wei-zhe, Lin Shao-liang, Tseng Geng-seng, Chai Yi-sung<br />[Address omitted]</p><h2 class="head2">Foochow</h2><h2 class="head3">One</h2><p>We have received every issue of The Open Door which you sent. After returning to Foochow from Amoy, we remained idle at home for six months because of the environment. This year Shao-geng and Shao-fang took up some odd jobs in the provincial capital. The Lord is still giving us peace. We thank Him unceasingly. We are sending X dollars for printing costs and X dollars for the work in the inland regions. Sister Ma Chu-feng sent a letter from Southeast Asia asking us to send another X dollars. X dollars of the amount are for the brothers and sisters in need, and X dollars are to defray the costs of the Gospel Book Room. Please greet the church in Hankow.</p><p>The weak ones in the Lord,<br />Hsu Shao-geng, Shao-hwa, and Shao-fang<br />April 28<br />[Address omitted]</p><h2 class="head3">Two</h2><p>I am enclosing a bank draft from the Bank of China for distribution to the brothers and sisters in need because of the war.

Sister Chen Wuan-ching is still in Kulangsu. The meeting hall in Kulangsu has been declared a refugee center. Dr. Chai Ming-ju's family has long moved to Kulangsu. Some believers in Swatow have already moved inland. I received a letter from Brother Chen Wen-kwang. He has recovered seventy to eighty percent from his illness. He will continue to take a vacation for two months so that he may fully recover. Sister Lin Lee Tsuo-yu will go to Singapore on the thirty-first of this month. Sister Huang Hwei-min and Sister Chai Lan-jen will go to Siam soon.</p><p>Your brother,<br />James Chen<br />May 22<br />[Address omitted]</p><h2 class="head2">Wei-Hai-Wei, Manchuria</h2><h2 class="head3">One</h2><p>Dear Brother Witness:</p><p>Although we do not often write, I remember you often in my prayers. I hope the God of grace and peace will keep us on the way, amen. My spirit is very peaceful and happy here. The strongest word that I have read recently is, "Deny yourself, pick up your cross, and follow the Lord." This word has been operating in me. Brother! It is so easy to say these words, but it is very difficult to practice them! May the Lord give me revelation that I may overcome my self and everything else by relying on Him. My time is not on a definite schedule (because of my job), so I can only pray and read the Bible with my wife and children. Wei-Hai-Wei is sometimes not peaceful. It is very difficult to travel. How is it in Chefoo? I hope you remember me, your weak brother, in your prayers. I also hope you can find some time to write a letter and help me. This is my hope, but I know that you are busy. Please forgive me. Peace in the Lord. Greet all the brothers and sisters who meet at Shuang-He-Li.</p><p>Your weak brother in the Lord,<br />Lin Shien-huei</p><h2 class="head3">Two</h2><p>Brother Tsi-yi:</p><p>I have received each issue of The Open Door. Thank and praise the Lord. Everything is according to His good pleasure. His gospel has been preached to places never reached before because of the present environment. I am still working in Liu-Gong-Dao, Wei-Hai-Wei. There is not much turmoil in the environment because the British are here. Thank God. Although the times are hard, I do not have any difficulties (materially speaking). I must think of my fellow members who are being affected both directly and indirectly by the war. I am sending a postal wire with X dollars for meeting the needs of the brothers and sisters who are depleted through the war and X dollars to help with the cost of printing. The amount is small, but I trust the Lord does not despise it. I hope God gives more grace in leading us on the way ahead. Amen. Peace in the Lord. Greet the brothers and sisters in Hankow.</p><p>Your weak brother,<br />Lin Shien-huei<br />April 4<br />[Address omitted]</p><h2 class="head2">Hong Kong</h2><h2 class="head3">One</h2><p>My poor health has completely recovered through the Lord's mercy and grace. I dare not say when I will go to Szechuan. Because I deeply feel there are many important lessons that I must learn, I want to spend some time to specifically wait on the Father. I want to spend more time to consider the glorified Christ. In the past the only thing I knew was to work for the Lord; I did not desire the Lord Himself. The work is important, but the Lord Himself is more important than the work. Therefore, I really pray to pay more attention to Him than to His work. If the Lord does not gain the person in the work, the work is nothing more than outward activity. The work and the church in Hong Kong are already separate according to the new principles. Thank the Lord, the brothers and sisters are led by the same Spirit to have the same view in this matter and are very much in one accord. We really give glory to God for this. Brother Chou Hung-bao came to Hong Kong on March 5. Yesterday, he and Brother Yin Tzu-lan's entire family went to K'un-ming. Brother Chen Ju-yen, Brother Stephen Kaung, senior Mrs. Nee, Mrs. Nee, Miss Lei, and the brothers and sisters have been preserved in peace by the Lord. They are well. Miss Mei Guang-yao returned to Hankow with Mrs. Luk and Brother Yang Tsun-sin in a group of six people.</p><p>Your brother,<br />Philip Luan<br />April 29</p><h2 class="head3">Two</h2><p>I moved from Shek-Kip-Mei Street to 101 Tai-Po Road, Floor 2, on the twenty-fifth of last month. Thank the Lord, this place is better for my health. Sister Huang Ro-chen and Sister Kuo Hai-jen are still working in Chungshan. Chungshan and Macao need brothers and sisters to live there for awhile.</p><p>Your brother,<br />Philip Luan<br />May 16<br />[Address omitted]</p><h2 class="head2">Canada</h2><p>Dear Sister Ruth and the sisters in the Lord:</p><p>It took a long time for your letters to reach me. I was very happy to hear that you had gone to Szechuan. I used to live in Feng-Jieh and Wan County, which are far away from Chungking. If you follow the Yangtze River upstream, you will pass through them. I asked the Lord to send some of you there to bring them the message of the full gospel of Christ, the perfect position that God has given Him, the revelation of the cross, and the revelation concerning the Body of Christ (the church). I want God's saved children in Szechuan to know about these things. I really would like to go with you. I will continue to pray for the places you will visit and the messages you will give. May God cause rich life to flow into His church through the messages you will preach. I will never forget you and the sisters and will pray for you diligently. I will lift my heart and seek after His will and the path He has chosen for me. As soon as I am clear, I hope I will obey. I am now living in a believer-friend's house in Vancouver. There are many brothers and sisters here. There is a doctor who believes in the Lord who read Mr. Nee's letter and felt that it was so full of light and life that he had to pass it on to other brothers and sisters. They are amazed that the Lord has done such a marvelous work among the believers in China and that He is using them. I am so happy! Greet the sisters that I know. We have the same life and the same hope.

We still need to pray for these places.</p><p>(3) With regard to the offerings for the brothers and sisters in need through the war, Brother Tsi-yi and the editor can only send money to the localities that can receive wires. We will do our best to distribute the offerings. May God lead us to be faithful in all things and accomplish them without making errors. Thank God! Many brothers and sisters are able to care for others because of the grace of God, not because they have an excess. Many of the localities that cared for others have become war zones themselves. Some are in great turmoil. We can only ask God to protect and remember them. We ask the brothers and sisters who are in safe places to open up and remember those brothers and sisters in distress. We must say that in all aspects the grace of God is sufficient for us in these days. Our hearts are full of praise to Him!</p><p>(4) The editor cannot answer many letters individually or quickly.

If anyone wants to subscribe to both The Christian and The Open Door, he should send two separate subscription forms because we are afraid we will not be able to forward mail.</p><p>(5) Because the post office in Shanghai does not accept large amounts of printed material, it is best for each locality to print their own gospel tracts. It will be more convenient this way.</p><p>(6) The Gospel Book Room has established a branch store in Hankow. Anyone in the region of Hankow can buy books from Hankow. If you live in Hankow, please come to buy your books at Gospel Court, 1 Hsiao-Dong-Jia Alley. Whatever Hankow lacks, Shanghai will supply, but please forgive us for adding a charge for the postage in such case.</p><p>May 29, 1938, in Hankow</p><h1 class="series">* * *</h1><p>The Open Door emphasizes the gospel work in each locality.
