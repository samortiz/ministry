   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>I. WE BEING CREATED BY GOD A TRIPARTITE BEING</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In the record of God's creation in Genesis, God did not give us many details concerning the heavens because the heavens do not have that much direct relationship with us.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>But concerning the earth, God gave us a number of details.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Genesis 1:2 through Genesis 2 gives us the details of the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>First, God caused the dry land to appear on the third day.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Then He made the plant life and the animal life.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Eventually, God told us that He made man.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>In God's creation, He mostly spoke things into being, but in His creation of man, He used two substances.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Genesis 2:7 says that He used the dust to make man's body and His breath of life to form man's spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The breath of life is not God Himself, God's life, or God's Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>But it is very close to God, very close to the life of God, and very close to the Spirit of God.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Before the breath of life entered into man, he just had a lifeless frame.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>But when the breath of life entered into man's frame, man became a living soul.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The soul was not created by God out of a certain substance.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The soul was the issue of the breath of life entering into man's body.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>It is man's being, man's self.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Exodus tells us that seventy souls of the house of Jacob went down to Egypt 1:5 .</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>These were seventy persons.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>A person is a soul.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>This shows us that the soul is our very person, our being.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The soul is between the outward frame, the body, and the inward organ, the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>A. With a Body Formed of the Dust,</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>as Our Outward Frame</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>In studying the definition of our spirit, we must be clear about God's creation.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>We have been created by God as a tripartite man.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>As we have seen, 1 Thessalonians 5:23 and Hebrews 4:12b are the most basic verses in the Bible concerning man's three parts.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Man's body formed of the dust is his outward frame Gen 2:7a .</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The minerals in our body are the minerals of the dust.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>B. With a Spirit Produced of God's Breath,</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>as Our Intrinsic Organ, Ranked with</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>the Heavens and the Earth</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>We also have a spirit produced of God's breath, as our intrinsic organ, ranked with the heavens and the earth Gen 2:7b; Zech 12:1b; Isa 42:5 .</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>I do not use the word made or created but produced.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The breath of life produced the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Actually, it was the breath of life becoming the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>In Genesis 2:7 the Hebrew word for "breath," neshamah, is the same word used for "spirit" in Proverbs 20:27, which speaks of the spirit of man.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>We have two main organs.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>One is the body as our outward organ, which is full of functions.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>But we also have an intrinsic organ within us our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>We can substantiate all the things in the divine, spiritual, and heavenly field by our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>If we do not use our spirit, we become very low, like the beasts.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The difference between man and the other living creatures is that only man has a spirit Job 12:10 .</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The spirit distinguishes us from all the animals, so we must study our spirit and exercise our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>If we do not care for our spirit, we can never enjoy God, we can never be spiritual, and we can never grow in the divine life.</S>
