   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Present your bodies a living sacrifice Rom 12:1 .</S>

   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>If we want to understand the will of God, we must not be fashioned according to this age.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Age is translated as world in the Chinese Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The Greek word for world is kosmos, but the Greek word in verse 2 is aion, which is translated age.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>This age is equivalent to people s understanding of the word modern; hence, it can also be translated as fashionable.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The world is Satan s entire organization, including its systems and institutions, which systematize the lives of everyone so that they cannot love God but instead will become enemies of God 1 John 2:15; James 4:4 .</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>An age is a part of the world; it is one section of the world that appears before us.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>The world is big and wide, but we are always in touch with a part of it.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>A section of the world appears before us, and this part or section of the world is the age, which is composed of modern and fashionable things, which oppose the will of God and cause people to be unable to understand, receive, or keep God s will.</S>

   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>This is the same as not following the fashion of this age.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>If we want to understand the will of God, we must fulfill this requirement.</S>

   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>The renewing of the mind is another requirement for understanding God s will.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>The mind is our thinking faculty.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Our mind is fallen and deeply contaminated by sin, the world, human emotions, and customs.</S>

   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>All of its old thoughts, concepts, perceptions, and views must be eliminated, and it must be taught anew by God.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>This is what the Holy Spirit wants to do through the Bible, but we must desire to have the Holy Spirit renew our mind in this way.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>If we are willing, the Holy Spirit will lead us to read God s Word the Bible and use its teachings to kill our old thoughts and wipe out our fallen concepts by renewing our mind so that we can understand the will of God.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Although God reveals His will in our spirit through His Spirit by giving us a sense in our spirit, we must use our mind to understand the sense in our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>The spirit is our innermost part.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Our mind surrounds our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>If our mind is not renewed, it cannot understand or perceive the sense of the Holy Spirit in our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>An unrenewed mind can be compared to a lampshade that is painted a dark color that prevents the light of the bulb from shining out.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Even when a little light shines out, the light is not according to its original color.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>The light is so deeply covered and influenced by the dark shade that it loses its original color.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>The sense in our spirit is similarly influenced if our mind is not renewed.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>Although we have the capacity to understand, we will understand incorrectly.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>This is similar to wearing colored eyeglasses which change the true color of an object.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>If our mind is not renewed and if we cannot shake off our old thoughts and concepts, we will not be able to understand the will of God.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>Even if we have some understanding, our understanding will not be correct.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>Thus, we will be unable to perceive the original appearance of the will of God.</S>
