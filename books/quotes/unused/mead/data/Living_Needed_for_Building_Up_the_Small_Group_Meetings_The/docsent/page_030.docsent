   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Laboring on the Lord s Word Being</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>to Build Up Ourselves in Our Most Holy Faith</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In these messages we have been concerned with the matter of strengthening the small group meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In order for the church to be built up by the saints, we must labor on the Lord s word.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>To labor on the Lord s word is to build up ourselves in our most holy faith.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Today, in the twentieth century, especially in the United States and in Taiwan, education is popular, and the standard of education is high.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Technology is advancing daily.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>In such an age, if we are illiterate, we will be of little use to society.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>We will not be able to do anything except eat and sleep every day, and we may even become barbarians, knowing nothing but quarreling and fighting.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>If a man is not educated, he will be very uncultured.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The more educated a man is, the more refined he will be.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Men in the world are seeking after worldly knowledge.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Although they may obtain such knowledge, they know nothing about spiritual matters.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Concerning spiritual matters, they are ignorant.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>We have all believed in the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>We love the Lord and we love the church.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>This is wonderful.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Yet most of us are short of spiritual education.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Because of this, in God s hand we are not very useful.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>On the side of our old creation, our flesh, we have received adequate education.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>But on the spiritual side, we have not labored for our spiritual education to prepare and build up ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>This is what concerns me.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>During the fellowship of these few weeks, we have exposed the poor and ignorant situation of Christianity.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Because of the Lord s mercy, we have been raised up by Him.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>In the past sixty years the Lord has continually granted us bright and rich truths.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Especially in these past twenty years, after the Lord s recovery came to the United States, we have continually seen new light, and we have published a great deal concerning biblical truths.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>We have expounded in detail the twenty-seven books of the New Testament, and we have printed these expositions in many books.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>But my point is this: We cannot say that we have attained simply because we have some truths and some books.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Have we read these books?</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Have we digested the truths contained in them?</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Have we built up ourselves in our most holy faith?</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>This is the key.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Our meetings are not so rich, and they are lacking and sometimes even void of the living word.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Because you have not received an adequate spiritual education, when someone mentions a spiritual matter, many of you become speechless.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>If you have not received a proper elementary, high school, and college education, your speech will indicate that you are an uncultured person, or what is commonly known as a country boy.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Among Christians today there are many spiritual country boys.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Many among us are also spiritually uneducated.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>To me, the Chinese-speaking meeting is a heavy burden.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Sometimes I sigh because during the meetings it seems that you do not know how to exercise your spirit to speak the Lord s word.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>But in other places you have a lot to speak.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>In the previous message I mentioned that we must exercise to speak the Lord s word, but after my speaking no one exercised.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>It is like a coach practicing with his players.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Suppose the coach passes the ball to his players, and no one continues to play.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Rather, suppose they say, You are the coach; you are an expert.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>We will watch you play because playing ball is the coach s business.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Some of the saints have come from a distance to attend this meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>A number of them said that if I were not speaking, they would not come.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>You want to hear me speak.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>If I do not speak, you will be unhappy.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>However, I also want to hear you speak.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>If you do not speak, I will also be unhappy.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>It is difficult to deal with this concept of not opening our mouth to speak.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>If the older ones do not speak, the younger ones will also be silent.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>The older ones take the lead, and the younger ones follow.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>In the end, no one speaks.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>In the natural realm it is easy to speak and difficult not to speak.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>In your own home would it be possible for you to be completely silent for an entire day?</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>When you are at home, it is impossible for you not to speak, but once you are in a meeting, it is easy for you to stop speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>We have said repeatedly that we need to exercise to speak the Lord s word.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>But eventually, we still do not speak.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>What is the reason?</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>I agree with the Chinese proverb which says, What is impregnated within will take form without.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>The Lord Jesus said, ...for out of the abundance of his heart his mouth speaks Luke 6:45 .</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Because you are not filled within and you are short of content within, you have nothing to speak.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>For this reason I am very burdened.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>I feel that everything in the United States is very good.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>However, if you are not one who loves the Lord, I wish that you would not come to the United States, because in the United States there are also many evil things.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>In this country people receive high wages for their jobs.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>The income from one person is sufficient to support an entire family.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>People are required to work only eight hours a day and five days a week.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>For many people there is no work on the weekends.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>All the weeknights and the whole weekend afford people extra time for entertainment.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>However, in the worldly entertainments all the lusts come in; all the sinful things creep in. Therefore, it is dangerous to live in the United States if you are not one who loves the Lord and seeks after the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>You may be busy working every day to earn money, but it is still meaningless to have so much money.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>If you have a large amount of money, though you may not sin now, one day the abundance of money will encourage you to sin.</S>
