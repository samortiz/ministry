[1]  The mother in verse 13 is a mother in the flesh in relation to Rufus, but more important, she is a mother not in the flesh in relation to Paul.
[2]  The Gospel of John is a book on life, not on the natural life, but on the transferred and transformed life.
[3]  The word of the Lord Jesus to John and to His mother was a word to show us that His life-imparting, life-releasing death transfers people's lives.
[4]  We have a habit of calling one another brother and sister in the church, but this may be just a religious term unless we have a genuine realization that we are brothers and sisters sharing the same life.
[5]  Although we speak of one another as our brothers and sisters so many times in the church life, I have never heard the saints speaking of their sons in the church, their sons in the spirit.
[6]  If you sisters would pick up the burden by looking at the cross, getting yourself transferred in life, and take some young ones of junior high school age to be your children, within five years there will be a revival in the church.
[7]  Without some children in the spirit, it could be so easy for the sisters to fall away.
[8]  If we call one another brothers and sisters in the church life, and yet when we come to the practical things, we don't care for each other's children, all of the second generation would realize that our brotherhood and sisterhood is not genuine.
[9]  All of us have the second birth, and we have the second family.
[10]  Until there are the real mothers in the church life, the church life is not practical, and it is not up to the top.
