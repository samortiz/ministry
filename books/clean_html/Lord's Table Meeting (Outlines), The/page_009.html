<ol class="upper-roman" start="4"><li>The revelation that can be seen in Psalm 22:12-22 and Hebrews 2:10-12:	<ol class="upper-alpha">	<li>Psalm 22:12-21 is a prophecy picturing Christ's death&#151;"Many bulls have compassed me," "My bones are out of joint," "My tongue cleaveth to my jaws," "They look and stare upon me," "They part my garments among them," "[They] cast lots upon my vesture."</li>	<li>However, Psalm 22:22 is a prophecy which is fulfilled after Christ's resurrection.		<ol class="decimal">		<li>Psalm 22:22a says, "I will declare thy name unto my brethren."			<ol class="lower-alpha">			<li>In John 20:17 Jesus called the disciples brothers for the first time.</li>			<li>Jesus never called the disciples brothers until after the resurrection; before His resurrection, the Lord only called His disciples friends.</li>			<li>In John 20:20-23 Jesus met with the disciples for the first time in resurrection; He declared the Father's name to His brothers.</li>			<li>At this time, on the day of Christ's resurrection, Psalm 22:22a was fulfilled.</li>			</ol></li>		<li>Psalm 22:22b says, "In the midst of the congregation will I praise thee."			<ol class="lower-alpha">			<li>This is Christ's praising of the Father in the midst of the church.</li>			<li>There is no record in the Scriptures of the fulfillment of this prophecy.</li>			</ol></li>		</ol></li>	<li>Hebrews 2:10 says, "For it was fitting for Him, for whom are all things and through whom are all things, in leading many sons into glory, to make the Captain of their salvation perfect through sufferings."		<ol class="decimal">		<li>The Captain of our salvation is the Son.</li>		<li>The Son is leading many sons (the believers) into glory.</li>		</ol></li>	<li>Hebrews 2:11 says, "For both He who sanctifies and those who are being sanctified are all of one, for which cause He is not ashamed to call them brothers."		<ol class="decimal">		<li>The "one" refers to the Father.</li>		<li>The Sanctifier is the Son.</li>		<li>"Those who are being sanctified" are the sons.</li>		<li>Thus, the Son and "those who are being sanctified" are all of one Father.</li>		<li>Therefore, He, the Son, is not ashamed to call us brothers; in John 20:17, after His resurrection He told Mary, "Go to My brothers."			<ol class="lower-alpha">			<li>Through Christ's resurrection, all of His disciples received the Father's life&#151;1 Pet. 1:3.</li>			<li>Now, because both Christ and we are of the same source (Eph. 1:3; 4:6; Matt. 6:9) and have the same life (1 John 5:11-12) with the same nature (2 Pet. 1:4), He is not ashamed to call us His brothers.</li>			</ol></li>		</ol></li>	<li>Hebrews 2:12 is a quotation of Psalm 22:22 and says, "I will declare Your name to My brothers; in the midst of the church I will sing hymns of praise unto You."		<ol class="decimal">		<li>Here we see the Son declaring the Father's "name" to His brothers, that is, making the Father known as the source of life and as the begetting God.</li>		<li>This verse also tells us that the Son sings hymns of praise to the Father in the midst of the church.</li>		<li>By this verse we see that the brothers are the church; individually speaking, we are the brothers and collectively speaking, we are the church brought forth in Christ's resurrection.</li>		</ol></li>	</ol></li></ol>
