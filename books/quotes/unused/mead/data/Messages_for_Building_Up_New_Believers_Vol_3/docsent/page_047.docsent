   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>B. What a Man Sows, That He Reaps</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Many portions in the Bible point out similar things.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>For example, Galatians 6:7 says, Whatever a man sows, this he will also reap.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>This speaks of God s governmental hand.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>If a father spoils his children, his children will not grow up in a proper way.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>A father who does not care for his own family will end up with a tragedy.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>This is the only possible result.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>A person who always argues and fights with others and who holds different opinions will have no friends.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>What a man sows, that he reaps.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>This is God s government, God s ordained law.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>No one can change such a law.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>God s children must be careful not to provoke His governmental hand.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>It is not easy for God to remove His hand once it is provoked.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>C. The Lord s Healing of a Paralytic Being</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>a Governmental Forgiveness</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>A certain paralytic was carried to the Lord in the presence of the scribes.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The Lord Jesus said to the paralytic, Take courage, child; your sins are forgiven Matt 9:2 .</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>If we do not understand governmental forgiveness, it will be hard to understand what the Lord Jesus was saying.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The paralytic did not express his belief; it was others who bore him on a bed to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Yet the Lord said to him, Take courage, child; your sins are forgiven.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Does this mean that the paralytic was saved when he was carried to the Lord?</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>If he were, salvation would have been too easy.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>One would only have to be carried to the Lord, and his sins would be forgiven.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>No, this certainly does not refer to eternal forgiveness.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>It has nothing to do with instrumental forgiveness or even forgiveness in fellowship.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>This is another kind of forgiveness.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The Lord shows us two things here.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>On the one hand, the paralytic s sins were forgiven.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>On the other hand, he had to rise and pick up his mat and walk.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Please bear in mind that many sicknesses are the result of God s governmental hand.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>In order for the paralytic to be healed and to rise again, he first needed to receive governmental forgiveness.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Such forgiveness is related to God s government.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>It is related to sicknesses, not to eternal life.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>When others carried the paralytic to the Lord Jesus, His forgiveness clearly related to the sickness of paralysis.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>This man came to the Lord to be healed, and the Lord Jesus said that his sins were forgiven.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>In other words, his sickness would be healed once his sins were forgiven.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>His sickness was related to his sins.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The Lord Jesus said such a word because the sickness was the result of the man s sins before God.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>He was sick because he had not settled the issue of his sins yet.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>When this issue was settled, his sickness was gone.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>This is governmental forgiveness.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Sickness goes away when governmental forgiveness comes.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Such a sin clearly involved a governmental offense.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The man was sick because he had done something which had offended God s government.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Once the Lord forgave him of his sins, he could rise, pick up his mat, and go home.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>This forgiveness is different from the other kinds of forgiveness.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>It is the forgiveness which enables one to pick up his mat and go home.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>This is governmental forgiveness.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>D. The Elders of the Church</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Anointing the Sick and Praying for Them</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>to Receive Governmental Forgiveness</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>James 5:14-15 says, Is anyone among you ill?</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Let him call for the elders of the church, and let them pray over him, anointing him with oil in the name of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>And the prayer of faith will save the one who is sick, and the Lord will raise him up; and if he has committed sins, it will be forgiven him.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>This seems to be a very special kind of forgiveness.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Here was a brother who was sick.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>The elders of the church were invited to anoint him with oil and pray for him, and the prayer of faith would cause the sick to rise up.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>If he had committed any sin, it would be forgiven him.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>We have seen that sickness may be caused by many factors.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Some sicknesses may not be the result of sin, but some are.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>The sin here is not forgiven through the confession of the sick one; it is forgiven through the prayer of the elders of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Why are his sins forgiven after the elders of the church pray for him and apply the anointing to him?</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>What sins are spoken of in this verse?</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>One cannot apply such a method to eternal forgiveness, instrumental forgiveness, or forgiveness in fellowship.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>I believe that this is related to God s government.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Suppose a brother is sick because of God s governmental hand.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>He has sinned and has fallen, and God is disciplining him.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Although he has confessed his sins and has been forgiven and restored to fellowship, God s disciplining hand has not been lifted.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>He has to wait for the elders of the church to come to him and make petition on his behalf, saying, The brothers have forgiven his sins.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>We expect to see him rise up again.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>The church would like to see such a brother being recovered to the flow of life.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Therefore, we anoint his body with oil that the ointment of the Head may flow to him once more.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>When the church does this to the sick one, he will be restored.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>In many cases, a person may have sinned and offended God s government.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>As soon as God removes His governmental hand from such a person, his sickness will be healed.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>When God removes His governmental hand, we have the fulfillment of the word, If he has committed sins, it will be forgiven him.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>This sin is different from other ordinary sins.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>In our reading of the Bible, we must realize that James 5 is a chapter on governmental forgiveness.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>If we fall under God s governmental hand, He will not let us go until we are fully forgiven.</S>
