   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Whenever we go through a trial, we go through it with the view of eventually transcending it.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The more trials we have, the more strength we find to meet the trials.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Through this process our spirits are strengthened.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Whenever we go through an experience, our spirits are strengthened.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The more experiences we go through, the stronger our spirits become.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Through the discipline of the Holy Spirit, the Lord breaks our outer man again and again.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>When the outer man is broken, the inner man is empowered to overcome all obstacles.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>When the hammer falls on us, it breaks and shatters our outer man.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>But the same hammer becomes something which our spirit overcomes.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>When the Lord puts us in an environment, our outer man is broken.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Our outer man cannot withstand any trial.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Whenever a trial comes, our outer man is broken.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The more trials we have, the more our outer man is broken.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>At the same time, the spirit prevails over these environments.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The environment prevails over our outer man, but our inner man prevails over the environment at the same time.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Through this process we are delivered from the environment and eventually overcome it.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>This is what happens when we go through trials.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The same thing is repeated whenever we face a trial: The Lord first gives us a trial and puts us under it.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>We experience the breaking of the outer man, but the experience does not stop there.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Our inner man rises up to overcome the environment, and we emerge on the other side.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The trial which overcomes our outer man is eventually overcome by our inner man.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Whenever we go through an experience, our spirit receives some training.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>It becomes more aggressive; it learns a little more of the Lord's grace and His Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>In other words, it becomes stronger than before.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>When our spirit is trained and becomes strong, we will have a usable spirit in our ministry of the word.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>On the one hand, a minister of the word must experience the breaking down of the outer man.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>On the other hand, his spirit has to be trained to be strong and useful.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>This work can only be accomplished by the discipline of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>When we go through a trial, we have to remember that such a trial makes us different in the end. Either we will become stronger or become worse.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Either we will murmur against God in our trial and remain defeated or we will come out of it in full victory.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>We should refuse to come out of it in defeat.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Second Corinthians 12 shows us that when a thorn comes, God gives us the grace to overcome the thorn.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>In the past we knew a little about grace, but we did not know the kind of grace that comes with the thorn.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Every trial comes with its thorn-laced blow so that we can experience the thorn-laced grace.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>What we knew before was a thornless grace; what we know now is a thorn-laced grace.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>We are like a boat that floats in two feet of water.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>As long as the water remains two feet deep, we can sail through it quite easily.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>But if there is a rock that is two feet high in the middle of the stream, the boat cannot go through.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>At such times we need to ask the Lord to raise the water level by two feet.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>When we know more grace, our spirit becomes stronger.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Paul said that he would "rather boast in...weaknesses" 2 Cor 12:9 .</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Whenever a weakness comes, we are empowered, and we can serve as a minister of the word by this power.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Different ministers of the word have different degrees of spiritual power because they experience different kinds of building work.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The words of the ministers may be the same, but their spirits are different.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>If we want to use our spirit, it must first become strong.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>We may be trained, but the extent to which we have been trained determines the extent to which our spirit can be used.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>This extent varies in different people.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The degree to which our spirit is trained determines the extent to which we can be used as a minister of the word.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Whenever a minister of the word encounters a trial or an affliction, he should realize that God is using it to prepare him to be His minister.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>We should not be so foolish as to think that it is best to escape.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>The more we run away, the less things will work out for us.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>We should always remember that without the thorn, there will never be the grace or the power, and the sphere of our service will be very much confined.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>We may still speak, but we will not have the spirit to release the word.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>We may have the word, but we must still have a properly functioning spirit to accompany the word.</S>
