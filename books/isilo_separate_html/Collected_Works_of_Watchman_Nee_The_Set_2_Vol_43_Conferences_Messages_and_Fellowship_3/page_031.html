What should we do now that the old man has been crucified? Romans 6:11 says, "So also you, reckon yourselves to be dead to sin, but living to God in Christ Jesus." We should reckon ourselves to be dead in Christ, and also reckon ourselves to be resurrected in Christ. We should reckon ourselves to be dead to sin and living to God in Christ.</p><p>What does reckoning mean? We know that men often are not that accurate in the way they speak or write. No one can guarantee that what is recorded as history or in documentaries is one hundred percent accurate. The most that one can say is that the records are very close to the facts. The most accurate human knowledge is mathematics. Mathematics is the only exact knowledge. Two plus two equals four. It is very precise. You cannot discount a little by saying that two plus two equals three, or inflate a little by saying that two plus two equals five. All the kindergartners and university students on the earth alike will say that two plus two equals four. You cannot say that two plus two equals five just because you have a doctorate degree. On this earth nothing is more precise than mathematics.</p><p>God wants us to reckon ourselves to be dead because we are truly dead. Four means four. If it is not four, we cannot say it is four. Whatever we have, we can only say what we have. We can reckon ourselves to be dead because we are actually dead. Suppose you are the bookkeeper of a business. If your accounting shows a loss of twenty thousand dollars, you have to report it as such. You cannot change the twenty-thousand-dollar loss into a twenty-thousand-dollar profit. The accounting book must match the income and loss of the business precisely. If God tells us to reckon ourselves to be dead, it means that we are truly dead. Only genuine death can be considered as death. If you have not died, you cannot reckon yourself to be dead.</p><p>The reckoning in the Bible is an act of faith. How do we reckon? We reckon by faith. We know that when the Lord was crucified, He took our old man along. The one who was without hope, the one who was full of sins and filth, was crucified on the cross of the Lord. Perhaps you still consider yourself to be alive and not dead. This means that you do not have faith.</p><h2 class="head1">FAITH IN GOD'S WORD, NOT IN ONE'S FEELINGS</h2><p>I have always felt that the thing which is most lacking among believers today is faith. There is the knowledge of the truth, but the real experience often does not match the knowledge. Because of the lack of living faith (Heb. 4:2), there is always a gap between what one knows and what he experiences. If one has a living faith, everything will be reality to him. But if he does not have faith, the truth will remain the truth. He will remain separate from the truth, and the two will never be joined together. If we have genuine faith, all the truth will become reality to us. God says that we are dead in Christ. If we believe, we will find that we are truly dead.</p><p>Two years ago a Western missionary who had several children came to me, saying, "Mr. Nee, I do not know how I can make it. If one of my children cries, I can bear it. But if another one cries, I lose my patience. My patience can only endure one child, not two. If two of them cry at the same time, I lose my temper. Mr. Nee, what can I do? I see that I am still alive; I am not dead at all. This is the reason for my failure. If I were truly dead, everything would be just fine." I smiled at her and said, "When has God ever said that you are dead in yourself? God has never said this. God has said that you are dead in Christ. If your eyes are upon yourself, you will always be very much alive. If you look at Christ, you will find that you are truly dead. Many people know the truth of crucifixion with Christ, but when they look at themselves, they find that they are not yet dead. God has never told us that we can look at ourselves and find ourselves dead simply by listening to a message. This is to live according to feeling, not according to faith. Faith is looking at Christ, not at ourselves. Faith sees ourselves in Christ, not in ourselves. As believers we should never look at ourselves. We should only consider ourselves in Christ."</p><p>We can only believe in the facts in Christ. We cannot believe in ourselves. Satan will continue to tempt us. He will tell us that we are alive. We find that we are still alive when we are in ourselves. Satan will cause us to look at ourselves. He will deceive us, saying, "God may say that you are dead, but you are not dead!" If we look at ourselves, we will see that we are not dead indeed. However, should we believe God's word or our feeling? God says that we are dead in Christ, but Satan says that we are not dead. When we look at ourselves, it may seem as if we are not dead. Should we believe God's word, or should we believe our own feelings? This is the difference between having and not having a living faith. We know that God says that we are dead. Should we believe God or should we believe our own feeling? Is God's word true or is our own experience true? We should believe God's word. This is faith. If we have a living faith, even if it seems that we are alive, we can say, "Even though I feel this way, I do not believe that I am alive. I do not believe my own feelings. I believe God's word. God says that I am dead, and I am dead." What is a living faith? It is laying hold of God's word. Only God's word is real. Our feeling and experience will always change. But I believe that all the works of God have been accomplished in Christ already.</p><p>Our problem today is that we only see that we are alive. When we only see that we are alive, we have let go of God's word. When our senses are filled with our own feelings, we have put aside God's word. We may feel that we are alive, but these feelings are contrary to God's word; therefore, we should not believe our feelings. Rather, we should only believe God's word. If we do this, we will find deliverance. Tens and thousands of people have heard this truth, but most of them just know the truth; they do not have a living faith, and everything is vain for them.</p><p>Our mind cannot render us any help. When temptation comes, our mind wonders what we should do to act dead. But such endeavors only prove that we do not have any faith at all. It is not a matter of whether or not we can believe that we are dead in Christ. We do not have to die; we are dead al- ready. We do not have to do anything; everything is done already. We do not have to inwardly resist temptation; we only need to believe God's word. If a business has gained some profit, the account will surely reflect a profit. God says that I am dead. What should I do? I should reckon myself to be dead. Many people think that once they die, everything will be settled. Actually they died long ago. Everything has been accomplished in Christ. There is no need for me to die, because I am already dead.</p><p>If I am not genuinely dead, how can God reckon me to be dead? If the business is losing money, how can the owner ask me to record a profit? Only when I am truly dead can God reckon me to be dead. God would not ask me to cheat in the accounting. Thank God! In Christ I am truly dead. Whether or not I experience it, my old man is dead already. Temptation will not add anything to the work of Christ. The work of Christ is fully accomplished, whether or not we have the experience. We only need to reckon ourselves to be dead. Where there is faith, there is the experience. Without faith there cannot be the real experience. Suppose temptation comes and you are stirred up within. At such times do you believe in the stirring within or do you believe in God's word? You will be tested immediately as to whether you believe in God or in your own feelings.</p><p>Believing God does not mean believing in evidence. Faith does not require evidence. Anything real does not need the proof of evidence. Those who are trustworthy have no need of evidence. If I lent money to the president, there would be no need for him to give me a guarantee. If I lent money to a taxi driver, I would require someone to guarantee the loan because the loan might not be repaid. God's word has no need of a guarantee. What He speaks stands because He is the great and most high God. He is real. What He speaks stands forever (Heb. 6:13). Our feelings will tell us that we are not dead and that we are still sinning. When this happens, what will we believe? Will we believe that we are dead in Christ or that we are still alive in our feelings? All those who believe that they are dead in Christ are blessed; all the problems will be resolved.</p><p>A living faith believes in God's word rather than in the doctrine. If you only know the doctrine, it will stay in your mind and not have any effect on you. You must believe God's word. You must reject everything that belongs to the self and believe that God has accomplished everything. When temptation comes, you may be stirred up because you realize that you are proud, unclean, anxious, unhappy, and jealous. What should you do? Those who have faith will praise God and say, "Although I cannot rejoice, I am still dead. Although I lose my temper, I am still dead. Although my feelings are contrary to God's word, I will still praise God. God has accomplished everything in Christ." If you believe that you are in Christ and that you are truly joined to Him, you will jump up and shout, "Praise God, I am dead!"</p><p>The difficulty today is that we only see "truths"; we do not see God's work. We only see the truth without seeing the real thing behind the truth. This is like studying geography without ever visiting the places. You must have revelation, and God's light must enlighten you before you will see your position in Christ. You do not see it now, and that is why you cannot believe. Suppose I go and hide in a room. You will believe that I am in the room because you saw me go in. Today you cannot see yourself as dead. On the contrary, you see that you have not died at all. Regardless of how you look at yourself, the old man is still alive. But thank God, although you cannot see it, you can believe it because you know that you are one with Him. When He died, you died with Him also. You cannot say that He is dead but you are still alive. Suppose I throw a soft-drink bottle into the sea. Wherever the bottle is, there is the drink within the bottle. You cannot say that the bottle is in the sea yet the drink in the bottle is at the YMCA or at Brother Wong's house. Where the bottle is, there also is the drink. God has put you into Christ. Since Christ has died, you have died also.</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_030.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_032.html">Next</a> </body></html>
