   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Ask and it shall be given to you; seek and you shall find Luke 11:9 .</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>If we ask, the Lord promised that it shall be given to us.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Therefore, our prayers are answered, not because we cry until the Lord softens His heart and responds.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Rather, He answers us because of His promise.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>His promise is the basis for our prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>2.</S>

   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The Lord s promise concerning prayer is very broad.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>As long as we are abiding in the Lord and praying in His name, He will do whatever we ask.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>3.</S>

   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>If we call upon God and pray to Him, He will listen to us.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>This is His word of promise.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>We should be full of faith, boldly call upon Him, and pray to Him because of His promise.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>4.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Open your mouth wide, and I will fill it Psa 81:10 .</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>This great promise speaks of God s desire for us to pray.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>According to His promise, He will fill our mouth if we open it wide.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>This should cause us to pray to God in great measure with assurance.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>All of these verses show that God promises to answer our prayers.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Since He has given us such promises, it is easy for our prayers to be answered.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The Power with Which God Answers</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>1.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>To Him who is able to do superabundantly above all that we ask or think, according to the power which operates in us Eph 3:20 .</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>God answers our prayer by His power.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>God s power is two-sided.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>One side is according to His life; the other side is according to His arm.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The power of His life is within us, accomplishing our prayers concerning spiritual matters of life.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The power of His arm is outside of us, accomplishing our prayers concerning environmental matters and things.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>His two-sided power is able to do superabundantly above all that we ask or think.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The Time in Which God Answers</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>1.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Before they call, I will answer; / Even while they are speaking, I will hear Isa 65:24 .</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Sometimes God answers us before we pray, and He hears us while we are praying.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>2.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>From the first day that you set your heart to understand this matter...your words were heard Dan 10:12 .</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>On the first day that Daniel prayed, his prayer was heard by God, but he did not know of God s answer until twenty-one days later, because the angel coming with the answer met with resistance from Satan s angel.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>This shows that sometimes God s answer to our prayer can be delayed by Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Like Daniel, we should endure in prayer to overcome obstacles from Satan so that we may see God s answer.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>3.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>He remained...for two days John 11:6, see also vv.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>3, 21 .</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>When Lazarus was sick, Martha and Mary, his sisters, sent some to tell the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>When the Lord heard about Lazarus, He remained for two days before He came.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Consequently, the two sisters felt that the Lord had come too late, that He had done something wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>However, the Lord waited for two days because He had His own plan.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>He wanted to wait until Lazarus had died and was buried so that He would have an opportunity to express His resurrection power.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Therefore, the Lord s answer to prayer, whether early or late, is always according to His plan.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>4.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Will not God...carry out the avenging of His chosen ones, who cry to Him day and night, though He is long-suffering over them?</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Luke 18:7 .</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Sometimes God waits a long time before answering our prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>While we are waiting, it seems as if He is ignoring our prayer, but eventually He gives us an answer.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>The time that He takes to answer our prayer is in His hands.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>If He thinks that it is better to be quick, He will answer quickly.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>If He thinks that it is better to be slow, He will answer slowly.</S>

   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>1.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>What man is there among you who, when his son asks him for a loaf, will give him a stone?</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Or also when he asks for a fish, will give him a serpent?...How much more will your Father who is in the heavens give good things to those who ask Him!</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Matt 7:9-11 .</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>God s wisdom means that He is never wrong when He answers our prayers.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Sometimes we ask wrongly, but He still answers correctly.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Sometimes we think a stone is bread and a serpent is a fish, and so we ask for them.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>But God still gives us bread and fish.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>He gives us the correct things, the good things.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>A brother who was going from a Western country to Africa to preach the gospel asked the Lord to give him a healthy body so that he could suffer in Africa.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>One day he fell and broke his leg.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>The break was so bad that it could not heal; eventually, he was given a wooden leg.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>He did not understand why the Lord allowed this to happen, but when he was in Africa, some natives saw him and wanted to eat him.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>When he could not escape their pursuit, he gave them his wooden leg to eat.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>When they tasted it, they let him go.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>Then he understood that God had answered his prayer by giving him a wooden leg that would save his life.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>Sometimes God s answers to our prayer do not seem appropriate.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>We even think that He is wrong, but the subsequent facts prove that His answers are indeed appropriate and correct.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>Thank God, we may be wrong, but He is never wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>We may ask wrongly, but He never gives the wrong thing.</S>

   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>We often do not know what we are asking.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>But the Lord in His wisdom knows what we need, so He gives according to our need.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>We ask for patience, but He gives us suffering.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>He knows that sufferings bring in endurance.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>He does not answer our prayers according to our concept but according to His wisdom.</S>
