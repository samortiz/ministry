   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Brothers, do not misunderstand me.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>I am not saying that we can all follow the example of 1 Corinthians 7.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In the whole Bible, only 1 Corinthians 7 presents such a noble example.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>If the Lord has no leading for us to speak in this way, however, it is a gross error for us to speak this way.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>First Corinthians 7 shows us the kind of person Paul was.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>This helps us to understand the books of Ephesians, Colossians, Romans, and Galatians.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>First Corinthians 7 reveals the person of Paul; it shows us the person who wrote Ephesians, Galatians, etc. We know that the book of Colossians is very high, but 1 Corinthians 7 tells us about the person who wrote Colossians.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Romans contains a clear exposition of the gospel, but 1 Corinthians 7 tells us about the person who wrote Romans.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>This is what makes 1 Corinthians 7 precious.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>In this chapter we clearly see a man whose feelings, thoughts, opinions, and words were worthy of God's trust.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>When God's word was put into him, this word became the highest revelation; it did not suffer any corruption.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>If we did not have 1 Corinthians 7, we could only know what the Holy Spirit had done through Paul; we would not know what the Holy Spirit had done in Paul.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>First Corinthians 7 shows us a man whose feelings, thoughts, and words are all trustworthy.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>When God's word came upon this man, there was no frustration to the word, just as there was no frustration during those times when God's word was not active in such a person.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>If we are not trustworthy, we become a frustration even when we have God's word.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The Lord cannot commit His revelation and light to some because they are not trustworthy.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>He cannot acknowledge them as ministers of the word because their thoughts, feelings, opinions, and words are not trustworthy.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Brothers, some of Paul's Epistles, like Romans, Galatians, and Colossians, show us high revelations.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>His Epistle to the Ephesians even shows us the highest revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Yet in the two Epistles to the Corinthians, we find the kind of person to whom God would commit His revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Paul was qualified to receive these revelations because of the kind of person he was.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>If we only had his other Epistles, without having 1 Corinthians 7, we would not know the kind of person Paul was.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>He was a faithful and trustworthy person.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>That is the reason that God's revelation did not suffer any corruption in him.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>In fact, there was so much glory in his constitution that his style was adopted to perfect God's word.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Paul's personality and idiomatic expressions all contributed to God's word; they made the latter more glorious and rich.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>What a glory that man can be used by God and that his human elements can be used by Him without compromising the perfection of God's word, but instead enhancing its glory, riches, and perfection!</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>May God be merciful to us so that He can use us and release His word through us.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>No need is greater today than the need for the word.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>May all the brothers see that there is a pathway that must be followed in order to be a minister of God's word.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>We have to beseech God to grant us much light, word, and inner dealings.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>We need deep and profound dealings.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>We need to be molded deeply, inwardly, and thoroughly.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Even our most delicate feelings have to be faithful to God.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>When these feelings are expressed, they will be regarded as the Lord's very own feelings.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>When our inclinations are expressed, they will be regarded as the result of the work of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Our own love and patience will flow out, yet this love and patience will be the fruit of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>This fruit will be the result of the frequent, deep, and thorough work of the Holy Spirit in us.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Through His operation in us we can bear this fruit.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>When we are constituted with the Holy Spirit, fruit is expressed in a spontaneous way.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Brothers, as the Holy Spirit performs His work in us and as we are being reconstituted by the Spirit, our feelings spontaneously become the Spirit's feelings, our thoughts become His thoughts, and our opinions become His opinions.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>When this happens, God will commit His word to us and allow us to transmit it to others.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Others will acknowledge it as God's word, and God will receive the greatest glory.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The fundamental question today is whether or not God can commit Himself to us.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>We have to see that the problem is not with His word but with the ministers.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Without the ministers, there is no word of God.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Today God is still speaking just as He did in earlier days.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>He has no intention of annulling the prophetic ministry in the church.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Neither does He have the intention of removing the teaching ministry or the evangelistic ministry from the church.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>The biggest problem today is the scarcity of ministers.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Whether or not there is ministry in the church and whether or not this ministry can be multiplied depend on us; the responsibility is on our shoulders.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>May we awake to the fact that the poverty and darkness of the church are related to us.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>May we pledge to the Lord solemnly, "Lord!</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>I am willing to be broken.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Break me so that Your word can get through in me."</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>May the Lord be gracious to us.</S>
