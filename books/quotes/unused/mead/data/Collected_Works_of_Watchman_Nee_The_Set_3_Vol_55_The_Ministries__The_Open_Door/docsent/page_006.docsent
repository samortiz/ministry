   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>All Should Obey before Doing</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>We ask every person in the church to practice obedience.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>We should ask before doing anything.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>There is order and authority here.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The church is a place of firm discipline.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>We must see that after man's fall, he became very loose.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>May God have mercy on us that none would forsake his service or act in disobedience.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Witness Lee</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>In April of last year we felt that we should build a meeting hall.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>At that time a budget of three hundred million yuan appeared to be a large sum to us.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Some of the brothers and sisters gave their all out of their love for the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>We announced last September that we would not work according to the so-called way of faith but would ask the brothers and sisters to take the way of responsibility.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The amount of responsibility the brothers and sisters would bear would determine the extent of our efforts.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>At the time there were three pieces of land.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>We classified them into three categories.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>If the offerings from the brothers and sisters were sufficient to buy the first piece of land, we would buy it.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>If they were sufficient only to buy the second, we would buy the second.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>If they were not sufficient for the second piece of land, we would buy the third piece of land.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>We wanted to see which piece of land God wanted us to buy.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>We continued this way for six months.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Many times it appeared that we would succeed, but then we found that we fell short again.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Today what God has given us truly surpasses what we could ask or think.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>He has given us the first choice.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>A First-class Piece of Land</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Although we went through a period of darkness, God has given to us according to His good will.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>We have truly learned something in this.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The land now is at 145 Tung-ren Street formerly Hardoon Road , Nan-yang Road.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>We have recently closed the transaction on it.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The land is slightly more than 4.7 Chinese acres.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>There is a western-style house on the property already.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>We are preparing to build a meeting hall with the capacity for five thousand people.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>All Those with a Burden</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>for the New Meeting Hall</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Brothers and sisters, if you did not give anything before, you can still give something now if you want to.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Zu</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>I would like to add a few words concerning the building of the meeting hall.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>This piece of land cost approximately 130 million.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>We plan to start building in August.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Presently, we are working on the design.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>We still need about ninety or one hundred million more.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>We must look to the Lord for this need.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>There is another matter.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Some consecration pledges, listing items of consecration which the brothers and sisters have handed in, have not yet been liquidated.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>It would be best if these brothers and sisters would dispose of these items by themselves.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Killing, Skinning, and Cutting</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>the Offerings by Themselves</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>I just thought of one passage in the Old Testament where the people brought their offerings for sacrifices.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>They had to kill, skin, and cut the offerings themselves.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Your giving something is your bringing the sacrifice to the Lord as a burnt offering.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>If it needs to be sold for cash, you need to sell it yourself.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Aside from the money we need for the meeting hall, we also need one or two automobiles.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>They will cost several billion.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>The printing work also needs two billion.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>These needs are desperate.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Therefore, now is the time for the brothers and sisters to begin skinning the burnt offerings which they have brought.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>No Centralization of Finance</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>As a final point, we will not have any centralization of finance in the future.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>All the brothers and sisters should be living for the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Their money and property should also be used for the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Except for what is needed for living and business, the rest of our money and property should be offered according to the Lord's leading.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>There are four areas for which you can offer your money: the local church, individual saints, the work, and the workers.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>You can follow the Lord's leading to give to any of these four areas.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Perhaps you will be led to make an offering for the local need, an offering for another local church, an offering for the work in your own region or in another region , or an offering to support the workers in your own region or in another region .</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>You might also be led to give to some needy brothers and sisters, or you might be led to give alms to the poor.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>You are not the only ones who should practice such offerings; the local church, the co-workers, and even the work can all be led to give to any of these areas.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>This is something done in life, something that requires the Lord's leading.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>God likes this.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>However, the money which the brothers and sisters have given this time has mainly been used for the purchase and construction of the new meeting hall in Shanghai.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>May God have mercy on us in this matter.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>May God also bless us in His mercy.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Witness Lee</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Recorded by Tao</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>May 29, 1948</S>
