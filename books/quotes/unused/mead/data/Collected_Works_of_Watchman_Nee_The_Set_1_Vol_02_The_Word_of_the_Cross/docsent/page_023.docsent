   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>II.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>NOT SEEKING THE LORD'S WILL</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>BY TAKING THE SCRIPTURES OUT OF CONTEXT</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>God's will has been fully declared in the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>All those who seek to know His will can find His intention concerning any matter through searching the Scriptures.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>But many believers take one or two verses and consider that to be God's will and act accordingly.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>They do not care what the Bible as a whole has to say concerning this matter.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>This is very dangerous.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Consider Matthew 4:7: "Jesus said to him, Again, it is written."</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Again!</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Again!</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Again it is written!</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The devil can tempt by quoting the Scriptures.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>If the Lord was like believers today, He would have considered the devil's words the words of the Bible and followed them.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Did He do this?</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>No, He did not.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>He considered the teaching of the whole Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>He said, "Again, it is written."</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Therefore, if we want to seek after God's will, we must not take things out of context.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>We must not choose some verses randomly and think that they are the teaching of the Bible!</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>We must always consider if there are other teachings in the Bible that have more to say about the matter in view and not decide in a rash way.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The devil is the same today as he was then; he will use many isolated verses to deceive man, cause man to listen to one-sided truths, and do many things which are against the Bible and God's will.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Some believers are quite peculiar in the way they quote verses out of context.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>For them, reading the Bible is a kind of fortune-telling.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>When something comes along and they do not know what to do, they open up the Bible and pray, "Lord, I am about to do something, and I do not know if this is according to Your will.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>I will open the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The first verse that catches my eyes will be Your instruction to me."</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Some may say, "I will open the Bible, and whatever verse my finger points to will be Your will."</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Still others may say, "When I open the Bible, a certain number of verses down or up from my finger will be Your will."</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>This kind of soothsaying style of seeking after God's will is bound to be filled with errors.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Satan can easily make our fingers slip to the wrong verse or wrong page.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>He can devise many ways and supply many opportunities for us to fall into his traps.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>It may be that we should stay in a place, but the devil can make us move away.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>It may be that we should say something, but the devil can make us shut up.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>It is entirely against God's will to make the Bible a fortune-telling book.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>It is very difficult to know God's will with a method that is far from His will!</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>We should never seek after the Lord's will this way.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>We have to spend much time in the Bible in our daily life so that we can know the teaching of the Bible concerning a certain matter.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>When things happen, we will not be caught by surprise and not pick a verse hastily, taking it as God's will and acting accordingly.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>III.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>NOT PROCEEDING WITH THINGS</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>THAT DO NOT BRING PEACE TO THE HEART</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>"And let the peace of Christ arbitrate in your hearts" Col 3:15 .</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>"You will keep the steadfast of mind / In perfect peace / Because he trusts in You" Isa 26:3 .</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>If we encounter some difficulty and do not know God's will, a good principle is to consider if we will have the peace afterwards.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>If we will not have the peace, we should not do it.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The meaning of peace is not a sensation of peace.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>It means an unchanging and normal calmness in our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>If by doing a certain thing, we will lose the calmness in our spirit, it is better that we do not do it.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>However, this is not an absolute indicator.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Sometimes we feel peaceful when we do things that we ought not to do, and we are restless when we do not do them.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Satan can work in our feelings to give us a false peace or false restlessness and cause us to do what he wants.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Therefore, in considering if a matter is according to God's will, we should regard the matter of peace as a partial factor for consideration and should not trust in it completely.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>IV.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>NOT CONSIDERING SOMETHING AS GOD'S WILL</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>BASED ON CIRCUMSTANCES OR NEEDS</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Many people consider their circumstances when they seek after God's will.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Their circumstances are their only guide.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>The result of this practice is confusion and failure.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>We can look at the story of Jonah.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>God's will was for Jonah to go to Nineveh, but Jonah wanted to go to Tarshish.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>When he reached Joppa, he met a ship which was sailing for Tarshish, paid the fare, and went aboard.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>The Bible says, "But Jonah rose up to flee to Tarshish from the presence of Jehovah, and he went down to Joppa and found a ship going to Tarshish.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>So he paid the fare for it and went down into it to go with them to Tarshish from the presence of Jehovah" Jonah 1:3 .</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>If Jonah had considered the circumstances, he surely would have thought that it was God's will for him to go to Tarshish!</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Otherwise, why else would the circumstances have worked out so well for him?</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>The first part of verse 3 says that he intended to go to Tarshish, and immediately there was a ship going there v. 3b . He had money in his pocket and could pay the fare.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>The circumstances were absolutely favorable for taking this way.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>If a Christian was put in these circumstances, he would surely say that he was walking according to God's will.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>"When I do this, my relatives agree with me, I do not lose my natural friendships, and I can serve the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>There is no need to spend too much time or money, and the accomplishments are great.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>I can go when I want to go and stop when I want to stop.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>There is no hindrance whatsoever in the environment.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>Is this not God's leading for me?"</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>Little does he realize that he has gone astray from God's will.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>Truly I say, the ships to Tarshish are numerous, and money for the fare is plentiful!</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>Yet neither the ship nor the money can guarantee that your journey to Tarshish is the right one.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>God's will is for you to go to Nineveh.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>Therefore, in seeking after the Lord's will, you must not merely consider the circumstance.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>Otherwise you will be led into the wrong path.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>Another great attracting force in the environment is certain needs.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>Many times, we think that there is a need or a lack, that we are well qualified to meet the need, and that we should go to render help to the situation.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>"I may be short of training in theology.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>But there is an opportunity to meet my need.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>Perhaps this is God's provision for me."</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>A common mistake of most believers today is to take the need in the environment as their indicator.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>Their slogan is, "We have to do it, because this matter has to be done."</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>Little do they realize that what is needed may not be what God wants them to do.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>Consider Paul and his companions: "Having been forbidden by the Holy Spirit to speak the word in Asia...they tried to go into Bithynia, yet the Spirit of Jesus did not allow them" Acts 16:6-7 .</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>Before verse 6 of this chapter, they did many works in many places.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>Believers were edified and sinners received salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>They were going to go to Asia which is today's Asia Minor .</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>It seemed as if there was a great need there.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>Many people had not heard the gospel of the Lord Jesus' dying for man's sin and on man's behalf.</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>There were so many needs.</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>It seemed that God was leading them to go to Asia.</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>Yet in reality this was not the case.</S>
   <S PAR='98' RSNT='1' SNO='98'>The Spirit of the Lord did not allow them to go.</S>
   <S PAR='99' RSNT='1' SNO='99'>The same was true when they wanted to go to Bithynia; the Spirit of Jesus did not allow them.</S>
   <S PAR='100' RSNT='1' SNO='100'>Therefore, in seeking after God's will, we cannot depend too much on needs, and we cannot be attracted by them to the extent that we lose sight of God's will.</S>
