   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER ELEVEN CONFIRMED BY THE LORD S TEACHING Scripture Reading: Matt 11:18-19; 12:1-14, 39-42 THE LIFE OF WISDOM</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>We have seen four cases from the New Testament concerning service.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The first case was the conceiving and bringing forth of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The second case was that of finding Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The third case was the testifying for Christ, and the fourth case was following Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>All of these cases have illustrated clearly, adequately, and completely that the New Testament service is outside of religion.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Some may say that this is simply our way to interpret these four cases; therefore, we do need confirmation from the Lord s own teaching.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>In this chapter we will see the clear and plain word of the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>By this we will see that the way we have interpreted these four cases is soundly confirmed by the Lord s teaching.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>In the above passages, there are four cases that reveal something of the Lord s teaching concerning the New Testament service.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The first case is related to John the Baptist.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>For John came neither eating nor drinking, and they say, He has a demon.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The Son of Man came eating and drinking, and they say, Behold, a gluttonous man and a wine drinker, a friend of tax collectors and sinners.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>And wisdom has been justified by her works Matt 11:18-19 .</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>John came neither eating nor drinking.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>This does not mean that John did not eat anything.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>We are told that he ate strange things such as locusts and wild honey.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>What the Lord meant is that John did not come eating and drinking in the cultural way.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>He did not eat in the way that people were accustomed to; he did not come eating according to tradition.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Surely he did a lot of drinking, but he did not drink any drink in the way of culture.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>In other words, in his eating and drinking there was no culture, no civilization, and no tradition; he did not eat and drink according to man s system or culture.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>What did people say about John?</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>They thought that he had lost his mind, and they said that he had a demon, that he was demon-possessed.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>By looking at the way he ate, drank, and lived, they thought that he had lost his mind and that he was possessed by a demon.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Then Jesus said that the Son of Man came eating and drinking.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>This was also not normal in the eyes of the people because He was eating and drinking more than they thought He should.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>He was feasting with the publicans and the sinners.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Therefore, they said that He was a gluttonous man and a wine drinker.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>John was at one extreme, and Jesus was at the other.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Which one was right?</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Is it right to eat contrary to human culture, or is it right to feast even with the sinners?</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>We may think that it would be better to compromise a little and to be somewhere in the middle, not at either extreme.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>However, let me say a word at this point.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>In the Lord s salvation, there is no compromise.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Eventually, you will be either in the New Jerusalem or outside of it.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>If there is no compromise, then what should we do?</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Should we follow John or Jesus?</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The Lord Jesus said nothing about following one or the other in this matter.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>In this aspect, there are no rules for living.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>What He said is that wisdom has been justified by her works, or justified by her children.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>We need to be the children of wisdom; and wisdom, no doubt, is Christ Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Children are those who have the life of the parents.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>To be a child is a matter of life; therefore, the children of wisdom are those who have the life of wisdom.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Christ is justified by those who have His life.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>It is a matter of life; it is not a matter of eating and drinking the way John did, or the way Jesus did.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>We all should eat and drink by following the life of Christ within us.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Should we eat and drink in a wild way like John, or should we feast like the Lord Jesus did?</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The answer is simply to follow the life of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Because we are the children of wisdom, we have the life of wisdom, and wisdom is Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Because we have the life of Christ, we do not need to go along with any outward rules, but we need to go along with His life within us.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Let us apply this principle.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Today there is the so-called hippy type of living, and nearly all the hippies have long hair.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Suppose a hippy becomes a Christian.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Should he leave his hair long, or cut it short?</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Christians, of course, are not hippies, but neither are they non-hippies.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Christians are the children of wisdom.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>They have the wonderful life of Christ within them.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Therefore, they should not go along with the hippy way or with the non-hippy way.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>They should simply go along with the life of Christ within them.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>We who are Christians are men of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>We are those who have Christ as life.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Gentlemen condemn the hippies, and the hippies condemn the gentlemen, but we do not condemn anyone, nor do we justify anyone.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>We only justify the life of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Wisdom is justified by her children.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>We do not care for the gentleman-way or the hippy-way; we only care for Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Hallelujah!</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Christ as life is the rule of our living.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>If you consider yourself a gentleman, you may see all the hippies among us and think that we are a hippy-church.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>However, you need to take note that we also have many so-called gentlemen among us, but this does not mean that we are a gentleman-church.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>We should not be a gentleman-church or a hippy-church, but a Christ-church, a church full of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Some may ask why I have the gentlemen s style haircut and not the hippies style.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Let me tell you, before I made the decision to have my hair cut in this way, I had much contact with the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Eventually, my decision was made according to the inner life of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>The inner life of Christ directed me to cut my hair in this way.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>Because I cut my hair in this way does not mean that I am in favor of the gentlemen s way.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>If you ask me how you should cut your hair, I will simply tell you to go to the Lord and see what He tells you.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>Let the inner life of Christ decide for you.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>None of us has the position to criticize anyone.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>As long as something is not sinful, we have no right to judge it.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>Let the Lord Jesus do this.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>Here then with John the Baptist is a case showing us that the proper Christian life is outside of religion and culture.</S>
