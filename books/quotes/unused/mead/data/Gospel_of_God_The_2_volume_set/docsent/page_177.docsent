   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE BELIEVERS BEING THE GIFTS</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>GIVEN BY GOD TO THE LORD JESUS</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Seventh, there is another reason why we will not lose our salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In the Bible we see that a relationship exists between the Lord Jesus and God, and a relationship exists between the Lord and us.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Many Christians have not clearly seen the relationship between God, the Lord Jesus, and us sinners.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Therefore, they misunderstand and think that they can lose their salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>There is a wonderful word in the Bible that says we Christians, the saved sinners, are the gifts given by God to the Lord Jesus John 17:6 .</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The Father is here, and the Son is also here.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The Father gave the saved ones as gifts to the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>If God has given us as gifts to the Lord Jesus, is there the possibility for us to lose our salvation?</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>We have to consider the matter from two angles.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>First, God gave us to the Lord Jesus as a gift.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>If we were to perish and lose our salvation, if our salvation were not eternal, God's giving us to the Lord Jesus would become a joke on the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>This is like a mother giving soap bubbles to her son.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Have you ever played with soap bubbles?</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>One dips a tube into soapy water, blows on the tube, and out come the bubbles.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>We know that those bubbles will disappear in a few minutes.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>But when the son sees it, he will be thrilled; he will think that the ball is great fun.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>He does not know that it will break after a little while.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>If God were not omniscient, it might be possible for us to perish because God would not know whether our salvation would be temporary or permanent.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>But God is omniscient; He knows whether we will be saved eternally or temporarily.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>If God were not omniscient, it could be possible that He would give us as a soap bubble to the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>But if God is omniscient, He would know that after three or five years, that bubble would break.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>If He were to do that, He would simply be giving air to the Lord Jesus; He would not be giving a gift to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>God is an eternal God; whatever He does is eternal.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>If God gives us as a gift to the Lord Jesus, He cannot regard that as a token favor only.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Second, for God to do this would cause a problem to the Lord Jesus also.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Suppose God gave us to the Lord Jesus, but three or five years later we perished and lost our salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>To us, we would have lost it.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>But whose fault would it be that we lost it?</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>You could blame the gift given by God for being corruptible.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>But you could also blame the Lord Jesus for not being able to take care of it.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Many times people have sent me some very good gifts.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>When I was away from home, I lost one of them, or damaged them.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Either I can blame the gift for being poor, or I can blame myself for being careless in keeping it.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>God told the Lord Jesus that He gave those people to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>What would happen if one day those people were to become lost?</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>We cannot blame only God for giving the Lord Jesus a token favor, but we have to also blame the Lord Jesus for not being able to keep those whom God had given Him.</S>
