   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Lesson Seventeen THE MINGLED SPIRIT Scripture Reading 1 Cor 6:17; Rom 8:4; 2 Tim 4:22; 2 Cor 3:17; Rom 8:16.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Outline One spirit with the Lord Two spirits mingled as one No third nature produced The Spirit witnessing with our spirit Walking according to the mingled spirit Text</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Physically we were born of our parents, but when we were regenerated, we were "born of the Spirit" John 3:6 .</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>By believing in the Lord Jesus, our spirit was born of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The all-inclusive Spirit came into our spirit to regenerate it with the divine life.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>I. ONE SPIRIT WITH THE LORD</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>One of the greatest verses in the Bible, 1 Corinthians 6:17, says, "He that is joined to the Lord is one spirit."</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The implications of this verse are marvelous and far-reaching.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>We, the believers, are one spirit with the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>How tremendous!</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>This implies that we are in Him and that He is in us.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>It also implies that we and He have been mingled, blended organically, to become one in life.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>To be one spirit with the Lord implies that we and He are a living entity.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>We simply do not have words to explain the significance of this verse.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>To say that we are one spirit with the Lord definitely does not mean that we are deified.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>However, it certainly does imply the mingling of divinity with humanity.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>In the words of #501 in Hymns, "God mingled with humanity lives in me my all to be."</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>To be one spirit with the Lord means that we are blended with Him organically and mingled with Him in life.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The word translated spirit in Romans 8:4, and in several other verses in Romans 8, presents a problem to translators.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>It is hard to decide whether to regard spirit as referring to the Holy Spirit and capitalize it, or to consider that it is the human spirit and not capitalize it.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The spirit here refers to the mingled spirit, our spirit mingled with the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>We need another size letter to denote this, neither a capital letter nor a small one!</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>These two spirits, the divine and the human, have become one 1 Cor 6:17; 2 Tim 4:22; 2 Cor 3:17 .</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>A. Two Spirits Mingled as One</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The Lord today is the life-giving Spirit, and we have a human spirit purposely created by God that we may take Christ as the life-giving Spirit into us.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Now these two spirits have become one.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>This is wonderful!</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Our spirit is one with the Lord, because as the life-giving Spirit He indwells our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>But the Lord in our spirit is not like a drop of oil in water, never mingling with the water.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>He mingles with us in our spirit as tea mingles with water.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>This is why many times it is difficult to distinguish whether it is we or the Lord doing things.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>We have some burden, yet it seems the Lord wants to do it.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>It is because we are one with the Lord in our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>After tea is put into water, it is difficult to separate the tea from the water.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>That is why I call it tea-water.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>It is both tea and water.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The two mingle as one.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>In the same way, the Lord Jesus as the life-giving Spirit mingles with our spirit as one.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>He is in us, and we are in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>It seems that a brother is speaking, but while he is speaking, the Lord is also speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>He speaks within that brother.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>His speaking is the brother's speaking, and the brother's speaking is His speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Eventually, a mingled one is speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Praise the Lord!</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>We are really one spirit with the Lord.</S>
