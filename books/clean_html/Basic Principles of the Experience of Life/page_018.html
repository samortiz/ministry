<h2 class=head2>The Law of Sin in Our Members</h2><p>With this point of view, we may read Romans 7 and 8. Verse 18 in chapter seven says, “For I know that in me, that is, in my flesh, nothing good dwells; for to will is present with me, but to work out the good is not.” The phrase in my flesh explains and defines the phrase in me. As humans, we have three parts: the spirit, the soul, and the body. Due to the fall, the body became the flesh. The body was pure when created by God, but this body was poisoned by the nature of the devil, so it changed in nature, becoming the flesh.<p>We must be careful when reading this verse. It says, “In my flesh, nothing good dwells.” This does not mean that there is nothing good in our whole being. In other parts there may be something good. At least in the will there is something good because we have the intention to do good. To will to do good is present, but to perform it through the flesh is impossible. As far as the flesh is concerned, therefore, nothing good dwells in us.<p>Verse 19 begins, “For I do not do the good which I will.” We will to do good; we at least have a desire to do good. Even before we were regenerated, many times we had a desire to do good. When I was young and before I was regenerated, many times I had the desire to be obedient to my mother and to love her, and I willed to do so, but whether or not I was able to perform it was another matter.<p>Verse 19 continues, “But the evil which I do not will, this I practice.” By this word we can realize that in us human beings there are two tendencies. One is to will to do good and not evil, while the other is that we cannot perform it. We will to do good, but we cannot do it; we will not to do evil, but we do it. To will is present with us, but to perform it is another matter.<p>Verse 20 says, “But if what I do not will, this I do, it is no longer I that work it out but sin that dwells in me.” In the New Testament there are two verses that say “it is no longer I” but someone else. Galatians 2:20 says, “It is no longer I who live, but it is Christ who lives in me.” However, we should not think that just because it is no longer I, it is Christ. Before we were regenerated, there was someone else within us, and now even after we have been regenerated, this one is still within us.<p>In principle, the word sin in Romans 7:20 can be capitalized as a proper noun. For sin to dwell in us is different from simply being in us. A table may be in a room, but we cannot say that the table dwells in the room. Only something living can dwell. This very “Sin” is something living because it dwells within us, and it also reigns, rules, dominates, and exercises its power and authority. It is no longer we that work, but it is a living entity that dwells in us. We can at least say that this living entity is something of Satan, the enemy. It is not something created in us by God. God did not create man with such an item in him. This is something of Satan, something out of Satan, which was injected into the human life. Within the fallen human race there is something living, dwelling, ruling, dominating, and exercising its authority to subdue people.<p>By these verses we can realize that with humans as a fallen race there are two entities. One is the human himself, and the other is something else called sin, which dwells in people to force them to do something which they do not will to do. Today people like to talk much about independence, but not one human on this earth is independent. Everyone is dependent, either on God or on the evil one. Why do we will to do good, but we cannot do it, and will to not do evil, yet do it? It is because it is no more we. If we were only created persons, we would simply be ourselves. We would be independent and free. However, we have become fallen and complicated, so we are not free, and we can never be independent. We are dependent and complicated. We will to do good, but someone within us does not agree. We will not to do evil, but someone within us does it. Moreover, this someone is much stronger than we are.<p>This may be compared to marriage. Many times I have told the young brothers and sisters that marriage apparently is a matter of happiness, but strictly speaking and in fact, it is a bondage. To be married simply means that we are willing to be bound and to give up our liberty. When a certain young brother was about to be married, he was so happy. He came to me and said, “Thank the Lord, I am going to marry! After a few days, I will no longer be single.” I said, “Yes, brother, you will no longer be single, but you also will no longer be free. You will be bound by the dear one you are going to marry.” Apparently he agreed with me, but he still thought that my word was too extreme. A short time after the marriage, however, he came back to me with tears, saying, “Brother Lee, you were right. From the time I was a baby, I have always liked to have the windows open at night, but my dear wife strictly insists on closing the windows. I cannot sleep with the windows closed, and she cannot sleep with the windows open. Furthermore, she is stronger than I am, so I am subdued.” When we marry, we become complicated. In the same way, when we became fallen, an illegal marriage took place. Now we can never be independent. We may will to “open the window,” but sin does not do it. There is something within us other than us, which is living, dwelling, ruling, and truly awful.<p>Verse 21 says, “I find then the law with me who wills to do the good, that is, the evil is present with me.” There is a law, a natural force, with us. Whenever we try to do good, there is always a natural force, forcing us to act to the contrary. When I was young and my mother was ill, I said to myself beside her bed, “I have to love my dear mother,” but after only two hours, I lost my temper with her. I could will, but I could not perform. To will was present with me, but to perform was another matter. I found the law that whenever I tried to do good, evil was present with me.
