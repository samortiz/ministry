   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE DIVINE DISPENSING</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>My burden in this conference is to fellowship with you concerning the divine dispensing of the Divine Trinity.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>God is one, yet He has a distinction of three.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The purpose of the Divine Trinity is to work Himself into His created man.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Because He wants to enter into us, He has to be triune.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>He must be the Father, the Son, and the Spirit, at the same time being one entity.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>In the Bible, the book that speaks most thoroughly and clearly concerning God being triune is the Gospel of John.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Forty or more years ago, when I first went to Taiwan, a friend of mine once sent me a big watermelon.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>When my children saw it, they were very happy.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>They asked what should be done to it.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>I took the melon to the kitchen, cut it into pieces, and pressed it into juice.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Then I gave the drink to the children.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>In the end, the melon became part of the children's constitution.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Hence, in order that the whole melon could enter into the children through their little mouths, it had to pass through this process.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>In the same way, our God is triune for the purpose of working Himself into us.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>He is the Father, the whole melon.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>He is also the Son, being cut into pieces.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>He is also the Spirit, being pressed into juice.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>In order for a big melon to enter into man, it must pass through all these processes.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>These steps are the stages of the dispensing.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Not only does the melon need to be dispensed, but it must also be digested and assimilated into the constitution of man.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>In the same way, the Triune God the Father, the Son, and the Spirit has been processed to become the life-giving Spirit so that we can drink Him and so that He can become our element.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>This is the divine dispensing of the Divine Trinity.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>THE DIVINE TRINITY THE FATHER, THE SON, AND THE SPIRIT The Father Expressed in the Son the Son Being the Embodiment of the Father</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The Gospel of John speaks of the truth concerning the Triune God in a most profound way.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>First, it shows us that the Father is expressed in the Son.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>In other words, the Son is the embodiment of the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>In John 14, one of the Lord's disciples, Philip, said to the Lord, "Lord, show us the Father and it suffices us."</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Jesus said to him, "Am I so long a time with you, and you have not known Me, Philip?</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>He who has seen Me has seen the Father The words which I speak to you, I do not speak from Myself; but the Father who abides in Me, He does His works.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Believe Me that I am in the Father and the Father in Me" vv.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>8-11 .</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Hence, the Son is the embodiment of the Father, and He expresses the Father among the disciples.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The Son came in the name of the Father and worked in the name of the Father John 5:43; 10:25 .</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>This means that He and the Father are one John 10:30 .</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>He lives because of the Father John 6:57 , and the Father works in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The Son Realized as the Spirit the Spirit Being the Reality of the Son</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Following this, the Lord said again in John 14:16-20, "And I will ask the Father, and He will give you another Comforter, that He may be with you forever; even the Spirit of reality He abides with you and shall be in you.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>I will not leave you orphans; I am coming to you because I live, you shall live also.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>In that day you shall know that I am in My Father, and you in Me, and I in you."</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>This shows us that the Son is the embodiment and the expression of the Father, and that the Spirit is the reality and the realization of the Son.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The Father in the Son is expressed among the believers, and the Son becoming the Spirit is realized in the believers.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Hence, the Father is in the Son, and the Son becomes the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The Triune God has dispensed Himself into us to become our portion, so that we can enjoy Him as our everything in the Divine Trinity.</S>
