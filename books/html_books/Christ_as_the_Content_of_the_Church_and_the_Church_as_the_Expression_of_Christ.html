This means that Christ is the life of the church, the content of the church, and everything in the church. Also, the church is the expression of Christ. We need a full understanding of this matter. The church is not a religion but a living expression of Christ. We are not here to teach people how to be moral, to be good, or to behave in a better way. We are for ministering and imparting Christ into people and for bringing people into the Body of Christ to be built up as a living expression. This is absolutely different from our human concept. Of course, if we have Christ as our life to be His living expression, we will behave in the best way, having the highest standard of morality. But as the Body of Christ, we are not for the mere expression of morality. We are not for good behavior. We are for expressing Christ.<p>The four Gospels show us that while Christ was on earth, He undoubtedly was a good man, even the best man. But this good man is different from all the other good men on this earth. Confucius was a good man, but you do not have the sense of the presence of God or of the expression of God in his life. But when you read the life of Christ in the Gospels, you have the sense of God&#8217;s presence and of God&#8217;s expression. His life was not a mere expression of morality, but an expression of God and of God&#8217;s heart. He was a good man, not as an expression of morality but as an expression of God. Today the church must be good. The members of the church must have the highest standard of morality and of ethics, but our business is not to express morality or ethics. Our business and responsibility are to express Christ.<p>Our goodness must be Christ and the expression of Christ. Surely we should not be proud. We need to be humble, but our humility must be Christ. We have to honor and respect our parents, but this must not be a mere expression of honor or of our ethics. Our honor to our parents must be the expression of Christ. It should not be something out of us naturally, but something out of Christ spiritually.<p>We need to deny ourselves so that we do not live by ourselves but take Christ as our life and live by Christ (Matt. 16:24; Gal. 2:20; Phil. 1:20-21). We live by Christ to our parents, and this Christ is our honor to them. Thus, the honoring of our parents is an expression of Christ as our life lived out through us. This revelation is missing today among the Lord&#8217;s children. Most Christian teachers cannot differentiate between goodness as the expression of Christ and goodness in itself. Since we desire to take the way of the Lord&#8217;s recovery, we must be very clear that Christ as our content is the first main item of the church life. Christ is the life, the content, and everything in the church life, and the church is the expression of Christ.<h2 class=head1>CHRIST AS THE INWARD REALITY AND CONTENT OF THE CHURCH</h2><p>Ephesians 3:10 says that through the church the multifarious wisdom of God is made known to the rulers and the authorities in the heavenlies. This is something as an outward expression to show forth God&#8217;s multifarious wisdom, but this does not reveal to us the inward reality and content of the church. In order to see this inward aspect, we need to go on from the first part of Ephesians 3 to the last part. The last part shows us the inward reality and content of the church (vv. 14-19). In addition to the outward manifestation, we need the inward reality. The second part of Ephesians 3 is the heart, the central point, of the entire book of Ephesians.<p>Verse 16 says that our inner man, our regenerated spirit, needs to be strengthened. This is a condition, a term, for Christ&#8217;s working within us. When our inner man is strengthened, Christ can make His home in our hearts (v. 17). Christ came into our spirit, and our spirit has been regenerated, made alive. But to be alive is one thing, and to be strong is another thing. Whether or not our regenerated spirit has been strengthened is a problem. Many Christians do not have a strong spirit. Their spirit has not been strengthened. This is why the apostle Paul prayed for the strengthening of our inner man, our regenerated spirit. This is the condition that must be fulfilled for Christ to make His home in our hearts.<p>Our heart is composed of all the parts of our soul-the mind, emotion, and will-plus the conscience, a part of our spirit (Heb. 4:12; John 16:6, 22; Acts 11:23; Heb. 10:22). Christ came first into our spirit (2 Tim. 4:22). Now He is looking for the opportunity to spread out of our spirit to saturate our mind, emotion, and will, so that He can settle down in our heart. Christ desires not only to indwell our spirit but also to settle down in all the parts of our soul to occupy the whole human heart. When our spirit is strengthened, Christ has the open and free way to spread out of our spirit into every part of our heart. Thus, all the parts of our inward being are filled with Christ.<p>Eventually, according to verse 19, we will be &#8220;filled unto all the fullness of God.&#8221; First, there is the strengthening of the inner man. Second, Christ makes His home in our hearts, occupying our whole being. Third, our whole being is filled unto all the fullness of God. When all the members of the church are such people, we will be full of strength to apprehend the breadth, length, height, and depth (v. 18). This means that we will realize the unlimited, immeasurable dimensions of Christ.<p>If we desire to know Christ as the content of the church, we must know the second part of Ephesians 3. When we want to minister something concerning Christ as the content of the church, we have to minister from this portion of the Word. Chapter one shows that Christ has been made Head over all things to the church, His Body (vv. 22-23). Then the first part of chapter three says that through the church, Christ as the multifarious wisdom of God will be manifested to the rulers and authorities in the heavenlies. But how can Christ be made known through the church? How can He be the real Head to the church? In order to answer these questions, we have to come to the second part of Ephesians 3. This is the central point, the heart, of the entire book of Ephesians.<p>Since we have been regenerated in our spirit, our spirit has to be strengthened by the Holy Spirit with power so that Christ may have the free way to saturate our whole being. He wants to spread from our spirit into every part of our soul, thus occupying and making His home in our whole being. Then our whole being will be filled with the reality of Christ unto all the fullness of God to make us the living expression of Christ. The fullness of God implies that the riches of all that God is have become His expression. When the riches of God are in God Himself, they are His riches. But when the riches of God are expressed, they become His fullness (John 1:16).<h2 class=head1>THE CHURCH BEING THE PURE EXPRESSION OF CHRIST</h2><p>We need to stress that since Christ is the life, content, and everything to the church, the church must be purely the expression of Christ, not of anything else. The church should not be the expression of any teaching or gift but just the expression of Christ. This is why there is not much teaching in the book of Ephesians. If we were asked to write something about the church, we might write a long book with many chapters of doctrine. But Ephesians is a book on the church of only six chapters. This is because the church is the expression of Christ-not of Christ in doctrine, but of Christ Himself. This is why the miraculous gifts are not mentioned in the book of Ephesians. Instead, what is seen are the living person of Christ and His living Body with His living members. Even the gift of teaching is not mentioned in the book of Ephesians. We have the Teacher, not the teaching. We have to realize that the Teacher is different from the teaching.<p>In the Body of Christ, His living members express Christ and nothing else. The Body is the fullness of Christ as the One who fills all in all (Eph. 1:23). Christ must be the very fullness within us, settling down within us to make His home in us as our everything by occupying, saturating, and permeating our whole being. Thus, the church becomes a pure expression of Christ and nothing else. We have to see this vision clearly.<p>Many so-called churches today give people the impression of healing, teaching, or speaking in tongues. These gifts become a replacement of the Body of Christ. When you come among some Christians, you may have the impression that they are very dogmatic. They are always determining the difference between wrong doctrine and right doctrine, giving others the impression that they are for a certain kind of teaching. This is all wrong. We must give people the impression that we are for nothing but Christ. When people come to our meetings, they must have the impression that we are standing for Christ Himself, not only in terminology but in reality. This should be our atmosphere and the impression which we give others. We need to reconsider the book of Ephesians. This book does not give us the impression of doctrines or gifts but only of Christ.<p>We have to make it clear that Christ is the life of the church, the content of the church, and everything to the church. Thus, the church must be the unique and pure expression of Christ and nothing else. Then we need to know how we can have Christ as our life and content. We need to see the detailed items in the New Testament of Christ being our content. The book of Acts shows us that Christ was the content of the early church, and the church was the expression of Christ. The Old Testament types also show us Christ as the content and the church as His expression. He is the reality of all the offerings and of the rich produce of the good land for our enjoyment. He is also the real ark as the very content of the tabernacle. The tabernacle is the expression and the ark is the content. In the abnormal situation, the ark as the reality and content was not within the tabernacle. Whenever we minister the word, we have to stress Christ as the content of the church and the church as the expression of Christ. We have much to experience and much to learn in ministering along this line. We have to learn how to minister Christ as the content of the church and the church as the expression of Christ.<h1 class=msg>CHAPTER TWO</h1><h1 class=msg>CHRIST AS EVERYTHING TO THE CHURCH IN THE EPISTLES TO THE ROMANS AND THE CORINTHIANS</h1><h1 class=scripture>Scripture Reading: Rom. 12:6; 1 Cor. 15:45b; 6:17; 2 Cor. 12:7-10</h1><p>When we minister Christ as the life and content of the church and the church as the expression of Christ, we need to say something based upon the healthy teaching of the Scriptures. For such a reality, we need the solid foundation of teaching. Then we can go on from this foundation to share something of our experience.<h2 class=head1>CHRIST AS THE CONTENT OF THE CHURCH AND THE CHURCH AS THE EXPRESSION OF CHRIST AS REVEALED IN ROMANS</h2><p>If we speak from the book of Romans about Christ as the life and content of the church and the church as the expression of Christ, we need to show people the whole structure of the book of Romans. Romans is a full record of the entire Christian life, including the inner life and the church life. It starts from our being sinners under God&#8217;s condemnation (1:18-3:20). This is why we need Christ&#8217;s redeeming blood so that we can be justified before God (3:21-5:11). Thus, the first part of the book of Romans shows us that we were sinful under God&#8217;s condemnation, but we have been justified by God through the redemption of Christ. We have been justified, saved, redeemed, and brought back to God.<p>Then Romans goes on to tell us how God works in us for our sanctification, transformation, conformation, and glorification. On the negative side, God gets rid of our old nature, our old man, to make Christ our new nature, our new man. This work is done through the cross on the negative side and the Spirit on the positive side. We have to experience the cross, to be identified with the death of Christ. The cross must do away with all the old things of the old nature, all the things of the self, and all the natural things. This is pointed out in chapter six of Romans.<p>Then chapter eight tells us that after the work of the cross, we are living and walking in and by the Spirit. This means that we are living in Christ and walking by Christ. In this way we are daily and gradually conformed to the image of Christ. In other words, we are gradually made the image of Christ to be the expression of Christ. Our old nature, our old self, the &#8220;I,&#8221; has been done away with by the cross, and all of what Christ is has been wrought into us. Christ has been made our life and even our daily walk, our living. Now we are persons who are not living by ourselves but by Christ. We are not walking in ourselves but in Christ. There has been a translation from the old nature into the new nature and from the old man into the new man by the cross and the Spirit. We have been translated into Christ through the working of the cross and the moving of the Spirit.<p>God is doing a work of translating us out of Adam into Christ, out of the self into Christ. This translating work is the sanctifying work, the transforming work, the conforming work, and the glorifying work. Now we are under the process of sanctification. The more we are sanctified, the more we are transformed, conformed, and glorified. When we are fully sanctified, that will be the day of our glorification. This is the content of the section of Romans 5:12 through 8:39.<p>Holiness is God Himself. The more God works Himself into us, the more we become holy. We can see this in the type of the tabernacle. All the boards of the tabernacle were of wood overlaid with gold. The wooden boards were sanctified, made holy, by being overlaid with gold. To be sanctified does not mean to be cleansed or to be kept away from filthy and worldly things. To be sanctified means to be overlaid with gold, signifying the divine nature. The more we are overlaid with the divine nature, the more we are sanctified. The divine nature is not only the holiness but also the glory. When the boards were overlaid with gold, they became holy and were in the glory. They were glorified by being overlaid with gold. The more we are overlaid with the divine nature of God, the more we are sanctified and glorified.<p>Sanctification, transformation, conformation, and glorification are actually one thing. We have been justified, but we need to be translated from the old being into the new being, from the old nature into the new nature. We have to be overlaid with the divine nature, to be sanctified. All that we are has to be swallowed up by Christ. Then we are transformed, conformed to the image of Christ, and glorified to become the expression of Christ.<p>Now we come to the last part of Romans (chs. 12-16). This shows us that we will be built up together as the Body of Christ, the church, to express Christ. We express Christ because Christ is wrought into us. We have been not only justified but also translated out of Adam into Christ. Because Christ has been wrought into us, what we have and what we are is Christ. We have been sanctified, that is, saturated and permeated by and with Christ. Now we live by and in Him, so we become His image. As those who are conformed to His image, we become His expression. Then we are built together, not in ourselves but in Him. This is like the wooden boards of the tabernacle being framed and built together in the overlaying gold. We are built together not in ourselves but in Christ.<p>From chapter twelve through sixteen, we see the real expression of Christ in the functions of the different members. The functions are the gifts, which are the expression of the grace deposited into us. Romans 12:6 says that we have gifts that differ according to the grace given to us. This is because the gifts are the outward expression of the inward grace. The inward grace is Christ deposited into us. Christ has been wrought into us as a deposit. We have a portion of Christ within us as the grace, and this grace expressed is the function, the gift. Thus, all the gifts are the expression of the inward grace, which is Christ deposited into us.<p>The gifts mentioned in Romans 12 are absolutely different from the miraculous gifts in 1 Corinthians 12. The gifts in Romans 12 are the expressions of the inner grace, which is Christ. The inner, deposited grace is expressed outwardly, and this outward expression is the gift. This gift is manifested in different ways.<p>As those who are justified by God, we should be sanctified daily by being overlaid with His divine nature. Then we are under the process of transformation and are being conformed to Christ&#8217;s image. We have a certain amount of Christ within us as grace deposited into us. Perhaps a certain brother, out of the measure of Christ within him, has a burden to give hospitality to many traveling saints (12:13b). When the saints come to his home, he spontaneously serves them, takes care of them, and displays love, which is Christ expressed through him. This hospitality is a gift, and this gift is an expression of the inner grace which is Christ deposited and wrought into him.<p>Let us consider the experience of another brother, who is being gradually sanctified, overlaid with the divine nature of God. A certain amount of Christ has been wrought into him, so gradually he has the burden to give material things to others (v. 13a). In his giving you can sense the flavor of Christ, the reality of Christ, and the presence of Christ. This giving of material things is an expression of inner grace, so this gift expresses Christ.<p>Another brother who has been justified and sanctified to a certain extent may have the heart to always show mercy to others (v. 8b). But others do not sense that he is merely a merciful person. In his showing of mercy, others sense the flavor and the tenderness of Christ. Even this showing of mercy is an expression of the inner grace, which is Christ.<p>In this way the members are built together and express Christ in many aspects. We become a living Body expressing Christ in many ways. Christ is expressed in the way His members minister, serve, show mercy, give material things, show love (v. 9a), and give hospitality to meet others&#8217; needs. Because we have been justified and sanctified, Christ has been wrought into us to a certain extent, and we have a certain amount of Christ as the deposited grace. Gradually, something will come out of this inward grace, and this coming out is the outward gift, the function, with the expression of Christ in our gift.<p>Thus, the whole book of Romans shows us that Christ must be wrought into us as our life and content and the church must be the expression of Christ. In this book, which is a full record of the Christian life, there is the expression of Christ and nothing else. There is not the expression of any doctrine but of Christ, who is the Redeemer and our portion within to be wrought into us to conform us to His image. The grace is deposited into us that it may become the very outward function, and this outward function is the expression of Christ in reality.<p>Whenever and wherever we come together, we come as such an expression of Christ. We are not here to express anything else. We are not standing for anything but Christ Himself. I have a real burden that all the dear brothers and sisters would be helped to realize this one thing-to know Christ as the life and content of the church. We need to experience Christ to such an extent and learn to minister Christ as the life, the content, and everything to the church.<h2 class=head1>CHRIST AS THE CONTENT OF THE CHURCH AND THE CHURCH AS THE EXPRESSION OF CHRIST AS REVEALED IN FIRST CORINTHIANS</h2><p>Now we want to see something concerning Christ as the life and content of the church and the church as the expression of Christ from 1 and 2 Corinthians. The end of Romans reveals the church as the Body expressing Christ, but the church in Corinth was expressing something else. We may express things which are quite spiritual, but even these things can become a distraction. The church must be the expression of Christ as revealed in the book of Romans. But the church in Corinth was distracted from Christ, not by evil things but by something apparently spiritual. They were distracted from Christ by the gifts.<p>Thus, the apostle Paul, the writer of 1 and 2 Corinthians, did his best to bring the distracted church back to Christ. The opening of 1 Corinthians tells us that Christ is the power and wisdom of God and has been made everything to us as righteousness, sanctification, and redemption (1:24, 30). The church is God&#8217;s cultivated land to grow in and with Christ and God&#8217;s building, the dwelling place of God to be built up as God&#8217;s temple (3:9-17). Thus, the church is a corporate vessel, a corporate container, to contain the Triune God. This church, which is the Body of Christ, is a part of Christ. First Corinthians 12:12 reveals that the church, as the Body, is Christ. This is because the church is a part of Christ, so the church must be the expression of Christ.<p>We also need to stress 1 Corinthians 15:45b, which reveals that Christ is the life-giving Spirit. This book does not show us that Christ is the gift-giving Spirit but that He is the life-giving Spirit. The church in Corinth overemphasized the gifts, so Paul somewhat restricted and restrained them from exercising the gifts too much. They went to an extreme, so Paul brought them back to be balanced. Some think that chapters twelve and fourteen encourage us to exercise the gifts, but if we read these two chapters carefully, we can see that they actually restrict the overexercise of the gifts and bring the distracted Corinthians back to Christ. Of course, Paul did not say that the gifts are wrong or bad, but he did indicate that we need to be limited in exercising the gifts. We have to be brought back to Christ to make Christ the reality of the church life.<p>This Christ is the life-giving Spirit, and we have to learn how to contact Him by exercising our spirit. First Corinthians 15:45b shows us that Christ is the life-giving Spirit, and chapter two shows us that we need to exercise our spirit. This chapter tells us that the soulish man is unable to apprehend spiritual things (v. 14). That means the soul is not able to contact Christ. The soulish man cannot apprehend spiritual things, and Christ as the life-giving Spirit is the reality of all spiritual things. We cannot apprehend and realize Christ by our soul. We must exercise our spirit to contact Him. A spiritual man discerns all things (v. 15). This shows us the great difference between the spirit and the soul. It is absolutely wrong to say that the spirit is the same as the soul. The soul is absolutely unable to contact Christ. We must exercise our spirit to contact Christ as the life-giving Spirit.<p>First Corinthians 6:17 says, &#8220;He who is joined to the Lord is one spirit.&#8221; The Lord is the life-giving Spirit, and we have a spirit within, so we must be one spirit with the Lord. When we exercise our spirit, we can contact and experience the Lord. Then Christ will be made real to us, and we will be made real in Christ. As the members of Christ, we will be built up with others to be the church as the living expression of Christ, who is the life-giving Spirit.<h2 class=head1>CHRIST AS THE CONTENT OF THE CHURCH AND THE CHURCH AS THE EXPRESSION OF CHRIST AS REVEALED IN SECOND CORINTHIANS</h2><p>Second Corinthians follows the first Epistle to give us a full revelation of how Christ is wrought into us. This is why the second Epistle does not mention the gifts. Instead, it brings us into another realm, another world, another field. It brings us further into Christ by telling us how Christ is wrought into us through all kinds of sufferings, through the different aspects of the working of the cross. One of the key passages in 2 Corinthians is 12:7-10. Here Paul said that there was given to him a thorn in the flesh, which caused him to suffer all the time. He prayed three times for the Lord to take away this thorn, but the Lord said to him, &#8220;My grace is sufficient for you, for My power is perfected in weakness&#8221; (v. 9a). The Lord indicated that Paul needed this suffering so that Christ as the sufficient grace and strength might be wrought into him.<p>Thus, in this second Epistle to the Corinthians, the inwrought Christ is revealed. The second Epistle is a record of the Christ wrought into us. The persons with Christ wrought into them will be easily built up to be the real and living expression of Christ and nothing else. This is why this second Epistle does not speak of any gift or of any miraculous, supernatural things. Instead, it speaks of the inner work of the indwelling Christ, the Christ wrought into us by the killing, the &#8220;burning,&#8221; of the cross. This is what we need today. We need to know Christ in an inner way and have Christ wrought into us.<p>After this fellowship I believe we have some vision of Romans and the Epistles to the Corinthians. From these three books we can see that originally we were sinners under the condemnation of a righteous God. As such sinful persons, we were justified by this righteous God through the redemption of the Lord Jesus. After this justification, the Lord starts within us to do a transforming work, to translate us out of the old realm of Adam into the new realm of Christ. We are translated from our self into Christ through sanctification, transformation, conformation, and glorification. Then we will have the image of Christ to express Him from within by being built together as His living Body. We will have the inner grace and the outward gifts as the expression of Christ.<p>This is the normal situation, but it is easy for us to be distracted, to be abnormal. We can be distracted from Christ even by good and spiritual things. We have to be brought back from all distracting things to Christ, taking Him as our reality. He is the life-giving Spirit within us, and we have a regenerated spirit. Now we have to exercise our spirit to contact Christ as the living Spirit. Then He will be wrought into us and expressed through us.<h1 class=msg>CHAPTER THREE</h1><h1 class=msg>CHRIST BEING THE CONTENT OF THE CHURCH TYPIFIED BY THE TABERNACLE</h1><p>In this chapter we want to see more concerning Christ as the content of the church and the church as the expression of Christ as typified by the tabernacle. We do not want to have the mere doctrine of typology. We want the real, practical application of the types confirmed by our experiences.<h2 class=head1>THE UNITING SPIRIT TYPIFIED BY THE UNITING BARS</h2><p>The bars which united the boards of the tabernacle (Exo. 26:26-28, 29b) signify the uniting Spirit (Eph. 4:3). In the uniting Spirit, there are both the human nature and the divine nature. Andrew Murray points this out in chapter five of his book The Spirit of Christ. This chapter is titled &#8220;The Spirit of the Glorified Jesus.&#8221; The Spirit of Christ (Rom. 8:9), the Spirit of the glorified Jesus, is different from the Spirit of Jehovah who fell upon people in the Old Testament (Judg. 3:10; 6:34; 13:25; 14:6, 19; 15:14). In the Old Testament, the Spirit possessed merely the divine nature. But since the resurrection and ascension of the Lord Jesus, the Spirit possesses both the divine nature and the human nature. The uniting bars of the tabernacle were of wood, signifying humanity, overlaid with gold, signifying divinity.<p>Also, there were three rows of bars uniting the boards. The number three signifies the Triune God. These three rows of bars were in five pieces. The middle bar was of one piece, and the top and bottom bars were each of two pieces. Thus, on the north, south, and west sides of the tabernacle there were five pieces. These three groups of five again point to the Triune God.<p>Now we need to consider what the number five signifies. Our hand has five fingers, that is, four fingers plus one thumb. The Ten Commandments are divided into two groups of five. The ten virgins in Matthew 25 are also divided into two groups of five. With the tabernacle, the number five occurs frequently. The tabernacle was made with ten curtains of fine linen. According to Exodus 26:3, five curtains were joined to one another, and the other five curtains were also to be joined to one another. Furthermore, the curtains in the outer court were squares, each measuring five cubits by five cubits (27:9-12, 18). Also, the altar of burnt offering was five cubits in length and width, and three cubits in height (27:1). The number five is composed of four plus one. The number four signifies the creature, and the number one signifies the Creator. This means that five is the number for responsibility formed by the Creator added to the creature.<p>Thus, we can see that the uniting Spirit is of the Triune God with the human nature overlaid with the divine nature. This means the Creator is added to man, the creature, enabling man to take the responsibility to fulfill all the requirements of God.<h2 class=head1>CHRIST AS LIGHT TYPIFIED BY THE LAMPSTAND</h2><p>Among all the utensils and furniture of the tabernacle, there are only two pieces without wooden material. The laver was made solely of brass (30:18), and the lampstand was made purely of gold (25:31-40). This is because the laver signifies the working of the Holy Spirit, and the lampstand signifies the working of Christ as light. This shows us that Christ as the Spirit is working within us.<p>The lampstand was all of gold, signifying the divine nature, but it still had something in it related to human beings. The lampstand consisted of a base, a stalk, and three pairs of branches. On each branch there were three cups shaped like almond blossoms, with knobs and blossoming buds. The number three also signifies resurrection since Christ was resurrected on the third day. The central stalk of the lampstand had four blossoms, whereas each branch had three blossoms. The number four signifies the creatures. The Bible speaks of the four living creatures (Rev. 4:6; Ezek. 1:5). Thus, even with the lampstand, which is entirely of gold, signifying that Christ as the light of life to us is absolutely divine, there is something showing that Christ as light is related to human beings, the creatures.<p>No one can exhaust the typological significances of the tabernacle. When we speak concerning the tabernacle, we have to stress that Christ is the content of the church and the church is the expression of Christ.<h2 class=head1>CHRIST AS RIGHTEOUSNESS, HOLINESS, AND GLORY</h2><p>The tabernacle consisted of three parts: the outer court, the Holy Place, and the Holy of Holies. In the outer court Christ is seen as righteousness for us to enjoy. We have to put on Christ as our righteousness. In the Holy Place Christ is seen as holiness, and in the Holy of Holies there is Christ as the glory. The content of the Holy Place is holiness, and the content of the Holy of Holies is glory. Righteousness, holiness, and glory are Christ in different aspects. This shows us that Christ is the content of the church life in three aspects to be manifested in the church life. Ultimately, He is the effulgence of God&#8217;s glory (Heb. 1:3) to be expressed in and through the church. The church as the reality of the tabernacle is built to show forth, manifest, and express Christ as righteousness, holiness, and glory. If we have a vision of this, our church life will be revolutionized.<h2 class=head2>The Enjoyment of Christ as Our Righteousness</h2><p>Now we need to consider how people can enjoy and express Christ as their righteousness. A person approaching the tabernacle from afar would first see the white fine linen hangings of the outer court. There is something white, pure, and clean separating the outer court of the dwelling place of God from worldly things. The white linen typifies, expresses, shows forth, declares, and proclaims that Christ is our righteousness. We put on Christ as our righteousness before God and man. In ourselves we have nothing to cover or qualify us so that we can stand before God and man. Christ as our righteousness covers and qualifies us.<p>In order to enjoy Christ as our righteousness, we have to pass through the altar and the laver. The altar signifies the cross. We can prove this by Hebrews 13:10 which says, &#8220;We have an altar from which they who are serving the tabernacle have no right to eat.&#8221; The Old Testament priests had no right to enjoy the offerings on this altar which we have. We have an altar, and this altar is the cross. On the cross Christ accomplished an all-inclusive death. That means that on the cross Christ carried out an all-inclusive judgment. Everything negative has been judged on the cross. If we want to enjoy Christ as our righteousness and participate in the church life, we have to realize that whatever we have, whatever we are, and whatever we can do have all been judged on the cross. By judgment we are redeemed. By redemption we are justified. This is the experience of the cross.<p>Based on the cross, the Holy Spirit comes into us to regenerate us. Our regeneration is the beginning of the cleansing, washing, work of the Holy Spirit (Titus 3:5). Regeneration is a part of the significance of the washing of the laver. The laver washes and cleanses. The altar was covered with brass (Exo. 27:1-2), and the laver was made entirely of brass (30:18), typifying God&#8217;s judgment. The laver was made with a particular kind of brass. It was made from the brass mirrors of the ministering women who ministered at the door of the tent of meeting (38:8). In ancient times they had brass mirrors, not glass mirrors. The laver exposed the priests in the way that a mirror does to show us what we are. Before the laver cleansed and washed the priests, it told them what they were, giving them a real picture of themselves. A father may tell his child that he is dirty, but the child may not believe him. But when the father brings his child to the mirror, the child can see for himself how dirty he is. By the mirror the child is convinced that he is dirty. Then he will go to the sink to wash himself. In the same way, the laver first exposed the priests. Then it cleansed them. This signifies the working of the Holy Spirit.<h2 class=head2>The Enjoyment of Christ as Our Holiness</h2><p>By the cross and the working of the Holy Spirit, we enjoy Christ as our righteousness. In the outer court, we see that Christ is expressed as righteousness before God and man. But this is just the outward behavior, the outward conduct, with nothing related to the inward nature. Righteousness relates to conduct, to behavior, but holiness relates to nature. God&#8217;s divine nature is holiness. As far as your conduct, morality, and behavior are concerned, you may enjoy Christ as your righteousness, but this is just the outward aspect. You have to go deeper to enjoy Christ as your inward nature, your holiness. In other words, we have to go on to express Christ not only as righteousness in our behavior but also as holiness in our nature, in what we are.<p>Now we need to consider how we can go on to enjoy Christ in such a deeper way. After the people offered the offerings and the shed blood was sprinkled so that they could experience redemption, they began to eat. All the experiences of holiness begin with eating. The bread on the showbread table in the Holy Place was for eating (Lev. 24:5-9). We do not merely put on Christ as our righteousness, but we also eat Christ as our spiritual food so that He can become our very nature (John 6:57). When the prodigal son in Luke 15 returned to his father, the father clothed him with the best robe to justify and qualify him so that he could come into the living presence of the father to eat and enjoy the fattened calf. Our salvation is not a matter of just putting something on but also of taking something in, of eating something. First, we have to put on Christ as our righteousness. Then we have to take Christ into us as our holiness.<p>The first part of Romans shows that we have Christ as our righteousness to put on. The next part speaks of Christ as our holiness taken into us and working within us. We enjoy Christ as our holiness by eating Him as our spiritual food. By eating Christ, He will work in us to enlighten us all the time. Then we enjoy Him as the light of life, which is the reality of the lampstand in the Holy Place. This brings us into the enjoyment of Christ as the sweet incense ascending to God to have His acceptance at the incense altar (Exo. 30:1-4). We enjoy the sweet acceptance of God in Christ in an inward and subjective way. When we take Christ into us, He is mingled with us to be our holiness.<p>Real sanctification involves not just a positional change but a dispositional change. The process of sanctification changes us in nature, in form, and in essence as well as in place. This metabolic change is transformation (2 Cor. 3:18; Rom. 12:2). When the church is transformed, the church expresses Christ as holiness. Holiness as the content of the church is Christ Himself.<p>In the outer court, the most striking thing is the white linen hangings, signifying Christ as righteousness. In the Holy Place the significant element is gold. Gold signifies God&#8217;s holy nature, His holiness. The outer court shows that the church expresses Christ as our righteousness. The Holy Place shows that the church expresses Christ as our holiness. When you were outside the tabernacle, you saw righteousness. When you came inside, you saw holiness.<p>When we look at the church outwardly, we should see good, pure, and righteous people. But when we come into the church, we should see that these people are not only righteous but also holy. They should have not only outwardly good behavior but also something in their nature which is divine and holy. By the Lord&#8217;s grace, we should express Christ in such a way. This is what we have to attain. We have Christ as our righteousness without and our holiness within, and we need to express Him in such a way even to the principalities and powers in the heavenlies.<h2 class=head2>The Enjoyment of Christ as Our Glory</h2><p>Eventually, our natural man-including the will, the self, the flesh, the &#8220;I&#8221;-must be broken. The &#8220;I&#8221; has to be broken, riven, torn down. Then we will get into the spirit. When we are walking in the spirit and not in our natural life, we will enjoy Christ as the glory of God in the Holy of Holies. We will have Christ expressed among us and through us as the glory of God. This is the expression of Christ to the uttermost. We should not only have Christ as righteousness in our behavior and holiness in our lives. We should also have Him as our glory. Then the natural life, the self, the flesh, the &#8220;I,&#8221; has been put away and we are in the spirit, the Holy of Holies. When we are in the spirit, we can sense that we have Christ as the glory expressed among us.<p>In the outer court we see the white linen, and in the Holy Place we see the gold. The most significant thing in the Holy of Holies is the glory. Christ as righteousness, holiness, and glory is the very content of the church life, and the church is the expression of such a Christ. In these days we expect that such a local expression of Christ will be raised up in many places. This is God&#8217;s intention, and this is what His enemy is trying to frustrate.<p>We can never be built together in ourselves. The acacia wood of the standing boards of the tabernacle signifies our regenerated, resurrected, uplifted, and reinforced human nature, not our natural human nature. In our untransformed human nature, we cannot be built up. The stronger we become in our natural man, the more independent we are. The weaker we become, the more we become limited and dependent on others. We have to be overlaid with gold. When we enjoy Christ more and more, the increasing measure of Christ unites us with others in God&#8217;s building. In ourselves we are too independent and can never stand with others. But when we enjoy Christ, we are being overlaid with Him, and the Christ whom we enjoy unites us. The more we enjoy Christ, the more unity we will have.<h2 class=head1>EATING CHRIST AS OUR SPIRITUAL FOOD</h2><p>We need to stress the matter of eating Christ. At the altar in the outer court, there was the eating of the offerings. At the showbread table in the Holy Place, there was the eating of the showbread. Also, in the Holy of Holies within the ark was the golden pot with the hidden manna (Heb. 9:4). This signifies the Christ eaten, digested, and assimilated by us. We have to put Christ on as our righteousness. But we also have to eat of Him to enjoy Him. We feast on Him at the altar in the outer court and at the showbread table in the Holy Place. We also enjoy Him as our inward, hidden supply in the ark in the Holy of Holies. We enjoy Christ subjectively by feasting on Him. We all have to learn to feast on Christ day by day. When we feast on Him, He will sanctify us, transform us, and conform us to His image. Then there can be the building up of the church as the dwelling place of God.<p>The content of the church is Christ Himself as righteousness, holiness, and glory, and the church is the expression of such a Christ. When there is such an expression in our locality, both we and the Lord will be satisfied to the uttermost. If we have such a church life, we will be satisfied. Our being satisfied means that the Lord is satisfied. This must be our goal. We must go on by His grace to attain this goal. In all of the localities we must build up such a glorious expression of Christ. This is the ultimate recovery of the Lord.<h1 class=msg>CHAPTER FOUR</h1><h1 class=msg>CHRIST AS THE OFFERINGS FOR THE CHURCH MEETINGS</h1><h2 class=head1>THE BUILDING UP OF THE CHURCH AND THE LIFE OF THE CHURCH</h2><p>In this chapter we want to see the revelation concerning Christ as the offerings for the church meetings. In the tabernacle we see how the building up of the church is realized. In all the offerings we see how the meetings of the church can be carried out. Both the tabernacle and the offerings show that Christ is the content of the church and the church is the expression of Christ. On the one hand, the church is always in the process of being built up. On the other hand, the church life is a life of meetings. In other words, the church building is one thing, and the church life is another thing. The tabernacle typifies mostly the building aspect, and the offerings typify mostly the life aspect. We always come together to express Christ, who is our content, in many aspects. These aspects are typified clearly by all the offerings. The offerings are for the church life, and the church life is a life of meetings.<p>In Exodus the tabernacle was built up. Then Leviticus shows us that the service of the Lord&#8217;s children is a service of meetings. If you do not have the meetings, you do not have the service. The tabernacle is called the tent of meeting (Lev. 1:1-ASV). Inwardly, it is a tabernacle, the dwelling place of God. Outwardly, it is a tent of the people&#8217;s meetings. In Exodus is the building up of the tabernacle. In Leviticus are the meetings at this tabernacle. The meetings are the most important virtues of the life of God&#8217;s people. The life of the people of God is a life of meetings. Thus, the building up of the church is seen in Exodus, and the life of the church, a life of meetings, is seen in Leviticus.<p>The life of the children of God is a life of meetings, and the most important and central thing in all the meetings is to offer Christ in many different aspects. The different kinds of offerings are types of the different aspects of Christ. Thus, the center of the life of God&#8217;s people is the Christ offered to God. The central thing in the meetings is the different aspects of Christ as the offerings, so Christ is the center of our church life.<h2 class=head1>OUR NEED TO LABOR ON CHRIST THAT WE MAY HAVE A SURPLUS OF CHRIST TO OFFER TO GOD</h2><p>The people of Israel could have something to offer only by laboring on the good land. The good land is a type of the all-inclusive Christ. The people of Israel had been brought into the good land, and the good land had been allotted to them in lots as their particular portion. God has given Christ in &#8220;lots&#8221; to us as our portion. Colossians 1:12 says, &#8220;Giving thanks to the Father, who has qualified you for a share of the allotted portion of the saints in the light.&#8221; Colossians reveals that Christ is our portion as our inheritance just as the land of Canaan was to the children of Israel. Each of us has a portion of Christ.<p>Some in the good land were lazy and became so poor that they had to sell their portion of the land to others. But they were not allowed to give up their portion forever. Every fifty years there was a jubilee, in which all the lots were returned to those who had sold them (Lev. 25:8-17). In a certain sense, some brothers who were lazy and did not make their living on Christ &#8220;sold&#8221; their portion of Christ. God has brought us into Christ and has given Christ to us as our portion. Now we have to labor on the portion of Christ given to us. We need to labor on Christ to enjoy Him day by day. If we do not labor on Him, we cannot have a proper living as the people of God. This is because we have nothing on which to live.<p>Suppose that we are the Israelites who have been brought into Canaan and have each been allotted a portion of the good land. If we do not labor on our portion of the land, we will suffer poverty as a consequence, even though our portion is very rich. If we do not labor, we will have nothing to eat, nothing on which to live. Then we will become poor. This is not the proper living of the Lord&#8217;s children. The proper living of the Lord&#8217;s children is one of working on the portion given to us by God in fear and in love of Him. He will send us the adequate rain and sunshine to cause us to have a rich harvest. Then we will have some riches on which to live. Our rich harvest and rich life will give glory to Him.<p>Out of the produce of this rich harvest, we should keep and separate one-tenth, the best part, with which we can worship God. Thus, ninety percent is for our living and ten percent is for the service, the worship, the meeting (Deut. 12:17-18). Three times a year the children of Israel all had to go to the tent of meeting and bring the top ten percent of their produce to offer to God for His worship (16:16). They had much to live on richly and also had something with which to serve God, to worship God, to meet with the children of God.<p>All of the children of Israel had the same rich land, sunshine, rain, and air, but those who were lazy and did not work hard would have no harvest, no produce. They would become poor, having nothing on which to live. Furthermore, they would come to the tent of meeting with their hands empty. This means that they would go to the meeting in a poor way, with nothing in their hands to offer, to contribute, with which they could worship God. This is the real picture of many Christians today. They have received Christ as their portion of the grace of God, but they do not labor on Christ. They have the sunshine, the rain, and the fresh air with the portion of the land, but they do not work on the land. They have Christ as their grace, but they do not labor on Christ because of their laziness. They rarely pray, contact the Lord, study the Word, or enjoy the Lord by feeding on the Lord through the prayerful reading of the Word. They have very little exercise of the spirit to contact the Lord or to do something for the Lord. There are many poor Christians today. They are not poor in the grace they have received, but poor in the produce of grace. Thus, spiritually speaking, they have nothing on which to live, and they do not have anything of Christ to bring with them to offer to God in the meeting.<p>If all of us were like this, we would have empty meetings. If all the children of Israel had come to the feast with empty hands, with nothing to offer, that would have been a &#8220;feast of empty hands.&#8221; They would have had nothing on which to feast. Instead, they would have had emptiness due to their laziness. This is a real picture of today&#8217;s Christian meetings. In such meetings, there is nothing of Christ as the riches, as the reality, as the rich content, to express. So there is the sense and expression of emptiness. There is an exhibition of emptiness and poverty.<p>Sometimes we would think that we have to learn to be humble by saying that we have nothing, but this is not humility. This is emptiness. To say that you have something of Christ is not to be proud, but to be faithful to speak the truth. When the Israelites came to the priest to offer something, they did not tell him that they did not have anything. In order to worship God, they had to have something.<p>The life of God&#8217;s people is first a life of laboring on Christ. Second, it is a life of having something of Christ to bring to the meetings to offer, to contribute. The proper life of Christians is to labor on Christ all the time. Then they will have the rich surplus of Christ to bring to the meetings for a rich exhibition of Christ. We exhibit Christ to God and to God&#8217;s enemy. The children of Israel had to come to Jerusalem three times a year for three feasts: the Feast of Unleavened Bread, the Feast of Weeks, and the Feast of Tabernacles. They brought the top surplus to the tent of meeting for God&#8217;s worship. We also have to bring the top surplus of Christ to the church meetings for our worship to God in spirit and reality (John 4:24).<h2 class=head1>CHRIST AS THE REALITY OF THE WAVE OFFERING AND THE HEAVE OFFERING</h2><p>According to Numbers 18, all the things offered by the people of Israel were referred to as wave offerings and heave offerings. These are not two kinds of offerings, but one offering with two aspects: the wave aspect and the heave aspect. The word wave implies a back and forth movement, and the word heave means to lift up. The wave offering signifies the resurrected Christ, and the heave offering signifies the ascended Christ. Christ offered Himself in His death, and He became the resurrected and ascended One. Resurrection and ascension are always related to each other. The resurrected Christ is the ascended Christ.<p>Everything which we enjoy of Christ is something of resurrection and ascension. Whenever we have something of Christ to bring to the church meeting to express Christ, this is always something of resurrection and ascension. We may testify that Christ is our comfort or wisdom. He is our comfort and wisdom only by His resurrection and ascension. The resurrected and ascended Christ is our comfort and wisdom.<h2 class=head1>CHRIST AS THE REALITY OF THE FIVE BASIC KINDS OF OFFERINGS</h2><h2 class=head2>The Burnt Offering</h2><p>Our experience of Christ can be classified into many items and can be typified by the five basic kinds of offerings: the burnt offering, the meal offering, the peace offering, the sin offering, and the trespass offering. When we learn to live by Christ, to take Christ as our life, the indwelling Christ will enable us to live a life absolutely for God and not for ourselves. This is the real experience of Christ as the burnt offering (Lev. 1:1-17; Heb. 10:5-7). The indwelling Christ enables us not to live for ourselves in anything but to live for God in everything. Christ then becomes a living burnt offering within us as we live by Him, taking Him as our life.<p>When we have this experience of Christ, we can offer what we have in the church meeting. We may offer a praise by saying, &#8220;Lord, we praise You that You are the One living within us to enable us to live a consecrated and separated life.&#8221; Such a praise, giving of thanks, testimony, or message is the offering of Christ as the burnt offering. When we offer Him in such a way, He is exhibited, expressed, and exalted.<h2 class=head2>The Meal Offering</h2><p>We can also experience Christ as the meal offering (Lev. 2:1-16). When we take Christ as our life, we will have a refined daily life in our behavior and conduct. We will be fine and pure in our humanity like the fine flour of the meal offering. This offering is composed of fine flour mingled with oil. It signifies how Christ lives in us so that we may have a proper, refined, and balanced human life. This is pleasant and sweet to God and man.<p>When we come to the meetings we can give a testimony, a message, or some praise and thanksgiving which will be an offering of Christ as the meal offering for the enjoyment of God and man. We may say, &#8220;Lord, we were rough people but thank You for becoming our meal offering. We can take You as our refined, even, balanced, and pure life. Thank You that we can be pleasant, not by ourselves but by You as our life.&#8221; We can offer this kind of praise if we have the experience, the surplus. If we live by Christ day by day, He will cause us to have a proper human living, to have the fine, sweet, proper human behavior.<h2 class=head2>The Peace Offering</h2><p>Now we come to the experience of Christ as the peace offering (Lev. 3:1-17; 7:11-21). The peace offering signifies Christ as the fellowship. When we have Christ in our living, this Christ who is practical to us will be our fellowship with God and others. When we can have fellowship with God by Christ, this is the peace with God. When we can have fellowship with man, this is the peace with man. The peace offering is Christ as our fellowship with God and man. When we have peace with a brother, that means we have fellowship with him. The more we experience Christ, the more fellowship we will have, and this fellowship is the peace. Then we can offer this experience of Christ to God in the church meetings through our thanksgiving, praise, testimony, or message. This is not doctrinal but practical. The peace offering is Christ Himself as the mutual enjoyment between us and God and between us and others. Thus, we enjoy Christ as our peace with fellowship.<h2 class=head2>The Sin Offering</h2><p>We also need to enjoy Christ as our sin offering (Lev. 4:1-35). We should never forget that we still have a sinful nature. Regardless of how much we live by Christ and enjoy Christ, we still have our flesh and our sinful nature, so we need Christ as our sin offering to deal with our sinful nature. Someone may pray, &#8220;Lord, we are still in our old nature. Forgive us. We thank You that You have died for us and have been made sin for us. We apply Your blood for our cleansing.&#8221; This is the offering of Christ as the sin offering.<h2 class=head2>The Trespass Offering</h2><p>After the sin offering, there is the trespass offering (Lev. 5:1-19), signifying how Christ deals with our sinful deeds. The sin offering deals with the sinful nature within. The trespass offering deals with the sinful deeds without. We need to confess our failures, mistakes, wrongdoings, and shortcomings and apply Christ as our trespass offering. The burnt offering, meal offering, and peace offering are the main items for our experience, whereas the sin offering and trespass offering are subsidiary.<p>Whenever we come together, regardless of the kind of meeting we have, we should come with the Christ experienced by us. Sometimes we offer Him to God as the burnt offering. At other times we may offer Him as the meal offering. In the Lord&#8217;s table meeting, we can offer Him as the peace offering for our fellowship with God and man in peace. At the same time, we cannot forget that we are still in the old, sinful nature and that we are sinful in our deeds. Then we can apply Him as our sin offering and trespass offering. In this way the surplus of Christ is offered to God and exhibited to the whole universe. Then our meetings will be enriched and strengthened because they are full of Christ. Such a church life is an exhibition of Christ, an expression of Christ.<p>Christ will be expressed through us not only in the building up of the church but also in the church life, in all the meetings of the church. Then we will bear a testimony of being united and built up in Christ to be an expression of Christ. Also, when Christ is offered to God in the church meetings in many aspects, the church meetings will be the expression of Christ.<p>Thus, with the church there are the building aspect and the life aspect. The life aspect depends on the meetings. In all the meetings, we should have something of Christ to offer. This depends on our daily labor on Christ. If we daily labor on Christ, we will have something of Christ to bring to our church meetings to contribute to others and offer to God so that we can enjoy Christ with God for the exhibition and exaltation of Christ. Then Christ will be expressed as the rich content of the church life.<h1 class=msg>CHAPTER FIVE</h1><h1 class=msg>CHRIST AS GRACE AND REALITY</h1><p>We have seen that the offerings in the Old Testament are types of Christ as the reality and content of the church life. In John 4:24 the Lord Jesus told the Samaritan woman that God is Spirit and that those who worship Him must worship in spirit and in truthfulness, or truth. When I was young, I was taught that truth means sincerity, so we have to worship God in spirit and in sincerity. But the more one reads the Gospel of John, the more he realizes that this is not the right meaning.<p>In John 14:6 the Lord said that He is the way, the truth (reality), and the life. We cannot say that the Lord is the way, the sincerity, and the life. This does not fit the concept of the Gospel of John. Later, I was taught that truth means the proper doctrines or teachings. Some Christian teachers say that John 4:24 means that we have to worship God in the spirit and according to the proper doctrines or teachings. But this is not a proper interpretation. The Lord surely did not mean that He is the way, the doctrine, and the life. The real meaning of the word truth in John is not according to our natural or religious concept.<p>John 1 says that the Word who was God became flesh, and this One was full of grace and truth (vv. 1, 14). Verse 16 says, &#8220;For of His fullness we have all received, and grace upon grace.&#8221; When we receive of the fullness of Christ, we have grace upon grace to enjoy. Verses 17 and 18 say, &#8220;For the law was given through Moses; grace and reality [truth] came through Jesus Christ. No one has ever seen God; the only begotten Son, who is in the bosom of the Father, He has declared Him.&#8221;<p>Grace and truth are the items of Christ&#8217;s fullness. His fullness is the fullness of the Godhead. Colossians 2:9 says, &#8220;For in Him dwells all the fullness of the Godhead bodily.&#8221; Fullness refers not to the riches of God but to the expression of the riches of God. What dwells in Christ is not only the riches of the Godhead but the expression of the riches of what God is. Christ is the embodiment of God. All that God is, is embodied in Him.<p>Grace and truth are in contrast to the law. This means that the law is versus grace and truth. Thus, if we are to understand the meaning of grace and truth, we have to know the meaning of the law. John tells us that the law was given by Moses. He does not say that the law came by Moses. This means that you can receive the law without receiving Moses. But grace and truth came through Jesus Christ. This means that if you are going to receive grace and truth, you have to receive this Christ. Darby&#8217;s New Translation of John 1:17 says, &#8220;Grace and truth subsists through Jesus Christ.&#8221; Grace and truth subsist through Christ, so when you receive Him, you receive grace and truth.<h2 class=head1>CHRIST AS GRACE</h2><p>The law never gives you something. Instead, it always demands something of you. Grace, on the other hand, never demands but always gives. Christ came to give and to impart, not to demand. The law tells us to honor our parents. This is a demand. But grace came to us through Christ. When this One comes into us, He imparts to us the honoring of our parents. Christ does not demand that we honor our parents; instead, He supplies us with what He is to honor our parents. The law tells us to love our neighbor as ourself. This is a demand. Christ comes to impart love into us. He supplies us with love to love others. On the one hand, Christ as grace never demands but supplies. On the other hand, the law demands but never supplies. When the Lord tells us to do something, He supplies us with what He is. Whatever Christ asks us to do, He always supplies us with that matter. This is grace.<p>The Lord demands that we be like Him, that is, that we have the likeness of God. He demands that we behave, that we live, act, and  conduct ourselves like God. According to the Ten Commandments, God is a God of love, light, holiness, and righteousness. The law demands that we be persons who correspond with what God is. The law, however, does not supply love, light, holiness, or righteousness to us. Christ, on the other hand, came to supply us with all that He is to meet what He demands. Christ as the embodiment of God came into us to impart all the fullness of God into us, including love, light, holiness, and righteousness. Christ came into us not to demand but to give, to supply, and to impart. This is Christ as grace. The law is demanding, but Christ as grace is within us giving, supplying, and imparting.<p>The law demands that we be what God is. We have to love others because God is love. We have to walk in the light because God is light. Since God is holy, we have to be holy. Since God is righteous, we have to be righteous. The law always demands, but Christ came as the embodiment of God to live within us and to impart love, light, holiness, and righteousness to us with all the fullness of God. This is grace.<p>Ephesians 5 tells the wives to submit themselves to their own husbands (v. 22). But we also have to remember that Paul charges us to do everything in Christ. Whether this charge is a law or grace to us is dependent upon what we realize. Many wedding pastors make Ephesians 5 a word of the law. But this portion of the Word is not a part of the law but of grace. Christ as grace imparts Himself into us to become our very submission. The wives&#8217; submission to their own husbands should be nothing less than Christ. The more you love Christ, the more you take Him as your life, the more you live by Him, the more you will spontaneously and unconsciously be sweetly submissive. This sweet submission is nothing less than Christ Himself. This is grace, not a demand.<p>Ephesians 5 also tells the brothers who are husbands to love their wives (v. 25). Some brothers would say that they cannot love their wives. We should not try to charge such brothers to love their wives according to the law of Moses. Moses cannot get through, but Christ can get through. We may say, &#8220;Brother, what you have told me about your wife may be absolutely true. But do you realize that Christ lives in you? Do you love Him? Do you live by Him?&#8221; The brother may respond by saying that he loves and lives by Christ to some extent. Then we can say, &#8220;I encourage you to go to the Lord again. Consecrate yourself to Him, open yourself to Him, and take Him in more and more to live by Him more and more. Then see what will come out. Forget about the command to love your wife. Just look to Him. Open up to Him more and more. Take Him as your life more and more and see what will come out.&#8221; If he takes this fellowship, he will experience Christ spontaneously and unconsciously as the love for his wife.<p>Such love is imparted by Christ and with Christ and can never be separated from Christ. Since you have Christ, you have love. Love is not a law, it is a grace; it is not a demand but an imparting. The law was given by Moses, but grace came through Jesus Christ. Grace was not given by Jesus but came through Jesus. When we have Jesus, we have grace. The Gospel of John does not tell us about the law but about grace. It tells us that the Word, which is God Himself, was incarnated to be the flesh and was full of grace. If we receive Him, we enjoy grace. Of His fullness we have all received, and grace upon grace. This is like the ocean coming to the land wave upon wave. Grace is God Himself given to us and enjoyed by us.<h2 class=head1>CHRIST AS THE REALITY</h2><p>Now we need to consider what truth is. The law is demanding, but with the law there is no reality. The law tells us to honor our parents, but the law does not give us the real honor. The law demands without providing the reality. The law tells us that we have to be holy as the Lord is holy, but it does not give us the reality of holiness. The law says that the proper human life must be holy, but it does not impart holiness. Thus, with the law there is the demand of holiness but not the reality. This is like having a menu but no food. The law is the menu; the reality is the food. Truth means &#8220;reality.&#8221; Christ is the reality of the honoring of our parents, the reality of holiness, and the reality of love.<p>Whatever the law demands is just a picture without anything real. The reality is with Jesus Christ. The picture was given through Moses. The reality came through Jesus Christ. The law demands that we be holy, but holiness came through Jesus. Jesus is the reality of holiness, love, righteousness, and honor. Jesus is the reality of all the contents of the law. If I give you a picture of a brother, you may say that it is nice but that you want the reality. When the brother actually comes to you, you may say, &#8220;The picture was given by Witness Lee, but the reality came through this brother.&#8221; Moses just passed on a picture to us, but the reality of this picture is Jesus Himself. When He comes, the reality comes with Him.<p>On the one hand, Christ is grace to us. On the other hand, He is the reality of all things demanded by the law. The law was given through Moses but grace and reality came through this wonderful Jesus, who is the very God incarnated as a man to bring God into us. This is the central message of the Gospel of John. This Gospel tells us that the Word, who is God Himself, became flesh to bring God into us as the reality of all things demanded, mentioned, and revealed through the law.<p>In the law there are not only commandments but also regulations. There are regulations concerning the offerings, that is, concerning how the children of Israel had to bring their surplus to worship God. The regulations of the law forbade people to come to worship God with their hands empty (Deut. 16:16). They were required to bring something to offer to God as the burnt offering, the meal offering, the peace offering, the sin offering, the trespass offering, the wave offering, and the heave offering. These are different aspects of the picture in the Old Testament which portray Christ as the reality of all the offerings. We have to enjoy Christ as the real surplus of the land of Canaan.<p>If we know this principle, we will be able to appreciate the relationship between the New Testament and the Old Testament. In the Old Testament, there are the pictures. In the New Testament, there is the explanation, the reality. When we look at the picture, everything is made clear. The entire Old Testament presents a full picture of what Christ is to us, showing us how we have to enjoy Christ, experience Christ, and partake of Christ. Christ in the New Testament is the reality of this picture.<p>Christ is the reality of all things demanded by God in the law. This is the proper meaning of the word truth in the Gospel of John. Truth does not refer to teachings or doctrines. Truth is &#8220;reality.&#8221; Christ as the embodiment of God is the reality of all things demanded by God in the law. The law was given by Moses; reality came with Christ.<p>John 4:24 says that God is Spirit and those who worship Him must worship in spirit and truthfulness, or reality. This means that if anyone is going to worship God, he must worship by exercising his spirit and by realizing Christ as the embodiment of God. Philippians 3:3 says, &#8220;For we are the circumcision, the ones who serve by the Spirit of God and boast in Christ Jesus and have no confidence in the flesh.&#8221; This verse reveals that we worship God by the Spirit and boast in Christ Jesus. This is the interpretation of worshipping God in spirit and in reality. Truth means reality, which is Christ Himself as the embodiment of God partaken of by us.<p>In John 8:24 the Lord Jesus said, &#8220;Unless you believe that I am, you will die in your sins.&#8221; &#8220;I am&#8221; is God Himself. The Lord was saying that we must believe that He is the great I Am, the reality of God. Whoever does not take this reality by believing in Christ will die in his sins. In verse 28 the Lord said, &#8220;When you lift up the Son of Man, then you will know that I am, and that I do nothing from Myself, but as My Father has taught Me, I speak these things.&#8221; Verses 31 and 32 say, &#8220;Then Jesus said to those Jews who believed Him, If you abide in My word, you are truly My disciples; and you shall know the truth, and the truth shall set you free.&#8221; Verse 28 says, &#8220;You will know that I am.&#8221; Verse 32 says, &#8220;You shall know the truth.&#8221; Thus, to know the truth is to know the I Am. The truth is the great I Am. This great I Am, the reality, will set us free.<p>Verses 33 through 36 say, &#8220;They answered Him, We are Abraham&#8217;s seed and have never yet been enslaved to anyone. How is it that you say, You shall become free? Jesus answered them, Truly, truly, I say to you, Everyone who commits sin is a slave of sin. And the slave does not abide in the house forever; the son does abide forever. If therefore the Son sets you free, you shall be free indeed.&#8221; Verse 32 says that the truth shall set you free, but verse 36 says that the Son sets you free. Thus, truth is the Son, and the Son is the embodiment of God.<p>In John 14:6 the Lord said that He is the way and the reality and the life. The Christian life is not a matter of doctrine or teaching but of reality. In verse 17 the Lord spoke of the Spirit of reality. The Spirit is the reality of Christ as the Son of God. John 16:13 says, &#8220;But when He, the Spirit of reality, comes, He will guide you into all the reality.&#8221; The Spirit brings us not into doctrine, but into all that Christ is as the embodiment of God.<p>Verses 14 and 15 say, &#8220;He will glorify Me, for He will receive of Mine and will declare it to you. All that the Father has is Mine; for this reason I have said that He receives of Mine and will declare it to you.&#8221; This means that the fullness of the Father dwells in the Son, and the Spirit of reality takes of this fullness and declares it to us. All that the Father is and has is embodied in the Son, and all that the Son is and has is declared as reality to the believers through the Spirit.<p>In John 18 the Lord said to Pilate, &#8220;For this I have been born, and for this I have come into the world, that I would testify to the truth. Every one who is of the truth hears My voice&#8221; (v. 37). The Lord did not testify to the doctrine but to the reality of God. Pilate responded by asking, &#8220;What is truth?&#8221; (v. 38a). After Pilate asked this question, he went out to the Jews and said to them, &#8220;I find no fault in Him&#8221; (v. 38b). Pilate understood the Roman law, but he did not understand the divine reality.<p>In view of the entire revelation of the Gospel of John, truth denotes the divine reality embodied, revealed, and expressed in Christ as the Son of God. In the New Testament, we must worship God in spirit with the reality. We do not worship according to the demand of the law. The law is an empty picture. Now we have to worship God, to serve God, with Christ as the reality.<h1 class=msg>CHAPTER SIX</h1><h1 class=msg>THE TABERNACLE AND ITS COVERING TYPIFYING THE CHURCH AS THE EXPRESSION OF CHRIST</h1><h1 class=scripture>Scripture Reading: Exo. 26:1, 7, 14</h1><h2 class=head1>THE BUILDING UP OF THE CHURCH SEEN IN THE TYPE OF THE TABERNACLE</h2><p>Exodus 26:1 says, &#8220;Moreover thou shalt make the tabernacle with ten curtains of fine twined linen, and blue, and purple, and scarlet: with cherubim of cunning work shalt thou make them.&#8221; First, the tabernacle was covered with ten curtains of fine twined linen. Verse 7 says, &#8220;And thou shalt make curtains of goats&#8217; hair to be a covering upon the tabernacle: eleven curtains shalt thou make.&#8221; After the curtains of fine linen were the curtains of goats&#8217; hair. Verse 14 says, &#8220;And thou shalt make a covering for the tent of rams&#8217; skins dyed red, and a covering above of porpoise skins&#8221; (Heb.). In this verse two coverings are mentioned: the covering of rams&#8217; skins dyed red and the covering of porpoise skins. This shows us that the tabernacle had four layers of covering. The first layer was the ten curtains of fine twined linen. The second layer was the curtains of goats&#8217; hair. The third layer was the covering of the rams&#8217; skins. The fourth layer, the last layer, was the covering of porpoise skins. These coverings have much to do with God&#8217;s building.<p>The Lord&#8217;s building of His dwelling place is not just a matter of having an outward pattern. The building of the church is dependent upon Christ being wrought into us. Through the birth of life and the growth in life, a living person is produced. This living person does not just have an outward pattern or form. A replica of a person may be produced by being manufactured in the way of imitation. This replica has the pattern, shape, and likeness of a person but not the life. The building up of the church is not merely a matter of having an outward pattern but a matter of the birth of life and the growth of life. The real pattern comes into being by the growth of life, not by organization or outward formation. A living person with an outward form comes into being by birth and by growth of life. No one manufactured or shaped him. Instead, he was organically shaped into his present form by the growth in life. In the same way, the building up of the church is a matter of the growth of life.<p>Every part and aspect of the tabernacle typifies either the work of Christ or Christ Himself being something to us. The tabernacle typifies that by the redemptive work of Christ, He Himself has to be wrought into us as everything in life. In the outer court is the altar, typifying the cross of Christ. By Christ&#8217;s all-inclusive death on the cross, He accomplished everything needed for us to have a right relationship with God. When we come to Him, confessing that we are sinners and that we have been put to an end by His death, we receive Him. Then we go to the laver, signifying the cleansing, purging, purifying work of the Spirit. The washing of the Spirit purifies us from all defilement so that we may be pure, clean, and suitable to have Christ wrought into us.<p>After these two items, the real building itself is seen in the Holy Place and the Holy of Holies within the tabernacle. Everywhere in the tabernacle there is something of wood overlaid with gold, signifying the mingling of divinity with humanity. The human nature is overlaid with the divine nature. Divinity has been wrought into and upon humanity. The showbread table, the lampstand, the incense altar, the ark, and the boards which form the framework of the tabernacle show that Christ as the embodiment of God is wrought into us as the very essence that we may experience Him as life and everything.<p>The Lord has to open our eyes and impress us with all these things. We cannot look in the New Testament merely to find the outward items of the church and then try to form a church according to this pattern. This is an imitation of the church. The church is produced in the same way that a living person is produced, that is, by birth and growth of life. A person can make a doll, but he cannot make a real man. The church is a real man, the new man (Eph. 2:15). No one can make a church. The church comes into being by a new birth in the Spirit and by the growth in Christ. The development of the church comes into being by Christ being wrought into us.<p>This is why I say that we should not try to form or organize anything. Many brothers do not realize what I mean. They may ask, &#8220;If we do not form a church or organize anything, what are we doing here?&#8221; My response is that we have to eat and drink of Christ as our spiritual food and drink (John 4:14; 6:57). The more we feed on Him and drink of Him, the more we will be swallowed up by Him. We cannot form or organize a church. The church must be born of Christ in the Spirit. The church must be the living Body of Christ grown up in the Spirit with the life of Christ. Surely there is the outward pattern, or form, but this is not produced by human manufacturing. Instead, the pattern and shape come out of the growth of life. The church grows with Christ, by Christ, and in Christ.<p>According to the type of the tabernacle, we experience the work of Christ and what He has accomplished for us in the outer court. Then we enter into the Holy Place and the Holy of Holies where we experience Christ Himself as everything to us. We experience Christ as the supply of life, the light of life, the resurrection, and the all-inclusive One so that He may be wrought into us.<p>In this way we become the material for the building up of the church. In the Spirit of regeneration and the Spirit of maturity, signified by the golden rings and the golden bars that unite the boards of the tabernacle, we will be united, combined, and built up together as a home, as one. This is the Body of Christ and the dwelling place of God. The building up of the church is a matter of growth. Christ is wrought into us gradually and progressively as everything so that we may grow in Christ, by Christ, and with Christ. Then in the Spirit of regeneration and the Spirit of maturity we become the material fitly framed and united together as a whole. This oneness is the Body of Christ and the dwelling place of God, the church. We have to keep our human hands away from this building of the divine life.<p>We also need to realize that regardless of how much Christ has been wrought into us, we can only be good enough to be the boards. We cannot be the covering of the tabernacle. If we were the covering, the church would be the expression of us. Only Christ can be the covering, so the church is the expression of only Christ Himself. The roof of the tabernacle is of four layers of covering. Each layer is an aspect of Christ, and the entire covering as a roof is the full revelation of Christ. Christ is the only covering, so the whole tabernacle is an expression of Christ. It is only when Christ is the expression that He will be our covering.<p>All the utensils, furniture, and boards of the tabernacle were also protected by the covering. Thus, the covering is both the protection and expression of the tabernacle. If we do not have Christ as our expression, we do not have His protection. If we expect Christ to protect the church, we must have Him as our expression. Some groups of believers are covered by certain doctrines or gifts. Thus, these doctrines or gifts become their &#8220;roof,&#8221; their expression. They are not under the covering of Christ Himself, so there is no real protection. No doctrine or gift can protect us. Only Christ can protect us. We must uplift Christ, exalt Christ, and express Christ as the only roof covering us. We are under the roof of Christ Himself.<p>The measurements of the tabernacle show that the covering as the roof also covers the sides of the tabernacle. Thus, from the outside, nothing can be seen except the covering. The boards and the contents of the tabernacle cannot be seen from the outside. This means that when people look at the local church from without, they must see Christ and only Christ. Then when people come into the church, they should see the mingling of Christ with human beings. Whenever people contact us, they should have the realization that there is something of Christ within us. From without people should see nothing but Christ. From within people should see nothing but Christ wrought into human beings. This is the real church life.<p>Without the picture and pattern of the tabernacle, we could not be so clear about what the church life should be. We need this picture in addition to the definition of the church in Paul&#8217;s Epistles. A child needs both a picture and a definition to receive a thorough understanding. If you want him to understand what a cat is, you must not only give him the word cat but also show him a picture of a cat. When we look at the picture of the tabernacle, we can understand what the real building of the church is. The church is not produced by human organization or formed by human endeavor. The church is the issue of Christ being wrought into a group of people, and all of these people uplift Christ, exalt Christ, and put on Christ to cover them and protect them.<h2 class=head1>CHRIST TYPIFIED BY THE TABERNACLE&#8217;S FOUR LAYERS OF COVERING</h2><h2 class=head2>Fine Twined Linen</h2><p>Now we want to consider the tabernacle&#8217;s four layers of covering. The first layer was of fine linen. This was the layer of the most fine material. It was embroidered with beautiful colors: blue, purple, and scarlet. According to the type, blue is heavenly, purple is kingly, royal, and scarlet is redemptive. The fine linen signifies the fine human nature of Christ with His fine character and conduct. It typifies the bountiful, fine humanity of Christ. The four Gospels portray a Man whose nature and conduct were exactly like the fine linen. This linen was very strong because it was twined, doubled, strengthened. The Lord Jesus was fine yet strong. Nothing with Him was rough. The fine linen was also embroidered with cherubim, which typify God&#8217;s glory magnified in His creation. This means that God&#8217;s glory was wrought into Christ&#8217;s humanity. With Christ&#8217;s fine human nature and character, there was God&#8217;s divine glory wrought into His creation. Hebrews 1:3 says that He is the effulgence of God&#8217;s glory. He is the brightness of God&#8217;s shining. The embroidered cherubim were upon Him. He is not only human but also divine. His human nature bears the divine glory.<h2 class=head2>Goats&#8217; Hair</h2><p>The second layer was goats&#8217; hair. In Matthew 25 the Lord divides the sheep from the goats (vv. 32-33). The goats signify sinful persons. Second Corinthians 5:21 says that God made Christ, the One who knew no sin, sin for us. The layer of goats&#8217; hair typifies that Christ was made sin for us. He was like fine linen, but He was made like goats&#8217; hair. With Him there was no sin. He did not know sin, but He was made sin for our redemption.<h2 class=head2>Rams&#8217; Skins Dyed Red</h2><p>The third layer was rams&#8217; skins dyed red. A ram is a male and the dyeing of red signifies the shedding of blood for redemption. This signifies that Christ was slain on the cross, shedding His blood to redeem us from our sins. Thus, the first layer typifies that He was sinless; the second layer typifies that He was made sin for us; and the third layer typifies that He bore our sins and shed His blood to redeem us from our sins. He was the sinless One, but He was made sin for us to bear our sins.<h2 class=head2>Porpoise Skins</h2><p>The outer covering was porpoise skins, the protection and safeguard for the tabernacle. This layer could withstand any kind of storm or attack. It was very coarse and looked worthless. From the inside the tabernacle looked beautiful and glorious, but from the outside it appeared very coarse. Likewise, Christ did not have a beautiful outward appearance (Isa. 53:2), but within He was divinely beautiful. It is the same with the church. When viewed from the outside by the worldly people, the church seems worthless and coarse like the porpoise skins. But when people come into the church, they will see the beauty and glory of Christ.<p>This is different from the testimony in today&#8217;s Christianity. They have great and beautiful buildings, but when you get inside there is no spiritual content. Most of the time they are inwardly empty or may even be inwardly defiling and ugly. This is the situation of worldly Christianity. The proper church, the proper spiritual building of God, is divinely beautiful inwardly and coarse outwardly. There is no outward comeliness or beauty with the church, just as it was with Christ when He was on earth.<p>This shows that we should try to hide ourselves, not advertise ourselves. Today many in fallen Christianity put pictures of certain persons who minister the Word in the newspapers to advertise them. That is not a glory but a shame. That is something of worldly religion. We should not have our names advertised in the paper. Once when someone put up a sign advertising that I would speak in a certain place, I charged him to take that sign down or I would not speak. The Lord Jesus never advertised Himself. Instead, He always tried to keep Himself hidden. The beauty, the comeliness, must be within. The experience of Christ within our spirit is the real beauty before God.<p>We should even be careful not to build our meeting halls with a very beautiful appearance. In Christianity they build beautiful buildings to attract people. If people are attracted to your beautiful meeting hall, they will end up being a problem to the church. We cannot attract people to the Lord by a beautiful building. Many people are attracted to St. Peter&#8217;s Cathedral in the Vatican, but not many of them are saved. There is no use in trying to draw people to the Lord in this way. This is not a pleasure to the Lord but an offense.<p>Inwardly, Christ was full of beauty. Outwardly, He was simple and humble. Such a Christ must be the covering as the roof of the church. This is not my opinion or concept but the real picture shown by the Word of God. We should not express anything but Christ Himself. The only thing we lift up and exalt as the covering, the roof, of God&#8217;s building is the wonderful Christ. Within He is full of the divine beauty and comeliness. Without in others&#8217; eyes He is simple and humble. Such a church can endure any kind of attack or temptation. The ones who endure to the end are those who do not have an outward beautiful appearance but who have an inward heavenly beauty and divine comeliness. Christ is both their content and covering, so nothing can damage or overcome them. This is the real building of the church.<p>We must learn to seek Christ in the spirit. We must learn to discern our spirit to experience Christ as everything to us. Then we will enjoy the riches of Christ to arrive at the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ (Eph. 3:8; 4:13). We will be the material which can be built up with others to be the building of God. We will be covered by Christ by exalting Christ as the roof of God&#8217;s building. We will have a proper, strong church life which can withstand any attack and endure any trial or temptation to the end for the glory of God.</body></html>
