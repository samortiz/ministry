   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>A SHORTAGE OF LIFE</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>If one sees his brother sinning, John writes, "he shall ask life for them that sin not unto death" 1 John 5:16 .</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>This is the only reference in the Bible to ministering life to someone.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>How is it possible to give life to someone?</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>I can give him, say, a watch, but what does it mean to give him life?</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>It means that I impart Christ to him.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>It is of no help to talk doctrines to him.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>He has sinned because he is short of life.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>When we are short of the Lord Jesus, we commit sin.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Doctrine will not help us to overcome sin.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Only one Person can overcome sin, and that is the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>If we lose our temper, that is an indication that we are short of the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>We do not need a rebuke.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>We do not need to be told what we should do or should not do.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>We do not need to be told that we were wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The more we are condemned, the more our temper will rise.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>A rebuking reduces our measure of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>What we need is an addition of Him, not a reduction.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>We need more of Him imparted into us.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Have you ever realized that you sin because you are short of the Lord Jesus?</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Why do you mistreat your wife or husband?</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Have you ever looked in the mirror when you were angry and seen how ugly you were?</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Yet you had every intention of being considerate and loving toward your spouse.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Why is it you have not been able to live up to your resolves?</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>You are short of the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Husbands, do not rebuke your wife.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>You will simply make yourself and her miserable.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Rebuking makes the situation worse.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>What can you do?</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>You may say that you must love her.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Sometimes that may help, but love may corrupt and do damage.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Only Christ works.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Only life helps.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>We husbands must minister life to our wives.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Sisters, deep in your heart you may have the intention to subdue your husband.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Husbands like to rebuke; wives like to subdue.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>You will never succeed in subduing your husband; God created man to be over you.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The only husband who can be subdued is the clever one; he will merely be tricking you into thinking he is subdued.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Give up your efforts to subdue your husband.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>What he needs is for you to minister life to him.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>You must minister a portion of Christ to him.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Both husbands and wives need more Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Only He saves.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>What short simple words John uses!</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>"Give him life" a first grader can read this.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Yet how marvelous is the expression, found nowhere else in the Bible!</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Some may protest that the Bible tells us to admonish and rebuke.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>It does, but this is not the word of the mending ministry here.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Why is Christianity so degraded?</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>One reason is that there are many to admonish but few to give life.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>What can mend today's broken situation?</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Only the life-giving mending ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Christianity's poor situation is due to the shortage of life.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>THE WAY TO HELP A SINNING ONE</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>In the church life we must learn to minister life.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>This is what is needed.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Do not try other ways.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>No way of helping is better than that of ministering life.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>You may raise the objection that you yourself are short of life; how can you minister it to others?</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>You may indeed be short of life.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Then what should you do?</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Do not go to admonish or rebuke.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Do not even go to the other party.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>You yourself must turn to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>"Lord, have mercy upon me.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>My brother is sinning; he needs the supply of life.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>He lacks life.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>But so do I, Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>I don't have much life either.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Have mercy upon us, but first have mercy upon me.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>I need more life.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>I must have more life."</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>You may be so burdened that you will even fast and shorten your sleeping hours in order to pray for more life.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>I can assure you that you will be supplied.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>If your car is almost out of gasoline, you can turn into the gas station and stay there to have the tank refilled.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>After a little while your gas supply will be replenished and you can continue on your way.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>When you yourself have the supply, then you can supply others.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>We need to learn that when any brother or sister sins, this is a strong indication that he or she is short of life.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>To be of help, we must first check whether we have life.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>Do we have a surplus of life?</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>Do we have more than we need?</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>If not, we must wait on the Lord with prayer and fasting until we get the rich supply.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>Then we can minister from this supply to others.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>This is the way to go on in the church life during this time of degraded Christianity.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>John stresses that this life which we need to minister to others is simply God Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>It is the Son of God.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>"This is the true God, and eternal life."</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>Our need is to have a bigger portion of the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>Then we shall have a surplus to minister to others, a surplus not of knowledge or doctrine but of God.</S>
