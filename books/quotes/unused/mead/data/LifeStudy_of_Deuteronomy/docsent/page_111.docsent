   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Moses told the people that he was a hundred and twenty years old and could no longer go out and come in, and that Jehovah had told him that he could not cross over the Jordan v. 2 .

   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>God's victory over Sihon and Og was to be an assurance to the people that He would defeat all the kings in Canaan, take over their land, and give it to the children of Israel as their inheritance.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>E. Encouraging All Israel</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>to Be Strong and Take Courage, to Fear Not,</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Neither to Be Terrified of the Nations</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Finally, in verse 6 Moses encouraged all Israel to be strong and take courage, to fear not, neither to be terrified of the nations, for Jehovah their God went with them and He would not fail them nor forsake them.</S>
