   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>The Need to Recover Submission</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>When Adam fell, the order in the universe was destroyed.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>We should never try to differentiate between good and evil.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Rather, we should submit to authority.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Man is prone to judge good and evil by himself.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>He feels that this is good and that is not good.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>It seems as if man's judgment is clearer than God's. This, however, is a condition of foolishness and the fall.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>This must be removed from us, for this is nothing but rebellion.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The scant submission that we see now is not enough.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Some think that it is enough to be baptized and forsake the denominations.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>But this is not enough.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>There are many young students who think that God is chastising them by requiring them to submit to their teachers.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>There are many wives who think that God is chastising them by requiring them to submit to a husband who is impossible to live under.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>There are many Christians who are still living in rebellion.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>They have not learned even the basic step in submission.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Submission in the Bible is submission to God's appointed authority.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>How shallow is the submission which has been preached hitherto!</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Submission is the basic principle.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>If the matter of authority is not solved, nothing can be done well.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Faith is the principle by which we receive life, while submission is the principle by which we conduct our living.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>All of the divisions and denominations of the church today come from rebellion.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>In order to restore authority, submission must be restored first.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Many are accustomed to acting as the head; they have never known submission.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>But we must learn submission.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>It must become our reaction.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>God has not hidden one thing from us concerning authority.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>In the church, whether directly or indirectly, God has shown us how to submit to authority.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Many only know about submission to God; they do not know about submission to authorities.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Because all authorities are from God, everyone has to submit to authority.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>All of man's problems are due to living outside the realm of God's authority.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>No Oneness of the Body</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>without the Authority of the Head</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Today God is taking the way of the recovery of the oneness of the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>In order to have the oneness of the Body, there must first be the life of the Head and then the authority of the Head.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Without the life of the Head, there is no Body.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Likewise, without the authority of the Head, there is no oneness of the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>We must allow the life of the Head to rule so that the Body can become one.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>God requires that we submit not only to Him, but also to all His deputy authorities.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>All the members have to learn to submit to one another.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The Body is one.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The Head and the Body are also one.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>God's will can be accomplished only when the authority of the Head prevails.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>God wants the church be the kingdom of God.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>A Few Points on the Lesson</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>of Submission to Authority</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>A servant of God will eventually encounter authority in the universe, in his community, in his home, or in the church.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>If a man has never met God's authority, how can he submit to God?</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>This is not a matter of doctrine or teaching.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>If it is, it will still be abstract to us.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Some think that submission to authority is a very difficult thing.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>But it is not difficult when one meets God.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Unless God's mercy is upon us, no one can submit to God's authority.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>For this reason, there should be a few points for us to learn:</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>1 There must be a spirit of submission.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>2 There must be the training in submission.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Some people are like savages; they cannot come under any submission.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>We have appointed a housekeeper for every household with the hope that we would all learn submission.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Translator's Note: This refers to the dormitories of the training in which these messages were delivered.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Everyone should receive training by standing in the proper position.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>One who has learned the lesson or who has been trained will not feel restricted no matter where he is placed.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>He will spontaneously live out submission without any difficulty.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>3 One must learn to be a deputy authority.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>A worker of God must not only learn submission to authority; he must also learn to be God's deputy authority in the church and in the home.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>If God entrusts him with many things, and if he has learned to submit under God's authority, he will not feel boastful about anything.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>However, some who have learned to submit to others find that they do not know how to be the authority when they are brought by God to a place to work.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Therefore, not only do we have to learn to submit to authority, but we also have to learn to be the authority and to stand in the proper position.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>On the one hand, the church suffers because many do not submit.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>On the other hand, the church suffers because many do not know how to be the authority by standing in the proper position.</S>
