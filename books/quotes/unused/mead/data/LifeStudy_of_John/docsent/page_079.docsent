   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>C. Persecuted by Religion</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>It is a good thing to receive sight.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>However, be prepared to suffer persecution at the hands of blind religion.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The blind man who received his sight was cast out 9:34 , meaning that he was excommunicated, ostracized, from the Jewish synagogue.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>This means that he was put out of the sheepfold, as spoken by the Lord in 10:3-4.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Although he was excommunicated from Judaism, he was received by the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>D. Believing in the Son of God</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The blind man came to believe in Jesus as the Son of God 9:35-38 .</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The blind man received his sight by a kind of obscure believing.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>He believed, but he was not clear.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>He was simply innocent.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>He believed without really knowing who Jesus was.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>He believed in an innocent way.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Although he did not know adequately who Jesus was, he did believe that Jesus was someone special and he argued about this with the Pharisees.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Eventually, the Pharisees cast him out.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Then, the Lord Jesus found him and said, Do you believe in the Son of God?</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>9:35 .</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The blind man replied, And who is He, Lord, that I may believe in Him?</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>9:36 .</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>He believed, yet he did not know the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Then the Lord said to him, You have both seen Him, and He is the One who is speaking with you 9:37 .</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Then the blind man declared, Lord I believe.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>And he worshipped Him 9:38 .</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>He believed that the man Jesus is the Son of God.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Thus, the blind man not only received his sight, but he himself was received by the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>This means that the Lord, as the shepherd, entered the sheepfold, saw a little, blind sheep, opened his eyes, and then led that sheep out of the sheepfold.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>In one sense, the sheep was cast out; in another sense, the Lord led him out.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The Pharisees cast him out, but the Lord Jesus carried him out.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The Lord did not carry him out of hell but out of the sheepfold.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>As we shall see more in the next message, the sheepfold was Judaism, the law-keeping religion.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The blind man, like the blind and lame people on the porches in chapter five, was kept on the law-keeping porch.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Then the Lord Jesus came, not only as life, but also as the shepherd, to lead him out of the fold.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The Lord is sovereign.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Many of us were in the fold of religion.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Perhaps you were there as one who was lame.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>We all were on that porch.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Thank the Lord Jesus for His sovereignty.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>He came as life to heal our blind eyes and as the shepherd to lead us out of the fold.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>E. Judged by Life</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>In 9:39-41, Jesus said, For judgment I came into this world, that those who do not see may see, and that those who see may become blind.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Some of the Pharisees who were with Him heard these things and said to Him, Are we also blind?</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Jesus said to them, If you were blind you would have no sin; but now that you say, We see, your sin remains.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The Lord told the Pharisees that He came to judge.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>But He told Nicodemus that He came not to judge but to save 3:17 .</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>He found a seeking soul in Nicodemus; therefore, He will not come to condemn the world, but to save the world.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>However, He saw pride in the Pharisees; hence, He will come to judge them.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Whether the Lord will come to judge or to save you depends upon your attitude.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>If your attitude is like that of Nicodemus, He will come to save you.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>If your attitude is that of the Pharisees, He will come to judge you.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Whether the Lord will become a Judge or a Savior to you depends upon your attitude.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>The Lord will seriously vindicate Himself when anyone is proud to assert himself with many claims.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>This simply indicates that he does not need the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Consequently, the Lord will leave such a person in his blindness.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>We must be very careful not to proudly say that we can see.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>If we claim that we see, the Lord will leave us blind.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>The Lord said that He will give sight to those who cannot see, but that He will make blind those who claim to see.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>This is a serious vindication of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Thus, we must be humble and not proud.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Pride simply means blindness and darkness.</S>
