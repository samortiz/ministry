<P>Verses 35-36: "For I was hungry and you gave Me something to eat; I was thirsty and you gave Me a drink; I was a stranger and you took Me in, naked and you clothed Me; I was sick and you visited Me; I was in prison and you came to Me." The difference between the sheep and the goats lies here. The reason that the sheep can receive the kingdom is because they gave food, gave hospitality, provided clothes, and visited the sick and those in prison, or performed similar good deeds. At the judgment seat the believers will be judged by their faithfulness, and the Jews by whether they worship the beast or not. The Gentiles will be judged at the white throne according to the book of life and the scrolls. Therefore, the Gentiles described here are different from the Gentiles in general because these are still living at the time of the Lord's coming. The judgment for them is based on the way they treat the Lord, that is, the way they treat the little brothers of the Lord. However, this does not include all the Gentiles who treat the Lord's little brothers well.</P><P>Verses 37-40: "Then the righteous will answer Him, saying, Lord, when have we seen You hungry and have fed You, or thirsty and have given You a drink? And when have we seen You a stranger and have taken You in, or naked and have clothed You? And when have we seen You sick or in prison and have come to You? And the King will answer and say to them, Truly I say to you, Inasmuch as you have done it to one of these, the least of My brothers, you have done it to Me." "One of these, the least of My brothers" should be rendered "the last of the brothers." Who are they? The Lord has three kinds of brothers: (1) the Jews (Acts 7:23-26; Rom. 9:3; Deut. 17:15); (2) His brothers in the flesh (Matt. 12:46-48; 13:55); and (3) the believers (Matt. 12:48-50). The little brothers referred to in Matthew 25:40 do not belong to categories (1) and (2), for the Lord clearly annulled those relationships in Matthew 12. Therefore, "the last...brothers" mentioned here refer to believers who have passed through the tribulation. How then are they called the last of the brothers? They are called such because they became so after their resurrection. A little brother is most blessed. Benjamin received a double portion. The Lord is one with these little brothers because to do anything to them is to do it "unto Me." Today by believing in the Lord, we become one with Him. This is why when Saul persecuted the saints, it was said that he was persecuting the Lord (Acts 9:5).</P><P>The overcomers will be caught up first. Those remaining, the majority of the believers, will pass through the tribulation and will be persecuted everywhere. The sheep will hear the eternal gospel preached to them by the angels (Rev. 14:6-7), a gospel that will exhort them to fear God and not to worship the idols. Consequently, they will not follow the current of their age in persecuting the Christians and in worshipping idols; rather, they will fear God. The Christians will then be sojourners, and these people will treat them well. All of their deeds will be done during the tribulation and will be different from those done at ordinary times. To do those deeds then will not be easy. This judgment will be based on their deeds in their bodies and not according to matters related to their spirit. Therefore, it is evident that they are not Christians. These people must be those living within the realm of material things.</P><P>The righteous are astonished. The Lord recognizes their astonishment. This shows that their good works are not done for the Lord's sake. Hence, it is clear that they are not Christians. When we treat a brother well, we are aware of it (Mark 9:41). Likewise, the Jews know that the Lord is the Lord, for after the tribulation they will all look upon the One whom they have pierced (Zech. 12:10).</P><P>The third section: the dialogue with the goats.</P><P>Verses 41-45:"Then He will say also to those on the left, Go away from Me, you who are cursed, into the eternal fire prepared for the devil and his angels. For I was hungry and you did not give Me anything to eat; I was thirsty and you did not give Me a drink; I was a stranger and you did not take Me in; naked and you did not clothe Me; sick and in prison, and you did not visit Me. Then they also will answer, saying, Lord, when have we seen You hungry or thirsty or a stranger or naked or sick or in prison and did not minister to You? Then He will answer them, saying, Truly I say to you, Inasmuch as you did not do it to one of the least of these, neither have you done it to Me." The evil ones are punished solely on the ground that they did not treat the Christians well. To treat the Christians well during the time of tribulation is not an easy matter. Therefore, the Lord will reward the sheep for their good work.</P><P>The fourth section: the conclusion.</P><P>Verse 46:"And these shall go away into eternal punishment, but the righteous into eternal life." That the evil shall go into eternal punishment is unquestionable. However, are the righteous saved? Yes. However, they do not receive eternal life but rather shall "go...into" eternal life. Eternal life enters into the believers, whereas the righteous here will enter into eternal life. These two are different: one enters into the kingdom; the other receives the kingdom. God gave the kingdom to Adam, whereas the believers are given by the Father to Christ. No one can pluck these ones that are chosen by the Father out of His hand.</P><P>The "cursed" in verse 41 are not cursed by God, for God never predestinates man to perdition.</P><P>The righteous are declared such by the Lord. They are not justified by man or by themselves. As such, they are saved. "Eternal punishment" here is in contrast to "eternal life." From this we know that these are saved.</P><P>These are recovered to the standing of Adam. In the Old Testament there are evidences to show that men inherited land because of righteousness (Psa. 37:10-11, 22-23, 26-29, 34; Gen. 12:2; 27:28; Num. 24:5, 9).</P><P>The most comforting fact is that even though the believers may pass through the great tribulation, the Lord will still remember them and send angels to preach the eternal gospel. The lesson we must learn here is that we need to be careful in dealing with a brother who is suffering. Although the Lord allows him to suffer, we need to help him. We should not be like the friends of Job. The Lord is one with His believers. Even when they are in prison, the Lord is still with them.</P>
