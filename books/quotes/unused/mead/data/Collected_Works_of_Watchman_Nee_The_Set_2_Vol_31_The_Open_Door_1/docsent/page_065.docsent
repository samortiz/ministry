   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Wu-Chow,</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Kwangsi Province</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Dear Brother Lan in the Lord:</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>May grace and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ be to you.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Since parting from you at the station, I arrived in Canton by the Lord's grace.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Although I experienced many hardships and threats along the way, the grace of God was always sufficient.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>God protected, watched over, and upheld me more carefully and more completely than a loving mother protects her baby in love.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>I cannot deny the dangers of the Canton-Hankow Railway, neither can I refrain from praising our God, saying, "Jehovah will keep you from all evil; He will keep your soul.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Jehovah will keep your going out and your coming in from now to eternity."</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>After the train passed through Ch'ang-sha, it would sometimes back up because there were too many trains on the tracks ahead.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>We would go forward for a day and backwards for a day.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>After four days and nights, we barely made it to Li-Dong in the middle of the night, because the #22 Canton-Wu-ch'ang Express traveling north had gone off the track at the entrance of the tunnel between the Ying-Teh and Li-Dong stations about 64 miles from its point of origination ; our train had to stop outside the tunnel.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>It could not go forward, and the passengers were free to get off the train.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>For awhile everything was in confusion.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>People were frightened, and we could not make out our way because it was night.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>There were no hotels and no place to stay the night.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>I had brought only two pieces of luggage with me, having shipped the rest of my things.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Two people left their luggage with me and walked five miles to the southern end of the Li-Dong tunnel to take a train to Canton.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Since I had been entrusted with their luggage, I had to be faithful.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>At dawn I hurriedly boarded a train back to Lien-Jiang and took the Jung-Yuan electric boat to Canton.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>I traveled for three days under the covering of His blood and did not meet up with any danger.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>I must honestly say that it was the Lord's covering.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>When I arrived in Canton, I had to wait for a few days at Brother Shuan's place because my luggage had not arrived.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>I also went to Hong Kong to visit the brothers in the Lord in Kowloon.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The meeting in Kowloon experienced much blessing from the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Because of this trip south, I was able to hear Brother Nee's message.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>He spoke on the topic of "The Question of Power and Wisdom" on the Lord's Day.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The Scripture reference was 1 Corinthians 1:22-31.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The main points of the message were: "The Bible manifests God's wisdom, while the Holy Spirit manifests His power.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Many of God's children think that if they beg God to make them this and that way, they will become this and that way.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>They do not know that such prayer is like climbing a tree to get fish.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The more they pray, the farther they will be from what they want.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>We are justified, not because we are worthy to be justified, but because the Lord Jesus, the righteous One who lives in us, makes us righteous.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>If someone asks who my righteousness is, I can immediately answer that the Lord Jesus is my righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>From this we see that we do not have to ask the Lord to make us righteous in this or that matter.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>We just need to allow the Lord to reign in us, for He is righteousness itself.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The Holy Spirit has the power and can accomplish in us what we are unable to accomplish in ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>He can overcome what we are unable to overcome.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Therefore, we do not need to beg the Lord to make us this or that.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>We just need to allow the Lord to do this or that in us."</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The Holy Spirit worked much on that day.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The atmosphere in the meeting was attentive.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The word was strong and piercing.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Unfortunately, I did not write it all down, so I can only tell you the main points.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>I arrived in Wu-Chow on the sixteenth, but the Salt Ministry was not set up yet.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>This was really unexpected.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The only denominations here are the Christian and Missionary Alliance Church and the Baptist Church.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>This is only my second day here, but I have been invited to testify at the Christian and Missionary Alliance Church twice already.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>I spoke on the matter of life.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>They really desired it.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>What is the current situation in Hankow?</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Will you be going elsewhere?</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Has God given you some direction?</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Please write an answering note if it is convenient.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>May the Lord be with you!</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Greet all the brothers and sisters in the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Your little brother in the Lord,</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Mu Hue-chen</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>January 21</S>
