   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>When the Spirit comes, it is the Son who comes.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Thus, when the Spirit comes, all three are present.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>The Spirit came after the Lord s resurrection to remind the disciples of all the things that the Lord had told them before His crucifixion.</S>

   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Overcoming All Troubles and Fears</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Life s peace overcomes all troubles and fears.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>All of the troubles and fears in this portion of the Word are caused by the persecuting religion.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>At that time, it was not a small thing to follow the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>The disciples did so at the risk of losing their lives or, at the very least, of losing the way to earn their living.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Since the disciples were under the fear of the opposing and persecuting religion, the Lord told them that in Him they had peace.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>He left His peace with them.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>This peace is just the Lord Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Regardless of the opposition, persecution, rumors, and bad names given to us by religion, the Lord Jesus within us is our life and our peace.</S>

   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>in the Giver of This Peace</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>The ruler of this world has nothing in the Giver of this peace 14:30 .</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>In this verse the Lord said, The ruler of the world is coming, and in Me he has nothing.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>The ruler of the world is Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>The hour was coming when he was going to attack the Lord, but the Lord said that Satan had nothing in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>In the next verse the Lord said, That the world may know that I love the Father, and as the Father commanded Me, so I do.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>Here the Father s commandment was for Him to die for the purpose of bringing us into God.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>The Lord fulfilled this commandment in order to show the world that He loved the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>The Lord did not go into death to show that Satan had failed to overcome Him or that Satan had nothing in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>Rather, the Lord went into death because He was going to prove to the world that He loved the Father so much.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>I believe that at this point we are clear about the meaning of this chapter.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>The Lord was going to die, to be resurrected, and to be transfigured into the Spirit as His other form, as another Comforter, so that He might come into us and bring us into God.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>By the resurrection life we are joined in oneness with God.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>Only by the Lord s death and resurrection could we be joined with God and be brought into Him.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>By His death the Lord has taken away sin, sins, the self, the old man, the flesh, the world, the prince of the world, and death.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>The Lord has removed all of these distances through His death.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>By His resurrection He is now the Spirit, and as the Spirit He comes into us and brings us into union with God.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>Now He is in the Father, we are in Him, and He is in us.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>Consequently, we are in the Father also.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>If we love Him and cooperate with Him, He will manifest Himself to us more and more.</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>The more we love the Lord, the more the Triune God will come to us, make His home with us, and make a mutual abode with us.</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>This mutual abode is the mingling of God with man.</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>The oneness of this mingling is the spiritual abode, the divine abode, the mutual abode.</S>
   <S PAR='98' RSNT='1' SNO='98'>We are an abode to God, and God is an abode to us.</S>
   <S PAR='99' RSNT='1' SNO='99'>This is the real building.</S>
   <S PAR='100' RSNT='1' SNO='100'>This is the proper and correct meaning of the Lord s word found in this chapter.</S>
