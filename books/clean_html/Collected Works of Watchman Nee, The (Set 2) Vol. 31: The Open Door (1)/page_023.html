<h2 class="head2">Recent News of Sister Ma Min-jen,<br />Kuling, Jiu-Jiang</h2><p>Sister X:</p><p>My illness has improved. The "air-pressurization" did me some good, and no bacteria was found in the sputum during the last examination. Perhaps the "air-pressurization" had killed the germs. The present world situation forces us to cry to the Lord to come quickly. I will write again. Please give my greetings to the brothers and sisters.</p><p>Sister Min-jen<br />November 19<br />(Sister Ma moved from the mountain in January and into Ren-Ji Hospital in Yi-Chang for convalescent care&mdash;Editor.)</p><h2 class="head2">Three Letters from Hankow</h2><h2 class="head3">One</h2><p>Sister X:</p><p>Tonight, Brother Han Fu-sheng with his children and amah, Brother Zhang Gung-jih and his family, Dr. and Mrs. Qu of Jiu-Jiang and their family, Mrs. Hu and my wife, and one sister from the Wei household left for Ch'ang-Teh on a steamer.
