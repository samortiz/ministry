<P>Today Israel is being pressed to release the land which they have regained. Israel will not do this. All the Arab countries which surround Israel hate Israel today. In the future Antichrist and his armies will do their best to slaughter the people of Israel. According to Zechariah they will slaughter two-thirds of them, so only one-third will be left (13:8-9). Out of this one-third, half of the city of Jerusalem will be captured (14:2). Then the Lord will return to fight against and defeat Antichrist and his armies.</P><P>At that time the Lord will grant something to those who mourn in Zion. They will mourn because they will have lost their relatives. But when Christ comes, He will give them a headdress instead of ashes. A headdress is a turban. Those who mourn in Israel put ashes upon themselves, but Christ will remove the ashes and give them a turban, a headdress. He will also give them the oil of gladness instead of mourning, and the mantle of praise for praising Jehovah instead of a spirit of heaviness. These are also very fitting for us believers today. Before we were saved, we were like this on the negative side, but the Lord gave Himself to us in such a rich way as all the above items. He will also be all these things to Israel at His return.</P><P>The Lord does all these things in order that the people of Israel may be called the terebinths of righteousness, the planting of Jehovah, that He may be glorified (Isa. 61:3b). Although many of them will be slaughtered, those who remain will become growing trees of righteousness. Terebinths, according to my study, are the best oaks. The people of Israel will be the planting of Jehovah, that Jehovah may be glorified. This will be at Christ's second coming, in which He will be the Anointed of God to take care of God's scattered and suffering people.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>E. As a Standard Raised Up<br>for the Gathering of Jehovah's Scattered People</H2><P>At Christ's return, He will be as a standard raised up for the gathering of Jehovah's scattered people (Isa. 62:10b). By that time, all Israel will be coming back. They have to see a sign, a standard, to which they can all be gathered together. Christ, the Anointed of Jehovah, will be that gathering standard.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>F. As the Salvation Coming to Zion to Rescue Her<br>from the Destruction of Antichrist<br>and the Nations with Him</H2><P>This Anointed of Jehovah will come to rescue Zion. Zion was one of the mountains upon which Jerusalem was built, and that mountain originally was called Moriah, where Abraham offered up his son, Isaac (Gen. 22:1-2). The temple was built on Mount Moriah in Jerusalem (2 Chron. 3:1). Later, Moriah was referred to as Mount Zion (Psa. 2:6; 48:2, 11; 74:2). The Lord will be the salvation coming to Zion to rescue her from the destruction of Antichrist and the nations with him (Isa. 62:11b; Zech. 12:2-9). At that juncture, Antichrist will have captured half of the inhabitants in Jerusalem. Christ as the Anointed of Jehovah will come to rescue them out of the killing hand of Antichrist.</P>
