   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>The Metamorphic Change of This Organism,</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>the Mingling of God and Man</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Following this, let us consider the metamorphic change of this organism the mingling of God and man Eph 4:22-24 .</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Although the Body of Christ has been cut off from the old creation, the "skin" of the old creation has not been fully shed.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>There is still the need for the metamorphic change, which is the putting off of the old man that has been corrupted by lust and the putting on of the new man that is created according to God in righteousness and holiness of the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Hence, every day we are putting off the old man and putting on the new man.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The more we put off the old man, the more we will put on the new man.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>This metamorphic change is accomplished through the renewing in the spirit of the mind of the believers.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>When the Spirit of God continually saturates our minds, we have the spirit of our mind.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>It is in this spirit that we are renewed and are transformed.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>This metamorphic change of the organism, the mingling of God and man, is also accomplished through the redemption by the saturating of the Holy Spirit of God as the seal Eph 4:30 .</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The more the Holy Spirit saturates us, the more our bodies are redeemed.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The parts of our being that have not been saturated by this seal are not yet redeemed.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The Holy Spirit is in us as the seal.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>From the day that we were saved, God has been sealing us with His element for the purpose of saturating our whole being until our bodies are fully transformed and redeemed.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>This kind of metamorphic change is also through the nourishing, sanctifying, and washing of Christ's word of life Eph 5:25b-27, 29 .</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>In the Lord's word, there is not only the washing water, but also the nourishing element and the sanctifying power.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The nourishing affords the supply in life and provides the warm, tender, loving cherishing.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Sanctification separates us unto God and transforms us.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The washing removes the spots and wrinkles so that the divine organism may become holy and glorious.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The Growth of This Divine Organism</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>and the Organic Building Up</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>of the Organism by Itself</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>As a step further, let us consider the growth of this divine organism and the organic building up of the organism by itself Eph 4:11-16 .</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The gifted ones in this organism perfect others so that they can also become gifted ones and can do the work of the ministry for the organic building up of the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Furthermore, the growth of this organism in the divine life equals the organic building up of the organism by itself in the divine life.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>When a baby is born, he needs to grow by drinking milk.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>This growth is the building, and both the growth and the building are organic functions.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>To build a house is organizational; it is not organic.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>It is done by putting together different materials.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>It is an organizational building.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>But our body is not like this.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Our body is built up organically.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>It is not built up by adding some flesh or skin from without, but by the growth of itself through eating.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The most difficult lesson to learn for us who are working for the Lord is to not have an organizational work but to have an organic work.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Many times our nourishing and perfecting of others are merely organizational methods.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>We only add something onto others.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>We should learn of Paul, who helped others to grow in life.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>In 1 Corinthians 3:6 he said, "I planted, Apollos watered, but God made to grow."</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>If we want to have an organic work, we need to have this kind of realization and attitude.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>We should not depend on our own methods.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>We are only those who plant and water.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>We can only do our part to nourish others, to fellowship and pray with others, and to supply them with some words of life.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>In the depth of our being, we still look to the God who gives life to work in man.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>In this way, we are not adding something to man, but are supplying others from within so that they can grow in life and be built up.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>In order for the Body of Christ to grow and be built up organically this way, we need to hold to truth in love and to grow up into the Head, Christ, in all things.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>When we lead and help others, we have to point out a way for them to learn to practice holding to truth in love and to grow up in all things into the Head, Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>By this, they will be able to touch and enjoy Christ, and Christ will have the preeminent place in them.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>They will then grow and be built up.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>In this way, out from the Head, all the Body, being joined together through every joint of the supply and being knit together through the operation in measure of each one part, will be able to grow gradually unto the organic building up of itself in love.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Hence, strictly speaking, it is not we who are building.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>We are only affording others a little supply, through which they grow and are built up organically.</S>
