<li>In his writings, Paul unveils to us that the grace of God is:
	<ol class="decimal" start="30">
	<li>The grace of Christ by which God called the Galatian believers to the gospel according to God&rsquo;s economy&mdash;Gal. 1:6.</li>
	<li>The grace through which God called the apostle Paul&mdash;1:15.</li>
	<li>The grace that was given to the apostle Paul and realized by James, Cephas, and John&mdash;2:9.</li>
	<li>The grace through which Paul was justified and which he would not nullify&mdash;2:21.</li>
	<li>The grace from which the Galatian believers had fallen because they went back to the law for their justification&mdash;5:4.</li>
	<li>The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ which was in the spirit of the Galatian believers for their remaining in God&rsquo;s New Testament economy&mdash;6:18.</li>
	<li>The rich grace of God with which He graced the believers in choosing, predestinating, and redeeming them in Christ&mdash;Eph. 1:6-7.</li>
	<li>The grace by which the believers have been saved through the death and resurrection of Christ and of which the surpassing riches might be displayed in the ages to come&mdash;2:5-8.</li>
	<li>The grace of which the apostle Paul was given the stewardship by God to carry out His New Testament economy in Christ&mdash;3:2, 7-9.</li>
	<li>The grace which is given to the believers according to what kind of gifts (gifted persons) they are in the Body of Christ&mdash;4:7.</li>
	<li>The grace concerning the entire salvation of Christ which is ministered to others out of the believers&rsquo; mouth in their common talk&mdash;4:29.</li>
	<li>The grace that is with those who love the Lord in incorruptibility&mdash;6:24.</li>
	<li>The grace of which the Philippian believers were partakers with the apostle Paul both in his bonds and in his defense and confirmation of the gospel&mdash; Phil. 1:7.</li>
	<li>The grace which was with the spirit of the Philippian believers in their experiences of Christ when the church was under persecution&mdash;4:23.</li>
	<li>The grace which the Colossian believers heard and knew in truth&mdash;Col. 1:6.</li>
	<li>The grace which the apostle Paul exhorted the believers in Colossae to sing with in their hearts when the word of Christ dwelt in them richly in all wisdom by their teaching and admonishing one another with psalms and hymns and spiritual songs&mdash;3:16.</li>
	<li>The grace with which the believers&rsquo; speech should always be, seasoned with salt, that they may know how they ought to answer each one&mdash;4:6.</li>
	<li>The grace that kept the Thessalonian saints sanctified wholly and preserved complete in their spirit, soul, and body&mdash;1 Thes. 5:23-28.</li>
	<li>The grace according to which the name of the Lord Jesus was glorified in the Thessalonian saints and they were glorified in Him&mdash;2 Thes. 1:12.</li>
	<li>The grace in which the Lord Jesus Christ and God the Father loved the Thessalonian saints and gave them eternal comfort and good hope and would comfort their hearts and establish them in every good work and word&mdash;2:16-17.</li>
	</ol></li>

<p>Prayer: Lord, we still look unto You. Only You know how much we need You. We need You to know Your holy Word. We do not want to know it just according to the dead letters. We want to know it according to Yourself as the Spirit. Lord, we are here again to cover twenty items of Your grace in six books. How much could we say, and what should we say? We look unto You. Lord, we have to confess that we still have shortcomings and mistakes. O Lord, forgive us. We are still quite contaminated. We need Your cleansing. Forgive us and cleanse us that we might be kept in the fellowship with You. Lord, we pray that the entire meeting would be a fellowship in the fellowship of God. Be with each one of us. Speak the same word, yet meet the particular need of all the saints. Amen.</p>
<p>In this message we want to continue our fellowship on the grace of God. Grace is covered throughout the New Testament, but the same word <em>grace</em> differs in its meaning according to the book in which it is mentioned. The grace in Galatians is different from the grace in Ephesians. This is because every book has its background and its goal. Grace in a certain book is used for that book&rsquo;s particular background and goal. We may say that we already know that grace is God becoming our enjoyment, but this is inadequate. This is a self-deceiving satisfaction. We must realize that the Word of God is deep, especially the word <em>grace.</em> In order for us to know what grace is in each book, we must get into the background and the goal of that book. In Romans grace is used with a different denotation in every chapter.</p>
<p>In this message we will cover twenty more points concerning the grace of God in six books: Galatians, Ephesians, Philippians, Colossians, and the two Thessalonians. Nearly every point needs a conference to be covered thoroughly. Because we do not have that much time, the only way we can take is to share the principles. We have to spend some time to get into the depths of the Word by keeping the principles.</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_069.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_071.html">Next</a> </body></html>
