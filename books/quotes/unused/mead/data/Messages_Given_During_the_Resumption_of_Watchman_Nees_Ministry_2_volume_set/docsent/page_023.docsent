   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>1.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The Anointing Bringing with It a Feeling</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>A few times I found myself arguing with rickshaw drivers.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>When I argued, the Lord was gone.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>There is a difference between what we know and what we feel.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>You may know that a certain medicine is bitter, but it is only after you put the medicine into your mouth that you feel its bitterness.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>When God anoints us, this anointing comes with a feeling.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>If I touch Brother Weigh's forehead, surely he will feel something.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Whenever we ignore our feeling, we are cut off from the fellowship.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>This is very real, and it is very simple.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>It all depends on whether or not you are willing and whether or not you want to have this experience.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>All other kinds of teachings are dispensable, but this matter is indispensable.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>There is no teaching that can cause something to happen: No matter how proper, neat, clean, and blameless you are as a person, as long as you are living outside of the Lord, you are not worth anything in God's eyes.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>2.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Walking according to the Sense of Peace</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>It is true that every genuine Christian has the anointing in him.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The Lord is not stingy, but neither is He sloppy.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>He means business with us.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Some sisters may want to buy some bargain fabrics.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>There is nothing wrong with this, yet the Lord may not want them to do it.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>For the price to be cheap is one thing.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>For someone to buy the items is another thing.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>In the end, when the sisters go ahead and make the purchase, they lose their peace and are unable to pray for a few days.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Only when others buy those fabrics from them are they able to gain back their peace.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>3.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The Depth of Our Experience Depending</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>on the Degree of Our Obeying the Inner Feelings</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>I have been a Christian for twenty-two and a half years.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>During the first ten or more years, I did not know anything about this way.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>During the last few years, the Lord has granted me mercy to discover this way.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The more you go along with your inner feelings, the more your spirit will be enlightened, and the more demands you will experience.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>These demands will become more and more severe, and you will be more and more restricted by the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Up to a certain point, you will lose the freedom to speak, act, laugh, or cry.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>You will be restricted in everything.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The more we reason, the more the Lord is gone.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Only by accepting all adverse conditions willingly and giving up all reasonings will the Lord have a way.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The anointing teaches us in everything.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>This anointing is true and is not a lie.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The question is whether or not we are willing to obey.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>THE FEELING OF THE SPIRIT AND</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>THE FEELING OF THE CONSCIENCE</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Brother Ho asked: How can we tell the difference between the feeling of the spirit and the feeling of the conscience?</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Can our conscience be wrong sometimes, since Satan disguises himself as an angel of light at times?</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>2 Cor 11:14 .</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>A. Taking Care of the Inner Feeling</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>in Everything</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Brother Lee answered: The initial work of the Holy Spirit is to recover the function of the conscience and to point out man's mistakes.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>After the function of the conscience is recovered, the Holy Spirit can go on to recover man's spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Once man's spirit is recovered, surely it will have feelings.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>A person has to take care of the inner feelings.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>If he does not have peace about something, he should stop doing it.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Only when he is at peace should he proceed with anything.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>B. No Need for Too Much Analyzing</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Rather, Exercising Much and</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Walking in Peace in a Faithful Way</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>In the Gospels, after a person is saved, many times the Lord says, "Go in peace" Mark 5:34; Luke 7:50 .</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Romans 8:6 says that "the mind set on the spirit is life and peace."</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>After the Ethiopian eunuch was baptized, he went on his way rejoicing Acts 8:32-39 .</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>In taking this way, there is no need to analyze too much.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>In the course of our experience, spontaneously we will be able to differentiate between the conscience, the spirit, and the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>We will develop a feeling for all these things.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Sometimes we may make mistakes, but we should not be discouraged.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>If we are wrong, we can exercise more until we become right.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>This is like practicing riding a bicycle or practicing penmanship.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>This way is surely the right way, and as long as our hearts are clean, as long as we are faithful, and as long as we have a heart for God, our feelings will become more and more sensitive.</S>
