   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Causing the Heavenly King Not to Do</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Many Works of Power among Them</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Verse 58 says, And He did not do many works of power there because of their unbelief.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The rejection of the Pharisees caused the heavenly King to forsake them.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The unbelief of the Galileans caused the Lord not to do many works of power among them.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Because of the Galileans natural knowledge, the Lord Christ could not do anything with them.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The Galileans did not say, Jesus, we don t want You!</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Get away from here!</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>They simply asked, Is this not the carpenter s son?</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Where did this man get this wisdom and these works of power?</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>These questions were sufficient.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The heavenly King could no longer remain there, and His gracious works of power could no longer be enjoyed by them.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Therefore, He departed from them to the desert where there was no culture, no religion, and, as we shall now see, no politics.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>B. Rejection by the Heathen Tetrarch</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>In 14:1-13 we see the rejection by the heathen tetrarch.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Politics is always alongside religion and culture.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>According to Matthew s presentation, after the rejection by religion and natural knowledge, there is the rejection by politics.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Herod the tetrarch represents the rejection by politics.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>This is the basic principle of 14:1-13.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Herod had John the Baptist beheaded in prison.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>In 12:24 the Jewish religious leaders, representing the entire nation of the Jews, rejected the heavenly King to the uttermost.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>This forced Him to forsake His natural relationship with them 12:46-50 .</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Then in 13:53-58 He was also rejected by the Galileans.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Now in chapter fourteen, Matthew in his doctrinal arrangement unveils to us how Gentile politics treated the King s forerunner.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Gentile politics were evil and full of corruption and darkness.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Up to this point Matthew has given a full picture of how the Jews, Galileans, and Gentiles rejected the ministry of the kingdom of the heavens.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>1.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Heathen Politics Coinciding with Jewish Religion</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Firstly, the rejection by religion reached its climax.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Following this came the rejection due to natural knowledge.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The rejection by politics coincided with the rejection by religion and natural knowledge.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The religionists, those with natural knowledge, and the politicians did not hold a conference for the purpose of rejecting the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Nevertheless, their rejection of Him coincided.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Religion, natural knowledge, and politics all came together in the rejection of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>2.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The Darkness of Politics Exposed</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>In chapter fourteen we see the darkness, rottenness, and injustice in politics.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Our eyes need to be opened to see that in religion there is no welcome to our heavenly King.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Neither is there a place for Him in natural knowledge nor in today s rotten, dark politics.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>In this generation there is no place for the heavenly King.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Religion, culture, and politics are all one in rejecting the heavenly King.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>How I thank the Lord for the record in the Gospel of Matthew.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>If you read the chapters prior to fourteen, you will see the deceitfulness in the Jewish religion.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>You will also see that natural knowledge has caused great damage to people.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Furthermore, you will see the rottenness and darkness in Roman politics, which was the leading political system on earth at the time.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>But even in the best political system there is nothing but rottenness and darkness.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>3.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Causing the Heavenly King</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>to Retreat to the Desert</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Thus far, we have seen the first two stations on the pathway to glory.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>The first station is the rejection by natural knowledge, and the second is the rejection by politics.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>The rejection both by culture and by politics compelled the heavenly King to retreat.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>When He heard of the execution of John the Baptist, He departed from there in a boat to a desert place privately 14:13 .</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Due to the rejection by all the religious, cultured, political peoples, the heavenly King left them for a desert place.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>This indicates that henceforth He would hide Himself privately in a desert, in a place without culture, away. from the religious, political, and cultured people.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>He did this in a boat, implying He would do this through the church.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Due to the rejection of the civilized world, the Lord, through the church, has always been hiding Himself privately from the religious and political circles in a realm without much culture.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>The remainder of 14:13 says, And when the crowds heard of it, they followed Him on foot from the cities.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>In spite of the rejection of all peoples, there was still a good number who followed the heavenly King.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>They did this by leaving their cities.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>It was not that the King came to their cities to visit them, but that they left their cultured cities to follow Him in the desert.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Through all the centuries, the true followers of Christ have left cultured spheres to follow their heavenly King outside the cultured world.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>We are among those who have followed Him.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Where He is, we go.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>We follow Him through all manner of rejection to the desert.</S>
