<h1 class=msg>CHAPTER THIRTY-NINE</h1><h1 class=msg>THE SIGNS IN JOHN FOURTEEN THROUGH SEVENTEEN</h1><h1 class=msg>(4)</h1><h1 class=scripture>Scripture Reading: John 14:2-3, 18-20, 28a; 16:5-7, 16</h1><p>In this message we shall consider the second sign found in chapters fourteen through seventeen of the Gospel of John: the sign of the Son’s going and coming. This sign involves the process of Christ’s death and resurrection. Why do we consider the Son’s going and coming to be a sign? We regard this as a sign because when the disciples heard about the Lord’s going and His coming, they understood it in a natural way. They thought that the Lord’s going meant that He would leave them and stay away from them forever. But the Lord’s going signifies something mysterious and divine. Notice that I use the word “signifies”; I do not use the word “means.” We are not speaking about what the Lord’s going means, but about what it signifies.<p>The Lord’s going was not merely a going away, a leaving. Rather, His going was a sign. The disciples, however, did not understand the significance of the Lord’s going. When they heard the word “go” come out of the Lord’s mouth, they understood it in a natural way. They did not realize at the time that the Lord’s going signified something deep, mysterious, and divine. Therefore, we need to see that the Lord’s going is a wonderful sign.<p>In the same principle, the Lord’s coming spoken of in John 14 is also a sign. Most Christians think that the Lord’s coming here refers to His second advent. But by the word “coming” the Lord was referring to something that was to happen only a few days later. Nevertheless, most Christians think that the Lord’s coming mentioned here is future. Thus, in their expositions they make this coming an event at least two thousand years after His going. Their exposition can be compared to Martha’s expounding of the Lord’s word in chapter eleven. After Lazarus had died, the Lord told Martha that her brother would rise again. She responded by saying that she knew that he would rise up in the last day. However, the Lord was trying to tell her that Lazarus would be raised up that very day because the Lord Himself is resurrection. In her exposition of the Lord’s word, Martha postponed the raising up of her brother until the distant future. Expositors make a similar mistake in expounding the meaning of “coming” in chapter fourteen. The Lord meant by the word “coming” a coming that was soon, a coming that would take place after a few days. But a number of expositors understand the word “coming” to refer to the Lord’s coming back at the end of this age. This understanding has nothing practical for our daily Christian life.<p>In chapters fourteen, fifteen, and sixteen of the Gospel of John, the Lord repeatedly explained to the disciples the significance of His going and coming. However, the disciples were preoccupied with their natural and traditional concept. No matter how much the Lord explained to them concerning His going and coming, they could not understand what He was saying. The situation is similar among most of today’s Christians. Christians today are occupied with traditional teaching and their natural understanding. Because of this preoccupation, they do not have the proper understanding of the Lord’s going and coming in John 14. Thus, there is the need for us to see that both the Lord’s going and His coming are signs indicating something deep, divine, and mysterious.<h2 class=head1>THE SON’S GOING</h2><p>The Son’s going is a sign of His all-inclusive death. For the Lord to go was for Him to go through an all-inclusive death.<h2 class=head2>To Solve the Problem of Sin</h2><p>Through His all-inclusive death, the Lord solved the problem of sin (Rom. 8:3; John 1:29; Heb. 9:26, 28; 1 Cor. 15:3; 1 Pet. 2:24). John 1:29 says, “Behold, the Lamb of God who takes away the sin of the world!” The Lamb of God took away the sin of the world when He was crucified. This aspect of His crucifixion is included in the sign of His going in John 14. Have you ever realized that the Lord’s going was His crucifixion?<p>In John 3:14 the Lord Jesus said to Nicodemus, “And as Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness, even so must the Son of Man be lifted up.” As we have seen, this is related to Christ as the sin offering (Rom. 8:3; 2 Cor. 5:21). When the Lord was crucified, He was lifted up, as the brass serpent was lifted up by Moses.
