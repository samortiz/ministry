   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>FELLOWSHIP CONCERNING THE URGENT NEED OF THE VITAL GROUPS MESSAGE TWENTY-FOUR BECOMING VITAL AND</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>GOING TO VITALIZE OTHERS THE GOD-ORDAINED WAY</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>By 1984 the recovery had come to a point of being dormant.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>At that time I felt burdened to go to Taiwan to study our situation.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>I was endeavoring to bring us into the God-ordained, scriptural way to meet and to serve for the building up of the church as the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Through five years of study, from 1984 to 1989, the Lord clearly showed us the God-ordained way.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The term the God-ordained way was invented by us, and we saw that this God-ordained way revealed in the Scriptures is of four steps: begetting, feeding, perfecting, and building.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>We need to beget, to produce, new believers.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Then we need to feed them that they may grow.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Then we need to perfect them, not by one teacher but through the mutual teaching in the groups.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>In the groups everyone is a teacher, and every teacher is a student.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Through the mutual teaching in the groups the new ones are perfected unto the work of the ministry as pointed out in Ephesians 4:12.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>This makes them qualified to prophesy, to speak for the Lord, for the building up of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>To take the God-ordained way is by these four steps, but how do we carry them out?</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>We found out that the way to carry out these four steps is by the vital groups.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>In 1949 we started the work in Taipei with about three to five hundred saints.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Within less than five years, we grew to fifty thousand.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>During that period of time, I felt we needed the groups.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Just to have the halls for the district work was not adequate, so we set up groups.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>We decided to have about twenty saints to a group, but the groups grew to fifty, sixty, and seventy saints.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Some even grew to one hundred.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The group leaders were very active ones in the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>From 1958 to 1984, however, the church in Taipei had gradually dropped the practice of group meetings and unconsciously drifted back to focus on the Lord s Day message meeting with one person speaking and the rest listening.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>In every hall there was a speaker to take care of this message meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>We had drifted away from the practice of the group meetings to a kind of Sunday morning service with one speaker.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>We have to realize that a big and top advantage of the group meetings is that they should make everyone function.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Our vital groups have not yet reached that standard of making everyone function according to the God-ordained way with its four steps: to beget, to feed, to perfect by mutual teaching, and to prophesy for the building up of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>After we released the truth concerning the group meetings, the churches attempted to pick up this practice.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>But what they eventually had was not vital groups, but mostly dormant groups.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>I became very clear within that in order to come out of our dormant condition we must stress the practice of the vital group meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>A VITAL GROUP BEING LIVING</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>AND FULL OF ACTIVITIES</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Recently I felt burdened to use the term vital groups .</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>My understanding in using the word vital is that a vital group is living and full of activities.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>You may be a living person, but if you do not know how to take any action, you are not vital.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Children from the ages of five to seven are vital because they are not only living but full of activities.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Spiritually speaking, we may be living but we are not vital because we are not living and full of activities.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>To be vital is to be living and very active, full of activities.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The vital groups are groups which are living and full of activities.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>If the saints who have the burden to be in the vital groups do not move, do not act, in any kind of meeting, the church is finished.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>THE WAY TO BECOME VITAL</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>We have made it clear that the way to produce the vital groups is that each of us must take the lead to be vital.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>In order to be vital, we first must have a thorough fellowship with the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Then that fellowship will bring us into a kind of realization that we are totally sinful.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Then we will be brought into a thorough confession of our sins.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Spontaneously, we will re-consecrate ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>We will pray, Lord, now I would like to consecrate myself to You anew.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Then that will bring us into a prayer life.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>No one can pray unceasingly without reaching this stage.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>When we pass through the stages of fellowship, confession, and consecration, we enter into a prayer life.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>It is in this prayer life that we pray ourselves into the Spirit the essential Spirit, the economical Spirit, the all-inclusive Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Then we learn how to follow this Spirit by exercising our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>If this is the case with us, we are really vital.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Actually, this is all revealed, unveiled, in the New Testament, especially in Paul s Epistles.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>The overcomers are the vital members.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>If we read the seven epistles to the churches in Revelation 2 and 3, we can see that the overcomers are vital.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>The overcomers in God s economy will be the ones who give God the way to consummate this age, to bring Christ back, and to recover His title and right over the earth through Christ s reign.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Christ will reign and the overcomers will reign with Him as His co-kings.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>We must remember that to be vital is to overcome.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>When we are vital, we will have a burden to contact others.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>This will not be something done merely because the elders made a decision.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>The elders may make a decision to divide the saints in the church into groups and call these groups vital groups, but they may be dormant groups.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>If we merely arrange the saints into groups and call them vital groups, that is something formal.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>That is just a movement.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Eventually, these groups will be the same as the old groups.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>This is not the way to have the vital groups.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>We must abandon that way and take the vital way.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>We will not be vital if we do not pass through the stages of fellowship, the confession of our sins, re-consecration, a prayer life, and the filling of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Also, we need to have a thorough and intimate fellowship with one another.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>We may come together as groups, and yet not have this kind of fellowship.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Instead, we are all very reserved.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>We open up ourselves to a certain extent and no more.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>We like to cover and hide many things concerning our situation.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>As a result, there is no thorough fellowship.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>When there is no thorough fellowship, there is no thorough blending.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>Then we cannot see the proper mutual intercession, the proper mutual care, and the proper mutual shepherding.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>This shows that we are not that vital.</S>
