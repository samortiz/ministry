   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE EYE OF THE NEEDLE</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In Matthew 19 the Lord Jesus illustrated how difficult it is for us to enter into the kingdom v. 24 . He said that it was even more difficult than for a camel to go through the eye of a needle.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Humanly speaking, no one can enter into the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>As far as we are concerned, it is impossible.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>But what is impossible with men is possible with God.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>God has the way for us to enter into the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>His way is not to enlarge the eye of the needle and make it a wide gate so that even a heavily laden camel can get through.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Rather, His way is to reduce the size of the camel until it is thin enough to pass through the eye of the needle.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>It is possible for thin thread to pass through the eye of the needle.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>In order for us to pass through the eye of the needle, the Lord must make us as thin as thread.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>By nature, we are camels.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>But God has a way to spin us into thin thread.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Although I have been a Christian for more than fifty years, I am still in the eye of the needle.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Sometimes I have cried out, Lord, I cannot tolerate Your spinning any longer.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>But the Lord said, Be patient, for I am helping you.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>You are still too thick.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>I am spinning you to make you thinner.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>There were times when I wanted to be cut off from this spinning process.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>But at those times the Lord said to me, It is not up to you.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>You may want to be cut off, but what will you use to do the cutting?</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The scissors are not in your hands.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>I shall neither drop you nor cut you off.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Rather, I shall keep on spinning you.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>This is the exercise of the kingdom today.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>THE EXPERIENCE OF CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Many years ago we received help regarding this matter of the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Because we were helped by this, we ministered it to others.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>There were various reactions to what we ministered concerning the exercise and reward of the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Some said that it was Hinduism and others that it was similar to the Catholic teaching of purgatory.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>But this is not Hinduism, purgatory, or any form of asceticism.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>It is the experience of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>THE MIND OF CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Philippians 2:5 says, Let this mind be in you, which was also in Christ Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The mind of Christ needs to become our mind.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>After Paul tells us that we need to let the mind of Christ become ours, he speaks of how the Lord Jesus was willing to become small and lowly.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>This is what we mean by spinning.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The heavenly, divine spinning brought Christ down from the heavens to the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>It caused the great Christ to become less than the lowest and smallest.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Christ has been spun.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>He was willing to be spun in this way, for His mind was that kind of mind.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>We need to consider the context behind Paul s word to the Philippians regarding the mind of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>To a certain degree at least, the believers at Philippi were not in the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>In their thinking they were regarding themselves as better and higher than others.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>That was an indication that they did not have the mind of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Thus, the Apostle Paul told them that they needed to allow the mind of Christ to become their mind.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>He pointed out that although Christ was so high and great, He was willing to become lowly and even to be put to death on the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>When Christ was crucified, He was made nothing.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The enemy even challenged Him to come down from the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Those who mocked Him said that if He would come down from the cross, they would believe in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>What a devilish challenge that was!</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Instead of coming down from the cross, Christ remained there for at least six hours to be nothing.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>He did not say one word to vindicate Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>This is the mind of Christ, the only mind good for the building of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Only when we have such a mind are we qualified for the building.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>WILLING TO BECOME NOTHING</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>If we see this vision and compare it with the situation among the Christians today, we shall realize that the building up of the church is a human impossibility.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Perhaps you will say, Lord, when You were on earth, You said that You would build Your church.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>But nearly two thousand years have passed and still we do not see the building.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Lord, where is Your building?</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>If we speak to the Lord like this, He may reply, You do not see the building because so few have been willing to care for the exercise of the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>We all love the Lord and the church.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>But the question is whether or not we are willing to become nothing.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>As we all know, our spirit is the very depth of our being.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>To be poor in this part of our being means to realize that we are nothing.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Are you willing to be nothing?</S>
