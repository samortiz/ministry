   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Ministering the Building God and the Builded God</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Our work in the recovery today is to minister God to people.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Yes, we need to save sinners and to feed the saints and perfect them.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The crucial matter, however, is that we minister God to others.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The God whom we minister is not just the building God He is also the builded God.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>If we fail to minister God in this way, our work will be wood, grass, and stubble 1 Cor 3:12 .</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>I would ask you to reconsider the work you are doing for the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Perhaps you have opened up a region or have brought many people to God.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>But I ask you this question: How much of Christ as the embodiment of the Triune God has been wrought into those whom you have brought to God?</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>If we are sincere and genuine, we will humble ourselves and confess that not very much of the Triune God has been wrought into the ones we have brought to God.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Therefore, we need to practice one thing to minister the processed Triune God into others so that He may build Himself into their inner man.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>In every aspect of our work preaching the gospel, feeding the believers, perfecting the saints the intrinsic element must be that we minister the building and builded God to others.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>I would urge you to pray that the Lord would teach you to work in this way.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The Processed Triune God</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Building Himself into His Redeemed People</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The processed Triune God is embodied in Christ and realized as the consummated Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>This is the God whom we worship, preach, and minister to others.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Today He is building Himself into His redeemed people in order to produce a house with Himself as the element and also with something from their redeemed and uplifted humanity.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>This house is the church, the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>This house is the enlargement, the expansion, of Christ, the embodiment of the Triune God realized as the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>As we carry out the God-ordained way in the four steps of begetting, nourishing, perfecting, and building, our work must be based upon the processed Triune God, who is building Himself into His chosen people.</S>
