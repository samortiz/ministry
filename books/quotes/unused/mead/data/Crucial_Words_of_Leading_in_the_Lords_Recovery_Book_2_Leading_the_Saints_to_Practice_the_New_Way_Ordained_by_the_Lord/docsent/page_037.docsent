   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CONCERNING THE EXERCISE OF SPEAKING</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>IN THE MEETINGS</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Concerning speaking, every elder must speak in the meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>No one can escape this.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>At the very least, the elders need to give announcements in the meetings; thus, it is necessary for them to learn to speak in the meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>This kind of speaking is different from speaking at home or conversing with people.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>When we speak in the meetings, we need to raise our voice and speak loudly so that others can hear us.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Sometimes in the meetings people speak in a low and soft voice.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>This causes people to suffer; this kind of voice is a burden to the ears.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Not only should we prophesy loudly in the big meetings, but we should also lift up our voice and speak loudly even in a small gathering of eight to ten people.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>This means that our throat must be clear and our voice strong.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>We should not speak softly; rather, we should lift up our voice and speak with certainty and assurance.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Another point concerning speaking is that our spirit must be released.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Generally speaking, when people are angry, they cannot release their anger unless they shout.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The louder they shout, the more they let their anger out.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>When we release our spirit, we also need to lift up our voice and speak loudly.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Just as people need to release their anger by raising their voice when they are angry, we also need to raise our voice when we exercise our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>In this way, people can hear us.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>This is what we must learn and practice.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Seminary students are required to take a class concerning methods of preaching, which teaches them how to preach.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>This class teaches them to pay attention to their voice and tone while preaching.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>When I was younger, I realized the importance of these points, so I purposely used to go to the seashore where there was no one else.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>There I would practice speaking, especially paying attention to my voice and tone.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>At times, I also stood in front of a mirror and paid attention to my gestures while speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>All these exercises related to speaking are helpful.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Since the elders are in the position of elders, they should carry out the duties relevant to their position.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>In other words, since they are elders, they must speak, and they must speak in a way that people can understand.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Now that we know the importance and necessity of speaking, we should all the more encourage the saints to learn and to exercise.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>This will be a great help to our meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The result of our exercise over the span of a few months and years will have a great impact on the building up of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Moreover, there is one point that we need to pay attention to; that is, while we usually compose with a pen, we must now compose with our mouth.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Thus, we must begin to exercise and learn to speak well.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Whether a written composition or a speech is considered good or bad depends very much upon how it begins.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Like a basketball or soccer game, if there is a bad start, it is difficult to continue in a good way.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Hence, the beginning is extremely important.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>If there is a good beginning, whatever follows will be easy.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>This is a principle.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Therefore, when we are going to give a message or prophecy, we need to carefully consider the beginning word or sentence; we should never consider this casually.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Some people speak casually, so their words have no impact.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The renowned preacher C. H. Spurgeon once spoke of a person whose heart had grown feet.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>This utterance captured everyone s attention, causing them to desire to know how a person s heart could grow feet and what Spurgeon was actually referring to.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Spurgeon spoke this in reference to not loving the world.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>A heart that has feet is able to run after many things.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Hence, a person whose heart has feet is one whose heart has been attracted to the things of the world and who has begun to love and pursue after these worldly things.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>This kind of eloquence in speaking leaves people with a deep impression that is difficult for them to forget.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Many of Spurgeon s sermons are full of good utterances.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>When speaking of forgiving others, he used an illustration of people burying a dead dog but leaving the tail above the ground.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Although the dog is gone, there is still a reminder.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>This often is our experience.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>We may tell people that a certain brother once seriously offended us but that we have forgiven him.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>This is to bury a dead dog but not bury its tail.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Although we may have forgiven the brother, we still frequently mention the matter to others.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>This is not genuine forgiveness.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Although Spurgeon s example was small, it left people with a lasting impression.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>In this regard, we not only need to learn to speak in the meetings, but we also need to consider and exercise in every aspect of our speaking so that our words may be effective.</S>
