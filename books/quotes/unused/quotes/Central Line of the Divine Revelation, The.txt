Father, in Greek Pater, denotes that God as the Father is the origin, the source, of all the families of God's creatures
In God's creation there are many families, such as the family of the angels, the family of mankind, and the family of the animals
We are the genuine family because we were not only created by God as the Creator the origin the source but also regenerated begotten by God
In the new creation, however, we have a Father in life who regenerated us, who imparted His very life essence into us

The source, the course, and the flow are according to the notion of our Triune God as the living water, which eventually becomes a river
At the end of the Bible, in the very last chapter, our Triune God is shown as a flowing river, the river of water of life
Such a river is a picture of our Triune God with the Father as the source, the Son as the course, and the Spirit as the flow

The sixty-six books of the Bible reveal that the highest point of the divine revelation of the person of God is Christ
If we were to ask a number of students and teachers of the Bible what the central line in the Bible is, they would have different opinions
What one sees in the Bible can be according to his preference and based upon his culture and his natural disposition
In this series of messages, we want to present the truth concerning the central line of the divine revelation in a new way
A number of crucial terms are used by Paul in these verses God's will, God's purpose, God's good pleasure, God's counsel, and God's economy
Based upon that counsel God made a plan with an arrangement and this plan with this arrangement is His household administration His economy
He asked Timothy to remain at Ephesus to charge certain ones not to teach differently but to take care of God's economy in faith
Anything other than God's economy is based upon human works, but the economy of God is based altogether upon our faith in Christ

Today the entire universe is a mess, but when the new heaven and new earth come, everything will be headed up in Christ under His headship
In the church, Christ is heading us up so that eventually all things can be headed up in Christ in the new heaven and new earth
The economy of God is with God Himself, but the stewardship of the apostle was not merely given to Paul as one person
Today an electrician knows more than Thomas Edison because he has inherited all the knowledge since Edison's time
Because we are later than Paul, we have inherited everything he and others have passed on to us since his time
In eternity past God was exercising His will for His purpose in which is His good pleasure and for which He had to make a counsel
The intention of God's economy is to dispense God Himself into His chosen people, making Himself one with them
The intention of God's economy is to dispense the element of Christ into us for our organic constitution and growth
In the previous message, we also pointed out the relationship between God's economy and the apostle's stewardship

The word for spirit here in Proverbs 20:27 is not the Hebrew word ruach, but neshamah the same word used in Genesis 2:7 for breath
Neshamah, the breath of life, is the source of the spirit and the element with which the human spirit was formed
The body was formed with the element of dust, and the spirit was formed with the element of the breath of life out of God

Although we have the imitation of God's attributes, we may not have the likeness of these attributes in our behavior
Before we were saved, our inward person was our soul with the body as its outward organ and the spirit as its inward organ
Through regeneration, our spirit, which was an organ to our soul, became the person, with the soul and body as its organs

These two chapters do not speak mainly of the creation; rather, they unveil to us the divine dispensing according to the divine economy
Although we cannot find the expressions the divine dispensing and the divine economy in these chapters, the fact is there
The intention of Genesis 1 and 2 is to show us how God made a preparation for His upcoming dispensing according to His divine economy
Genesis 1 and 2 are a record of how God created man with the intention that He would be man's life and content
One tree, the tree of life, was good for food , but the other tree, the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, issued in death
The tree bears fruit every month for the supply of all the inhabitants in the New Jerusalem, and the river flows to quench their thirst
The mentioning of these precious materials, the river, and the tree of life corresponds to the record in Genesis 2
The New Jerusalem is the composition of these three materials to be the bride , the real Eve, to match the real man, the Triune God
At that time, God will have a counterpart with which to spend His eternity for His rest, joy, and satisfaction

Seven lamps are on one lampstand to express the light, and the lamps contain the light that the lampstand gives
In creating man God used clay to form mans body as his outward physical organ with the physical consciousness to contact the physical world
The spirit as man's inward, spiritual organ is higher than the body as man's physical organ, since the spirit is composed of God's breath
The breath of life out of God's mouth became the spirit of man, which is the lamp of God to shine within us for God
As men, we have two organs, the physical organ and the spiritual organ, and we ourselves are living souls, living persons
God's desire was not merely to have a man as a living soul with a body of clay and a human spirit formed of God's breath
God's putting man in front of the two trees was a strong indication that God wanted man to take Him in by eating Him
After being regenerated, we, the God-created men, need to be transformed, renewed, and conformed to the image of God's embodiment
God's inheritance is the New Jerusalem, and eventually, we as the precious stones will be built together to become His inheritance
Eventually, in the New Jerusalem we will recall with the brothers and sisters how God put us together in many situations
The Triune God, after being processed, has blended Himself with the tripartite, transformed men, causing them to all become one
The New Jerusalem is the tabernacle of God , God's abode, and God and the Lamb are the temple for us to dwell and serve in
God's breathing His breath into man was a dispensing, and our taking in God as the tree of life is also a dispensing
We do not have any other burden besides this ministry of God's economy with His divine dispensing into humanity

In Genesis God promised that the seed of the woman would come, but in Isaiah 7:14 He said that a virgin would conceive and bring forth a son
Mary, a female descendant of King David, became the mother of the promised Christ and the mother of the seed of the woman
Christ as the seed of the woman implies that the complete God became a perfect man through the dispensing of Himself into humanity

He does not say, 'And to the seeds,' as concerning many, but as concerning one: 'And to your seed,' who is Christ'
Abraham might have only understood that God would give him a good piece of land, a land flowing with milk and honey
The Spirit as the consummation of the Triune God for the dispensing of Himself into the believers of Christ is the seed of Abraham
On the one hand, the life-giving Spirit is a transfigured descendant of Abraham, and on the other hand, He is the very Triune God
If we did not have the life-giving Spirit in our spirit, we would sink in the 'water' because we are not buoyant
The life-giving Spirit as the seed of Abraham and as the consummation of the processed Triune God is the top blessing
Our spiritual blessing for eternity is to inherit the consummated Spirit, the consummation of the processed Triune God, as our inheritance
According to Paul's understanding in Acts 13:34 and 35 , the sure mercies shown to David are Christ Himself in resurrection
Christ as God's sure mercies shown to David is for the dispensing of God Himself into all the believers of Christ in His resurrection
The entire revelation of the Scriptures is wrapped up with the seed of the woman, the seed of Abraham, and the seed of David
Christ's being the seed of the woman, the seed of Abraham, and the seed of David strongly implies the dispensing of God Himself into man

As the last Adam, Christ died and resurrected, and through death and resurrection He became the life-giving Spirit
The consummated and indwelling Spirit is the Spirit who has gone through a process to become qualified and able to indwell us

The compound ointment in Exodus 30:23-25 is a clear type of the unique and all-inclusive Spirit, who is the Spirit
If we read Acts 13:33 and receive light from the Lord, we can see clearly that resurrection was a birth to Christ
He also became the Prince, that is, the King, in His humanity that we may share His kingship for God's administration
We must be filled with the Spirit within and without, and we must live and walk according to the Spirit in our spirit
To be filled inwardly is to have the infilling of the Spirit, and to be filled outwardly is to experience the outpouring of the Spirit
We must overcome individualism, sectarianism, and Christianity, and we must live the life of the Body of Christ
We must receive God's constant and instant dispensing continuously through unceasing prayer, not quenching the Spirit

The processed Triune God will marry the redeemed and glorified tripartite man, and together they will become a universal couple
There is a clear word in the Bible that says that the very Christ who is our Redeemer and Savior is now the Spirit
The use of this title in John 20:22 makes the breathing in that verse different from the breathing in Genesis 2:7
The Father is the source, the Son is the course, and the Spirit is the flow and also the reaching of the Triune God
The Spirit is the ultimate expression of the Triune God; thus, when we receive the Holy Spirit, we receive the totality of the Triune God
When God breathed His breath into Adam to animate the man of clay with a human spirit, He consummated the old creation
In His resurrection Christ's humanity was 'sonized,' and in His 'sonized' humanity He was born to be the firstborn Son of God
It was in such a condition that Christ came to the disciples and breathed Himself into them to compound mingle and blend Himself with them
When Peter, John, James, and the other disciples were meeting in that small room, they represented the entire Body of Christ
After this breathing and receiving took place, the compounding, blending, and mingling of God with man was consummated
Based on this breathing, the Spirit whom He became came to be the realization of Him as the embodiment of the Father within the believers
The transmission of the Triune God into the Son's believers makes them one with the Triune God for the glorification of God the Son

How could His putting on human nature, which took place after Adam was created, cause Him to be the Firstborn, the first creature?
If we put a dot on some point on the circle, it would be difficult to say what is before that point and what is after it
The transforming Spirit will conform us to the image of the firstborn Son of God that we may fully be what He is
The only difference will be that today we are clothed with clay, but in that day we will be pieces of clay clothed with glory
He is not in us in a dormant way, but He is saturating and permeating us to bring us through the process of conformation

Prayer: Lord, we look to You for Your teaching, Your instruction, Your guidance, even Your interpretation of Your Word
According to Paul's interpretation, the promise God gave to Abraham was the blessing of this life-giving Spirit
She was the one who spoke to the serpent, and as a result the serpent damaged her and also her husband through her
In that promise in that first preaching of the gospel the complete God made a promise to the couple especially to Eve by cursing the serpent
When God was cursing the damaging serpent, He promised the damaged persons that the seed of the woman would bruise the serpent's head
God called Abraham out of the fallen race and promised him that he would be a blessing to all the nations on the earth
Eventually God gave more details saying that not through Abraham directly but through his seed all the nations of the earth would be blessed
Approximately one thousand years later God promised David that He would establish the throne of his seed forever
The Triune God, the complete God, created man and then purposed to be born of fallen man to become a threefold seed
By this we can see that the Trinity is not a doctrinal matter but a matter of dispensing and enjoyment to the fallen race
We need to realize that today our God is absolutely different from the God of the Jews and from the God of the Moslems
The Nicene Creed does not mention this, nor does it mention the sevenfold Spirit in Revelation 1:4, 4:5, and 5:6
Paul said that he formerly was zealous for his fathers' religion and that he had advanced in that religion beyond many of his contemporaries
On a certain day he was traveling from Jerusalem to Damascus to bind the followers of Jesus and bring them to the high priest for sentencing
He received a revelation of Christ, and he also received a burden to preach, to minister, and to present this One to others
The word faith denotes first the things we believe in; then, based on what we believe in, we have the action of believing
When we preach the gospel, we preach this belief, that is, the person of Christ and the redemptive work of Christ
Romans 10 says that faith comes out of hearing, and hearing comes out of preaching , and preaching comes out of being sent
As you teach English to the people, you can teach them the truth, the faith, the belief, and the holy word that you have heard
To be regenerated by the Spirit is instantaneous, but to be regenerated according to the Spirit implies a process
We were born according to the life-giving Spirit, and immediately after our birth, God gave us the life-giving Spirit
We were born according to the consummated Triune God, and after our birth we received the gift of the consummated Triune God
Matthew 2819 says Go therefore and disciple all the nations baptizing them into the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit
We should tell them, 'From today onward you are no longer naked; you are clothed and covered with the processed, consummated Triune God'
Romans 6:3 says, 'Or are you ignorant that all of us who have been baptized into Christ Jesus have been baptized into His death'?
It then goes on to say that the life that we now live, we still live in the flesh, yet we live this life by Christ as our faith
People may say, 'Since you are still eating, sleeping, studying, working, and doing things, you are still living'
You will spontaneously have more experience of Him and you will have something as a testimony or a teaching of the truth to render to others
We also need to realize that God's ordained way is not to use a big speaker but to raise up all His chosen people to prophesy for Him
If the Lord were not a Spirit or if we did not have a human spirit, it would be impossible for the Lord and us to have a union
Corinthians 1545b says The last Adam became a lifegiving Spirit and 1 Corinthians 617 says But he who is joined to the Lord is one spirit
Certain verses in the New Testament, such as John 3:16, speak of our believing not merely in Christ but into Christ
To realize that we have been baptized into Christ and have put on Christ requires the exercise of our believing ability
If a person exercises his inner being to call on Jesus regardless of his race color or culture Jesus comes as the Spirit and enters into him
Matthew 2819 says Go therefore and disciple all the nations baptizing them into the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit
We must believe what we preach, and we must believe that when we baptize people, we put them into the Triune God
When we live in this way, we enjoy Christ and appreciate Christ, and Christ within us becomes our present faith
We are still living, yet we live this life not by anything of ourselves but by Him as everything, even as our faith
It is often difficult in Paul's writings for translators to determine whether spirit should be capitalized or not
The way to receive, experience, and enjoy Christ as the Spirit is also by having Christ formed in us through travail
In Galatians 1:16 Christ is revealed in us; in 2:20 Christ lives in us; and in 3:27 Christ is upon us, clothing us like a garment
The last two lines in the Chinese say that all that we are has been terminated, and Christ's all in all has become our element
Romans 12:2a says, 'And do not be fashioned according to this age, but be transformed by the renewing of the mind'
To be renewed in our mind is to remove our self and the world from our mind, emotion, and will and replace them with Christ
If we are full of the self and love the world in our inner being, our outward form will simply be the self and the world
Paul had to suffer like a mother, travailing for the Galatians until Christ replaced the self and the world in them with Himself
If we sow something high and good, we will reap the same, and if we sow something mean and low, we can expect to reap the same thing
To sow to the Spirit in this way is to receive, experience, and enjoy the Spirit as the all-embracing blessing of the gospel
If we live a life without the Spirit and sow according to the flesh, we cannot expect to enjoy Christ as the all-embracing blessing
Several years ago the major denominations in America came together to consider a joint work to evangelize the world
The consummate way to receive, experience, and enjoy Christ as the Spirit is by the grace of the Lord Jesus Christ with our spirit
The Gospel of John may be very familiar to us, but we should not consider that it is a shallow or superficial book
Because many things in the Gospel of John are quite deep, few have spent the time to dig out the things in this Gospel
John 1:12-13 says that those who receive the Son of God through their believing into Him are born of God to be children of God
His need was to receive Christ as the Son of God through believing into Him so that he could be born of God to be a child of God
To receive, experience, and enjoy the all-inclusive Christ, we must take Him as the Lamb of God who takes away the sin of the world
Jesus was called the Lamb of God because in the eyes of God He was the sacrifice, the offering, for the sin of the world
The people who constitute the world are sinful, and the world as the composition of these people also is sinful
All the people who dealt with Him at the time of His crucifixion led Him like a lamb to the cross, the place of slaughter
We also receive, experience, and enjoy the all-inclusive Christ by receiving the Spirit from Him not by measure
If the Spirit whom we receive from Christ were measurable or limited, He would not be adequate for us to enjoy
According to the clear revelation of the New Testament, eternal life is God embodied in Christ and dispensed into us by the Spirit
Eating and drinking Christ is the way to worship Him, and it is also the way to receive, experience, and enjoy Him
We were saved first by hearing the word of Christ concerning the Father, and then by believing in the Father, who sent Christ
The worldly people do not have the capacity to live in their spirit, because they do not have eternal life in their spirit
After we believed into Christ, the Triune God entered into us as the eternal life, giving us the capacity to live in our spirit
Another way to receive, experience, and enjoy Christ is to eat the word spoken by Christ as spirit and as life
The Speaker of the word is the processed Triune God, and His speaking transmits the processed Triune God into us in the form of the word
If we would receive, experience, and enjoy Christ, we must leave all the religious sheepfolds and follow Him according to His voice
In John 11:25 the Lord Jesus told Martha, 'I am the resurrection and the life; he who believes into Me, even if he should die, shall live'
Praying such a prayer will save you out of your flesh and transfer you into another realm, the realm of eternal life
The thirteen items mentioned in this message are the subjective ways to receive, experience, and enjoy the all-inclusive Christ
The beginning of the Gospel of John says, 'In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God'
Christ is God ; He is man ; He is the Son , the Spirit , and also the Father ; and He is the body of all the shadows
Whatever we enjoy daily, weekly, monthly, and yearly is a shadow, but Christ is the body, the reality, of all the shadows
Americans are the totality and expression of the riches of America that they have eaten and digested including American beef pork and fish
John 114 says that Christ came as the incarnated One full of grace and reality and verse 16 says that we have all received of His fullness
Matthew presents Christ as the King; Mark presents Christ as a Servant; Luke presents Christ as a man; and John presents Christ as God
The love of God, the grace of Christ, and the fellowship of the Holy Spirit are for God's dispensing, for His giving of Himself to us
In Galatians 3:2 Paul said, 'Did you receive the Spirit out of the works of law or out of the hearing of faith'?
John 2:23 says, 'Everyone who denies the Son does not have the Father either; he who confesses the Son has the Father also'
Out of the throne of God and the Lamb flows the river of the water of life, and in this river the tree of life grows as a spreading vine
The One who gives Himself to us is the breath, the food, and the water, and we receive Him by breathing, eating, and drinking
The more we hate our soulish life, the natural life, the more we will keep it, resulting in more enjoyment of the eternal life
We have this eternal life, but we often do not have the enjoyment of it because we do not hate our soulish life
If we hate our self, we will keep our soul-life to enjoy and experience the divine life, which is in us from now unto eternity
In the Old Testament there were ten commandments, but in the Gospel of John the Lord gave only one: love one another
We receive, experience, and enjoy Christ also by taking Him as the way, the reality, and the life to come to the Father
Since the way is Christ, a living person, so the place to which the Lord brings us must also be a person, God the Father Himself
The Father is in the Son and the Son is in the Father , and the Spirit comes as the Spirit of reality to be the reality of the Son
Love is from the Father as the source; the manifestation is through the Son; and the making of the abode is by both the Father and the Son
We must go forth from one door to another door, even from one city to another city and from one country to another country
To see one of our fruit remain in the church and begin to serve in the same way that we do causes us to be joyful
On the one hand, the Spirit is the Comforter; on the other hand, He is the Convicter, the One who rebukes and reproaches
He will tell others that as long as they do a certain improper thing, they will suffer and not have any comfort
In John 16:13-15a the Lord Jesus said, 'But when He, the Spirit of reality, comes, He will guide you into all the reality
We enjoy this blessing by being one with the Triune God and allowing the transmission from the Triune God to reach us
The Lord is breathing Himself out, and we are receiving not simply His breath but His breathing, which includes His person
Feeding the lambs, the young ones, takes place in the home meetings, and shepherding the sheep takes place in the group meetings
Feeding Christ's lambs and shepherding His sheep are for His flock, the church, which is His heart's desire and God's good pleasure
In this message we will begin to see the way to receive, experience, and enjoy Christ in the rest of the books of the New Testament
On the one hand, the Spirit is the blessing, and on the other hand, the Spirit is the way for us to participate in the blessing
Both the blessing and the way are the all-inclusive Spirit, and this Spirit is the consummation of the processed Triune God
To walk according to the spirit is to have one's being not merely by or through the spirit, but according to the spirit
The flesh that Christ, as the Word of God, became is the flesh of sin, but this does not mean that Christ had any sin within His flesh
By walking according to the spirit, we enjoy Christ as the all-inclusive life-giving Spirit, who is the blessing of the gospel
We should not do anything that is not according to the spirit, and we should not think anything without our mind being set on the spirit
Whenever we begin to think about something, we as seeking Christians should always check whether or not our mind is set on the spirit
The spirit mentioned in Romans 8:4-6 refers to the regenerated spirit, which is indwelt by and mingled with the Holy Spirit
He then said that the spirit in verses such as Romans 8:4-6 refers to both the human spirit and the divine Spirit
The renewing of our mind is for the transformation of our soul that we may know the will of God concerning the Body life
The will of God in Romans 12:2 is not His will related to our daily affairs, but His will concerning the Body life, the church life
Five years later, after his return from Europe, Brother Nee called a conference and began to give messages on knowing the Body of Christ
In the same way, the phrase who is theirs and ours indicates that Christ is the portion possessed by all the saints
Corinthians 1:9 says, 'God is faithful, through whom you were called into the fellowship of His Son, Jesus Christ our Lord'
The electricity that flows from the power plant to a building illustrates how power and wisdom are transmitted to us from God
We enjoy Christ also by partaking of Christ as the Lamb of the Passover and the unleavened bread that we may become a new lump
In order to walk out of Egypt they needed strength, and their eating of the lamb supplied them with the needed strength
According to their constitution, the children of Israel were completely leavened; that is, they were constituted sinners
After their eating of the Passover lamb with the unleavened bread, they were cleansed and began to have an unleavened constitution
Christ as the unleavened bread became our unleavened food to reconstitute us, so that we may become a new lump
The spiritual food is typified by the manna , and the spiritual drink is typified by the water that flowed out of the cleft rock
Now that we have been baptized into the Body through the one Spirit, we should continually drink the same Spirit
The Spirit in whom we have been baptized and whom we are now drinking has two aspects, the outward and the inward
The Spirit in the outward aspect is the economical Spirit, and the Spirit in the inward aspect is the essential Spirit
We enjoy the aggregate of the all-embracing blessing of the full gospel of God also by partaking of Christ as the life-giving Spirit
The Spirit is on us as the anointing Spirit; He is within us as the sealing Spirit; and He is with us as the pledging Spirit
Both the believers and the ministers should be written on by Christ with the life-giving Spirit as the writing ink
The more Christ writes upon us with the inking Spirit, the more we enjoy the aggregate of the all-embracing blessing of the gospel
Transformation requires the addition of another element; without such an addition, transformation cannot take place
Through the transmission from the Lord Spirit, within whom is the element of the Lord, we are transformed from glory to glory
We are all busy in the morning, but we must do our best to save ten or fifteen minutes each day to behold the Lord
If we normally rise at six o'clock in the morning, we can gain fifteen minutes by rising fifteen minutes earlier
If we take another ten minutes from the time given to our business we can have a total of twentyfive minutes for beholding the Lord each day
By beholding Him we will receive an element from the Lord that will transform us into the glorious image of Christ, even from glory to glory
Corinthians 13:14 says, 'The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ and the love of God and the fellowship of the Holy Spirit be with you all'
Today as we are in the fellowship of the Spirit, we participate in the grace of Christ and enjoy the love of God
The same word in verse 2 is translated stewardship, referring to the stewardship of the apostles as the ministers
In Hebrews, Paul spoke of the word of righteousness, which is the solid food, and the good word of God, which is the milk
As the ministers who speak the Word of God, we all need to learn how to make our stewardship a dispensing ministry
We receive, experience, and enjoy Christ also by holding the Head that we may grow into Him in everything for the building up of His Body
In the past several years the winds came a number of times and some of the weaker ones have been blown away that is they have left the Head
To hold the Head is to hold on to Christ as our centrality universality and everything and not listen to the heretical distracting teachings
The way to receive, experience, and enjoy Christ is also by being renewed in the spirit of the mind for the putting on of the new man
We are in the process of putting off the old man as our old 'garment' and putting on the new man, the church life
To be nourished and cherished as a member of the Body of Christ by Christ as the Head is also a way to receive, experience, and enjoy Christ
The way to receive, experience, and enjoy Christ is also by being empowered in the Lord to put on the whole armor of God
The Greek word for bountiful supply refers to the supplying of all the needs of the chorus by the choragus, the leader of the chorus
To pursue Christ that we may gain Him as the excellent Christ is another way to receive, experience, and enjoy Christ
The four biographies of Christ present Him in four different ways, as the King , the Slave , the man , and God
On the one hand, we need to learn how to be submissive, suffering whatever happens to us and worshipping the sovereign Lord
The way to receive, experience, and enjoy Christ is also by being empowered in Christ that we may be able to do all things
Paul could carry out the high virtues in human life not merely by the One who empowered him but in the One who empowered him
To partake of Christ as the God-allotted portion of the saints is a rich way to receive, experience, and enjoy Christ
He is also the Head of the Body, the beginning, Firstborn from the dead, and the One in whom all the fullness was pleased to dwell
To partake of Christ as the body of the shadows of all our necessities is also a way to receive, experience, and enjoy Christ
Our necessities include eating, drinking, a weekly rest, a monthly new beginning with light in the darkness, and yearly feasts
To call on the Lord out of a pure heart for the pursuing of His virtues is also a way to receive, experience, and enjoy Christ
Another way to receive, experience, and enjoy Christ is by the renewing of the Spirit, whom God pours out upon us richly
It is true that Christ's redemption is complete, but Hebrews tells us that God chastises those whom He receives
There is no word in the New Testament that says that God chastises His people only in this age and not in the next
In nearly every book of the New Testament we are warned concerning the possibility of being chastened by God in the coming age
Another way to receive experience and enjoy Christ is by taking the milk of the word as newborn babes for the growth in life unto salvation
Another wonderful way to receive, experience, and enjoy Christ is by abiding in the Lord according to the teaching of the divine anointing
At the end of the Bible there is a river flowing out of the Triune God, and in this river the tree of life grows
The river signifies the Spirit of God, and the tree of life signifies Christ growing along the flow of the Spirit
The river is to satisfy us and quench our thirst, and the tree of life is to fill us and strengthen us constantly
For eternity we will be drinking of the living water and eating of the tree of life for our eternal enjoyment of Christ
Many generations passed, including Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, but no one experienced God's complete salvation until the Passover
The Passover includes not only the blood of the lamb; it also includes the flesh of the lamb, the unleavened bread, and the bitter herbs
The flesh of the lamb, the unleavened bread, and the bitter herbs were taken inwardly because they were eaten by the children of Israel
God's judgment included not only the Egyptians but also the Israelites, who were just as sinful as the Egyptians
God's redemption took care of their problem directly with God, the problem of God's condemnation because of their sins
These miraculous acts, such as the opening of the Red Sea, were related to the arm of Jehovah in the Old Testament
The arm of Jehovah, referring to the power, the miraculous strength, of Jehovah, acted to save the children of Israel
The children of Israel also enjoyed the pillar of cloud in the daytime and the pillar of fire in the nighttime
The rock was struck by the lawgiver, Moses, and out of the cleft rock living water flowed to quench their thirst
After the people ate the flesh of the lamb, the lamb was dispensed into them, and by this dispensing they were strengthened
In God's full salvation today, we enjoy God's dispensing by Christ being our Lamb, our unleavened bread, our manna, and our spiritual water
The flesh of the lamb was eaten by God's redeemed people to satisfy them and to strengthen them to run God's way
In the redeeming aspect, He becomes our food to satisfy us and to strengthen us to run the course God has set before us
In the unleavened aspect, He is the unleavened bread to supply us with the unleavened element so that we can live an unleavened life
The reason for the change of diet was to replace God's redeemed people's earthly constitution with the heavenly one
In this series of messages we are emphasizing the all-inclusive Christ whom we are eating, rather than the way to eat Him
In John 14 one of the Lords disciples asked Him to show him the way and in verse 6 the Lord said I am the way and the reality and the life
The types in the Old Testament show us how to enjoy God as our life supply that He may dispense Himself into us
When we put both together in our understanding, we enjoy God, and He has more opportunities to dispense Himself into us
At Mount Sinai, however, God trained the children of Israel concerning how to eat Him through the offerings in a regulated way
The divine economy and the divine dispensing are shown in the types in the enjoyment of the continual offerings
The enjoyment of the continual offerings typifies our enjoyment of God as our life supply to dispense Himself into us in a continual way
The meal offering to be eaten by the priests signifies Christ in His humanity to be dispensed into us for us to live a priestly life
These cakes entered into the priests by the priests' eating, and the element of these cakes was dispensed into the priests
Since the meal offering was a type of Jesus, the eating of the meal offering by the priests indicates that we must eat Jesus
In our ministering of Him to others as the sin and trespass offering, we enjoy Him as these offerings for ourselves
The offering whose blood was sprinkled at the altar could be enjoyed not by the sinner but by the offering priests
We must first enjoy Christ as the sin and trespass offering in our spirit and be filled with Him as the Spirit
We can help others by ministering Christ as such an offering to them, that is, by offering Christ as the sin and trespass offering for them
To help others to overcome sin and sins is not as high as bringing others into fellowship with God and with His saints
The breast and the right thigh were particular parts of the peace offering that only the offering priests could eat
We do not have the right to eat the breast, signifying the Christ of love, and the right thigh, signifying the Christ of strength
They do not offer the sin and trespass offering for others, or even if they do, they may not offer the peace offering for others
In this way we have more and more enjoyment of God, and God has more and more opportunities to dispense Himself into us
We contact such a one with a burden and with Christ in our spirit to bring him Christ as his sin offering and trespass offering
If we enjoy Christ as the sin offering, we will have a strong word to speak about Christ being the offering for our sin
The Feast of Unleavened Bread signifies the sinless living of the New Testament believers for the whole course of their Christian life
Before the resurrection the life-giving Spirit was not yet ; Christ produced the life-giving Spirit through His resurrection
These many sons became the many grains , who are the members of Christ, the brothers of Christ to constitute His Body
The Feast of the Blowing of Trumpets, however, signifies God's calling together of Israel, His scattered, dispersed elect
The firstfruits of the Feast of the Firstfruits, after being offered to God for His enjoyment, were to be eaten by the people of Israel
According to the record of Leviticus 23, the offering of only one of the seven feasts, the Feast of the Firstfruits, was to be eaten
The blood of the Passover lamb signifies the crucified Christ, but the meat of the lamb signifies the resurrected Christ
The unleavened bread of the Passover was made of grain that had been ground and blended to be one loaf, signifying death and resurrection
According to the type of the feasts, what we enjoy and what is being dispensed into us is the resurrected Christ
It is such a One who is good for us to eat and who, in His resurrection and consummation, dispenses Himself into us
In this message we will consider the divine economy and the divine dispensing in the initiation of the New Testament
In the New Testament the first two things that carry out God's dispensing are the incarnation and resurrection of Christ
Our God went through a process; the beginning of this process was incarnation, and the end of this process was resurrection
Between the incarnation and resurrection are the steps of Christ's human living and Christ's all-inclusive death
The crucial point concerning the Lord's birth is the matter of dispensing, but this thought is missed by most Christians today
Most Christians are veiled from seeing this matter because of all the outward things in the celebration of Christmas
The Lord's incarnation and resurrection are the two basic steps of God's dispensing of Himself into His chosen people
In the first four thousand years of man's six-thousand-year history, strictly speaking, there was no dispensing
It is very difficult to find a verse in the Old Testament that says that Jehovah God was in man or entered into man
In Luke 24 after the Lords resurrection the Lord took a journey with two of His disciples as they were going away from Jerusalem to Emmaus
The two disciples talked about the Lord and even rebuked the Lord , but the Lord pretended not to know anything
The first step in the accomplishment of God's full redemption and salvation in Christ was the incarnation of Christ
The incarnation of Christ was through the conception by the Holy Spirit in a human virgin, dispensing the holy nature of God into humanity
At the time of His birth He was called Christ ; but thirty-three and a half years later, when He ascended to the heavens, He was made Christ
Through resurrection Christ was consummated to be the perfect, complete Christ, the One who is the mingling of divinity with humanity
By Thy death and resurrection, Thou wast made God's firstborn Son; By Thy life to us imparting, Was Thy duplication done
We're Thy total reproduction, Thy dear Body and Thy Bride, Thine expression and Thy fulness, For Thee ever to abide
We are Thy continuation, Thy life-increase and Thy spread, Thy full growth and Thy rich surplus, One with Thee, our glorious Head
Regeneration, renewing, sanctification, transformation, conformation, and glorification are all the issue of the divine dispensing
Revelation 12:1-5 reveals that a woman, who signifies the totality of God's people on earth, brings forth a man-child
, full of grace and reality,' and verse 17 says, 'For the law was given through Moses; grace and reality came through Jesus Christ'
In our spirit we enjoy the dispensing, and from the dispensing we receive the fullness, all the riches of what the Triune God is
In incarnation the divine dispensing was mainly for Christ, the Head, but in resurrection the divine dispensing is mainly for us, the Body
The dispensing in incarnation for the Head has been completed, but the dispensing in resurrection for the Body is still going on today
By His growing up, a kind of dispensing took place in which the many grains were produced to be the many members of His Body
The producing of the many grains and the regenerating of the many sons was carried out by the same procedure of the divine dispensing
In Christ's resurrection we sinners have all been made three things: the many grains, the many sons, and the new creation
By this dispensing we become the members of Christ's Body, the many sons in God's household, and the new creation
In the New Testament the divine economy and the divine dispensing are revealed in the accomplishment of God's full redemption and salvation
The Lord Jesus as the Head of the Body 'bathed' the Body through the baptism of the Holy Spirit on the day of Pentecost
Christ in His humanity is revealed first as the King-Savior in Matthew, then as the Slave-Savior in Mark, and then as the Man-Savior in Luke
Christ came filled in His being as God in the Son to be given to us for our enjoyment and to be gained by us as our reality
Christ did not come with a small amount of grace and reality; on the contrary, He was full of grace and reality
The Lord told Nicodemus that he needed to be buried through water and have a new birth through the Holy Spirit; then he would be regenerated
As a result, in Nicodemus as well as in many others, the Lord would have His increase, His bride, His counterpart
John 5 tells us that whether or not we are in the tomb, we all are dead persons; but the Lord comes to us that we may have life
If we receive His word and believe the One who sent Him, we receive Him as life, which transfers us out of death into eternal life
Again, this is the transmission, the impartation, the dispensing, of the Triune God as life in the Son into us
In John 812 Jesus said I am the light of the world he who follows Me shall by no means walk in darkness but shall have the light of life
Whether or not we can explain this, it is a fact that the oneness revealed in John 17 is a oneness of four parties
The Lord accomplished many things to get into us and bring us into the Triune God, to make us one with the Triune God
They might not have been able to sleep well, but the Lord rested well in the tomb, and on the day of resurrection He came out of the tomb
On that morning Jesus, who had been the only begotten Son of God, became the firstborn Son of God with many brothers
Mary announced this to the disciples, but they were not comforted and still shut the doors to the room where they were for fear of the Jews
It was the practical impartation of the resurrected Christ, the pneumatic Christ as the life-giving Spirit, into His believers
Now He has everything: divinity, humanity, human living, the all-inclusive death, and the powerful, excellent resurrection
When we take this dose, His element is dispensed into us, and the 'antibiotics' in this dose kill all the 'germs' within us
When the Lord Jesus came to the disciples on that night, He brought such a consummated dose for them to breathe in
Just as there is no element of time with God, there is also no element of separation with the members of the Body
We were born again in Christ's resurrection, and we began to breathe at His breathing of the consummated Triune God into His believers
Ephesians 4:4-6 says that we --the one Body --and the one Spirit, the one Lord, and the one God and Father are mingled together
The accomplishment of God's full redemption and salvation in Christ was also in the outpouring of the economical Spirit upon the believers
After the delivery of the believers in the Lord's resurrection, there was a need to bathe the believers as a newborn child
The outpouring of the economical Spirit is the outward filling of the Spirit of power and the baptism in the Holy Spirit
According to the natural laws of God's creation, if we take a bath every day and drink some water after our bath, we will be very healthy
The accomplishment of God's full redemption and salvation in Christ is also in the regeneration of the believers
That was the accomplishing of the reality, the fact, that God brought forth many children through Christ's resurrection
Our need for a personal experience of regeneration can be illustrated by the exodus of the children of Israel out of Egypt
The exodus of the children of Israel was a corporate matter, but each Israelite needed to experience the exodus personally
The accomplishment of God's full redemption and salvation in Christ progresses in the subjective sanctification of the saints
The applying of the blood of Christ to separate us from the world is an outward, positional matter, not a dispositional matter
We still need a dispositional sanctification by the inner life, by the indwelling Spirit, by the very God who is within our spirit
Every day the divine life as the Holy Spirit who is God Himself is operating moving working saturating and anointing us little by little
After we were regenerated, we might have enjoyed certain worldly entertainments, but today we would not do those things
By such a sanctification we will not be fashioned according to this age but will be transformed by the renewing of our mind
He does this little by little, saturating us vertically and permeating us horizontally in every part of our being until our body is redeemed
These include the economy of God, Christ, the Spirit, the transformation of the believers, and the Body of Christ
The word oikonomia is great in significance because it refers to God's eternal purpose according to His heart's desire
In John 16 the Lord told His disciples clearly that He had many things to say to them, but they could not bear them at that time
God's economy, God's eternal plan, is revealed especially in the four books of Galatians, Ephesians, Philippians, and Colossians
The knowledge concerning Christ and the apprehension concerning Christ were released to a surpassing degree in the writings of Paul
The apostle Paul used the dimensions of the universe the breadth, length, height, and depth in order to show the dimensions of Christ
No one except Christ knows how broad is the breadth how long is the length how high is the height or how deep is the depth of the universe
Such a Christ first came down from the heavens to the earth; then He descended into Hades, the lower parts of the earth
After that, He ascended to the earth, and then He ascended far above all the heavens that He might fill all things
The Triune God, after being processed through incarnation, human living, crucifixion, resurrection, and ascension, has become the Spirit
John in his Gospel had some revelation concerning the Spirit, but his writing is only a record of what he saw; it is not his teaching
Regeneration, subjective sanctification, renewing, conformation, and glorification are also included in this revelation
In our gospel service, we need to preach the gospel in the newness of spirit, not in the oldness of a certain way or a certain formula
Before our regeneration, we did not have the divine life, but through regeneration, God imparted Himself into us and became our life
Galatians 6:15 says, 'For neither is circumcision anything nor uncircumcision, but a new creation is what matters'
He desires to gain a group of regenerated people as His new creation created by Him with His divine life embodied in Christ
From there it spreads by saturating vertically and permeating horizontally through every part of our soul to reach our body
It goes on to saturate and permeate our body until one day our body will be fully saturated and permeated, that is, fully redeemed
The processed Triune God who has passed through incarnation, human living, death, and resurrection is for our experience
He is also concerned about the way we comb our hair and even about what kind of buttons we have on our clothing
The more you say this, the more the Lord Jesus will touch you until you lose your freedom and your peace to do many things
In contrast, my face may be changed from a pale complexion to a pink one through eating rich and nourishing food for a period of time
We may understand the teaching concerning the Body of Christ and yet not have the element or essence of the Body
In order to have the element and essence, again and again, time after time, we must open ourselves to what we have heard and pray
If we open to the Lord and pray in this way every morning, it may seem that our prayer is the same day after day
Your Christian life will grow, and you will be under the sealing, which will result in the glorification of your body
The firstborn, representing all the families of both the Egyptians and the Israelites, were to be killed by God
The blood shed by the lamb was the redeeming blood, which redeemed all the firstborn of Israel from the sentence of death
God charged the children of Israel to eat the meat, the flesh, of the lamb while they were inside their houses under the sprinkled blood
None of these items was related to redemption, because the children of Israel had already been redeemed by the blood
In these miracles God exercised His arm of power to destroy Egypt by smiting Pharaoh, his country, and his army
The rescuing of Israel out of Egypt on the day of the Passover implies both God's salvation and God's redemption
God created man in a pure way for the purpose of entering into him as His vessel so that man could contain Him
In the biblical sense, to be renewed is to have a new element added into our being to replace and discharge our old element
In the whole universe only God could be a new element that can be added into our being to replace our old element
Some of the ethical teachers and philosophers, such as Confucius, taught their followers that they must be renewed
These people received many teachings concerning renewing, but they did not receive an element that could renew them
The New Testament teaching concerning renewing, however, stresses that the Holy Spirit accomplishes the renewing
The renewing that is according to the New Testament is accomplished by adding a new element into the believers' being
In Romans 11 Paul said that we, the Gentiles, are not the natural branches of the vine , but we were wild olive branches
Day by day we not only need cleansing, washing, and purging; we also need renewing by the dispensing of the Holy Spirit
In Romans 8 the mind is mentioned instead of the soul because the major part, the leading part, of the soul is the mind
In the renewing of the believers, the first step is to give life to their spirit, and the second step is to give life to their soul
Romans 12:2 says, 'And do not be fashioned according to this age, but be transformed by the renewing of the mind'
In Romans 8:6 Paul said, 'For the mind set on the flesh is death, but the mind set on the spirit is life and peace'
If our mind is on the flesh, we will suffer from hatred, dissatisfaction, and a number of other negative things
The Spirit renews the believers by dispensing the newness of Christ's resurrection life into the believers' inward being
The husband consumes the wife, the wife consumes the husband, the parents consume the children, and the children consume the parents
Lord, be our help in this matter, and cover us and cleanse us with Your precious blood that we may enjoy Your anointing
The transformation of the renewed believers takes place through the renewing of the mind, that is, in the soul
According to my knowledge, those philosophers, such as Confucius, who stressed human ethics and morality also stressed renewing
We need to be impressed that in the Bible the God-ordained and God-required renewing is not by our work; neither is it by God's work
The subjective sanctification is by this divine element, which is the holy nature, the holy element, of our Triune God
Pray- reading can affect our transformation because pray-reading keeps us in the presence of the divine element
In order to be renewed and transformed, we do not need to do anything; but we do need to absorb the divine element into us
By further masticating the word, we will taste the word even more, and we will receive more of the divine element
After the food enters into our stomach, the organic process of digestion causes the food to have an organic union with our being
In addition, because of the devastation of Satan and sin, we became old in the three parts of our being spirit, soul, and body
At the time of our salvation, the Spirit of God entered into our spirit to regenerate us, to make us new in our spirit
God used dust plus water to make a new form, that is, Adam's body with all its distinct parts, which did not exist prior to that time
Before we received the Lord Jesus, we had a certain form; but after we received the Lord Jesus, we became another form
When we are renewed, our form changes, not by our doing but by the organic divine element moving within us organically
He does this by putting Himself as a new element into us, first, to regenerate us, second, to sanctify us, and third, to renew us
The steps of regeneration, sanctification, and renewing result in the changing of our present form into a further form
From the day of our regeneration we need to be sanctified a little more each day, and we also need to be renewed day by day
After following such an atmosphere for one year, when they return home, their parents see in them another form
The new divine element, after being added into our old element, participates in an organic moving with our old organic 'organs'
In Romans 12:2 Paul said, 'And do not be fashioned according to this age, but be transformed by the renewing of the mind'
To linger in the presence of the Lord while beholding Him and reflecting Him affords us a real taste, a real enjoyment
When we look at Him, lingering in His presence, we behold Him, and He transfuses Himself as the life-giving Spirit into us
In the Old Testament economy the Angel of Jehovah was with Israel through the forty years of their wandering in the wilderness
As the Angel of Jehovah, Christ was among, around, and over the children of Israel, but He never entered into them
Today, after the processes of incarnation, crucifixion, and resurrection, this Angel of Jehovah has become the life-giving Spirit
The food we eat, the water we drink, and the air we breathe are all elements that are dispensed into us every day
When the divine element is added into our redeemed and uplifted natural element, we are sanctified and renewed
The result is that we are metabolically transformed, and the image of the resurrected Lord in the glory of His divine life is formed in us
Brother Nee once said that any teaching that helps us to work is wrong, but any teaching that ushers us into Christ for enjoyment is right
We do not need to work for transformation, but we need to behold and reflect the glory of the Lord in resurrection
He dispenses and we absorb Him the very processed and consummated Triune God as the lifegiving compound indwelling Spirit into our being
God makes us holy by imparting Himself, that is, by dispensing Himself, as the holy element, the holy nature, into our being
While Jesus was working and walking on this earth, He was the mingling of the Triune God with the tripartite man
Such a mingling is carried out by dispensing not a once for all 'injection' but a continuous dispensing day by day
The accomplishment of God's full redemption and salvation in Christ is in the conformation of the transformed believers
The conformation of the transformed believers conforms the transformed believers into the image of the firstborn Son of God in resurrection
There is one verse Romans 829 that clearly and definitely says that the believers will be conformed to the image of the firstborn Son of God
We will be conformed not in a general way but in a specific way to the definite image, the real likeness, of the firstborn Son of God
In life, in nature, in appearance, in taste, in everything and in every aspect, we become exactly the same as He is
When Christ was living on this earth, He expressed the attributes of God, which are love, light, holiness, and righteousness
These are the four basic elements love, light, holiness, and righteousness with which the Ten Commandments were composed
He loves us; He enlightens us; He is holy, even the embodiment of holiness; and He is righteous, even the very composition of righteousness
While Christ was on this earth, He expressed God in His divinity in love, in light, in holiness, and in righteousness
Philippians 2:7 tells us that Christ emptied Himself, taking the form of a slave, becoming in the likeness of men
In the only begotten Son of God there is only divinity, but in the firstborn Son of God there is both divinity and humanity
As a God-man who walked on the earth, He was both God and man, but His humanity had not yet been brought into divinity
Romans 1:4 tells us that through resurrection He was designated the Son of God according to the Spirit of holiness
The answer is that we all have received a Christ who is no longer the only begotten Son of God, but who has become the firstborn Son of God
Regardless of how others treat us, we should still be happy; we should not complain but should still love others
The husbands murmur to their wives, the wives murmur to their husbands, and the children murmur to their parents
To be conformed to the image of the firstborn Son of God is to be conformed to One who is both divine and human
As Christians, we need to express God in His divinity, and at the same time we also need to express man with the proper humanity
Christ is the only begotten Son of God and the firstborn Son of God altogether to be our portion in resurrection
We need to realize that all day, from morning until evening, God is working in us to dispense the element of the resurrected Christ into us
Every day the resurrected Christ dispenses Himself into us to work out one thing, that is, to conform us to His death
If someone such as our wife, our mother, or our roommate mistreats us, we should react by being conformed to Christ's death
We are conformed to Christ's death not by our capacity, not by our ability, but by Him in resurrection as our capacity
In Philippians 3:11 Paul said that he was aiming at the out-resurrection the outstanding resurrection, the extra-resurrection as a prize
All believers who are dead in Christ will participate in a general way in the resurrection from the dead at the Lord's coming back
The divine revelation concerning the divine economy and the divine dispensing is the central line among the many lines in the Bible
The terms divine economy and divine dispensing are new to most Christians because few know the teaching of Gods economy in the New Testament
The word economy, the anglicized form of the Greek word oikonomia, was stressed very much by the apostle Paul in his Epistles
In this administration there is a marvelous arrangement for God to dispense Himself into His chosen, created, and redeemed people
Today the life of many Christians is poor because they have missed the organ for the Christian life the human spirit
In John 4:24 the Lord Jesus said, 'God is Spirit, and those who worship Him must worship in spirit and truthfulness'
The Father is the source, the Son is the course, and the Holy Spirit is the flowing, the reaching, of the Triune God to us
God has regenerated us in our spirit , and He is now dwelling in our spirit to make our spirit one with His Spirit a mingled spirit
God's presence is a grace, His strengthening is a grace, His empowering is a grace, and His sanctifying is a grace
A mature son of God is one who has been conformed in his maturity of life to the image of the firstborn Son of God
In His divinity, He was very lofty and high, but in His humanity, He was a lowly person who lived a lowly life
On the one hand, we should live a high human life with all the human virtues, such as meekness, humility, and forbearance
On the other hand, we should express divinity in all the divine attributes, such as love, light, holiness, and righteousness
We need to realize that glorification will take place on the conformed sons of God, that is, on the mature sons
According to this teaching, the destination to which Christ is leading us is the objective glory of God in the heavens
It seems that the eternal glory of God is objective, far away from us, and that we are being led until we reach the destination of glory
Before we were saved, we were very active in our soul and very living in our body, but we were dead in our spirit
God desires to enter into our mind, emotion, and will, but often He finds the door to the three parts of our soul closed
When we turn our mind to our spirit and set our mind on the spirit, our mind will be filled, occupied, and taken over by God
Our spirit was redeemed when God regenerated our spirit, and our soul is redeemed when our soul is transformed
The reality of divine healing is that our mortal body is saturated with the divine life from our spirit through our soul
If we would learn to control our flesh by controlling our eating, drinking, and sleeping, we will live a longer life
Whenever you are about to be angry or unhappy with your spouse the best way to deal with your anger or unhappiness is to call O Lord Jesus!
Not only so, by calling on the name of the Lord, the Holy Spirit, as the embodiment of the divine life, spreads even into our body
When the process of glorification reaches its climax, we will be fully mature, and this maturity will be our glorification
The redemption of our body is accomplished by the transfiguring of our body of humiliation into the body of Christ's glory
The glorification of God's conformed sons is initiated by the Spirit's sealing unto the day of the redemption of the believers' body
God's conformed sons are glorified through the Spirit as the firstfruits dispensing the divine essence into the believers' entire being
We want to enter into the intrinsic revelation of Your Body, the church, which will be consummated in the New Jerusalem
Most Bible readers appreciate the beginning of the Bible, but they do not pay much attention to the end of the Bible
According to this natural understanding, God spends many years and does so much just to prepare a mansion for us
A figure of speech is used to speak of something that is somewhat unseen, somewhat mysterious, and somewhat hidden, concealed
Because something cannot be easily realized or apprehended, it is not possible to express what that thing is in normal terms
Since one item of the New Jerusalem is a figure of speech, the rest of the items must also be figures of speech
Revelation is a book of signs because it unveils to us things which we have never seen and which we cannot understand
Based upon this principle, the New Jerusalem as the conclusion of the book of Revelation should surely be a sign
The book of Revelation is really a book of revelation, and in this book a great sign is revealed the New Jerusalem
It was a great thing for the infinite God, the eternal God, to stay and be confined in the womb of a human virgin for nine months
As the resurrected Christ, He has been working in the heavens for almost two thousand years to work out His new creation
Corinthians 3:9 says that the church is God's cultivated land, God's farm, to grow something, and also God's building
The New Jerusalem, as the tabernacle, indicates what God's redeemed people will be to God in eternity, that is, God's eternal dwelling place
In the new heaven and new earth, the New Jerusalem will be a mutual dwelling place for the redeeming God and the redeemed man for eternity
The processed Triune God is the One who has gone through incarnation, human living, an all- inclusive death, and a wonderful resurrection
He has been consummated with incarnation, with human living, with a wonderful death, with resurrection, and with ascension
That consummation will be the glorification, the redemption, the transfiguration, of our body of humiliation into the body of Christ's glory
Our God is the processed and consummated Triune God, and we are the redeemed, regenerated, transformed, conformed, glorified tripartite man
The New Jerusalem is a composition of two groups of people God's Old Testament saints and Christ's New Testament believers
Without the Old Testament saints, we do not have the entrance, but without us they do not have the foundations
The inward constitution of the New Jerusalem is the Triune God, and the outward composition is the redeemed saints and believers
The New Jerusalem is built of three kinds of precious materials, signifying that she is built with the Triune God
When an oyster is wounded by a grain of sand, it secretes its life-juice around the grain of sand and makes it into a precious pearl
If we are not burned and pressed, we will remain pieces of coal, and we cannot be built up together into the New Jerusalem
We know that it is the throne of grace because out of it flows the river of water of life with the tree of life growing in it
There are three gates on the north, three gates on the south, three gates on the east, and three gates on the west
The light, the river, and the tree are for dispensing the very substance, element, and essence of the Triune God into our being
On our side, we have to pass through five '-tions': redemption, regeneration, transformation, conformation, and glorification
