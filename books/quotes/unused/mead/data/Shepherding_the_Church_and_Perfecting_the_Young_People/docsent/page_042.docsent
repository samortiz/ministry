   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Being Renewed and Not Holding On to Old Ways</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>We must spend time before the Lord in order to be renewed and not hold on to our old ways.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>From 1967 to 1970 we did not make much progress.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The churches have been here for more than twenty years, and some elders and responsible ones are getting older.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Therefore, we truly need a change.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The elders and responsible ones can continue to function behind the scene by praying, interceding, and caring for the saints and by supplying life.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>They should also allow younger saints to handle the business affairs of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>We need a new way of doing things because the Lord is new every day.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Everyone must rise up in the Lord to perfect the younger saints.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>It will be a shame if we cannot change the system and pass the baton.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>It is a shame to control things, and it is also a shame not to perfect the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The brothers must be encouraged to advance.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>It is not sufficient for the elders and co-workers to ask the saints to pray, pray-read, and release the spirit in the meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The root, the cause, of our sickness is still present, and it must be removed.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Otherwise, even pray-reading will become a method among us.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Unless the co-workers, elders, and responsible ones have a fundamental change in life, any method will merely be superficial.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The co-workers and elders lack vitality, and they barely manage to meet the need.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>This is still worthy of praise because the meetings are being maintained.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>However, we need to be living and energized.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>We must strive and struggle to be flexible and living.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>This can be likened to a boxer who must be regulated in his practice but who also must be flexible and active in competition.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>We need to be regulated while we are being trained, but we should be living and not rigid in our practical application.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Whether or not a person has been trained makes a difference.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>A person who is trained is able to apply his training.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>THE LORD S BLESSING</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Genesis 2:5 shows God s need to send the rain and man s need to work the ground.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>This means that we need to labor and toil in order to coordinate with God in the work.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>If we are willing to coordinate with God, the East from Japan to Hong Kong and the Philippines, Malaysia, Singapore, Indonesia, and Thailand will be open to us.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The Lord has opened this door for us, and we should match Him with our cooperation.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The Lord has indeed blessed this way.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>He bestows His blessing on us.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>We are not worthy, but the Lord is still doing His work.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>It is obvious that the Lord is blessing what we do.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>When we work with the young people and children, He blesses the work.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Although we are still not mature in life, the Lord has blessed us and caused us to be different from Christianity in our function and our work.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>This is altogether the Lord s blessing.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Furthermore, the church in Taipei has had substantial offerings.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>This is also the Lord s blessing.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>This proves that the Lord is blessing His way.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The Lord has also opened doors for us.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>All we need is to cooperate with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>We must go against the Chinese disposition, character, and temperament.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>We must not excuse ourselves and say that we were born this way.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Since we love the Lord and are willing to serve Him full time, we must have a heart for the work and not turn to the world.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Since we have given ourselves, we must be desperate to find a way to improve.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Some brothers are complaining that I make changes every day.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>However, I have not made enough changes.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>I hope that the brothers will not dispute or insist on keeping the old way.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Everyone must pursue the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>If we can move forward and change our way, we will have a wonderful situation.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>The Lord will bless this way.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>He will also bless our fellowship.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>THE CO-WORKERS GOING OVERSEAS</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>TO HAVE A BROADER VIEW</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>AND BRING IN NEW FELLOWSHIP</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>According to our present situation, twelve brothers will go overseas for at least two to three months every year.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Some of them may go for half a year.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>When these co-workers return, they will be assigned to lead the saints in a larger locality.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>The co-workers will go abroad in order to learn how to work.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>While they are abroad, their ability to supply the word will increase, and the propagation of the work will also increase.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>If all the co-workers could serve in this way, Southeast Asia would be enlivened and blended together.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Taiwan would become a center of the work.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>This is the situation that we are anticipating.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>However, it must not happen through human organization.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>We hope that more young saints can be gradually added to the work.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Both full-time brothers and sisters are needed.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>We lack co-workers who are between the ages of twenty-five and forty.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>I hope that some in this age group can be brought in to serve in coordination with the rest of the co-workers so that the younger ones can be raised up.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>This path that we are taking is not too difficult.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>We look to the Lord for His leading in this matter.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>The co-workers who go abroad must go with a burden.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>I hope that all the saints would receive the burden to pray for this matter.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Whenever there is an opportunity, the co-workers should go abroad to serve for a period of time and then return.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>The serving ones should also visit different places such as Japan and the United States.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>This would be a great help to them.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>A few serving ones can go abroad and visit some places.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>They should endeavor to help the place that they visit and to bring back something new, thus having a kind of fellowship.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>This kind of fellowship needs to increase, but this does not mean that we should have a move with a large group of saints traveling.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>At the same time, the overseas saints can also visit Taiwan.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>In short, there should be much fellowship among the saints from all over the world, either by their coming here or our going to visit them.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>If we practice this, our view will be broadened, and the work will become one.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>May we all receive the burden to pray for this so that we have a broadened view and do the same one work.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>CRUCIAL POINTS OF THE WORK IN TAIWAN</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>There are five major cities along the west coast of Taiwan, along the railroad.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>These cities are Kaohsiung, Tainan, Taichung, Taipei, and Keelung.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>We can add Hsing-chu, Chia-yi, and Chung-hua to have eight major cities.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>We need to strengthen our labor in these eight cities and make them the base of our work.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>These cities should be the focus of our work.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>We should also work with the students.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>The students work is more important than the work on the strategic cities.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>The blessing is with the students; hence, we must give our all to this work.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>Our work must focus on the main cities and on the students.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>The co-workers need to make this shift and work with the students, that is, spend more time with the students.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>At the same time, the co-workers must not hold on to the church affairs.</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>The church affairs must be handed over to the elders and the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>The co-workers must concentrate on the growth in life and the supply of the word.</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>The rest of their time should be spent on the schools.</S>
   <S PAR='98' RSNT='1' SNO='98'>We must pay attention to the growth in life and the supply in the word.</S>
   <S PAR='99' RSNT='1' SNO='99'>When we find out that there are saints meeting in a school, we should focus our labor on them.</S>
   <S PAR='100' RSNT='1' SNO='100'>This especially applies to the local churches in large cities.</S>
   <S PAR='101' RSNT='1' SNO='101'>We must strengthen the work in the schools.</S>
   <S PAR='102' RSNT='1' SNO='102'>There should also be a desperateness in the work of shepherding and visitation.</S>
   <S PAR='103' RSNT='1' SNO='103'>The students should be involved in the work; they must not depend on others to do the work for them.</S>
   <S PAR='104' RSNT='1' SNO='104'>There is much work to be done.</S>
   <S PAR='105' RSNT='1' SNO='105'>We visited a few churches that were established by migration and saw that the Lord has blessed many aspects of the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='106' RSNT='1' SNO='106'>Hence, the co-workers must go out.</S>
   <S PAR='107' RSNT='1' SNO='107'>When they go out, they will become living.</S>
   <S PAR='108' RSNT='1' SNO='108'>The church they visit will become living, and the co-workers will also become living.</S>
   <S PAR='109' RSNT='1' SNO='109'>Furthermore, they will bring back something living to their locality.</S>
   <S PAR='110' RSNT='1' SNO='110'>This also applies to those who stay in Taiwan.</S>
   <S PAR='111' RSNT='1' SNO='111'>The co-workers must focus on having a living word.</S>
   <S PAR='112' RSNT='1' SNO='112'>They do not have to serve in one designated area.</S>
   <S PAR='113' RSNT='1' SNO='113'>It may be effective for them to serve in different areas.</S>
   <S PAR='114' RSNT='1' SNO='114'>When a person serves in one area, it is easy to become regulated and mechanical.</S>
   <S PAR='115' RSNT='1' SNO='115'>We must do a work that is living and energizing.</S>
