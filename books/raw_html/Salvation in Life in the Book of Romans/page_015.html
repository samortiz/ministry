The first five items speak of God’s salvation in life. The first item is the law of the Spirit of life. This law saves and frees us. Second, we have the subjective and dispositional sanctification that saves us from a nature soaked with the element of the world. Third, the renewing of our mind leads to the transformation of our whole soul which delivers us from a living soaked with the element of the world. Whereas dispositional sanctification delivers us from a nature soaked with the element of the world, the renewing of our mind, leading to the transformation of our soul delivers us from a living soaked with the element of the world. Fourth, we are being built up together in the Body of Christ, and are thus delivered from the individualism of the natural life. Last, we are also being conformed to the image of the Son of God to be delivered from the expression of the natural life. These five items of saving in life are very profound. They touch the depths of our being. They touch our nature, our living that is soaked with the element of the world, our individualism in the natural life, and the expression of our natural life.<p>There are also four results to the saving of the life of Christ. First, we reign in life to subdue all insubordination. When we come to the matter of reigning, we reach the top and the ultimate point; there is nothing higher than this matter. God has saved us to the extent that we can reign in this saving life. The second result is that we are all living the church life in a locality to be saved from our self-view and self-goal. The third result is that Satan is crushed under our feet and God’s kingdom is brought in. The final result is that we reach glorification, the ultimate consummation of God’s salvation in life.
