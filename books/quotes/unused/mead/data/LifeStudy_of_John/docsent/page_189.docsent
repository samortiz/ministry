   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>2.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Indicating that Some of His Followers</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Will Live Until He Comes</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Verse 23, referring to what the Lord had said to Peter about John, says, This word therefore went forth among the brothers that that disciple would not die; yet Jesus did not say to him that he would not die, but, If I want him to remain until I come, what is that to you?</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>In this word the Lord indicates that some of His followers will live until He comes.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>3.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The Disciples Following Him and</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Living with Him in His Invisible Presence</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>and Waiting for Him to Come</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>in His Visible Presence</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>It seems that in this portion of the Word there are some contradictory elements.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>When the Lord said, Follow Me, He was there with the disciples.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>How then could He say, Until I come ?</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Since He was there, He need not come.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>If He meant that He would leave them and later come back to them, how could He say to them, Follow Me ?</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>How could they follow Him?</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>When I was young, I was troubled by this and said to myself, If the Lord is here for us to follow Him, then there is no need for Him to come.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>He is here already.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>But if He is coming, then He must be away from us.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>How then can He ask us to follow Him?</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The answer to all these questions is the Lord s invisible presence.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>According to His visible presence, He would leave the disciples and come back later.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>But according to His invisible presence, He would be with them all the time.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>On the one hand, He would be with them, and on the other hand, He would be away from them.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Therefore, on the one hand, they could follow Him, and on the other hand, they would have to wait for His coming back.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>There are two aspects of the Lord s presence His invisible presence and His visible presence.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Because of the Lord s invisible presence, we can follow Him.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Invisibly, the Lord is here, and we follow Him.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Visibly, He is not here, and we must wait until He comes.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The key is the Lord s wonderful presence.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>In this age, His invisible presence is better than His visible presence.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>His invisible presence is more precious, available, prevailing, rich, and real.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>I hope that we all understand these two aspects of the Lord s presence.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Visibly speaking, we are waiting for Him; invisibly speaking, He is walking with us and we are following Him.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>After His resurrection, the Lord remained with the disciples for forty days Acts 1:3-4 in order to train them to realize, practice, and live by His invisible presence.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>In verse 23 the Lord indicated that some of His believers would follow Him to death and that some would remain, would live until He comes.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>John 21 is a very practical chapter.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>We have seen that we have been regenerated as the sons of God and have the life and nature of God.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Thus, we are the manifestation of God.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>God has committed to us His heavenly and divine commission, and we must do something to accomplish the Lord s purpose feed His sheep and shepherd His flock until all the sheep are brought together as one Body to be a spiritual house.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Although we must do these things, there is still the practical matter of our living.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>In this chapter we see that the Lord will provide for our needs and take care of our living.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>We must simply commit the matter of our living into His hands and leave it there.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>If we are under His will, the Lord will certainly maintain our living.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Furthermore, we must also realize that we must suffer and sacrifice for the Lord s testimony, following Him even unto death.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The span of things covered in John 20 and 21 is very broad.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>It begins with the discovery of the Lord s resurrection and ends with His coming back.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>These two chapters show everything that will happen to us between the Lord s resurrection and His coming back.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Between these two events are all the things related to the Christian life during the church age: seeking the Lord with love toward Him, especially in the personal morning watch; seeing the Lord in resurrection; receiving the revelation of the issue of the Lord s resurrection concerning the brothers and the Father by experiencing His manifestation; meeting with the believers to enjoy the Lord s presence; being breathed on by the Lord with the Holy Spirit and being sent by the Lord with His commission and authority to represent Him; learning how to live by faith in the Lord and to trust in Him for our daily living; loving the Lord with our natural strength having been dealt with and having learned the lesson of being broken, of losing our self-confidence, and of putting our trust in the Lord; shepherding the flock for the building of the church; practicing the Lord s invisible presence in which some follow Him even to death to glorify God, not by self-will but according to His leading, and some live until He comes back.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>As we have seen, the Gospel of John begins with the Word in eternity past.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>After passing through the long process of incarnation, crucifixion, and resurrection, this Word has become the life-giving Spirit, the holy pneuma, the holy breath 20:22 .</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>In Greek, the word pneuma is used for both breath and spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>The very eternal Word has become such a breath, such a Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>This is the processed God for our enjoyment.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>He is now the life and the Spirit in resurrection, moving, living, working, and walking with us.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Furthermore, He meets with us all the time.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>As the life, the Spirit, the holy breath, in resurrection He is constantly with us invisibly.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>He will continue with us invisibly, meeting, moving, living, working, and walking with us, until He comes visibly.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>This is the very Jesus Christ in whom we believe; the very Lord whom we have received; the very God whom we serve, worship, and enjoy; and the very all-inclusive Spirit who is always with us and within us.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Praise Him!</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>The Gospel of John has no conclusion.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>This book is not closed; it is still under the Spirit s composition.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Perhaps today s Gospel of John has two or three thousand chapters.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>This book is still being composed, and we are included in its composition.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Praise the Lord!</S>
