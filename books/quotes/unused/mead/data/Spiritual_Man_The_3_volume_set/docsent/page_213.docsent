   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>ONENESS</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>"One spirit" Phil 1:27 .</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>We have already seen how the living of a spiritual man is joined with other believers.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Oneness in the spirit is very important.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>If God, through the indwelling of the Holy Spirit in a believer's spirit, is completely joined with the believer, the believer's spirit will also be one with the other believers.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>A spiritual man is not only one with Christ in God; he is also joined to God who dwells in every believer.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Therefore, if a believer allows the soulish life to work, he cannot walk according to the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>If a believer allows his mind or emotion to control his spirit, then his spirit cannot be one with other believers.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Only when the mind and emotion submit to the control of the spirit can the believer disregard or stop the discord in the mind and emotion and be one with the other children of God in spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>A believer must keep his spirit in a condition of being one with all the believers.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>This is not being joined only with a small group of those with the same opinion, but with the entire Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Our spirit must be without hardness, bitterness, or restrictions; instead, it must be completely open and free before our contact with others can be without barrier.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>FULL OF GRACE</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>"The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit" Gal 6:18 .</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>We must constantly guard our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Therefore, the grace of the Lord Jesus Christ is precious.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The grace of the Lord in our spirit is our help at any time.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>This is a word of blessing; this is also the height of what a believer can receive in his spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>We should always keep our spirit in the grace of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>THE RAPTURED SPIRIT</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Apart from the conditions of the spirit discussed above, we should also keep our spirit in a condition of being out of the world and ascending to the heavens at all times.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>We call this the raptured spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The raptured spirit is deeper than the spirit of ascension.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The person who has obtained the raptured spirit not only lives as if he is in the heavens; he also, through the Holy Spirit's leading, believes and expects the second coming of the Lord and his own rapture.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>When the spirit of the believer and that of Christ are joined as one spirit, he becomes a citizen of the heavens in experience, living in the world as a sojourner.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The Holy Spirit will call him to advance step by step so that he can receive the raptured spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Formerly his cry was "Forward!"</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Now it is "Ascend!"</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>This causes his whole being to go heavenward.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The raptured spirit enables a believer to have a foretaste of the spirit which has "tasted...the powers of the age to come" Heb 6:5 .</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Everyone who believes in the doctrine of the second coming does not necessarily have this raptured spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Believing in the Lord's second coming, preaching about it, or even praying for it does not mean very much.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>We can have all of these but still be without the raptured spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Not every mature believer has this spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>It is a gift of grace from God.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Sometimes it is given according to His pleasure; sometimes it is given in response to supplication in faith.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>With this raptured spirit, the believer's spirit is always in a position of being raptured, believing not only in the Lord's return but also in his own rapture.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>This is not believing a doctrine but knowing a fact.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Just as Simeon, by the revelation of the Holy Spirit, knew that he would see the Christ of God before his death, a believer should also believe with assurance in his spirit that he will be raptured to the Lord before he dies.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>This faith is the faith of Enoch.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Naturally, we are not stubbornly believing a superstition.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>If we are in the period of the rapture, we cannot help but be filled with the faith of being raptured.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>This kind of faith will enable us to better understand the work of God in this age.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Thus, we will receive the heavenly power to help us in our work.</S>
