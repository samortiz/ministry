   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Equipping Ourselves with the Truth</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>We must equip ourselves with the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Then the saints in the churches will be like the children of an educated family.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>When they open their mouths, the truth will flow out, and when they go out to preach the gospel, they will speak the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>If the young people among us speak the truth of Romans 8:1-13 to their parents, telling them that the Triune God is dispensing Himself into the tripartite man, I believe that their parents will be moved.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>We should not be afraid that they will not understand us.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>If we understand the truth, others will understand what we speak to them.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>When we understand the truth, we should discuss the truth with other saints instead of talking about the weather and politics.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>We should be steeped in the truth and equipped with the truth to the extent that we breathe the truth, eat the truth, and live the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Our entire being should be full of the truth, and our conversation with other saints should be nothing other than the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Our friends and relatives should hear only the truth out of our mouths.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Then after a period of time, they will understand what they could not receive at first, and the truth will enter into them.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>America has many immigrant Chinese families with elderly men and women who did not understand English when they immigrated.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>However, since their grandchildren speak English, the grandparents gradually learn to speak English, because they hear it every day.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>For the sake of the gospel in our homes, on the campuses, to the children, and in the communities, we must cultivate the habit of speaking the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Our gospel is to speak the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>If we speak the truth in our homes, our friends and relatives will hear the truth when they are in our homes.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>If this is our situation, how can the gospel fail to spread?</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>We should not be afraid of having nothing to say; there are too many things to speak about.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The Life-study of the New Testament contains more than twelve hundred messages and over twelve thousand pages.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>We also have the Recovery Version of the New Testament with its footnotes.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Many treasures are buried in these pages, and the truth they contain is rich.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Every family and every saint must get into the Recovery Version of the New Testament to equip themselves with the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>This will enable the truth to saturate us, and it will cause us to be filled with the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>When we are soaked with the truth, we will be able to preach the gospel in our homes, on the campuses, to the children, and in the communities, and the Lord will have a way among us.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>A FEW PRACTICAL POINTS</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>We would now like to fellowship concerning a few practical points.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>First, we hope the brothers and sisters understand that the way that the Lord has given us requires every saint to be practically involved in serving Him.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Every one of us is a part of the church, even if we are the weakest or the smallest member.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Furthermore, we should be willing to receive help in order to serve the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>We all must serve.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Second, we do not need everyone to be full time, but we must all learn to redeem the time Eph 5:16 .</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>We must also present our bodies Rom 12:1 .</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>We must all redeem the time and present our bodies.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The Lord has given every one of us a different situation.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Some of us must work in a profession, as nurses, doctors, teachers, professors, or clerks, to earn a living and support our families.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>This is proper.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Some of us run our own businesses in order to support our families.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>This is also proper.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>No matter what our situation is, we must arrange our time so that every day and every week and every month we have the time to present our bodies to the Lord for His use.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>We might spend one hour every week visiting people, or we can invite our friends and relatives to our home one evening every week and lead our family to preach the gospel to them.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>This is what it means to redeem the time and to present our bodies.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>This is very practical, and I hope that we will all enter into it.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The third point concerns finances and material offerings.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>We do not want to set up an organization to support the needs of the full-time serving ones.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Those who serve full time in the local churches serve and work for the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The locality where they live should support them.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>For example, the church in Kaohsiung should support the full-time serving ones in the area around Kaohsiung; the church in Taichung should support those who serve in the area around Taichung; the church in Keelung should support those who serve in the area around Keelung; the church in Taipei should support those who serve in the area around Taipei; and the church in Hualien should support those who serve in the area around Hualien.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Then we will not need a special group of saints to look after this matter.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>It will also be more convenient for the brothers and sisters to give material offerings.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>The brothers and sisters who have a heart for the full-time serving ones can give their offerings to the church in their locality.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>They can indicate on the envelope that the offering is for the brothers and sisters who serve full time.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Even if it is not indicated on an envelope, the church can use the offering to take care of the full-time serving ones.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>We need to realize that once the full-time brothers and sisters begin to serve, there will be a greater need for material offerings in order to support them.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>There will also be more saints encouraging the various activities of the church, and their work will produce results.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>This means our numbers will increase, and when our numbers increase, there will be the need for more meeting halls.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Taipei has twenty-one meeting halls.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Even if every meeting hall is packed, we would be able to seat only a little more than eight thousand saints.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>At present, there are only five thousand saints meeting in the church in Taipei, but we hope that by next year we will have recovered more than three thousand of the dormant saints.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>We will also gain new ones.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Therefore, our numbers will reach almost eight thousand.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>The twenty-one meeting halls will not be able to hold everyone.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Some saints have suggested that we divide every meeting hall into two groups, and we would have one group meet in the morning and the other group in the afternoon.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>However, this is not good for the long-term.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>If our numbers continue to increase, dividing into two groups will not be adequate.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>There will be a need for us to increase the number of meeting halls.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>In any industrialized country with a growing economy, land and buildings are expensive.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>This is the case in Taiwan.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>We must therefore make plans.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>We will need a large amount of offerings.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>We must all coordinate together concerning the offerings and concerning the arrangements.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>The elders and the serving ones must have a long-term view.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>They must also observe how society is developing and note the locations that will be suitable for meeting halls.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>This will require many saints, a large amount of material offerings, and much preparation.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>The brothers and sisters need a heart that is willing to offer up everything to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>Then our way will be prosperous in the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>If a locality has more offerings than it can use, the saints can give the extra funds to make up the lack in other localities so that the local churches care for one another in the matter of finances.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>In this way there will be no dead money among us.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>In other words, our money should be living and flowing.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>Our finances should flow from the brothers and sisters to their churches; it must also flow to other localities and to the churches all over the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>The Lord s recovery today has spread to all five continents of the world.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>Numerous countries in Africa, Germany in Europe, and many other areas need help financially.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>We are on the earth today for the Lord s testimony in this age.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>The earth has become like a small village in which every country and major region are closely related.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>We thank the Lord that by His blessing and mercy, Taiwan is economically developed.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>Because we are under this blessing and we love the Lord, we should give more material offerings.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>We must give our offerings to the local church in the locality where we reside.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>If we live in a city, we give our offerings to the church in that city, and the church will distribute the offerings.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>Most of the offerings will be used to support the full-timers, to spread the gospel, and to build meeting halls.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>If a locality cannot use all the offerings it receives, it can care for other localities.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>If the churches in a country cannot use all the offerings they receive, they can care for the churches in other countries.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>All our circumstances are under the Lord s blessing; we should seize the opportunity to labor under the Lord s blessing and arrange for the spread of His testimony on the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>May we all pray and fellowship with the Lord so that we can act according to the Lord s operation.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>If we rise up, then after five to ten years we will be able to praise the Lord, and the condition of the churches will be clearly manifested.</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>I hope that the brothers and sisters will receive this fellowship and burden and go before the Lord concerning this move.</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>We must pray much before Him for the sake of His testimony.</S>
