        <h1 class="msg">CHAPTER FOURTEEN</h1>
<h1 class="title">BASIC CONDITIONS FOR SERVING THE LORD</h1>
<p>In this chapter we will consider a few basic points that are crucial in serving the Lord and in working for the Lord. We will also consider the basic conditions for serving the Lord. Many who serve the Lord do not realize that they neglect and even ignore these basic points.</p>
<h2 class="head1">KNOWING A TREE BY ITS FRUIT</h2>
<p>A person who does not pay attention to these basic points will be known by his fruit. The Lord Jesus said, &ldquo;By the fruit the tree is known&rdquo; (Matt. 12:33). We can know by its fruit whether a tree is a peach tree or an apricot tree and whether it is good or corrupt. A tree with apricots cannot be called a peach tree, and if its fruit is sour, tart, small, and dry, we cannot say that the tree is good. But if its fruit is sweet and juicy, everyone will know that this apricot tree is good. Similarly, the measure of a person&rsquo;s work depends on his fruit, not on his feelings or on the appraisal of others.</p>
<p>Some of you have been serving for more than ten years. I exhort you to spend time before the Lord, asking Him to show you the kind of fruit that your service has produced. There is no need for you to say that your fruit is good or even that it is corrupt; instead, let the Lord reveal this to you. The Old Testament speaks of an offering that is &ldquo;according to the shekel of the sanctuary&rdquo; (Exo. 30:13). This is a form of measurement. The weight of an offering that a person brought before God was not based on the standard of others but on the shekel of the sanctuary. A person who thinks highly of himself may think that his offering weighs one talent. According to the standard of the sanctuary, however, his offering may weigh only one gerah, which is one-twentieth of a shekel (v. 13), and there are three thousand shekels per talent. In contrast, a person who has been dealt with by the Lord may feel that his offering is not even half a gerah, but after being weighed in the sanctuary, his offering may weigh more than half a talent. Hence, our work is not measured by our own valuation or by the valuation of others. We need to go before the Lord and, without any consideration or bias, ask Him to show us the fruit of our work.</p>
<h2 class="head1">FOUR BASIC POINTS FOR DETERMINING<br />
THE EFFECTIVENESS OF ONE&rsquo;S WORK</h2>
<p>According to my experience, there are four basic points that determine the effectiveness of our work before the Lord.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Producing Churches</h2>
<p>First, we need to know whether our work produces churches. Those who have been in the Lord&rsquo;s work for some time should ask whether they have raised up local churches or whether their service has built up any local churches. The churches are raised up and built up in a definite way, just as there is a definite way to build a house. If a contractor says that he has not built any houses but that he has hammered a few nails and supplied building materials for others to build houses, there must be a problem with this contractor, and his company will surely go out of business. A qualified contractor, who has been working for more than ten years, will surely be able to point out certain buildings or houses that he has built. If he can point out the houses that he has built, no one will deny his work. His work will prove that he is a qualified contractor.</p>
<p>We have been working for the Lord for many years, but we are not clear concerning the situation of our work, nor are we clear concerning the situation of others&rsquo; work. We must see ourselves clearly before we can help others in the work. When we understand how to evaluate our work, we will not be deceived by others. Whether people speak of our work in a noble, a flattering, or even an ambiguous manner, we will be clear in our heart. Regardless of what a person says about himself, we should only ask, &ldquo;Where is your fruit? Has any church been built up by your service, or do you take advantage of others&rsquo; efforts and take credit for their work?&rdquo; The first basic point that we need to pay attention to in our service to the Lord is to know whether we have established or built up a local church.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Ministering Christ</h2>
<p>Second, we need to know whether our work ministers Christ. Have we ever helped the saints in practical matters? Have we ministered Christ to the saints? We need to let the Lord, as a spiritual Surgeon, cut open our being and our work in order to see whether we have ministered Christ to the saints in practical matters. If we indeed minister Christ to the saints in practical matters, then those who come in contact with us will be delivered from the world and filled with the Holy Spirit. Those who contact us will know the flesh, know the cross, and know how to live in the spirit. Whether we are sent somewhere by the arrangement of the co-workers or we go out of our own burden, we should pay attention to ministering Christ and rendering help in practical matters. This is a basic point.</p>

 	<h2>Noise Words</h2>
 	<p>Common words, such as "and", "is", "but", and "the", also known as noise words, are bypassed in a search. The search string, the Spirit &amp; who, would result in an error since who, which stands by itself, is a noise word. The following is a list of noise words:</p>
	<p>$, a, also, an, and, another, any, are, as, at, be, because, been, being, both, but, by, came, can, did, do, each, for, has, had, he, have, her, here, him, himself, his, how, if, in, into, is, it, like, make, me, might, much, my, of, on, or, our, out, over, said, should, since, some, still, such, take, than, that, the, their, them, then, there, these, they, this, those, to, too, very, was, way, we, well, were, what, where, which, while, who, with, would, you, your</p>

  	<h2>Ranking</h2>
  	<p>Rank is a value from <strong>0</strong> to <strong>1000</strong> indicating how closely a match scored or ranked against the original search string. Rank values are affected by the following factors:</p>
		<ol>
            <li><span>The total number of occurrences of the original search words/phrases in a portion of a book.</span></li>
            <li><span>Content that includes the search words in close proximity to each other are ranked above those that do not. Therefore, a portion of a book that has the search words in close proximity may have a higher ranking than another portion of a book that has a higher hit count but the words are not in close proximity to one another. Therefore, we also include a search word hit count for reference.</span></li>
            <li><span>The rank values are relative to each other. Therefore, it is not possible to interpret the RANK value as a percentage or group the rank values into high/medium/low ranges. Think of rank as a method to order the results for a specific search.</span></li>

 	<h2>Search Scope</h2>
 	<h3>Include All Word Forms</h3>
	<p>This option breaks out the search string into its individual words and generates all conjugations and declensions for each word in the search phrase. A search on the word, dwell, would search for dwell, dwelling, dwelling's, dwells, dwelt, and dwelled.</p>
	<p>There is no need to use ^ (inflectional search) or * (prefix search) when using the Include all word forms search scope.</p> 
	<h3>Specified Word Forms</h3>
	<p>This option searches for exact matches of the specified words or phrases used in the search string. Use of ^ (inflectional search) with a particular word in the search string will broaden the search for that given word in that all conjugations and declensions for that word will be searched. Similarly, use of * (prefix search) with a particular word in the search string will broaden the search for that given word in that all words with that prefix will be searched as well.</p> 
	<h3>Note</h3>
	<p>Common words, such as "and", "is", "but", and "the", also known as noise words, are bypassed in a search. A list of all noise words is as follows:</p>
