   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>The chapters of each book of the Scriptures are also divinely arranged.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The things that are stated explicitly, of course, have profound significance; however, certain things that are not mentioned are even more profound in their significance.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>For instance, Genesis 14 tells us that when Abraham returned after winning a battle, Melchisedec, the king of Salem, the priest of the Most High God, went to meet him, ministered bread and wine to him, and blessed him vv.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>17-19 .</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Strangely, however, Genesis does not tell us anything about the origin of Melchisedec.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>According to the style of Genesis, whenever someone is mentioned, there is usually an account of his background.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>For example, there are clear records of the backgrounds of people such as Adam and Noah to let us know of whom they were born, what their accomplishments were, and how long they lived.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>However, the record in Genesis concerning Melchisedec does not disclose to us his beginning or his end. Therefore, we do not know where he came from or where he went.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>In Hebrews 7, however, Paul tells us that Melchisedec, who was a type of Christ as the eternal Son of God, had no father, no mother, no genealogy, no beginning of days, and no end of life v. 3 . This shows us the reason why the record of his background was omitted in Genesis.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Of course, Melchisedec could not actually be without parents, as if he simply dropped from heaven, but these facts were omitted intentionally in Genesis.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Even Moses, when he wrote Genesis, probably did not know why the Holy Spirit did not reveal to him the background of Melchisedec, including his birth and his death.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>I do not believe that Moses knew that one day Paul would use Melchisedec to typify Christ, who has no beginning, no ending, no birth, and no death.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>This proves that Moses wrote Genesis under the leading of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Let us take the four Gospels as another example.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The four Gospels give us a portrait of the Lord Jesus in four different aspects.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>However, a case may be mentioned in one book but not recorded in the other three books, while another case may be recorded in two or three books, and yet the emphasis in each of these books may be different.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>For example, in the case of the Lord Jesus' feeding five thousand with five loaves and two fish, the writing style of John chapter six is totally different from that of the other three Gospels.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Therefore, in order to understand the full significance of any case recorded in the four Gospels, we need to study the four Gospels together and take care of every aspect of that case.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Only then will we be able to have a thorough understanding and comprehension.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>It is surely meaningful that a certain case is recorded in some places, but it is equally meaningful, from another viewpoint, that it is omitted in other places.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>In Matthew 5:18 the Lord Jesus says, "For truly I say to you, Until heaven and earth pass away, one iota or one serif shall by no means pass away from the law until all come to pass."</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Therefore, we who love and pursue the Lord should devote a major part of our lifetime to the study of the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>It is absolutely impossible to study the Bible thoroughly.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>We all know that our diet is of utmost importance to our health.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>We should pay attention not only to how much we eat but also to how properly we eat.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The Cantonese, who are very particular about their eating, eat seven times a day.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>As followers of the Lord, we need to read the Bible every day and if possible seven times a day.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>You should never think that you do not need to read the Bible anymore because you have already read through it several times and have read it thoroughly.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The Bible is exceedingly rich.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Therefore, no matter how thoroughly you have studied it, there are still some items that you have not yet uncovered.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>I hope that you will not only remember this point but also practice accordingly.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>If you spend time to study the Bible diligently, you may wear out a Bible in seven or eight years.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Your Bible will become worn out because you have studied it so diligently and so frequently.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>You may consider yourself to have exerted sufficient effort only after you have worn out several copies of the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The amount of effort you have put into the study of the Bible can be seen in two things.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The first thing is how old your Bible is and how worn out it is.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>If it has not been handled often enough and is still very clean, preserved intact, and kept in the same place, this proves that you have not spent time to study it.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The second thing is how many circles, dots, and lines there are in your Bible, how many different colors there are, and how many annotations have been written in it.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>This does not mean that you should draw or write indiscriminately.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The circles, dots, and lines you draw, the colors you apply, and the words you write must all be meaningful, and the more the better.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>One thing that has been a concern to me and that I have always greatly regretted is that I lost my first Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>I truly hope that I will be able to get back that Bible because it means a great deal to me.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>If today someone would offer a high price to buy my old Bibles, I definitely would not sell them.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>To me, they are my best savings, my priceless treasures.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>I say this with the hope that all of you will spend time to study the Bible diligently.</S>
