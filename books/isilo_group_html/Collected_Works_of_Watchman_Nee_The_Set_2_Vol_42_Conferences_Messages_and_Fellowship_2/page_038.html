We are saved in Christ. How could the Lord die on our behalf and save us? Individually speaking, we were saved when we believed in the Lord. But corporately speaking, we were all condemned in Christ. For example, here is a chalk box. We can say that this is a picture of us in Christ on the cross. I do not have to throw the pieces of chalk into the sea one by one. As long as I throw the chalk box into the sea, all the chalk will be in the sea. The chalk will be wherever the chalk box is. In the same way, we are now in Christ. All of His experiences have become our experiences. He was judged on the cross, He was crucified, and He resurrected and ascended. We have also been judged, crucified, resurrected, and ascended because we are in Him. All of His experiences have now become ours. In Christ, God sees us as Christ, having the same experiences that Christ had. This is God's work of redemption.</p><h2 class="head1">HOW TO BE IN CHRIST</h2><p>Someone asked how we can be in Christ, and I answered, "If Watchman Nee, weighing only one hundred and fifty pounds, has the strength to put the chalk into the chalk box, is it too hard for God, who is the creator of the universe and millions of times stronger than me, to put us into Christ?" Please read 1 Corinthians 1:30. Of whom are we in Christ? Of God! We are in Christ. But we do not know how we got into Christ, in the same way that the pieces of chalk are in the chalk box, but do not know how they got in. However, as long as the chalk is in the box, whatever happens to the box will happen to the chalk. I do not know how I got into Christ. I only know that God has put me into Christ. Whatever Christ has passed through, I also have passed through. You must realize one thing: God's work of redemption does not deal with you as an individual; He only deals with Christ. Today God has set up two great camps in this world&mdash;the camp of Christ and the camp of Adam. Man has a choice to be either in Adam or in Christ. If you are in Adam, your end is perdition. If you are in Christ, your end is salvation. God did not do anything outside of Adam. In the same way He is not doing anything outside of Christ.</p><p>Someone once asked me, "Do you think I will go to hell?" I answered, "You are quite qualified to go to hell." He answered, "But I am such a good man. Will I still have to go to hell?" I said, "You were already qualified a long time ago. I do not have to ask whether you are good or bad as an individual. I only ask if you are in Christ or in Adam. You do not have to steal, murder, or commit any gross sins. As long as you are in Adam, you are qualified to go to hell." I remember one wonderful passage of the Bible in the book of Hebrews. Hebrews is a difficult book. The apostle who wrote this book was trying to prove to us that Christ is higher than Moses, Joshua, the angels in the Old Testament, and Aaron. He compared Christ with many people. One of the comparisons he made was of Christ as the High Priest and Aaron as the high priest. How did the apostle prove that Christ is higher? He said that Christ is a priest according to the order of Melchisedec; His priesthood is derived from Melchisedec. Aaron was a high priest, but his priesthood was derived from Levi. Aaron had an ancestor, who was Abraham. One day Abraham went to war. After he won, he gave one tenth of what he took to Melchisedec, from whose order Christ's priesthood was derived. This proves that Aaron is less than Christ. Aaron was the descendant of Levi, Levi was the son of Jacob, Jacob was the son of Isaac, and Isaac was the son of Abraham. Abraham offered one tenth of what he took to Melchisedec. When Abraham offered one tenth to Melchisedec, Isaac was in Abraham's loin. Jacob and Levi were even smaller, but they were within Abraham as well. Hence, they also offered one tenth through Abraham to Melchisedec. Consequently, Christ, whose priesthood is after the order of Melchisedec, is surely greater than Aaron, whose priesthood is after the order of Levi.</p><h2 class="head1">INHERITING ALL OF GOD'S SPIRITUAL BLESSINGS<br />IN CHRIST</h2><p>Once I talked to a few college students who majored in biology. I told them that according to the Bible, the father's age is less than the son's age, and the son is older than the father. This is because the source of life extends all the way to the first ancestor. By the time the line of life reaches the father, it may already be six thousand years old. Suppose his son is thirty years old. It means that his life is now six thousand plus thirty years old. Does this not therefore mean that the son's age is greater than that of the father?</p><p>Just as Adam's life was in us, the life of Christ is now in us. When we received the life of Adam, we became a part of Adam. Today the same is true about being in Christ. When we are in Christ and receive the life of Christ, we become a part of Christ. Everything in Christ becomes ours. This is God's way of salvation as revealed in the Bible.</p><p>Some may pose a question: If this is the case, why do we still need to have individual pursuit? Does this mean that we no longer need to seek after holiness and victory? Please remember that if you want to be holy and perfect, you have to view yourself according to God's view. Forget for the moment whether or not you have sinned. All that matters is being in Christ. Whether or not you are good, whether or not you have the overcoming life, and whatever way you are going does not matter. As long as you are in the box, everything that the box passes through will become your experience. This is the gospel. This is why we say that the gospel is free. It is free because it has nothing to do with us. As long as we are in Christ, everything becomes ours. Ephesians 1:3 mentions every spiritual blessing in the heavenlies. All of these are ours when we are in Christ. When we are in Christ, God cannot hold back anything from us. When we are in Christ, God cannot withhold any spiritual blessings from us. God cannot withhold them because He has already put them into Christ. God can choose not to put us into Christ, but as soon as He puts us into Christ, He cannot withhold any spiritual blessings from us. We lack nothing in Christ. God is not satisfied with giving us nine things when there are ten things in Christ. Everything that is in Christ is ours. This is God's work. Whether it is salvation, the overcoming life, power, the way, or anything else, we have them all as long as we are in Christ.</p><p>It does not make any difference even if you are the chiefest of all sinners. God has put you into Christ. When Christ died on the cross, God's punishment on Christ became your punishment, and His judgment upon Christ became your judgment. Your sins are all forgiven in Christ. God has no way to take back what He has done even if you commit more sins. This is based not only on God's grace, but also on His righteousness. Romans is a book on grace and righteousness, whereas Ephesians is on God's grace. There is a difference of timing between the two. It is God's grace for Him to work in Christ. If God did not put man into Christ, man would have no way to help himself. It is God's grace that we can be in Christ. After God put man into Christ, He judged the man who is in Christ. Today you are saved. However, you are saved not only because of God's grace, but because of God's righteousness as well. Can God judge us again after He has judged Christ? No! After He has judged Christ, He has to justify us, because we are in Christ. God is righteous, and He has to recognize everything that Christ has done.</p><p>After we become a Christian, everything depends on seeing what it means to be in Christ. After we see the meaning of being in Christ, we will enjoy great blessings.</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_037.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_039.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Collected Works of Watchman Nee, The (Set 2) Vol. 42: Conferences, Messages, and Fellowship (2) &nbsp; pg 38</div><br></body></html>
