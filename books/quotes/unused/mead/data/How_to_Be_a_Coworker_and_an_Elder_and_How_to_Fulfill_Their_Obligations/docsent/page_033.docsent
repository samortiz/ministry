   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>3.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>As a Co-worker, Never Consider That You Are above the Elders and Never Attempt to Appoint Elders</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>As a co-worker, you should never consider that you are above the elders and never attempt to appoint elders; appointing elders requires maturity in life, being adequately equipped with the truth, and not being too young in physical age.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>According to the holy Scriptures, apostles are co-workers, and it is the apostles who appoint elders.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Therefore, some young co-workers consider themselves apostles above the elders.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>This kind of consideration is wrong and absurd.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>In fact, not everyone who is called a co-worker can appoint elders.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>I know definitely that some co-workers went to certain localities and attempted to appoint elders there but were rejected by the local people.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>It is neither fitting nor proper for one to attempt to appoint elders simply because he has become a co-worker.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>To appoint elders requires maturity in life and adequate equipping in truth.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Brother Nee said that one who is an apostle must be able to decide the meaning of doctrines to determine whether a certain truth is according to the holy Scriptures.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Both to decide the meaning of doctrines and to appoint elders are not simple matters.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>They require a person to be adequately equipped and not to be too young in physical age.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Suppose a young person who is twenty-six years old appoints a person who is fifty-eight years old to be an elder; this is entirely inappropriate.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Therefore, do not think that without you no one can appoint elders.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>It is better not to appoint any elder than to have a young person doing the appointing.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>This is a problem which we need to avoid among us.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>B. Pride 1.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Pride Is an Attribute of Our Fallen Nature by Birth</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>To fulfill the obligations of the co-workers and elders, first, we need to beware of ambition, and second, we need to beware of pride.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Pride is an attribute of our fallen nature by birth.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>God has His attributes and we have ours.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>We are fallen human beings, and as such, the first attribute we have is pride.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Who is not proud?</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Whoever is not proud is good for nothing.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>In the Lord's work, however, we must try our best to guard against pride.</S>
