   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Seeking to Be Blended</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>First, we need to be blended by much and thorough prayer in love.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>This blending is not once for all.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>We have to practice this blending until we see the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>We are not yet thoroughly blended.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In order to be blended, we need to release our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Actually, when I say that we need to be released, this does not only mean to pray.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>When we come together in the vital groups, we should release ourselves by opening up to one another.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>We may have been with one another for years, but we do not really know one another.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Instead, we like to hide ourselves in certain things from the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>I am afraid that not one of us is really open.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>All of us are pretending to be good members of the vital groups.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>We may show up on time and behave ourselves as nice ladies and gentlemen, but this is seclusion.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>We do not want to talk openly with the saints in our vital group because we are secluded.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>To talk openly with the intimate and thorough fellowship in Christ is to be released.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>We do not open up to others, because we are afraid to be known by them.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>As a result, we cannot receive the inner healing from the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>We may be sick of gangrene, but we want to cover and hide our sickness from others.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>We need to realize that the other members of our vital group are our doctors.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>If we open ourselves up in a proper way to the other saints in our group, we will be healed.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>But instead of opening up, everyone is hiding.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Some of us are released, but we are not absolutely released, because we are not used to being open to others.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>We are not open, but closed and secluded.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>When we come together, we may feel that there is not much to do.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>I have said that the group meetings are eighty percent of the church life, and the first item of the group meetings is to come together to fellowship in an intimate, thorough, and spontaneous way.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Maybe a sister would open up by saying, I can t tolerate my children.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Would you tell me how to overcome my temper?</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Why would we not open up to one another in this way?</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Instead of seeing a scenery of intimate fellowship in the vital groups, I see a very behaving scenery.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Everybody behaves.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>No one wants to make a mistake.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Everyone wants to be a good boy and a good girl.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>I have seen this for many years, and I am disgusted with this.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>I want to see a group of seeking saints coming together to gain the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>But where can we see a group of saints practicing the New Testament revelation today?</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Who is denying himself?</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Who is being renewed, transformed, and conformed to the image of the One who has passed through death and resurrection?</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Gradually, we have drifted into practicing a routine church life, but where is the Spirit and where is the leading of the Lord?</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>There is not much leading of the Spirit among us.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Instead, you act by your way, and I act by my way.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>You pray by your way, and I pray by my way.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Who is going to be adjusted?</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Who is going to learn?</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>If we are not inwardly adjusted and transformed, then where is the church life?</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>We have lost the impact in winning the sinners because we are a group of behaving people.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>We do not have the real spirituality as the power from on high, as the impact.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>In nearly everything, we have lost our spiritual impact.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>This is why we need a strict training.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Otherwise, there will be no remedy to our situation.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>We love the recovery, we love the Lord, we love the church, and we are so good.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>We behave ourselves so that we do not offend anyone or make mistakes in the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>But this is not the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>This is a kind of top social club.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>The church life, however, is a group of Jesus-lovers who seek after Him.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>These lovers of Jesus are ones who, after being regenerated, go on to learn the lesson of denying themselves in everything so that they can be renewed.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>They are living, serving, and meeting not by their doing and adjustment but by the Holy Spirit s leading.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>They are being renewed even in the way they deal with their children and in the way they talk to their spouse.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>A brother who is in the process of being renewed might confess, Lord Jesus, I am wrong in my attitude, my inner feeling, my expression, my word, and my tone to my wife.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>All of these things are from the old creation.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Our word might be right, but the tone in which we speak may be wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>The tone is not in the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>The husbands need such a confession to the Lord of their inner feeling, attitude, expression, tone, and word toward their wives.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>We need to confess to the Lord that our speaking to our wives is not in the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>The brothers may be able to pretend before the saints, but they cannot pretend before their wives.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Many times the husbands word to the wives is not spiritual.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>This shows that we need to be transformed in everything.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>The Lord needs a group of people who have been regenerated, renewed, transformed, and conformed to the firstborn Son of God so that they can be built up together.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>This building is the Body and the practical church life.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>I appreciate that the Lord has raised up so many churches on the earth, but the actual situation of the churches with respect to the practice of the God-ordained way is not that much up to the standard.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>This is why we need to raise up the vital groups.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>The remedy is here.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>In our vital groups, we must have much and thorough prayer to get ourselves blended with others in love.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Whenever we come together, we should open up to one another to have an intimate and thorough fellowship.</S>
