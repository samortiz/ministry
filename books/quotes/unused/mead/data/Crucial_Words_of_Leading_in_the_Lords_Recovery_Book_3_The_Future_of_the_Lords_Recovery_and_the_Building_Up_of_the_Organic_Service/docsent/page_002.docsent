   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER ONE BASING THE DIRECTION OF THE WORK</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>ON A CONSIDERATION OF OUR HISTORY 1</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>By the Lord s mercy, the Lord s recovery has spread from the Chinese-speaking world, that is, from the Chinese language, to many other languages.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The Lord s recovery has reached the five continents of the world.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>In this message we will consider the history of the Lord s recovery in Taiwan during the past thirty-five years, beginning from 1949.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Before 1948 the Lord s recovery was not fully established in Taiwan; hence, that time should not be considered as the initial stage.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>It should be considered as before the initial stage.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>THE INITIAL STAGE OF</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>THE LORD S RECOVERY IN TAIWAN</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The initial stage of the Lord s recovery in Taiwan began in 1949.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Before 1949 local churches were not clearly established in Taiwan, because no elders were appointed prior to this time.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Before 1949 there were some small churches, or rather, there were meetings in various places in Taiwan, but the responsible ones who had been spontaneously produced had not been appointed as elders.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The first elders were appointed in the church in Taipei.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>In the summer of 1949 the ministry in the Lord s recovery began the work in Taiwan with a conference.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>After this the Lord s recovery in Taiwan began to take shape; that was more than thirty-five years ago, a third of a century.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>This period, which cannot be considered short, is our history.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>We must look back and consider those early years in order to learn and to receive practical light instead of being idealistic.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>I came to Taiwan in 1949.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Before then I had served in more than two churches, and by the Lord s grace, my service was successful.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The first church was the church in Chefoo.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The success of the church in Chefoo was witnessed by many brothers.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>After the victory in the Sino-Japanese War in 1945, I met with Brother Nee and fellowshipped concerning what I had practiced in Chefoo, that is, concerning the way I had led the church.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Brother Nee encouraged me to be diligent to continue my practice in the other churches.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Hence, I was bold to lead the church in Shanghai, and the result was obvious to all.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>If it had not been for the change in the political situation, the church in Shanghai would have been a great success.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Despite the success that we had in Chefoo and Shanghai, after coming to Taiwan, we felt that some of the things that we had practiced were unnecessary.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>We therefore dropped the unnecessary items.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>As a result, the work in Taiwan was a new beginning.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>We began with about five hundred saints, and by 1956 we had thirty thousand saints.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>When we invited Brother T. Austin-Sparks in 1957, we had more than fifty thousand saints.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>But his visit gave rise to a storm among us, and after that storm, all that we had done from 1949 to 1957 was diluted.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>THE COMPREHENSIVE LEADING AND THE PRACTICE</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>OF MEETING IN DISTRICTS AND GROUPS</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>There were several characteristics of the work that we began in Taiwan.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>One feature was to hold trainings that were comprehensive in nature.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The best training was in 1953; it was a training on truth, life, the church, and the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The aspect of the training that was on the church included service.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Those who attended the trainings know that that particular training was comprehensive.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>As a result, the leading in the church was also comprehensive.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>We did not overemphasize any point; rather, we paid equal attention to truth, life, the church, and the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>These trainings were very successful, and our numbers in the churches increased greatly.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>As our numbers increased, we began meeting in separate meeting halls, and because our numbers continued to increase, the meeting halls were divided into districts.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>At that time we did not use the term group.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Even though Brother Nee used the term districts, based on Acts 2:46, which says that the believers met from house to house, he did not have the way to practice it.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The turmoil in the church in Shanghai prevented him from putting this into practice.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>After the turmoil the church stopped meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>That was in 1942.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>That same year the church in Chefoo had a great revival.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>The church in Chefoo put the matter of meeting in districts fully into practice, but we did not have the practice of meeting in smaller groups.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>During that time our numbers increased but not such that we needed to divide into smaller groups.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>When we came to Taiwan, we did not meet only in halls, which were equivalent to what Brother Nee called districts.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>We divided every hall into smaller groups, which we called districts.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Due to the constant increase in our numbers, we had to consider how to take care of the new believers who were being added to us.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>The Lord reminded us of what He had done in the wilderness when He distributed the loaves He had the people sit down in groups Mark 6:39-40 .</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Based on this principle, we began to further divide the districts into groups, and we met in halls, districts, and groups.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>In those seven years our numbers increased from five hundred to fifty thousand; that was a hundredfold increase.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Once we had a baptism meeting for newly saved ones that began at six o clock on Saturday evening.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Even though we were baptizing people in three different meeting halls, we could not finish all the baptisms that night, so we continued baptizing people on the Lord s Day morning.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>On that occasion we baptized more than seven hundred people.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>If we had continued meeting in halls, districts, and groups, I do not know how many people we would have gained.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Five hundred saints increased to fifty thousand within seven years; that is more than a hundredfold increase.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>From 1957 until today we have passed through four seven-year periods.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>In the beginning of the four seven-year periods, we met in halls, districts, and groups; however, after Brother Sparks visited us, we were distracted in our practice.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>If we had not changed our direction, we could have gained at least two hundred thousand in the following seven-year periods.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>A conservative estimate is that we would have a total of two hundred fifty thousand saints.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>We increased from five hundred saints to fifty thousand saints.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>If we use this fifty thousand increase as the base, in another seven years we should have gained another fifty thousand.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>We believe this would have been possible.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>We had some definite experiences in mainland China, and we knew which experiences were useful for the building of the church and which were not.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Hence, after the Lord brought us to Taiwan, we continued the useful practices and dropped the practices that were not useful.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Not only so, we added a new practice of dividing into groups.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Before 1952 only one sister and I were serving full time.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>In 1952 approximately one hundred brothers and sisters joined us to serve full time.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>After the comprehensive training in 1953, the one hundred full-timers went to carry out their function in the different halls, districts, and groups.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>This is the way that our numbers increased to fifty thousand in just a few years.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>We invited Brother T. Austin-Sparks because we wanted to receive spiritual help; however, as a result of his visit, our practice was diluted.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>After 1958 we stopped paying attention to the district meetings, and we did not establish any more district meetings or group meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>This practice was washed away during that storm.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>The dissenting ones said that we did not have a vision and that the leading co-workers were finished.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>This was in 1959.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>Everyone was influenced by this speaking, and many were carried away to speak of a vision and of spirituality.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>As a result, our initial practice was set aside, and we returned to the way of Christianity in which we gathered the brothers and sisters either for the Lord s Day meeting or to preach the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>No one paid attention to meeting in districts or groups.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>The leading we had in our first seven years was blown completely away like a puff of smoke.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>Today, nearly twenty-eight years after 1957, our numbers are less than what they were then.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>We have decreased, not increased.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>During these past twenty-eight years some brothers and sisters have passed away, some have become cold, others have backslidden, still others have gone abroad, and there are those with whom we have lost contact.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>The number of new ones is equal only to the number of brothers and sisters who were lost.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>We now know the reason for this: we abandoned the practice that we had during our first seven years in Taiwan, and we returned to the traditional way of Christianity, which is to meet to preach the gospel and to listen to messages.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>It is an undeniable fact that the way of meeting in halls, districts, and groups is beneficial to the increase of numbers in the church.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>However, for the past thirty years we have abandoned this practice; hence, our numbers have not increased.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>This has been a huge loss to us.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>Moreover, we have not seen any accomplishment in spirituality or in life.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>We do not pursue the truth, and we fall short in spirituality and in the growth in life.</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>This is not true only of Taiwan; most of the brothers and sisters in the churches in Southeast Asia and Hong Kong are not clear about the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>Hence, we can say that we are doing an average job in the gospel, we are not strong in the church life, we have no goal concerning the truth, and we have no accomplishments in spirituality and in life.</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>On the contrary, we have abandoned our strong point, our special skill, which is the practice of meeting in halls, districts, and groups.</S>
   <S PAR='98' RSNT='1' SNO='98'>Therefore, our numbers have been reduced.</S>
   <S PAR='99' RSNT='1' SNO='99'>We can say that our loss is greater than our gain.</S>
   <S PAR='100' RSNT='1' SNO='100'>NEEDING TO PAY ATTENTION TO NUMBERS</S>
   <S PAR='101' RSNT='1' SNO='101'>We must learn the lesson of paying attention to the truth, to life, to the church life, and to the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='102' RSNT='1' SNO='102'>We must also pay attention to the number of saints in the meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='103' RSNT='1' SNO='103'>If a church has no quantity, how can it have quality?</S>
   <S PAR='104' RSNT='1' SNO='104'>For this reason, we have not produced many elders or co-workers over the past twenty-seven years.</S>
   <S PAR='105' RSNT='1' SNO='105'>If, instead of neglecting our early practice, we had continued to the present, I believe that we would have produced many elders and full-time serving ones, and our numbers would have increased greatly.</S>
   <S PAR='106' RSNT='1' SNO='106'>Moreover, although we cannot say with assurance that our condition in life would be better than it is today, we believe that it would not be worse.</S>
   <S PAR='107' RSNT='1' SNO='107'>We can also say that concerning the truth, our condition would not be worse than it is today; of course, we do not dare say that it would be better.</S>
   <S PAR='108' RSNT='1' SNO='108'>The same applies to the church life, we dare not say that our condition would be better than it is today, but at least it would not be worse.</S>
   <S PAR='109' RSNT='1' SNO='109'>However, we can say with certainty that we have decreased in numbers.</S>
   <S PAR='110' RSNT='1' SNO='110'>It would be a great thing to have more than three hundred thousand brothers and sisters in Taiwan.</S>
   <S PAR='111' RSNT='1' SNO='111'>This would be a huge asset that would enable us to do many things.</S>
   <S PAR='112' RSNT='1' SNO='112'>We are studying our past history solely with the view of analyzing it in order to learn some lessons from it.</S>
   <S PAR='113' RSNT='1' SNO='113'>From now on our work must pay attention to numbers, and we must give people the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='114' RSNT='1' SNO='114'>We must train the believers who are added to us in the truth; we must also help them grow in life.</S>
   <S PAR='115' RSNT='1' SNO='115'>Our meeting life, that is our church life, must be strengthened and enriched, and we must pay attention to the gospel to take care of our numbers.</S>
   <S PAR='116' RSNT='1' SNO='116'>As soon as we gain people through the gospel, we must bring them to the meetings in the districts and in the groups.</S>
   <S PAR='117' RSNT='1' SNO='117'>We must learn these things and pay close attention to them.</S>
