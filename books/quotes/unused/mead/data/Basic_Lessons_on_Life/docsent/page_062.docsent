   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>II.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>DISPENSED INTO OUR SPIRIT</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Such a divine life is first dispensed into our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Romans 8:10 says that since Christ is in us, our spirit is life.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>This is because Christ Himself is this life, and this life is in our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Therefore, our spirit is life.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>This is a very strong point.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Verse 10 does not say that since Christ is in us, the life is in us.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Instead, it says that our spirit is life.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Today our regenerated spirit is life.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The contrast presented in verse 10 is very interesting.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>It says if Christ is in you, your body is dead.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>It does not say your body is death.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The opposite of being dead is being living.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Based upon this, it would seem that verse 10 should say our body is dead and our spirit is living.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>But here Paul made the contrast different.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>He said our body is dead and our spirit is life.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Since Christ is in our spirit, our spirit is not only living but also life.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>We may read Romans 8:10, which says that our spirit is life, but we understand that either life is in our spirit or that our spirit is living.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>We read this verse in one way but we realize it subconsciously in another way, in a natural way.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>We do not realize that our fallen spirit, after being regenerated with Christ, becomes life.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>It is not only living and does not only have life; it is life itself.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Paul did not use all these words and phrases in a light way.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>He wrote Romans just as an attorney would write a legal document.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>In Romans 8 every word, every phrase, every clause, and every sentence should have been thoroughly considered by Paul.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Paul was very careful about the experience of life and about the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>All the things in Romans 8 are greatly involved with life and truth.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Paul said that since Christ is in us, our spirit is life.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Now that we have been saved, we have a part of our being that is life itself.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>A. Christ in You</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>We have to stress strongly that Christ is in us.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Life is not good behavior.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Life is Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Any kind of virtue is not life, regardless of how high or how excellent that virtue is.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Life is a person.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Life is Christ Himself, and Christ is in us.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>We have to stress this strongly.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>We can never overly stress this one thing "Christ in you."</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>We are short of utterance to stress this one thing.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>In the whole universe nothing is greater than Christ being in us.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Christ being in us is the greatest wonder, the wonder of wonders, in the whole universe.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>We need to impress the saints with who Christ is.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>He is both God and man, having both divinity and humanity.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>We have to stress again and again all the wonderful riches of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Such a One is now in us.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>We should not take Romans 8 for granted.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>It is not a small thing that Romans 8 was written and that this chapter is in the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Without Romans 8, what would we do as Christians?</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>We must stress the wonder of Christ being in us to impress ourselves and impress the saints.</S>
