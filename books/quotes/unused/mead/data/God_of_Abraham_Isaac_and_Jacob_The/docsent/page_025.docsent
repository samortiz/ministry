   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE FIRST TEST THE BIRTH OF ISHMAEL</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>It is not a simple thing to usher in Isaac.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Abraham had to be tested.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In order for us to be God's vessel, bring in Christ, and express His authority, there must be many tests.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>After Genesis 15, the Bible shows us that Abraham was tested three times concerning his son just as he was tested three times concerning the land of Canaan.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Two of these tests occurred before the birth of his son, and one occurred after his birth.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>All three tests prepared Abraham for the ushering in of Isaac.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>In other words, the church must be tested and prepared before it can bring back the glorious Christ to the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Chapter fifteen tells us that Abraham said to the Lord, "God, what wilt thou give me, seeing I go childless, and the steward of my house is this Eliezer of Damascus?"</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>God said, "He that shall come forth out of thine own bowels shall be thine heir."</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Abraham believed in God, and God counted it to him for righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The promise of begetting a son was there, and the faith was there.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>However, day after day, there was no son.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Month after month, there was no son, and year after year, there was no son.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>This shows us that faith has to be tested.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Abraham's faith grew step by step.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Genesis 16:1 says, "Now Sarai, Abram's wife, bare him no children."</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>He was now eighty-five years old.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>His wife Sarah could not bare him a son.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>What should he do?</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>At that juncture, his wife said to him, "Behold now, the Lord hath restrained me from bearing: I pray thee, go in unto my maid; it may be that I may obtain children by her" v. 2 . What did Abraham do? "Abram hearkened to the voice of Sarai.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>And Sarai, Abram's wife, took Hagar her maid the Egyptian..and gave her to her husband" vv.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>2-3 .</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The Bible specifically says that "Abram had dwelt ten years in the land of Canaan" v. 3 . When Abraham first arrived in Canaan, God promised, "Unto thy seed will I give this land" 12:7 . Just before these events God promised him again, "He that shall come forth out of thine own bowels shall be thine heir." By the time he was eighty-five years old, however, he still had no son.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>He became anxious.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>In order to have a son, he went in unto Hagar as his concubine.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Hagar became pregnant and brought forth Ishmael.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The Bible specifically says, "And Abram was fourscore and six years old, when Hagar bare Ishmael to Abram" 16:16 .</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>This is a great matter.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>God ordained that Abraham would beget a son, but His ordination was for Abraham to beget a son through Sarah and that he would beget him at the age of one hundred.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>However, Abraham shortened the time by fourteen years with his own effort.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Moreover, the son was begotten through Hagar.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>This was the first test that Abraham faced concerning his son.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>He believed in God's word.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>He believed that God would give him a son.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Yet he did not realize that believing meant to stop his own activities and wait on God's work!</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>As soon as we believe, we should stop our own work.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Hebrews 4:10 says, "For he who has entered into His rest has himself also rested from his works, as God did from His own."</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>When we believe, we should not make haste.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Whenever we believe, we should be at rest.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Abraham believed in God, yet he did not learn his lesson.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>He did not see that if he had believed, he should have waited and should not have done anything by himself.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>He thought that in order to believe, he should help God and do something by himself.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Consequently, he accepted his wife's word, took Hagar to be his concubine, and bore Ishmael.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Abraham gave God a hand!</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>He thought that since God had promised a son, he would fulfill God's will by doing this!</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>He did not do anything else.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>All he did was act on his own concerning something that God had promised him.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>But this one act brought about his failure!</S>
