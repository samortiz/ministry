<h1 class="msg">CHAPTER ONE HUNDRED TWENTY-THREE</h1><h1 class="title">GOD'S INHERITANCE&mdash;<br />THE RICHES OF CHRIST</h1><h1 class="scripture">Place: Unrecorded<br />Scripture Reading: Gal. 2:20; 3:26&mdash;4:1a, 6-7, 28, 31; 5:1; John 15:4a; Rom. 6:5-7, 11; Eph. 2:4-6; Phil. 1:21a; 1 Cor. 1:30</h1><p>Prayer: Lord, under Your light we feel ashamed, because even though we are surrounded by riches, we are living in poverty. Although there is living water all around, we are still thirsty. Show us the riches that are found in Christ, and that we are made to partake of these riches through the grace of God. It is not our faith, but Your selection that counts. It is not of our will, our consecration, or our obedience, but fully Your free provision, grace, and mercy. You are the One who sowed, and You are the One who gathers. Lord, open our eyes to see the riches of Christ. In the name of the Lord, amen.</p><h2 class="head1">ISAAC AND THE CHURCH</h2><p>The book of Galatians shows us that the principle of the believer's living is being an Isaac, one who inherits. Isaac entered into glory, and Christians will also enter into glory. Just as Isaac was begotten through promise, Christians are also children through promise, and just as Isaac became an heir, Christians are also made heirs of God.</p><p>Romans speaks of sinners receiving grace, whereas Galatians speaks of sinners not remaining in the same place but going on in grace after receiving grace. Romans speaks of initial grace, while Galatians speaks of ongoing and sustaining grace. The apostle said that having begun by the Spirit, one should not be perfected by the flesh (3:3). The matter is not what we are going to do or what we are going to give to God. Grace is not our striving to be good or changing for the better. Grace is our looking to the Lord's mercy. It is not a matter of what we should do but a matter of looking to His grace. Isaac was an heir, not an initiator. The same is true with Christians today.</p><h2 class="head1">GOD'S INHERITANCE&mdash;THE WORK OF CHRIST</h2><p>The New Testament shows us two parts in the work of Christ. First, we are in Christ, and second, Christ is in us. One is a union in Christ, and the other is a union in us. Historically, first we are in Christ and then Christ is in us. This is why the Lord said in John, "He who abides in Me and I in him..." (15:5). Our abiding in Christ includes all the facts related to our being in Christ, while Christ's abiding in us is related to the life of Christ. When a Christian abides in Christ, he touches all the facts related to being in Christ. When Christ abides in a Christian, he touches Christ as his life. Being in Christ involves the inheritance of all that Christ has accomplished in the past. Christ's being in us involves our receiving of all that Christ is and has today. When we are in Christ, everything that Christ has accomplished from the past to the present becomes our enjoyment. When Christ is in us, everything that Christ will accomplish between now and the future becomes ours.</p><h2 class="head1">CHRISTIANS IN CHRIST</h2><p>For a Christian to be in Christ means that God has put him in a new position; he now has a new beginning. "The Christian in Christ" is something that spans from the past to the present; whereas, "Christ in the Christian" is something that spans from today to the future. The former was accomplished once for all in Christ, and the latter continues from here until eternity. The Bible says, "But of Him you are in Christ Jesus" (1 Cor. 1:30). This means that God has delivered us out of the old man, the self, the world, and Satan into Christ.</p><p>Romans 1 through 4 tells us that man is wrong in his conduct, while Romans 5 through 8 tells us that man is wrong in himself. A man's conduct is wrong because his person is wrong. This is why man has to die. If we are crucified with Christ, we believe that we will live and ascend with Christ. By the law of the Spirit of life, we will live in the spirit. Only crucifixion, resurrection, and ascension can terminate the old things. But how can we be crucified, raised, and ascended? We do not have to die, resurrect, or ascend by ourselves. This is the work of God. He has joined us to Christ. "But of Him you are in Christ Jesus." This is one of the most precious verses in the Bible. We have to realize how important this is.</p><p>Suppose you put a banknote in the hymnal. If the hymnal is thrown into the fire, the banknote will be burned as well. If you mail the hymnal to England, the banknote will go to England as well, because the banknote has been joined to the hymnal. The same principle applies in our crucifixion, resurrection, and ascension with the Lord. Our natural self, whether good or evil, meek or rash, patient or impatient is crucified in Christ; it is terminated. Now we are resurrected in Him and in the new creation. Therefore, we do not need to look at what we were or are outside of Christ.</p>
