<h1 class="title">The Age of Restoration<br />
and<br />
Christ as the Shoot of Jehovah<br />
and the Fruit of the Earth</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Isa. 4:2-6; 2:2-5</h1>
<ol class="upper-roman">
<li><em>In that day</em> in Isaiah 4:2 refers to the coming restoration of the nation of Israel&mdash;Matt. 17:11; 19:28; Acts 1:6; 3:21; 15:16:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>Basically, between eternity past and eternity future, there are three ages&mdash;the age of the old creation, the age of the new creation, and the age of restoration:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>From God&rsquo;s creation of the heavens and the earth in Genesis 1:1 to the beginning of the age of grace is the age of the old creation.</li>
		<li>The age of grace is the age of the new creation; the work of God in the age of grace is to produce the new creation&mdash;John 1:16-17; 2 Cor. 5:17; Gal. 6:15.</li>
		<li>The coming age will be the age of restoration&mdash;Matt. 19:28; Acts 3:21:
			<ol class="lower-alpha">
			<li>In the coming age God will neither create nor produce the new creation; rather, He will do the work of restoring the old, fallen creation&mdash;Rom. 8:20-22.</li>
			<li>A restoration will be brought to all things; in this restoration death will be limited, and there will be abundant life and much praise and rejoicing&mdash;Isa. 65:18-25.</li>
			<li>After the age of restoration, the entire universe will be changed from the old to the new; then there will be the new heaven and the new earth with the New Jerusalem&mdash;v. 17; 66:22; Rev. 21:1-2.</li>
			</ol></li>
		<li>Isaiah prophesied concerning the age of restoration (Isa. 2:2-5; 11:1-10; 61:4-9); chapter 35 is a marvelous picture of restoration.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>God&rsquo;s judgment on the haughty nations ushers in the God-man, Christ (4:2, 5-6), issuing in the restoration of the nation of Israel (vv. 3-6; 2:2-5), which brings in the kingdom and consummates in the new heaven and new earth (65:17).</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>The all-inclusive Christ is the center and the circumference, the centrality and the universality, of God&rsquo;s eternal economy&mdash;Col. 1:15-18:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>As the embodiment of the Triune God, Christ is the reality of every positive thing in the universe&mdash;2:16-17.</li>
	<li>God&rsquo;s intention in His economy is that Christ be everything; therefore, it is crucial for us to see that God wants nothing but Christ and that in the eyes of God nothing counts except Christ&mdash;vv. 16-17; 3:4, 10-11.</li>
	<li>Because Christ is the centrality and universality of God&rsquo;s move, the book of Isaiah reveals many aspects of Christ for the fulfillment of God&rsquo;s economy&mdash;6:1-8; 22:22; 53:5, 10b-12; 54:5; 55:4-5.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>In 4:2 there is a pair of aspects of Christ&mdash;the Shoot of Jehovah and the Fruit of the earth; <em>the Shoot</em> is in comparison to <em>the Fruit,</em> and <em>Jehovah</em> is in comparison to <em>the earth:</em>
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>God is eternal, and man came from the earth; <em>the Fruit of the earth</em> refers to a man made from dust&mdash;Gen. 2:7.</li>
	<li>Christ as God came from eternity, but as man He came from the earth, so He is the Shoot of Jehovah and also the Fruit of the earth.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li><em>The Shoot of Jehovah</em> refers to Christ&rsquo;s deity, showing His divine nature&mdash;Isa. 4:2a; John 1:1; 20:28; Rom. 9:5:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>The Shoot of Jehovah typifies not only Christ&rsquo;s divinity but also the sprouting and development of Christ&rsquo;s divinity through the incarnation of God&mdash;John 1:1, 14; Heb. 1:1-3; 2:14.</li>
	<li>The Shoot of Jehovah is a new development of Jehovah God for the Triune God to branch Himself out for His increase and spreading through His incarnation&mdash;Isa. 7:14; Matt. 1:22-23.</li>
	<li>In His incarnation Christ as the Shoot of Jehovah branched Himself out in His divinity from the territory of divinity into the territory of humanity&mdash;John 1:1, 14.</li>
	<li>In His incarnation Christ came from eternity into time; from ancient times, from the days of eternity, the Triune God was preparing to come forth out of eternity into time, to come with His divinity into humanity&mdash;Micah 5:2.</li>
	<li>The sprouting and development of God in Christ as the Shoot of Jehovah are for the expression of all the riches of divinity in Christ&rsquo;s humanity, that is, for the rich attributes of divinity to be developed into the virtues of Christ, the God-man, in His humanity&mdash;Eph. 3:8.</li>
	<li>The incarnated God, in His divinity, will be the beauty and glory of God&rsquo;s chosen people in the day of restoration&mdash;Isa. 4:2a:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>Our God with His divine nature is our beauty and our glory&mdash;60:1, 9, 13.</li>
		<li>Because Christ lives in us, we are partakers of the divine nature; in this sense, we are not only human but also divine, and the divine nature is our beauty and our glory&mdash;Gal. 2:20; 2 Pet. 1:4.</li>
		</ol></li>
	</ol></li>
<li><em>The Fruit of the earth</em> refers to Christ&rsquo;s humanity with His human nature&mdash;Isa. 4:2b; Luke 1:42:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>As the Fruit of the earth, Christ was born a man of human blood and flesh from the earth; the earth was the source of Christ&rsquo;s humanity, just as eternity was the source of His divinity&mdash;Heb. 2:14.</li>
	<li>Christ as the Fruit of the earth is for the multiplication and reproduction of the divine life in humanity&mdash;John 12:24:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>God in Himself, in His divinity, has no way to be multiplied.</li>
		<li>For His multiplication and reproduction, He needs humanity; humanity is the soil, the earth, for the Triune God to be multiplied and reproduced&mdash;20:17; Rom. 8:29; Heb. 2:10.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>As the Fruit of the earth, Christ, in His humanity, which expresses His divine beauty and glory, will be the excellence and splendor of God&rsquo;s chosen people in the day of restoration&mdash;Isa. 4:2b:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>Even today in the age of grace, we should live a life that expresses Christ&rsquo;s beauty and glory in a divine way and that expresses Christ&rsquo;s excellence and splendor in a human way&mdash;1 Cor. 10:31; Phil. 1:11, 20.</li>
		<li>A proper Christian is both divine and human, having the divine beauty and glory of Jesus and the human excellence and splendor of Jesus&mdash;vv. 8-9; 1 Pet. 2:12.</li>
		</ol></li>
	</ol></li>
<li>In Isaiah 4:5-6 there is a second pair of aspects of Christ&mdash;a covering canopy of glory and an overshadowing tabernacle of grace:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>The second pair is the issue of the first pair and is produced by the first pair:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>Because Christ is the Shoot for God&rsquo;s new development and the Fruit for God&rsquo;s reproduction, He has the divine beauty and glory with the human excellence and splendor; therefore, He can be a canopy covering us and a tabernacle overshadowing us&mdash;vv. 2, 5-6.</li>
		<li>Our Jesus is the God-man, the One who is both divine and human; as the God-man in His divinity and humanity, He, the Shoot of Jehovah and the Fruit of the earth, is a covering canopy of the divine glory and an overshadowing tabernacle of grace in humanity.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>The God-man, Christ, is a canopy, which is the covering glory of Christ in His divinity that covers all the interests of Jehovah God on earth&mdash;v. 5.</li>
	<li>The overshadowing tabernacle is the God-man, Christ, in His humanity with His grace, as illustrated in 2 Corinthians 12:9; this is Christ as our overshadowing protection and defense&mdash;Isa. 4:6; John 1:14.</li>
	</ol></li>
