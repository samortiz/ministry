   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE ANOINTING OINTMENT</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>THE COMPOUND SPIRIT FOR ANOINTING</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The Spirit is also symbolized by the anointing ointment, which is the compound Spirit for anointing Exo 30:25-26; 1 John 2:20, 27; 2 Cor 1:21 .</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The difference between the oil and the ointment is that the ointment is a compound.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>In order to make an ointment, something of liquid is needed as a base.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Then some elements are added into the liquid and compounded together.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The Spirit that is working upon us and within us is not only an oil but also an ointment.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The four elements in the compound ointment in Exodus 30 are myrrh, cinnamon, calamus, and cassia.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>These four elements are mingled together with olive oil.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>They are compounded together into one ointment.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Many Christians may know the Holy Spirit, but they do not have the realization of the compound Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Before the incarnation of God, the Spirit of God had not been compounded with the elements of the Triune God s processes.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>But after God s incarnation and through Christ s crucifixion and resurrection, the Spirit of God became a compound Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The element of the Spirit of God before God s incarnation was divinity, which is God Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Through God s incarnation, humanity was added to the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Through Christ s crucifixion, the all-inclusive death of Christ was added into the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Through His resurrection, the element of resurrection with its power was added into the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Now in the Spirit are divinity plus humanity plus death plus resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>All of these elements have been compounded together into an anointing ointment, which is the compound Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>THE WIND</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The Spirit is also symbolized by the wind Ezek. l:4a; 37:9a; John 3:8; Acts 2:2 .</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The Hebrew word ruach can be translated spirit, wind, or breath.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>In Ezekiel 37, ruach is translated in these three ways.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Ezekiel l:4a says that a strong wind came out of the north.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>According to the Psalms, God dwells in the north Psa 48:2 .</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>When people go north, they say that they are going up, and when they go south, they say that they are going down.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>God is up, and Satan is down.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>This is the principle of the universe.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>A strong wind coming from the north means that the strong Spirit comes from the very God.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>In Ezekiel 1:4 there are also the cloud, the fire, and the brightness, which is the light.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The wind brought in the cloud, and in the cloud is the fire.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Along with the fire is the brightness, which is the light.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The wind, the cloud, the fire, and the light all refer to the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>In the New Testament, the Spirit is also symbolized by the wind.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>John 3:8 says, The wind blows where it wills, and you hear the sound of it, but you do not know where it comes from and where it is going; so is everyone who is born of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The Greek word pneuma is the word for wind and for spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Whether it means the wind or the spirit depends upon the context.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The context here says that it blows and the sound of it can be heard.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>This indicates that it is the wind.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The Spirit as the blowing wind brings God into us for our regeneration.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>One of our co-workers was saved by the blowing of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Before he was saved, he was a member of the Nationalist party.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>At that time they considered that Christianity was a tool of imperialism.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Thus, this brother despised Christianity to the uttermost.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>He considered it as a foreign religion used by the imperialists.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>One day as he was sightseeing, he went to a certain mountain where there was an idol temple.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>When he entered this idol temple, to his surprise he saw a big Bible that was opened to Psalm 1.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>When he read Psalm 1, he was surprised at and inspired with what he read.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>He continued to read the Bible in this idol temple, and eventually he was convicted of his sins, realizing that he was a sinner before God.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>He wept and rolled on the ground repenting.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>The Spirit was a strong wind that day to get him regenerated.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>He was saved by the Lord, he withdrew from the Nationalist party, and he eventually became one of our co-workers.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>His regeneration was by the wind.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Others among us were not saved by such a strong wind of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>The Spirit may have come to us as a gentle breeze.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Our confession may have been very gentle.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>We could have simply prayed in this way: Jesus, I love You.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>I am a sinner.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>I believe in You, and I take You.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Thank You, Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Many of us were regenerated in a gentle way.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Others have been regenerated in a strong and even wild way.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>When they were regenerated, they may have jumped, shouted, danced, or cried.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>The Spirit as the wind in John 3:8 is mentioned in relation to those who are regenerated, who are born of the Spirit.</S>
