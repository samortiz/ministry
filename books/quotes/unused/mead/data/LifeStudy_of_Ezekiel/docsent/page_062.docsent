   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>LIFE-STUDY OF EZEKIEL MESSAGE FIFTEEN GOD S JUDGMENT UPON THE NATIONS Scripture Reading: Ezek.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>25:2-3, 7-8, 12-16; 26:2, 4; 28:21-22, 24, 26; 29:3, 6-7, 16; 30:6, 10; 31:16, 18</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In this message we come to the matter of God s judgment upon the nations.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>This is covered in chapters twenty-five through thirty-two.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>ISRAEL BEING THE CENTER OF GOD S ECONOMY AMONG THE HUMAN RACE ON EARTH</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>According to Genesis 11 rebellious mankind sought to do something to build the tower and city of Babel in order to concentrate themselves and make a name for themselves.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>However, the Lord came down to exercise His judgment over these rebellious people.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Under the Lord s judgment, Babel became a center not for gathering but for scattering, and the human race was scattered from Babel as the center.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Deuteronomy 32:8 says, When the Most High divided to the nations their inheritance, / when he separated the sons of Adam, / he set the bounds of the people / according to the number of the children of Israel.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Here we see that God set up the boundaries of all the nations according to the number of the people of Israel.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>This indicates that in His economy on earth among the human race, God made Israel the center.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Israel is the center of the earth s population.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>To be sure, God did this with a purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>If we look at a map, we will see that Palestine, the good land where God put Israel, is the real center of the inhabited earth.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Palestine is situated at the center of the three continents of Europe, Asia, and Africa, the continents where the human race began.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Later, the human population spread to America and also to Australia.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The central location of the land of Israel provided a good opportunity for the spreading of the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>We know from history that the preaching of the gospel began in Jerusalem and then spread to Europe, Egypt, and Asia.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Eventually, the preaching of the gospel spread to America and Australia.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>This was God s purpose in putting His people at the center of the human population.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Furthermore, according to the prophecy concerning the coming age, the millennium, the people of Israel will be the priests on this earth teaching all the nations to worship God Isa 61:6; 2:3 .</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>These prophecies also show us that Palestine is the center of the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>However, at the time of Ezekiel, the people of Israel became degraded and unsuitable for God s purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Their degraded situation forced God to exercise His judgment upon them and temporarily to give up Palestine as His center.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>God turned to Babel again and raised up King Nebuchadnezzar, who built the great empire of Babylon.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The Babylonian empire then became God s center for executing His judgment.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Through the empire of Babylon under King Nebuchadnezzar, God executed His judgment not only upon His people Israel but also over the nations.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>SEVEN REPRESENTATIVE NATIONS</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Chapters twenty-five through thirty-two of Ezekiel speak of seven nations that surrounded the nation of Israel.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Actually, there were more nations around Israel, but the record mentions only seven.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>This is similar to the mentioning of the seven churches in Asia in Revelation 1 3.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>When the Lord spoke of the churches in Asia, He selected seven 1:11 .</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>This does not mean that there were only seven churches in Asia but that the Lord selected seven representative churches.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The principle is the same in the book of Ezekiel.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>There were more than seven nations surrounding Israel, but the Lord selected seven nations as representatives of all the nations.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>These seven nations were Ammon, Moab, Edom, Philistia, Tyrus, Zidon, and Egypt.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Divided into Three Groups</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>These seven nations are divided into three groups.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The first four nations Ammon, Moab, Edom, and Philistia form the first group; Tyrus and Zidon make up the second group; and Egypt stands alone.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>We know that these nations are divided into these three groups because Ezekiel saw three separate visions at three different times concerning these groups.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>His first vision covers the first four nations; his second vision, Tyrus and Zidon; and his third vision, Egypt.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Moreover, the first two, Ammon and Moab, fit together as a pair; the third and fourth, Edom and Philistia, stand as a pair; and the fifth and sixth, Tyrus and Zidon, are a pair.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Only Egypt is alone.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Applicable to Today s Situation</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The Old Testament is not only a record of history but a record that can be applied to the church today.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>We need to keep this in mind as we read the book of Ezekiel and be impressed with the fact that Ezekiel was not written merely for the sake of history.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Rather, the record in this book is applicable to today s situation.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Therefore, we need to know the spiritual application of all these seven representative nations.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Previously we pointed out that the spiritual application of the noisome beasts is that some evil people could be in the church as wolves Ezek.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>14:21; Acts 20:29 .</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Here we have the spiritual application of Ezekiel s word concerning the beasts.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Now we need to see the spiritual application of the seven nations.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Otherwise, we may read these chapters merely as prophecies which have been fulfilled in history.</S>
