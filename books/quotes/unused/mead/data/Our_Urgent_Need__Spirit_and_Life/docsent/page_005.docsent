   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER TWO NOT GOOD OR EVIL BUT LIFE Scripture Reading: John 4:10-14, 20-21, 23-24; 8:3-9; 9:1-3; 11:20-27</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The book of John stresses our need of the Spirit, who is the reality of the divine life.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In this chapter we will examine four cases in this Gospel that illustrate the principle of life versus good and evil.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Within the fallen race of man there is always the question: "Is this good or evil, right or wrong, yes or no?"</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>When the Lord Jesus was on the earth, people always brought questions concerning good and evil, right and wrong, and yes and no to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>THE WORSHIP OF GOD IN SPIRIT</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>In John 4 is the case of a sinful woman despised by society.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>In her talk with the Lord, He pointed out to her that she needed the living water v. 10 . The living water is the Triune God, even the Son of God, the very Christ who became the life-giving Spirit 1 Cor 15:45b . This was all that the woman needed.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>When she asked Him for this water, Jesus said to her, "Go, call your husband and come here" John 4:16 .</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The Lord was wise and very gracious.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>He was not like us.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Many times when we preach the gospel, we do not have much wisdom.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>When we preach the gospel of the Lord as the living water and the sinner replies that he wants it, we may say, "What about your sin?</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Don't you know you are a sinner?"</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>This may offend people, and this offense will cause them to be closed.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The Lord Jesus was wise.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>He did not use the word sin; He used the word husband instead.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>It is as if He said, "Go call your husband.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>I do not want to talk to you about sin.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>I want to talk to you about your husband.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>You have a problem concerning your husband."</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>That woman was deeply touched.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The matter of her husband was the real issue with her.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>This matter was the center of her sinfulness.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>At this point the woman lied to the Lord Jesus by speaking the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>She said, "I don't have a husband" v. 17 . Whether this was a lie or the truth depends on your interpretation.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The Lord did not condemn her but said, "You have well said, I don't have a husband; for you have had five husbands, and the one you now have is not your husband; this you said truly" vv.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>17-18 .</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>She did not confess her sins, but the Lord Jesus made a thorough confession of her sins for her.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Then the woman became clever and turned the question concerning her husband to a religious question concerning the worship of God.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>She said, "Our fathers worshipped in this mountain, and you say that in Jerusalem is the place where men must worship" v. 20 . Her question was related to whether one should worship in that mountain or in Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>It was a question of yes or no, right or wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The Lord Jesus did not answer yes or no, right or wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>He said, "Woman, believe Me, an hour is coming when neither in this mountain nor in Jerusalem shall you worship the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>But an hour is coming, and now is, when the true worshippers shall worship the Father in spirit and reality; for the Father seeks such to worship Him" vv.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>21, 23 .</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Here we may see a principle.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>In that day among the Jews and Samaritans, there was much talk about the worship of God.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>This is a good, glorious, and beautiful subject.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Today it is the same.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>In the churches we may have much talk about the worship of God.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Some may talk about whether to worship God in this way or in that way, by this means or by that means, or in this place or in that place.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>These are the different opinions, ideas, concepts, and understandings concerning the worship of God.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>We may have been caught up by the issue of the worship of God.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>However, we may have neglected and forgotten that to worship God is altogether not according to the outward way, but is a matter in our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The One whom we worship is not outward.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>He is a Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>His nature and essence is Spirit, just as the nature and essence of a table is wood.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>We must realize that the very One whom we worship does not demand that we worship Him in a certain place or in a certain way.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>He is a Spirit essentially.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>We cannot touch electricity with a piece of wood.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>We must use metal to touch electricity, to become electrified.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>In the same way, only the spirit of man can touch this God who is Spirit v. 24 . Talk about ways means nothing.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>The Jews learned the things concerning the worship of God from the writings of Moses, and the Samaritans learned the worship of God from the same writings.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>History tells us that the Samaritans had the Pentateuch and worshipped God according to that part of the Old Testament, as did the Jews.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Both peoples had the same portion of the Bible, but they had different interpretations.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>The Jews said that they had to worship God on Mount Zion, the central part of Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>But the Samaritans said they must worship in Samaria.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>In these two places, two peoples held two concepts.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>The one people said that their concept was according to the Bible, and the other people said that their concept was more according to the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>This sinful, despised, and clever woman brought the question of worship to the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>She wanted to know who was right and who was wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>She only had the knowledge concerning the worship of God.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>The mere knowledge concerning the worship of God means nothing.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>If you are really concerned about the worship of God, you must know that the very God whom we worship is Spirit in essence.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Worship does not depend upon regulation, knowledge, a place, or any ways.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>It all depends upon what part of your being you use to worship your spirit, your mind, or your body.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>When I visited Jerusalem, I saw Moslems worship God by prostrating themselves on the ground.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>I said within myself, "What are you doing there?</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Don't you realize that this is abominable in the eyes of God?"</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>They took off their shoes because they considered their place of worship to be sacred, and they replaced them with special, expensive slippers.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Then they got in a line and followed everyone else to bow down several times.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>They worshipped God by an exercise of their physical bodies.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>However, the Lord Jesus told us that worship is neither in this place or in that place, and neither in our mind or our body, but in our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>"God is Spirit; and those who worship Him must worship in spirit " John 4:24 .</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>We must exercise our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>It is possible that we may talk much about the worship of God but forget that the worship of God could only be prevailing in our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>Do not talk about the ways or the "hows."</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>We must realize that anything concerning God must be in our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>Turn to the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>This must be renewed among us.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>We should say, "Don't talk about the worship of God.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>Turn to your spirit."</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>What matters is neither Samaria nor Jerusalem but our spirit, because the very One whom we worship is Spirit, and we can contact Him in and with our spirit.</S>
