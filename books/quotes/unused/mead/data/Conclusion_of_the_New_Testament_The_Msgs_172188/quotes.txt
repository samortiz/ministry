[2]  These aspects include serving and worshipping God, working and laboring for the Lord, not loving the world, overcoming Satan the Devil, fighting the good fight, and running the course of the race.
[3]  All these matters can be carried out only by the dispensing of the divine Trinity, by the infusing and transfusing of the riches of the processed Triune God into us.
[4]  We need to stay in His presence, fellowship with Him, and even pray with fasting in order to receive more dispensing of the divine essence into our being so that we may serve and worship God, work and labor for the Lord, not love the world, overcome Satan, fight the good fight, and run the good course of the race.
[5]  2 No One nor Anything, neither Tribulation, nor Distress, nor Persecution, nor Famine, nor Nakedness, nor Peril, nor Sword, nor Death, nor Life, nor Angels, nor Principalities, nor Things Present, nor Things to Come, nor Powers, nor Height, nor Depth, nor Any Other Creature Is Able to Separate Them from the Love of God the Love of Christ
[6]  In Romans 8:35 Paul asks, "Who shall separate us from the love of Christ?
[7]  4 Nothing Can Put Them to Shame, but Christ Is Magnified in Their Body Whether through Life or through Death
[8]  In Philippians 1:20 Paul says, "According to my earnest expectation and hope that in nothing I shall be put to shame, but with all boldness, as always, even now Christ shall be magnified in my body, whether through life or through death."
[9]  7 They Are Blessed by Being Reproached in the Name of Christ, Because the Spirit of Glory and of God Rests upon Them
[10]  The believers, having believed into Christ John 3:15 and having been baptized into His name Acts 19:5 , that is, into Himself Gal 3:27 , are in Christ 1 Cor 1:30 and one with Him 1 Cor 6:17 .
[11]  In this message we shall consider further the believers being profited by all things in their circumstances and environments through their experience of the dispensing of the divine Trinity.
[12]  12 They Do Not Need to Fear Those Who Kill the Body, but Are Not Able to Kill the Soul; Their Hairs Are All Numbered by Their Father in Whose Eyes They Are of More Value Than Many Sparrows, Not One of Which Shall Fall to the Earth without Their Father's Permission
[13]  In Matthew 10:28-31 the Lord Jesus says, "Do not fear those who kill the body, but are not able to kill the soul; but fear rather Him who is able to destroy both soul and body in Gehenna.
[14]  15 They Count It All Joy When They Fall into Various Trials
[15]  17 They Accept with Joy the Plundering of Their Possessions, Knowing That They Have a Better and Abiding Possession
[16]  Through the divine dispensing the believers also share the kingdom of Jesus in His tribulation and endurance for the word of God and the testimony of Jesus Rev 1:9 .
[17]  In this message we shall consider further matters related to the believers' being profited by all things in their circumstances and environments.
[18]  21 They Are Not Ashamed of Suffering as a Christian but Glorify God in This Name
[19]  First Peter 4:16 says that if a believer suffers "as a Christian, let him not be ashamed, but let him glorify God in this name."
[20]  23 They Suffer with Christ That They May Also Be Glorified with Him; Their Sufferings Are Not Worthy to Be Compared with the Coming Glory to Be Revealed to Them
[21]  Romans 8:17 and 18 say, "If children, heirs also; heirs of God and joint heirs of Christ, if indeed we suffer with Him that we may also be glorified with Him.
[22]  25 The Crown of Life Shall Be Given to Them for Their Suffering, Trial, and Tribulation
[23]  We have seen that, in the progressing stage of God's full salvation, the believers experience the dispensing of the divine Trinity in the matters of serving and worshipping God, working and laboring for the Lord, not loving the world, overcoming Satan, fighting the good fight, running the course of the race, and being profited in all things in their circumstances and environments.
[24]  Because the authorities are from God, the believers should not resist them.
[25]  f For the Lord's Sake according to the Will of God
[26]  Finally, the believers are to be subject to the government for the Lord's sake according to the will of God.
[27]  First Peter 2:13-15 says, "Be subject to every human institution for the Lord's sake, whether to a king as supreme, or to governors as sent by him for vengeance on evildoers and praise of those who do good; because so is the will of God, by doing good to silence the ignorance of foolish men."
[28]  In Romans 12:20 Paul says, "If your enemy is hungry, feed him; if he is thirsty give him a drink; for in doing this you will heap coals of fire upon his head."
[29]  In this message we shall begin to see that, through the experience of the dispensing of the divine Trinity, the believers have the highest standard of morality and virtues. i.
[30]  1 Having Been Created in Christ for Good Works, Which God Before Prepared That They Should Walk in Them
[31]  The good works for which God created us are not merely the good things according to our general concept but the definite good things which God pre-planned and previously ordained for us to walk in. These good things include the doing of His will to live the church life and bear the testimony of Jesus, as revealed in the entire book of Ephesians.
[32]  a Concerning Things, All Things Are Lawful to Them, but Not All Things Are Expedient, Profitable
[33]  First Corinthians 6:12a says, "All things are lawful to me, but not all things are expedient."
[34]  Through the experience of the dispensing of the processed Triune God the believers have the highest standard of morality and virtues.
[35]  In 5:20 righteousness does not refer to the objective righteousness, which is the Christ we receive when we believe in Him that we may be justified before God 1 Cor 1:30; Rom 3:26 .
[36]  b Not Lusting for a Woman by Looking at Her and Committing Adultery in the Heart Surpassing Not Committing Adultery
[37]  Matthew 5:33-37 says, "Again, you have heard that it was said to the ancients: You shall not perjure yourself, but you shall render to the Lord what you have sworn.
[38]  But I say to you, Do not swear at all, neither by the heaven, because it is the throne of God, nor by the earth, because it is the footstool of His feet, nor by Jerusalem, because it is the city of the great King.
[39]  f As Sons of the Heavenly Father, Loving Their Enemies and Praying for Their Persecutors Surpassing Loving the Neighbor and Hating the Enemy
[40]  Matthew 5:43-45 says, "You have heard that it was said, You shall love your neighbor and hate your enemy.
[41]  But I say to you, Love your enemies, and pray for those who persecute you, that you may become sons of your Father who is in the heavens, because He makes His sun to rise on the evil and the good, and sends rain on the just and the unjust."
[42]  However, in order to touch our natural being and to reveal how much the divine life within us can do for us, the Lord requires us to love our enemies and pray for our persecutors.
[43]  6 Being Established in Every Good Work and Word
[44]  Second Thessalonians 2:16 and 17 say, "Now our Lord Jesus Christ Himself, and God our Father, who has loved us and given us eternal encouragement and good hope in grace, encourage your hearts and establish you in every good work and word."
[45]  Here we see that the Lord Jesus Christ and God the Father establish the believers in every good work and word.
[46]  In this message we shall first cover two further matters related to the believers' having the highest standard of morality and virtues, and then we shall consider the matter of watching and praying.
[47]  4 To Stand before the Son of Man at His Throne in the Heavens
[48]  The believers need to watch and pray not only to escape from the great tribulation but also "to stand before the Son of Man" Luke 21:36b .
[49]  In this message we shall cover two matters: first, the believers' becoming, as the bride, one with the Spirit; second, the believers' looking to and waiting for the Lord Jesus' coming back to usher them into their future.
[50]  In the progressing stage of God's full salvation, the stage of transformation, the believers experience and enjoy the processed Triune God in His triune dispensing, they experience God's redemption continuously, they enjoy the dispensing of the divine Trinity in the divine transformation for the divine conformation, they experience the dispensing of the divine Trinity corporately by entering into the kingdom of God, by living in the church, and by living in the Body of Christ, and they experience the dispensing of the divine Trinity in various other aspects.
[51]  This Spirit is the all-inclusive, life-giving Spirit as the consummation of the processed Triune God who, in Revelation 22:17, has become one with the believers as the bride. a. The Spirit, as the Consummation of the Processed and Dispensed Triune God, Becoming One with the Bride, the Aggregate of All the Regenerated and Transformed Tripartite Men
[52]  Forming the Universal Couple the Mingling of the Processed Triune God with the Regenerated and Transformed Tripartite Man
[53]  Calling the Thirsty Ones to Come and Drink the Water of Life the Flow of the Processed and Dispensing Triune God
[54]  THE CONCLUSION OF THE NEW TESTAMENT MESSAGE ONE HUNDRED EIGHTY THE BELIEVERS THEIR FUTURE 1
[55]  In the foregoing messages we have covered the believers' past in eternity, where they were foreknown, chosen, and predestinated by God, and also their past in time, where they were created by God and became fallen and dead in offenses and sins.
[56]  In the initial stage, the stage of regeneration, the believers have been called by God and separated unto Him, they have repented, believed, and been baptized, and they have been joined to the processed Triune God, redeemed, made a new creation, and saved.
[57]  Romans 8:29 and 30 say, "Whom He foreknew, He also predestinated to be conformed to the image of His Son, that He should be the Firstborn among many brothers; and whom He predestinated, these He also called; and whom He called, these He also justified; and whom He justified, these He also glorified."
[58]  First Corinthians 2:7 indicates that God has predestinated us to obtain His glory that we may express Him.
[59]  It is in this Christ, through His all-inclusive redemption and based on all His achievements, that God can be the God of all grace to call us into His eternal glory and to perfect, establish, strengthen, and ground us in the Triune God as the solid foundation, thus enabling us to attain unto His glorious goal.
[60]  e. Enjoying the Glory of the Children of God with Its Freedom
[61]  When the believers are glorified, they will enjoy the glory of the children of God with its freedom.
[62]  Everyone who believes in the Lord Jesus will eventually become a glorified son of God bearing the righteousness of God outwardly, being saturated with the holiness of God inwardly, and shining in the realm of His full glory as one of His sons.
[63]  In this message we shall see that in the completing stage of God's full salvation, the stage of glorification, the believers will be redeemed in their body.
[64]  1 For God's Purchased Possession to Be Redeemed, with the Holy Spirit as the Pledge of Our Inheritance
[65]  The Holy Spirit today is a guarantee, a foretaste, and a sample of our divine inheritance until our body is transfigured in glory, at which time we shall inherit God in full.
[66]  2 The Issue of the Sealing of the Holy Spirit
[67]  In Ephesians 4:30 Paul tells us that we were sealed with the Holy Spirit of God "unto the day of redemption."
[68]  1 According to the Operation of Christ Who Is Able Even to Subject All Things to Himself
[69]  In Philippians 3:21 Paul says, that the Lord's transfiguring the body of our humiliation, conforming it to the body of His glory, will be "according to the operation of Him who is able even to subject all things to Himself."
[70]  In this message and in the message following we shall consider in a brief and simple way the rapture of the believers, which is the third item of the believers' future in the completing stage of God's salvation, the stage of glorification.
[71]  a. The Dead Overcomers through All the Generations, as the Man-child among Them, to Rise and Be Caught Up
[72]  Revelation 12:5 says, "She brought forth a son, a man-child, who was about to shepherd all the nations with an iron rod; and her child was caught up to God and to His throne."
[73]  1 To Mount Zion in the Heavens Where Christ Is
[74]  In Revelation 14:1 we see that the one hundred forty-four thousand firstfruit are with the Lamb, Christ, on mount Zion.
[75]  From this we see that the firstfruit will be raptured to mount Zion in the heavens, where God and His throne are and where Christ is.
[76]  The minority of the living believers signified by those taken in Matthew 24:40 and 41 and Luke 17:34 will be raptured to stand before the Son of Man in the heavens.
[77]  In Luke 21:36 the Lord Jesus says, "Be watchful, at every time beseeching, that you may prevail to escape all these things which are about to take place, and to stand before the Son of Man."
[78]  In this message we shall cover further aspects of the rapture of the believers. d.
[79]  1 The Prudent Ones Who Take Oil in the Vessels with Their Lamps and Who Are Ready Will Be Taken to the Marriage Feast of the Lamb
[80]  a They Need to Go to the Oil Sellers and Buy the Oil for Their Vessels
[81]  Verse 8 says, "The foolish said to the prudent, Give us some of your oil, for our lamps are going out."
[82]  This word implies that even after resurrection the foolish believers will still need the infilling of the Spirit of God.
[83]  The foolish virgins represent the believers who have been regenerated by the Spirit of God dwelling in them but who are not filled with the Spirit of God so that He may saturate their whole being.
[84]  1 The Dead Ones among Them Signified by the Ten Virgins Shall Rise Up First
[85]  First Thessalonians 4:16b says, "The dead in Christ shall rise first," The dead believers signified by the ten virgins will be the first to rise up and be raptured into the Lord's parousia. a The Resurrection of Those Who Are Christ's
[86]  Those who are Christ's are the believers in Christ, the just ones, who will be resurrected unto life at the Lord's coming back before the millennium John 5:29; Luke 14:14; 1 Thes 4:16; 1 Cor 15:52; Rev 20:4-6 . b The Resurrection of Life
[87]  In John 5:28 and 29 the Lord Jesus says, "An hour is coming in which all who are in the tombs shall hear His voice, and shall come forth: those who have done the good to the resurrection of life, and those who have done the evil to the resurrection of judgment."
[88]  In Philippians 3:11 Paul says, "If by any means I may attain to the out-resurrection from among the dead."
[89]  In this message we shall see that, in the completing stage of God's full salvation, the believers will be judged at the judgment seat of Christ, which is the judgment seat of God.
[90]  The fourth judgment revealed in the New Testament is the judgment of the living at Christ's throne of glory Matt 25:31-46 .
[91]  After the Lord Jesus defeats Antichrist and his army, many of the Gentiles will still be living on earth.
[92]  "When the Son of Man comes in His glory, and all the angels with Him, then He shall sit on His throne of glory; and all the nations shall be gathered before Him, and He shall separate them from one another, as the shepherd separates the sheep from the goats" vv.
[93]  Before the judgment seat of Christ, each of the believers will give an account of himself to God for the Lord to settle the accounts with them.
[94]  When the believers are judged by the Lord at His judgment seat, some will receive a reward.
[95]  Hebrews 10:35 says, "Do not cast away therefore your boldness, which has great reward."
[96]  The reward spoken of here is the kingdom reward because it will be given to us for our enjoyment in the coming kingdom, not in this age.
[97]  In this message we shall cover two aspects of the believers' future in the completing stage of God's full salvation: first, the believers' being invited to the marriage feast of the Lamb and being His bride; second, the believers' being the heavenly armies following the Faithful and True, The Word of God, King of kings, and Lord of lords.
[98]  Blessed Are the Overcoming Saints, Who Are Invited to the Marriage Feast of the Lamb as His Bride
[99]  We have seen that in the progressing stage of God's full salvation, the stage of glorification, the believers will be glorified, redeemed in their body, raptured, and judged at the judgment seat of Christ.
[100]  Furthermore, the overcoming believers will be invited to the marriage feast of the Lamb and will be the heavenly armies following the Lord to fight against Antichrist.
[101]  2 Drinking the Cup of the New Covenant Anew with Their Lord
[102]  In the heavenly part of the millennium the overcoming believers will drink the cup of the new covenant anew with their Lord.
[103]  In Matthew 26:29 the Lord Jesus said, "I will by no means drink henceforth of this fruit of the vine until that day when I drink it new with you in the kingdom of My Father."
[104]  When the overcoming believers participate in the coming kingdom, they will inherit eternal life and thereby have a fuller enjoyment of the divine life Matt 19:29b; cf.
[105]  Strictly speaking, to eat of the tree of life in the paradise of God refers to the particular enjoyment of Christ as our life supply in the New Jerusalem in the coming millennial kingdom, because this is a promise of reward made by the Lord to His overcomers.
[106]  The enjoyment of Christ as the tree of life in the New Jerusalem in the new heaven and new earth will be the common portion of all God's redeemed people, whereas the particular enjoyment of Him as the tree of life in the New Jerusalem in the coming millennial kingdom will be a reward only to the overcoming believers.
[107]  If today we love only the Lord and not our soul, that is, our self, and if we live by Him and according to His standard, then when He comes back He will reward us with the kingdom.
[108]  In the kingdom we shall have no problems, sorrows, or sufferings in our soul, for at that time we shall gain our soul, we shall save our soul, and we shall enjoy the salvation of our soul.
[109]  In the coming kingdom the overcoming believers will reign with Christ.
[110]  Revelation 20:4b says, "They lived and reigned with Christ a thousand years," and verse 6b says, "They shall be priests of God and of Christ and shall reign with Him a thousand years."
[111]  e. They Shall Have the Right to Eat of the Tree of Life
[112]  Revelation 22:14 says, "Blessed are those who wash their robes, that they may have right to the tree of life, and may enter by the gates into the city."
[113]  This verse may be considered a promise of the enjoyment of the tree of life, which is Christ with all the riches of life.
[114]  The tree of life is nothing less than Christ, the Son of God, the redeeming Lamb, as our life supply.
[115]  The fact that the tree of life grows on the two sides of the river of the water of life indicates that the embodiment of the Triune God, who is Christ, is always along with the all-inclusive Spirit, who is the consummation of the Triune God, to be our life supply dispensed into us.
[116]  According to the entire Bible, there is a divine romance between God the Creator, the Redeemer, who is the male, and His redeemed people, who are the female.
[117]  In this message we shall consider further aspects of the believers' future in the ultimate consummation of the dispensing of the divine Trinity.
[118]  The one throne for both God and the Lamb signifies that God and the Lamb are one the Lamb-God, the redeeming God, God the Redeemer.
[119]  The redeeming God will also be the temple of the holy city for the believers' eternal dwelling with God as His serving ones Rev 21:22; 22:3c .
[120]  The water flows out of this spring to saturate the believers, and this saturation involves God's dispensing. e. As the River of the Water of Life, the Flow of the Dispensing Triune God, Proceeding Out of the Throne of God and of the Lamb in the Middle of the Street of the Holy City
