   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER SIXTEEN LIGHTING THE LAMP</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>And thou shalt command the children of Israel, that they bring thee pure oil olive beaten for the light, to cause the lamp to burn always.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In the tabernacle of the congregation without the veil, which is before the testimony, Aaron and his sons shall order it from evening to morning before the LORD: it shall be a statute for ever unto their generations on the behalf of the children of Israel Exo 27:20-21 .</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>We are told here that the priests must do two things with the lamp.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>First, they must light the lamp with the pure olive oil.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Second, they must order or arrange the lamp.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Then let us read Exodus 30:7-10: And Aaron shall burn thereon sweet incense every morning: when he dresseth the lamps, he shall burn incense upon it.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>And when Aaron lighteth the lamps at even, he shall burn incense upon it, a perpetual incense before the LORD throughout your generations.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Ye shall offer no strange incense thereon, nor burnt sacrifice, nor meat offering; neither shall ye pour drink offering thereon.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>And Aaron shall make an atonement upon the horns of it once in a year with the blood of the sin offering of atonements; once in the year shall he make atonement upon it throughout your generations: it is most holy unto the LORD.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>In these verses, to dress the lamps means the same as to arrange or to order the lamps in chapter twenty-seven.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Now we must read Psalm 119:147-149: I prevented the dawning of the morning, and cried: I hoped in thy word.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Mine eyes prevent the night watches, that I might meditate in thy word.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Hear my voice according unto thy loving-kindness: O LORD, quicken me according to thy judgment.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Here David is praying and dealing with the Word in the early morning.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>We see that his praying was mingled with the reading of the Word.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Finally, we must read John 15:7: If you abide in Me and My words abide in you, ask whatever you will, and it shall come to pass to you.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>From this verse, we see that when we have the Word abiding in us, we will get the answer to whatever we pray.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>THE CENTRAL ITEM OF THE TABERNACLE</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>In the last chapter, we have seen that the main commission of the priesthood is to burn the incense.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>We need to be impressed that the burning of the incense is the central matter of everything in the tabernacle, God s dwelling place.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>We know that there is the outer court, and then the tabernacle with the Holy Place and the Holy of Holies.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>In the Holy of Holies there is the ark, which is a type of Christ, and it is on this ark that God meets with His people.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>This is the place where man can meet God.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Then there is the lampstand, the showbread table, and there is also the golden incense altar for the priests to burn the incense.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>These are the things within the tabernacle.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>There are two other things outside the tabernacle in the outer court the laver for cleansing and the burnt offering altar to offer the sacrifices.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>If we look at a chart of the tabernacle showing all these things, we see that the incense altar is the very center of the whole tabernacle.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>It is the very center of God s building, God s habitation.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The incense altar is for man to meet God at the ark.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>By this we may realize that all the things in the tabernacle are for the incense altar.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The offering altar, the laver, the showbread table, and the lampstand are all for the incense altar.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>And the incense altar is for man to contact God at the ark.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>All this is a prefigure, a shadow of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The tabernacle is a type of the church as God s habitation among man.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Today the church is the real tabernacle for God.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>In the church there is the reality of Christ as the ark in which, on which, and by which God can meet man and man can meet God.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>In the church man can meet God on Christ, in Christ, and with Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>But how can this be done?</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>This can only be done by having the altar for the offerings, the showbread table for the life supply, and the lampstand for the light.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>All these things are for the burning of the incense through which man can meet God in Christ.</S>
