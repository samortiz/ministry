   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>LIFE-STUDY OF EXODUS MESSAGE SEVENTEEN GOD S DEMAND AND PHARAOH S RESISTANCE 3</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The book of Exodus reveals that God desires to rescue His people from everything other than Himself, that He wants to deliver them from everything that is not God.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>After the exodus from Egypt, God s people saw a heavenly vision by which they came to know God Himself and, in addition, to know the kind of living that is in accordance with God.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Then they could be built up as God s dwelling place on earth.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>This is the basic concept of the book of Exodus.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>God longs to rescue His chosen people from every form of usurpation and preoccupation so that they may have nothing besides God Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>After the children of Israel had been delivered from Egypt and had passed through the Red Sea, they came to Mount Horeb, the mountain of God.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>At one time, God s people were in Egypt, living an Egyptian life and performing Egyptian labor under the tyranny of Pharaoh.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Although many of them may have had no thought of God, they were nevertheless God s chosen people, for they had been predestinated by God to be separated unto Him.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The first chapters of Exodus reveal that God s people had been usurped by Satan and were held in bondage under Satan s hand.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>At that time, everything related to them was Egyptian.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>There was nothing about them that was for God.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Therefore, God came in to deliver them, to separate them, to release them from Satan s usurpation and Egypt s preoccupation, and to bring them to the mountain of God, where there was nothing at all Egyptian.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>There at the mountain of God the people God had chosen could be alone with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>When the children of Israel came to Mount Horeb, God was their center, their purpose, their business, and their very life.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>He was even their home.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>God was everything to them.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>In the wilderness, especially at the mountain of God, Mount Horeb, the children of Israel had nothing but God.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Many Christians today talk about being saved.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>But very few realize that to be saved is to be brought to a place where there is nothing but God.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>More than any other book in the Bible, the book of Exodus exposes the world.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Although the New Testament speaks a great deal about the world, even telling us that the whole world lies in the evil one 1 John 5:19 , it does not present a clear picture of what the world is.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>For this, we must come to the book of Exodus, which is a book of pictures.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>If we read chapters five through twelve in a proper way, we shall see a series of vivid pictures portraying the nature and meaning of the life of the world.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>God wants His people to see the world for what it is.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>If the element of the world remains in us, we shall be damaged in relation to the fulfilling of God s purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>When the children of Israel were in the wilderness, they remembered the enjoyment they had in Egypt.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>They recalled the taste of the leeks, the onions, and the garlic Num 11:5 .</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Due to this remembrance they had a problem with God s dwelling place.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The same is true of Christians today.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Because many Christians are still in Egypt, they can have nothing to do with God s dwelling place.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Even those who have been separated from Egypt may still remember the pleasure of Egypt.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Hence, we all need to see a clear picture of the life and living in Egypt.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Not only were the ten plagues a warning and a punishment to the Egyptians, but they were also a revelation, an unveiling, to God s people.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>By means of these plagues, the children of Israel must have come to see the actual situation of Egyptian living.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>As a result of these plagues, they must have come to loathe their living in Egypt.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>God wanted the life in Egypt to be exposed so that His people would hate it and want to flee from it.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Therefore, God s purpose in sending the ten plagues was not only to warn the Egyptians and to punish them.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>It was also to show His own people what the world was.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The world also needs to be unveiled to God s people today.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>God wants His people to be His dwelling place on earth.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>However, this desire can be fulfilled only if we have been delivered from the world and have nothing besides God Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>In these days we have been emphasizing the need for the building up of the churches.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>But if we want to see the churches built up in a practical way, we must come fully out of the world.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>On the negative side, the book of Exodus unveils the world.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>On the positive side, it reveals God s dwelling place.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Firstly, the true nature, meaning, and issue of life in Egypt are exposed to God s people.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>God s intention in giving this revelation is to cause His people to become disgusted with Egypt, to leave Egypt behind, and to be separated to God for His dwelling place.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>The principle is the same today.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>If we have not been separated from the world, we cannot become God s dwelling place.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>For the building up of His dwelling place, we must see the world as it really is.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Furthermore, we must loathe the world s way of living and be willing to forsake it.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>If we see God s purpose as it is disclosed in the book of Exodus, it will be easier for us to understand the significance of the plagues.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>God s intention in sending the plagues was not only to punish the Egyptians; it was also to expose the Egyptian living.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Like the Egyptians in the book of Exodus, the people in the world today have no understanding of the actual situation of life in the world.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>The worldly people have all been drugged.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Under the influence of Satan s drugging, they are happy with their life in the world.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>They have no realization of what it is to live without God in the world.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>In their experience, the water of the world needs to be turned into blood.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Then they will know the nature of life in the world and the result of living in the world.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>The nature of life in the world is death, and the result of living in the world is also death.</S>
