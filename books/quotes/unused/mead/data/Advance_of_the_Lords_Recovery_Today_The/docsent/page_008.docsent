   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE UNIQUE PATTERN OF THE PRIESTS</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>OF THE GOSPEL IN THE NEW TESTAMENT</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The unique pattern of the priests of the gospel in the New Testament is the Apostle Paul 1 Tim 1:16 .</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>We need to see how Paul did his work as a priest of the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>According to the New Testament record, he did it in three steps of offering.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>First, Paul saved sinners to offer them up to God as acceptable sacrifices Rom 15:16 .</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Second, he brought the believers up to lead them to present themselves to God as living sacrifices Rom 12:1 .</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Third, he warned and taught every saint in all wisdom to present each one full-grown in Christ Col 1:28-29 .</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>He did this by laboring and struggling according to God s operation which operated in him in power.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Paul s announcing of Christ in Colossians 1:28 is to tell out Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>To present every man full-grown in Christ is to offer every man full-grown in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Saving Sinners to Offer Them to God</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>as Acceptable Sacrifices</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>According to Romans 15:16, Paul offered the saved sinners to God as acceptable sacrifices.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>All of the unbelieving sinners are in Adam.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>When we preach the gospel to them and they receive the Lord, they are transferred out of Adam into Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>When someone believes into Christ, he becomes a part of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The unbelievers who are transferred into Christ are the increase of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>When I am preaching the gospel to offer saved persons to God, I am offering Christ not the individual Christ but the corporate Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>In the Old Testament, the priests offered bulls and goats as sacrifices.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>God was pleased with that because they were types of the coming Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Our work today in the New Testament age is to preach the gospel to save sinners, to make them parts of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>When we offer these ones to God, God considers them as parts of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Thus, we are offering the increase of Christ to God.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Because we are members of Christ, we can say that we are Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Paul said in Philippians 1:21, For to me to live is Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>When we were offered to God, we were offered to God as Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The bulls and goats that the Old Testament priests offered to God were types.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>They were not the reality.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The reality of these offerings is Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>God was happy with the offerings in the Old Testament because they pointed to the coming Christ, but today we are priests who do not offer the types.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>We offer the reality, and the reality is not just the individual Christ Himself without any enlargement or increase.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>We are offering the increase of Christ, the parts of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>I am very happy because through my ministry over many years I have offered a number of thousands of people to the Lord as acceptable sacrifices.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>When I see the Lord, I can give Him an account that I have offered a number of thousands of parts of Himself to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>We need to consider how many parts of Christ we have offered to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>We all have to answer this question.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>One day we will see the Lord, and we will have to give Him an account concerning our living and labor on this earth.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>How many parts of Christ we have offered to Him indicates how much we have labored.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>In talking about his labor in the gospel, Paul said in Colossians 1:29, For which also I labor, struggling according to His operation which operates in me in power.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>To offer parts of Christ to God requires our labor, but not labor by our own strength or our own ability.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>We need to struggle according to His operation which operates in us in power.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>We are the New Testament priests of the gospel of God, so we have to labor on the sinners by imparting God, dispensing God, into them to bring them into Christ, making them parts of Christ which we offer to God as acceptable sacrifices.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>All of us as the New Testament priests are obligated to do this.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>One day we will all appear before the judgment seat of Christ, and we will have to give the Lord an account.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>When we talk about knocking on people s doors for the preaching of the gospel, what we mean is to visit people.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>We visit people to impart Christ into them.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Visiting people to impart Christ into them must be a part of our Christian daily life.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>In our daily life, we must impart God and dispense Christ into others to make them, the sinners, parts of Christ that we may present these parts as sacrifices offered to God for His good pleasure.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>This will produce the members of Christ to constitute His Body and eventually issue in this Body being expressed on earth in many localities.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Bringing the Believers Up to Lead Them</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>to Present Themselves to God</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>as Living Sacrifices</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>After the saving of sinners, Paul continued to nourish the new ones, to bring them up in the same way that we would raise up our children.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>When we bring up our children, we first teach them what to do, and after a period of time, we charge them to do it themselves.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>At the time of their salvation, Paul presented the saved sinners as sacrifices.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Then Paul brought them up and led them to present themselves as living sacrifices.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>When I preach the gospel to a sinner and he gets saved, he is now in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>I present this one to God in Christ, with Christ, and as a part of Christ, as a spiritual sacrifice.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Now that he is saved, he is a babe in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>I should not leave him alone, but I have to feed him as a nursing mother.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>After revealing in Romans 1 and 2 that the believers were sinners, Paul did this feeding work in chapters three through eleven.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Then in Romans 12, Paul, the feeder, begged the saints to present themselves to God as living sacrifices.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Paul did not beg the saints to offer themselves to God in Romans 1.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>It was after his fellowship through eleven chapters that he could ask the saints in Romans 12 to offer themselves to God as living sacrifices and be His serving members.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>We have to offer ourselves directly to God, but we do this by being helped, by being perfected, by the preaching apostle.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>This is the pattern we have to follow.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>When people receive the Lord as their life, they are babes.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>After a period of time of feeding on Christ, they grow and grow in life until, spiritually speaking, they enter into their teens.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>In a family, the parents cannot give the little children much responsibility, but later the parents can charge them to do things according to their stage of growth.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>When a child becomes thirteen years old, he comes out of elementary school and enters into junior high school.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Paul s charge in Romans 12:1 is something just out of elementary school.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>The elementary teaching is in Romans 1 11.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>Romans 12:1 may be considered as a charge to those who are now thirteen years old.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>After the long teaching in Romans 1 11, the children have entered into junior high.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>Paul offered them as sacrifices to God at their conversion.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>Now that they are in their teens, he begs them to present themselves to God, to present their bodies as a living sacrifice to God.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>After this offering in Romans 12, the practice of the Body life begins.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>After the saints presentation of themselves to God, they can be the active members of the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>Thus, in the following verses of chapter twelve, we see that the ones who present themselves as living sacrifices become functioning members of the organic Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>These living members function according to their gifts, such as prophecy or teaching vv.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>6-7 .</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>Before Romans 12, there was no practice of the Body life.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>Beginning in chapter twelve the saints are beginning to be perfected to practice the Body life.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>After being perfected, the saints will do the same work as the gifted ones the apostles, prophets, evangelists, and shepherds and teachers Eph 4:11-12 .</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>Even though the saints are not these particular gifts, they will do the same work that these gifts do.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>This work is the work of the New Testament ministry, which is to build up the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>The Body of Christ is built directly by the perfected saints, not by the perfecting gifts.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>This Body is built up and expressed in many localities on this earth as the local churches.</S>
