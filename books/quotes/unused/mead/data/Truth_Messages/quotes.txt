[1]  CHAPTER ONE THE PILLAR AND BASE OF THE TRUTH TWO ASPECTS OF THE CHURCH
[2]  In the two Epistles to Timothy there are a number of unusual expressions not found elsewhere in the New Testament.
[3]  First Timothy 3:15 says, But if I tarry long, that thou mayest know how thou oughtest to behave thyself in the house of God, which is the church of the living God, the pillar and base of the truth Gk.
[4]  . In this verse two aspects of the church are covered: the church as the house of the living God and the church as the pillar and base of the truth.
[5]  However, because we did not have the pillar of truth, evil things were allowed to creep in. It seemed that there were no police stations and no policemen.
[6]  But because we have been short of the truth and short in the practice of the truth, we have not done so.
[7]  After speaking of cutting straight the word of the truth and shunning profane and vain babblings, Paul mentioned those who concerning the truth have missed aim 2 Tim 2:15-18, Gk.
[8]  In 2 John 1 and 2 the Apostle John speaks of loving in the truth, of knowing the truth, of the truth abiding in us, and of the truth being with us forever.
[9]  In this message we shall devote our attention to the definition of the truth.
[10]  As we all recognize, truth is the opposite of falsehood.
[11]  If we would know the meaning of truth in the Bible, we need to get into the depths of the Word.
[12]  The difference between a newspaper and television is that with the newspaper there is no light, only printed letters, but with television light and electricity are required.
[13]  Now we can understand that, in the Bible, truth refers to the shining of the light.
[14]  But when, by the mercy of God, the light shines on these verses, they see the truth of Christ s death and are saved.
[15]  The church in the Lord s recovery must be full of life and strong in the truth.
[16]  We need to get into the Word so that we may have not only the Spirit, but also the Spirit of truth.
[17]  When we walk according to the Spirit, we are walking in the truth; and when we walk in the truth, we are walking according to the Spirit.
[18]  The New Testament reveals clearly that when the church is degraded, we need to walk not only according to the Spirit, but also in the truth.
[19]  For example, he says, The elder unto the elect lady and her children, whom I love in the truth; and not I only, but also all they that have known the truth; for the truth s sake, which abideth in us, and shall be with us forever 2 John 1-2, Gk.
[20]  If we are truly eager to present ourselves approved to God, then when we read the Word, we shall find the truth revealed in one place after another, like pieces of a jigsaw puzzle.
[21]  If you would be such a servant of the Lord, you need to be eager to present yourself approved to God in knowing the truth and in cutting straight the word of the truth.
[22]  In this message we need to cut straight the Word concerning leadership in the New Testament economy.
[23]  In God s New Testament economy the leadership among His children is not official, permanent, or organizational.
[24]  Once again I say that although the foundation of life has solidly been laid among us, there is still the need for the Lord to raise up the pillar of the truth upon the bulwark of the truth.
[25]  In this message we shall consider the truth concerning the ministry in the New Testament economy.
[26]  In Acts 20:24 Paul says, But none of these things move me, neither count I my life dear unto myself, so that I might finish my course with joy, and the ministry, which I have received of the Lord Jesus, to testify the gospel of the grace of God.
[27]  Regarding this matter of the ministry, we need to be clear both about the truth in the Bible and about the situation of today s Christianity.
[28]  In the Lord s recovery we are for the recovery of Christ as life and everything to us for the building up of the church.
[29]  Some have said that the Lord s recovery is a one-man show, that here there is room only for the ministry of Witness Lee, not for the ministry of anyone else.
[30]  The Gospel of John is not only a book of life, but also a book of truth.
[31]  John 1:4 says, In Him was life, and verse 14 says, And the Word became flesh and tabernacled among us...full of grace and truth.
[32]  This Gospel reveals that the compound Spirit, the Spirit which was not yet John 7:39 before the Lord was crucified and resurrected, is the Spirit of truth John 14:17 .
[33]  Therefore, the Lord Jesus is the truth, the Spirit is the Spirit of truth, and the Father s word is truth.
[34]  We may have known that the Father, the Son, and the Spirit are all related to life, but we may have never seen that all Three of the Triune God are also related to the truth.
[35]  Because the Father s word is His expression, and because His word is truth, truth is the expression of the Father.
[36]  Whenever we come to the Bible, we should have the consciousness that we are coming to God s expression, to God expressed.
[37]  But when the Word mingled with the essence of the Triune God is imparted into us as the truth, this truth sanctifies us.
[38]  I can testify from experience, however, that when we contact the Lord through the Word and allow Him to infuse Himself into us, the truth thus imparted into our being kills our ambition.
[39]  A third cause of division is self-exaltation, which usually accompanies ambition.
[40]  In order to have the genuine oneness, we need to be separated from worldliness, ambition, self-exaltation, and opinions and concepts.
[41]  In John 14:2 the Lord Jesus says, In My Father s house are many abodes; if it were not so, I would have told you; for I go to prepare a place for you.
[42]  Therefore, in the beginning of this section of the Gospel of John, the Lord said clearly that His going was for the purpose of accomplishing one thing: to prepare a place for us in the house of God, the church, and to pave the way for us to be brought into this place.
[43]  This sanctification takes place by the Word, which is truth, and by the Spirit, which is the Spirit of truth.
[44]  In these four chapters of John the Word and the Spirit are mentioned again and again.
[45]  I thank the Lord that so many of us have come back to the Word and are getting into the Word every day.
[46]  As we come to the Word every morning, outwardly we touch the Word, but inwardly the Spirit touches us.
[47]  In John 14:6 the Lord said, I am the way, and the reality, and the life; no one comes to the Father except through Me. Christ, the Son, is the way, and the Father is the place.
[48]  If we continually touch the Word and allow the Spirit to touch us day by day, we shall be sanctified; that is, we shall move out of ourselves, our old lodging place, and into the Triune God, our new lodging place.
[49]  If we allow the Spirit of reality to work this truth, this reality, into our being, we shall have the genuine oneness, a oneness where there is no worldliness, ambition, self-exaltation, or opinion, but only the Father s life, nature, and holiness for us to express Him.
[50]  I have the burden to give another message on the genuine oneness revealed in John 17.
[51]  He created man not in an individualistic way, but in a corporate way; for God s intention was not to have many men individualistically, but to have many men as part of a corporate man.
[52]  Our concept is the expression and enthronement of our self-exaltation.
[53]  In this portion of the Word, the Lord firstly gave a message to His disciples and then offered the prayer recorded in chapter seventeen.
[54]  At the beginning of this section we have the subject of the Lord s last words to His disciples before His crucifixion: And if I go and prepare a place for you, I am coming again and will receive you to Myself, that where I am you also may be John 14:3 .
[55]  In this verse the Lord prayed, Father, I desire that those whom You have given Me may also be with Me where I am, that they may behold My glory which You have given Me. The where in 14:3 refers to the Father, but the where in 17:24 refers to the glory of the Father.
[56]  Therefore, when we are in the Father, we have the Father s life and nature; but when we are in the Father s glory, we express the Father.
[57]  Although we may have the confidence to say that we are in the Father, we may not have the boldness to say that we are in His glory.
[58]  Many Christians think that the place spoken of in John 14:3 is the heavenly mansion.
[59]  But if we consider this verse in its context, we shall see that this place is the Father, not the heavenly mansion.
[60]  However, it is a basic concept in the New Testament that God s intention is to put us into Himself through the death and resurrection of Christ.
[61]  The fact that Christ s death and resurrection have opened the new and living way for us to enter into the presence of God is revealed in Hebrews 10.
[62]  When the Lord Jesus was speaking to His disciples the night before He was crucified, His disciples had not yet been brought into the Father, although they had been following the Lord for three and a half years.
[63]  When we repented to God and believed in the Lord Jesus, we were brought into God the Father, although we might not have realized this at the time.
[64]  It is a matter of great significance to be one where the Son is.
[65]  Because they are not in the Father, they are not in the expression of God.
[66]  The Lord s prayer in John 17 reveals that we need to be brought onward from being just in the Father to being in the Father s glory.
[67]  In John 17 the Lord Jesus prayed that we would be one in the Triune God.
[68]  We have pointed out that according to the type of the standing boards of the tabernacle, our oneness is not in the wood, but in the gold.
[69]  Recently, some among us became dissenting, although they claimed to have seen the ground and to be for the Lord s recovery.
[70]  We have seen that genuine oneness is possible only in the Triune God.
[71]  The Lord Jesus has brought us into the Father, where He is.
[72]  Before we were saved, we were outside the Father, and we had nothing to do with Him.
[73]  By the Lord s mercy and grace, we are one with Him where He is, in the Father and in the Father s glory.
[74]  In John 14 the Lord Jesus says that He and the Father will come to the one who loves Him and will make Their abode with him v. 23 . Then in chapter fifteen the Lord says, Abide in Me and I in you.
[75]  Until now, you may have thought that the rings were the product of the overlaying of the boards with gold.
[76]  Sound Bible teachers and expositors agree that the rings signify the initial Spirit given to us, that is, the regenerating Spirit, the sealing Spirit mentioned in Ephesians 1.
[77]  This regenerating and indwelling Spirit is the initial Spirit given to us by God.
[78]  For this reason, Bible teachers say that according to Luke 15, after we come back to the Father, the Father gives us Christ as our righteousness to cover us and the Spirit as the seal to testify that we belong to the Father and that we have become His inheritance.
[79]  To have simply the three rings is not to be rich in the expression of the proper oneness.
[80]  In addition to admitting that we are poor in God, we should also learn to confess that we are poor in the oneness.
[81]  If we have seen the church and if we are faithful to stand on the ground of the church whatever the condition of the church may be at present, we shall know that the church is simply the church.
[82]  I have no doubt that you all have the three rings, the Triune God as the initial Spirit sealing you, giving you the sense of discernment, and enabling you to express the Lord whom you love.
[83]  The oneness mentioned by the Lord in His prayer in John 17 is mysterious, for it is a oneness realized and practiced in the Triune God.
[84]  The Lord prayed that all His believers would be one so that God could have a dwelling place on earth.
[85]  This Spirit is not merely the Spirit of God, but the Spirit of God with the Father and the Son.
[86]  After we are regenerated, the sealing Spirit begins to spread throughout our being.
[87]  Many of us can testify that the spreading of the gold has increased since we came into the Lord s recovery.
[88]  By reading the Word we have come to see that this precious substance is the divine nature added to us with God the Spirit.
[89]  The more we pray, have fellowship with the Lord, read His word, and tell Him that we love Him and want to be one with Him, the more we sense that something is spreading within us and overlaying us with gold.
[90]  The uniting bars are not the Holy Spirit alone, but the Holy Spirit with the human spirit.
[91]  Whether or not the uniting Spirit can actually join us into one depends on whether or not we are willing to cooperate with this Spirit.
[92]  To have such a oneness, we need the initial Spirit, we need the transformation into acacia wood, we need the overlaying with gold, and we need the crossing of the uniting Spirit according to the willingness of our spirit to cooperate with Him.
