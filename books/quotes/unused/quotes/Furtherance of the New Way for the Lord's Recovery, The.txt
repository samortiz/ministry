What is known as the Lord's recovery began at the latest in the Reformation, which took place in the sixteenth century through Martin Luther
During that time, there were small groups of people, one after another, who saw that the church of their day had become deformed
They had a strong burden and hope in the depths of their heart and spirit to bring the church back to its earliest condition
In 1922 the first church in the Lord's recovery in China was started in Foochow, which was Brother Nee's hometown
Like the other works of the Lord, His recovery is carried out through His word and follows His word, which is the truth
The Lord's move does not depend merely on the truth; it depends even more on the vitality of the truth, which is life
In the Lord's move, if there is only the truth yet the people themselves are deadened and not living, then everything is still empty
Whenever the Lord reveals and releases the truth, action will follow, and the vitality within the action is life
For the past twenty years my work has been carried out mainly in the West, and most of my writings have been written in English
That book consists of forty-four chapters, of which the last nineteen chapters deal exclusively with the New Jerusalem
Although it has been almost a quarter of a century, those messages are still fresh, living, and full of supply
We still have a great lack because after sixty-four years, the number of people in the Lord's recovery is not very large
From 1960 to 1962 when the Lord brought us to the Western world the work of the Lords recovery also entered into the Englishspeaking world
According to the calculation we made a few years ago, there are more than six hundred churches on the six continents of the globe
With respect to the number in the meetings, it is still too small; on average, each locality has only two hundred people in the meetings
A great part of these people are in Taiwan, because Taiwan alone has more than forty thousand, or one-third of the entire number
In the other localities most of the meetings have fifty to sixty people others have twenty to thirty and still others have about one hundred
According to the truth which the Lord has shown us and according to the life which He has given to us, our increase and spread are too poor
The development of the television, telephone, and other telecommunication technologies has increased the spread of news
To prepare for the full-time training, nearly every day we have to make long-distance phone calls, and the calls are quite numerous
In the past we have ignored these clear truths of the Bible; we were influenced by Christianity and were distracted and carried away
From the beginning of the Lords recovery in China Brother Nee pointed out that the church needs to be built up with the household as a unit
Now the church in Taipei, which has four thousand people regularly attending the meetings, has produced two hundred full-timers
There are fifty-two weeks a year, and as long as we are able to go, then we should practice this principle every week without fail
Regardless of who you are or how busy you are, you should give the Lord two hours every week to do nothing else but go out door-knocking
The full-timers should also go out door-knocking from Monday through Saturday for at least two or three hours a day
According to the Lord's word, if we reject this kind of fellowship, when we meet the Lord, we will not be able to give an account before Him
An increase at the rate of doubling the number every year is something without precedent in the history of Christianity
Whoever has a heart to love the Lord should consecrate themselves especially to go out door-knocking every week for two hours
The second step is that we must go to people's homes after they have been baptized to continue meeting with them
The third step is that after we have set up a meeting in their homes, we must teach them the truth and help them to grow in life
After a month, when the training is over, how will the church in Taipei care for these 2,600 people and these 1,000 home meetings?
In the world today, no matter what field you are in, the practical methods are constantly being reformed and improved
The saints who meet regularly must produce one full-timer for every twenty saints to go out door-knocking every day
They must also produce one door-knocker for every four saints to go out door-knocking for two hours every week without fail
It has now been sixty-four years since the early part of this century when the Lord raised up His recovery in the Far East
Most people do not even know that to be regenerated is to receive the life of God as their life apart from and in addition to man's own life
In 1 Timothy 3:9 Paul tells the saints who are deacons that they must hold 'the mystery of the faith in a pure conscience'
In verse 15 he goes on to say that the church is the house of the living God, the pillar and base of the truth
Rather, we are receiving the God and Christ of reality; that is, we are receiving spirit and life imparted to us through the holy Word
They studied 'tritheism' and 'Christology,' but in the end they had neither God nor Christ, just an 'ism' and an 'ology'
The majority of those in Christianity do not have the proper concept of the truth, and they have completely ignored God's economy
The pastors preach mostly things such as God being love and the Lord letting the little children come to Him to be blessed by Him
They taught about God's New Testament economy concerning Christ and the church as revealed in the entire New Testament
The New Testament Recovery Version includes a chart of the seventy weeks with the coming of Christ and the rapture of the saints
If we want to understand the mystery of God's economy, we must first understand Matthew 5-7, Matthew 13, and John 14-16
When the all-inclusive Spirit as the consummation of the Triune God is received into men, He first regenerates them
When Satan and his followers see this house, this Body, which is the church, they will know the multifarious wisdom of God
Two thousand years ago you began to employ your craftiness and to show off your cleverness, and you have been doing so until now
Some have asked why the Recovery Version of the New Testament has the word Recovery in its title and what it is that needs to be recovered
The full-time training established by the church is not a training in methods; rather, it is a training to get the saints into the truth
In the same way, since we all have a heart to go out door-knocking and to care for people, we must spend time to get into the truth
Today in the Lord's recovery the truth is clear, and there are many books to which we can refer and which will help us get into the truth
When doing a certain thing, each person will do it differently, and the results will be related to the person doing it
When we go door-knocking today, and a person answers the door, if we know the truth, we will be full of the flavor of the truth
We should take the truth with which we have been 'truthized' to 'truthize' others until all Taiwan has been 'truthized'
Every evening and holiday many people are just busy watching television or reading the newspaper to fill up their time of boredom
If we go out door-knocking and visit them at these times, they will certainly be interested and welcome us in to speak with them
The practice of going out door-knocking is God's wise ordination, and it is the new way which is welcomed by people
In principle, most people do not like to accept this kind of invitation, but they welcome our visiting them by door-knocking
If someone is an elementary school student, when he opens his mouth, it will be the aroma of a child in elementary school
The church is like a family, so we can let the young ones 'play' and do not need to worry that a problem may arise
The young trainees should not overemphasize the fact that they are taking the new way and have gained so many people through door-knocking
Some of the older saints cannot get used to the new way, so the younger ones should not boast in front of them
In this term of the training five thousand people have been saved through doorknocking and one thousand home meetings have been established
By the end of the training, even more people will have been saved and even more home meetings will have been established
When they are in the army, they always say the army is good and important, but when they are discharged, they say that the army is not good
When they are no longer occupying that particular position or doing that particular job, they say that it is not good
6 billion, and the number of Christians and Catholics added together still does not equal one-third of the entire world population
The total added together does not even equal 200,000, as all the rest of the Christian groups have just a few scattered members
If we do knock on the door of a Catholic or a Christian, we should not try to change them, nor should we reject them
We must always remember that in the entire world there are more than 3 billion unbelievers who are the main target of our door-knocking
7 million people are baptized, then most of them are 'roots,' 'branches,' and 'leaves,' but very few 'outshine' others to be the 'flower'
We do not have a Shantung restaurant, so if some of you want to eat steamed bread, you have come to the wrong place'
In this age the Lord has certainly revealed all the visions in the New Testament to us, enabling us to clearly see God's economy
When the Lord returns, these ones will be the bride for Him to gain and the firstfruits who are raptured first
Only such a group of people who are constituted as the Lords bride through practicing the new way will be able to bring in the Lords return
We must be reminded here that we are going on in the way of recovery, beginning with the step of door-knocking
If we faithfully practice according to the principles we have fellowshipped, then in a year we will certainly double our number
We go out knocking on doors and visiting people to preach the gospel and to lead them to be saved and baptized
There are even some who gained one hundred twenty people in a little more than two months and brought them to be baptized
If they do this, then in a very short time many people will know the truth of this mystery and all the other truths of the Bible
When we teach the truth to people, they will spontaneously be fed and supplied with life, and they will be able to grow in life
He is not a religion, not even so-called Christianity; rather, He is the living Christ as the contents of our faith
If we look back at the past two thousand years, the result of what Christianity has practiced has also been disappointing
Those who meet regularly must produce one out of every twenty to be a full-time serving one who is supported by the other nineteen
According to the Bible, the elders should not lord it over the flock but should become the leading sheep as patterns of the flock
We should actively carry out these principles of twenty people producing one full-timer and four people producing at least one door-knocker
According to our original calculations, we would need two thousand five hundred full-timers for this evangelization project
At that time, the brothers and sisters felt it was truly enjoyable to stand up to share, and they would race to be the first
After hearing about the practice of door-knocking, she tried it once and immediately gained one person for baptism
Whenever she meets people she does not speak about anything else but how satisfied she is that she has gained a person through doorknocking
There are two hundred fifty trainees from overseas, one hundred eighteen of whom have requested to stay in Taiwan
An eighty-six year old sister who was newly saved through door-knocking is very thankful that some of the trainees brought the gospel to her
There was another sister who went out door-knocking for four days without gaining anyone, but she still went out patiently on the fifth day
Among these five was one young person who came to see her this afternoon, expressing a desire to attend the full-time training
The young people whom these trainees have brought to the Lord are also willing to be like the trainees and to do what they do
There are one hundred sixty-eight hours in a week, and we need to consecrate only two or three hours, so this price is not too high
Take transportation, for example; it takes about one hundred days to walk from the east coast of America to the west coast
It is a big mistake if we think that because we are older it is easy for us to learn the new way by simply listening to a little explanation
When they came, we were busy turning the pages of the Bible for them and helping them to listen to the message
In Acts 8, Philip preached the gospel to the eunuch, and in a very short time, perhaps only fifteen minutes, he baptized him
When Philip explained the passage in Isaiah, 'As a sheep He was led to slaughter,' he preached Jesus as the gospel through it
After two years of use it has been translated into all the languages spoken in the countries where there are churches in the Lords recovery
It used to be that baptizing people was not to be done carelessly; rather, baptism had to be carried out by the elders
In the northern Chinese dialect we have a very interesting expression called huo ho, which means 'optimum cooking temperature'
Now we have changed our mode of transportation to the automobile, so we should not do things in the same way as when we used carts
We should not think of driving oxen while riding in an automobile even though we are accustomed to driving oxen
In the same way, if our hope is that the Lord's recovery will increase and spread, then we must change our concept
Every morning they have to straighten their rooms and have morning watch, then they go out jogging for bodily exercise
Once the training center asked all the trainees to put their shoes outside their bedroom doors before they went to sleep
After the trainees had gone to sleep, the trainers came and polished their shoes until they were bright and shiny
The next morning after rising, the trainees saw that all their shoes were black and shiny; they were both touched and ashamed
The training is mainly for teaching us what to say and what to do when preaching the gospel so that people will be open to receive
Usually when we go out door-knocking there are three people to a team with one elderly person, one middle-aged person, and one young person
If there is an elderly sister present she should help prepare the water and the clothing and just assist on the sidelines during the baptism
You should coordinate together to go into the houses, and to sit with people while they are listening, praying, and being baptized
Now with the practice of the new way, we have been given the opportunity and the way to serve that can fill up our inward lack
On the other hand, we also need teachers to teach the new ones and to help them to properly use the lesson books
In the end, they will not just be baptized; they will learn the truth in their homes to be supplied and grow in life
Although many of us have picked up the burden to become doorknockers we should not go to the homes of the new ones to lead a home meeting
The controlling vision of our change of system is to take the focus off the meetings and place it onto the homes
In this past year we have knocked on the doors of 150000 households and the number of people baptized through doorknocking is more than 5700
According to this small but penetrating light in the Bible, the earliest church life was entirely carried out in the homes
In the age of the apostles, as soon as the church was formed, several thousand people were immediately brought to salvation
Once there was organization, the result was the establishing of large corporate meetings, followed by the need for preachers
What we have seen before the Lord is that one day in the Lord's recovery there will be mostly home meetings and not many big meetings
Perhaps once or twice a month the whole church will come together for a meeting like the one mentioned in 1 Corinthians 14
If there were no home meetings as supporting pillars, that kind of big meeting would not be a glory but a deformity
It is only after we have constantly labored in the home meetings that one day we can have a big meeting as a harvest
The Chinese all used to wear long gowns, but today it is difficult to find anyone in a gown, because everyone is now wearing Western clothes
Even though it is difficult to come down the stairs as long as we are willing to walk we will be able to slowly get down to the ground floor
Our baptisms are not what they used to be, with baptism interviews to determine if the candidates are clearly saved before we baptize them
Now we just need to preach The Mystery of Human Life to them, lead them in prayer, and baptize them in the bathtub after they have believed
A country's strength and a society's health are entirely determined by the strength and health of the families
According to the Chinese tradition the children are raised by the parents in the homes they are taught they live and they grow up at home
Now, due to the increase in the cost of labor, almost every household cooks for itself and does all the housework itself
Everyone will feel that a large meeting in which one person speaks and everyone else listens has lost its flavor
The participants in these meetings will all be able to speak and function and even their children will be able to lead others to sing hymns
Most people have the concept that baptism is a very solemn matter which should be carried out at the meeting hall
He was not even baptized in a bathtub; it was perhaps just a pool, a puddle, or a stream of water on the roadside
We must be those who love the Lord to such an extent that like Mary we are willing to break our flask of alabaster for the Lord
Inwardly, we will always have a feeling that although our body is in the world, we are neither of the world nor for the world
It should not be that we read it only when we are interested, and if we are not interested, we do not touch it for three months
In addition, there is one thing that we must pay attention to; we must learn from those who know how to go out door-knocking
If we do not first have the proper equipping mentioned above, even if we learn all the techniques, it will be useless
We will be like monkeys imitating humans having only an outward show but no life and therefore will not be able to truly minister to people
They will be born into this way and will be raised up and grow in this way, so they will be able to do the same things
The first step-door-knocking, leading people to believe, and baptizing them-is being adeptly and properly done by the trainees
When we go out to knock on doors or to lead a home meeting, we will be able to boldly speak and minister the Lord's word
Today the worldly religion either has the demonic spirits or is without any spirit, but we have the Holy Spirit
At the same time, we must also pray and ask the Lord to speak in our speaking, telling the Lord that we would speak only when He speaks
When we have thoroughly confessed our sins and emptied ourselves completely, the Lord is surely with us and the Holy Spirit surely fills us
Concerning singing, we may not have any musical ability and are out of tune when we sing, but this is not important
You should know that a person with the leading and presence of the Holy Spirit is like 'one who is beside himself'
If we want to help people not to be formal in prayer, then we must pray 'crazy' prayers instead of conventional prayers
Our whole being must be full of germs so that when we contact people we immediately infect them with the germs and make them crazy too
As a result, the world will spontaneously fall away from them and they will not want anything other than the Lord and His word
When we go to lead a home meeting, we should have these four items-the Lord's Word, the Holy Spirit, praying, and singing-as our foundation
Door-knocking to preach the gospel is not only the God-ordained way but also the best way according to the needs of human society
Man is a social creature, and every human being likes to be part of a group, but it is not easy to find a good and proper social group
The Lord wants us to practice His ordained way with the ultimate result of bringing the church life completely into the homes
After the apostles passed away, however, the church, affected by various tests, fell into the condition of today's Christianity
We hope that according to what we have seen in the Bible, we could bring the church life back into the homes in the shortest time possible
The progress of these past few years has been possible for the undeniable reason that the families are healthy
Their concept of society is not necessarily strong, nor are they always patriotic, but their concept of the family is deep and strong
The result is that the strength of the meetings and the shepherding of the believers depends solely on the pastor
The first step for practicing the new way, the God-ordained way, is to knock on doors and bring people to be saved and baptized
On the one hand, this proves that the new way is workable, and on the other hand, it shows us how great the need is
Leading a big meeting or a training is not a problem for us because for many years we already have had much experience
The saints raised up in the localities must have a clear burden from the Lord to consecrate two or three hours every week to Him
Each home meeting should, at the most, last for fifty minutes; we must learn to be economical in our use of time
Once the saints have received the burden, they should not carry out this burden half-way or in an inconsistent manner
We should solemnly receive the burden from the Lord to lead and care for the new ones just as we lead and care for our children
When we go to lead a home meeting, we are not just attending a meeting but are leading and taking care of the new ones
In other words, they are our children, so we must feed and nurse them as a mother and also teach and exhort them as a father
In the past three months we have gained six thousand people through our door-knocking and have established two thousand home meetings
If we wish to not be busy to have no burdens or to spend our days in a leisurely way then we will live our days without the Lords blessing
There is no need for us to go out purposely to do these things, nor should we be too passive, but always seeking the so-called leading
When you meet with illness, do not be worried, just lay your hands on the sick one and pray, seeking the Lord's leading to heal the sick one
Although it is wrong to care just for these things, it is also a shortcoming and a mistake to intentionally avoid doing them
If we are such people when we go to lead and care for a home meeting then after a short while we will produce a great effect on the new ones
They all spoke gently and elegantly, walked slowly with a Bible in their hands, and after walking a few steps they would look up to heaven
They might not say anything, but unconsciously they will be affected and will even pay attention to and imitate our way of dressing
The most important thing in leading a meeting is our person; people bear children who are just like themselves
When we take the lead, we must definitely not take it upon ourselves to be the head and do everything by ourselves
In this way, they will learn how to meet after just a few meetings and will be able to function in the home meetings
In contrast, home meetings are characterized by their disorderliness, and it does not matter even if the meetings drag on a little
Because in the past we have not paid much attention to music, the brothers and sisters have been affected and are not able to sing very well
When you go to visit new ones, it is best to bring the 100 Selected Hymns, which contains hymns chosen out of all our hymns
When we lead the home meetings, the hardest point, which is also the most important matter, is teaching the truth
Some people may say, 'We are not like the full-time serving ones, who specialize in these matters and have time to prepare thoroughly
As long as we all have a heart to learn and practice, then we will spontaneously be able to lead the home meetings
If we consider ourselves old and tired, then we will not want to walk or move, so we will certainly fall ill in a short time
What we need to do now is to endeavor to go on according to this new way and do our best to bring the church life into the homes
After three months we can conclude our taking the lead and try to allow the new ones to take the lead themselves
During those first three months we must lead and teach them, causing them to learn and practice until they are able to do what we do
Now there are already some new ones who have been through this perfecting and who are going out door-knocking with us
In the past our knowledge was inadequate, but now we are in an age of advancement and the standard of education has been raised
In the past we felt that it was too hard to understand certain hymns, but now the new ones understand the hymns as soon as they sing them
Parents all know that the way to teach little children to speak is to constantly speak when you are around them
If you do not teach them to speak, in just three years' time they become mutes who truly are not able to speak
You must believe that by your speaking again and again they will be able not only to understand but also to speak according to your speaking
If the changing of the system is delayed due to the elders' unwillingness to rise up, we may not know its effect until eternity
If the elders in Taipei do not wake up then the church in Taipei will be like a dead end and it will drain the morale out of the training
Among these are about one hundred saints from abroad, many of whom want to bring their families over to Taiwan
We have said that we must lead the home meetings properly so that the new ones will know the truth and grow in life
The success or failure of the new way completely hinges on whether or not we are able to carry out and get through this step
We have had this question in our heart for a long time over the years we have baptized more than 100000 but where did all those people go
Now the practice of the new way is making the home the focal point, so it gives us all a supporting foundation
If we use a hose to pump water out of a well and onto the ground, the water will soon seep back into its original place
We all must see clearly that the new way depends on the home meetings, and the home meetings depend on how we lead and perfect the new ones
The church must have a church life which is up to the standard in order to support these new ones for this further step
After a rainstorm the reservoir may be full, but after just half a month the water will all run out through the breach or the hole
We have already been quite successful in gaining new ones through door-knocking and in establishing home meetings
After sending them to all the denominations, however, most of them became very cold and were never heard from again
The Lord's Word says very clearly that the church is God's flock and the elders are the leading sheep who lead the entire flock
They need to fast and pray once a week, asking the Lord to care for the saints and to bring them into the vision and practice of the new way
When we go out to lead the home meetings, teach the truth to the new ones, and lead them to grow in life, there will be a necessary process
The working out of this process will not be uniform; some new ones will learn a little faster, while others will go somewhat more slowly
Other new ones may be reluctant to leave the home meetings and may even be unwilling to meet in the homes of other people
The reason is that the system in Christianity is wrong because all the believers do nothing with the hired pastors doing everything for them
The local churches are next with only forty or fifty thousand; the third is the True Jesus Church with twenty or thirty thousand
We must accomplish this in the shortest time possible, so that every home meeting will be living and functioning
When we go out door-knocking to preach the gospel, we will bring people to salvation without having to rely on preachers
If we can lead 20,000 home meetings with 50,000 or 60,000 new ones, it will be very easy for them to go out door-knocking
In between the group meetings and the meetings in the meeting halls, we may need yet another level of meetings
In these districts we should have a meeting place to allow these saints to have a meeting that is nearby in which they can help one another
Even the question of whether to continue as a full-time serving one or to get a job is completely organic and free
The first two steps of the new way have been put into effective practice; the last two steps need further research
There are three important matters that we must fellowship about so that all the churches will know the present situation of our work
Now we are busy carrying out the training and researching the new way; when we want to have a big meeting, we can rent a stadium
From this perspective, the matter of building the large meeting hall in Linkou can be postponed without interrupting our work
In order to evangelize Taiwan, it would be best if there were 2,500 full-time serving ones; at least we will need one thousand
