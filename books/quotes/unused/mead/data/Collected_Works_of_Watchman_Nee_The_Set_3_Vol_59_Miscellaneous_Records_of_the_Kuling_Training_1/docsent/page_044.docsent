   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Offense against Deputy Authority</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Being a Serious Thing</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>After God's anger burned against Miriam and Aaron, the cloud was lifted from over the tent of meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>This signifies the departure of God's presence.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Normally, the lifting of the pillar of cloud in the day signaled the children of Israel to set forth on their journey.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>On this day, however, the lifting of the cloud from the tent of meeting was not a signal to begin the journey.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Whenever there is reviling, God's presence is withheld, and the movement of His people stops.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>This is not a small thing.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>In man's eyes an argument with Moses only involved Moses; the issue seemed minor.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>In God's eyes, however, this was very critical.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>God withdrew His presence because of this argument.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>This shows the seriousness of the offense.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Moreover, Miriam became leprous.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>She was the one who instigated the whole incident, and the instigator always comes first in everything.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Being a leper was no better than being a Cushite.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>A Cushite, at the most, was dark in skin, but a leper was unclean and had to be kept away for seven days from the camp of God's people.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>This matter was resolved by Moses' intercession for his sister's healing.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>God told Moses, "If her father had done no more than spit in her face, should she not be disgraced for seven days?</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Let her be shut up outside the camp for seven days, and after that she may be brought in again" 12:14 .</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Spitting was a sign of shame to the Jews.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Here we are told that if her father had spit in her face, she would have been shut out of the camp for seven days.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>This meant that she had to bear her shame for seven days.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>After the seven days, the cloud was lifted, and the Israelites were allowed to move on.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>God removed one shame with another kind of shame.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The sin of reviling was absolved.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>According to the Bible, transgression against authority is a very serious thing.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>If we are wrong in our attitude towards God's servant, we stumble, and there is no way for us to go on.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>We must be very careful and exercised in dealing with God's servants.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>We cannot speak lightly against them.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Today many people revile and deal capriciously with God's servants and those who are ahead of them without realizing the seriousness of the matter.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>May God open our eyes to see the seriousness of authority.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>THE REBELLION OF KORAH'S COMPANY</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The above examples first show sons rebelling against their father, then sons acting arbitrarily, and finally a brother and sister speaking against their own brother.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>All these things happen because of men's blindness; they do not see the spiritual relationship that exists in their midst.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>They do not realize that they are not dealing merely with family relationships.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>A few years after the incident with Miriam, another rebellion broke out.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>In Numbers 16 we find Moses and Aaron being attacked by Korah's company and by Dathan and Abiram.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>This time men outside Moses and Aaron's immediate family rose up against them.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Korah's company of men were Levites; they were assigned to carry the ark, and they had nothing to do with the sacrifices.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Dathan and Abiram were descendants of Reuben.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Here we find the tribe of Levi and the tribe of Reuben.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>According to the flesh, Reuben was Jacob's oldest son.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The tribe of Levi was chosen to take the lead in spiritual matters.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The tribe of Reuben, however, was the leading tribe in physical matters.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>These two tribes were not happy that God spoke only through Moses and Aaron.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>They rose up, reviled, and attacked them.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>In addition to these men, there were two hundred fifty leaders among the people.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>These men were chosen by Moses to share the responsibility of ruling over the people of Israel.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Korah, Dathan, and Abiram, together with the two hundred fifty leaders rose up and spoke against Moses, saying, "You have gone too far!</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>For all the assembly is holy, every one of them, and Jehovah is among them.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Why then do you exalt yourselves above the congregation of Jehovah?" v. 3 . They all reviled and attacked Moses and Aaron fiercely and vehemently.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>A Deputy Authority Being a Meek Person</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>When Moses heard this, he fell on his face.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>He was a very meek person, more than all men who were on the face of the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Unless a man is meek, he will not fall on his face when others revile him.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Those who fear God will fall on their face because they know that authority belongs to God.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>A deputy authority does not walk around in pomp and style.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>He does not sit in a high chair and demand obedience from others.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Moses was not reviled while sitting on a high pedestal; he was a person who could fall on his face.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>He was indeed a meek person.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>This is the reason he had the authority.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Unless a man first falls on his face, he cannot truly be lifted up.</S>
