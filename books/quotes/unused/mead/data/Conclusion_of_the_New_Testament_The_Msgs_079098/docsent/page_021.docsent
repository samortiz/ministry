   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>E. HOLINESS FOR SANCTIFICATION</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The New Testament reveals that the Holy Spirit has the attribute of holiness for sanctification 1 Pet 1:2; Rom 15:16 .</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In the New Testament the word "holy" means separated to God, set apart to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>To be holy is to be different, distinct, from everything that is common.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>In the universe there is only one nature that is absolutely different from all other things, and this is the nature of God.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Hence, God is holy.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>It is not an insignificant matter to be holy, for to be holy is virtually to be divine.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>It is to be separate, different, from anything other than God.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Holiness and sanctification both refer to an element that is holy.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Holiness refers to the element itself, for holiness is the nature and quality of being holy.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Sanctification refers to the process of being made holy, the process of being sanctified.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>A process is going on to make us holy.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>This process is sanctification.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Therefore, to have holiness is to have the element, and to undergo sanctification is to be in the process of being made holy.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Furthermore, sanctification may also denote the practical effect produced, the character and activity, and the resultant state of being sanctified to God Rom 6:19, 22 .</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>In the Greek text of the New Testament many times the expression "the Spirit, the holy" is used 1 Thes 4:8; Heb 3:7 .</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>I believe that the reason for this is that in the New Testament the emphasis is not only on the Spirit but also on holiness.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The Spirit has the attribute of holiness and even is holiness.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Therefore, the Holy Spirit is sometimes called the Spirit, the holy.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Where the Spirit is, there holiness is also.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The all-inclusive Spirit dwells in us with a condition, a state, of holiness.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The Spirit Himself is the essence, the very substance, of holiness.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>When this Spirit enters into our spirit and remains there as the essence of holiness, there is in our spirit a condition of holiness.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>First Peter 1:2 speaks of the sanctification of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Sanctification of the Spirit here is not the sanctification of the Spirit which comes after justification through the redemption of Christ, as revealed in Romans 6:19, 22 and 15:16.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>In 1 Peter 1 sanctification of the Spirit, as the main emphasis of this chapter, an emphasis on holiness vv.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>15-16 , is before the obedience of faith in Christ's redemption, that is, before justification through Christ's redemption 1 Cor 6:11 , indicating that the believers' obedience unto faith in Christ results from the Spirit's sanctifying work.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The Spirit's sanctification in its two aspects is inclusively revealed in 2 Thessalonians 2:13, which is for the full salvation of God to His chosen people.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>God's full salvation is carried out in the sphere of the Spirit's sanctification.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Second Thessalonians 2:13 says that God has chosen us "unto salvation in sanctification of the Spirit."</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The salvation unto which we were chosen by God is salvation in sanctification of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Sanctification of the Spirit is the divine transformation.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>By this we are thoroughly saved from all old and negative things and made a new creation to obtain the Lord's glory.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Therefore, the Spirit dwells in us for sanctification.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The indwelling of the Spirit is actually our sanctification.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The Spirit dwells in us with one goal to sanctify us, to transform us.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>This is sanctification of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>In Romans 15:16 Paul says, that "the offering of the nations might be acceptable, having been sanctified in the Holy Spirit."</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Here to be sanctified means to be separated, to be made holy with transformation in life.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>This is not merely objective positional sanctification but subjective dispositional sanctification.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>This sanctification is to renew us, transform us, and conform us to the image of God's firstborn Son so that we may be fitting to be a living member of the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>We all need to be sanctified, to be made holy.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>For us to be made holy means that we are separated unto God and become one with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>If the Spirit did not have the attribute, the excellency, of holiness, He could not sanctify us.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>But the Spirit does have the attribute of holiness, and this excellency is His power to sanctify us, thereby making us distinct from all that is common.</S>
