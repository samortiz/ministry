<h2 class="head2">The Meetings Are Looking Up (Mei County)</h2><p>Through eight fellowship meetings in Mei County concerning the church service and the way of the gospel, the brothers have gained the benefit and have been revived. We should give glory to the Lord. Last Lord's Day (November 5), we preached the gospel in two separate places, and it was especially good. The brothers were extremely zealous. This week there were two gospel times in which we recorded the names of twenty-six believers. We are now increasing our visiting. If the Lord gives us grace, we will soon have a baptism meeting. We have divided into three homes for the prayer meeting. By the Lord's mercy, the three home prayer meetings have been very living recently. The other meetings are looking up as well. The newly saved brothers and almost all of those who have fallen have turned back. We can only thank the Lord. We began work on the meeting hall yesterday. We have estimates of the costs. It should hold between three and five hundred people. It will cost around eight or nine million. We can only ask the Lord to prepare it.</p><p>Your brothers,<br />Jia Xiu-gi, Lee Feng-xiang, Liu Chao-ren, and Hao Yung-en<br />November 15, 1950</p><h2 class="head2">I Have Circled in the Wilderness Long Enough<br />(Charhar Province)</h2><p>I am weak and useless; it has been ten years since I left you. As I look back over this portion of the way, I can say nothing. I am ashamed and embarrassed at forgetting the Lord's grace and going against righteousness. Although there have been a few times during this period when I have been stirred up to make a resolve, they were useless in the end. Although I have continued to pray and read the Bible, I have not had any new light or gain. In summary, I can only say that when one leaves the Lord, one can only sin; when one leaves the Body, one is even more impotent. I am a lonely, pitiful member who is not worthy to fellowship with you, but I have not forgotten you and the dear, estimable brothers and sisters in Shanghai, especially Brother Nee. I will never forget what I received from him and the help I got from all the brothers and sisters. Sometimes I have wanted to write you a letter to ask for your news, but I felt as if I had somehow offended you and I stopped myself from writing. Today I deeply feel that I have circled in the wilderness too long. I will not and dare not fall any further. I hope that this is not an activity of the flesh or an expression of the emotions, but that the Lord has had mercy on this worm that I am. I really am worse than a dead dog.</p><p>After leaving Shanghai and returning to Shacheng, I announced immediately that I was leaving the denominations. At that time there were a few brothers who met together to serve the Lord, but because the flesh had not been dealt with enough, the result was a house built on sand. Later, I moved back to my home town and used medicine to serve the sick in the village. I also did some farming and learned the skill of knitting to maintain my livelihood. I am now formally practicing medicine. In my family of seven, we see the Lord's grace everywhere. There used to be a few sisters who met with us, but they have now moved to other places, and we only worship as a family (on the Lord's Day). As I reach this point in my writing, I can only shed tears of deep-felt remorse that I have not done anything for the Lord! I have often thought that I am merely waiting for the wedding feast (perhaps I will not have a portion?). Oh, may the Lord have mercy! Brother, please remember the cries of this weak one in the poor, remote countryside.</p><p>A weak member in the Lord,<br />Pei Han-zao<br />December 28, 1950</p>
