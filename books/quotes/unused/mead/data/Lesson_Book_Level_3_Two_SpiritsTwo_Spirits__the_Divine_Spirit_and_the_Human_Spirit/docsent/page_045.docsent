   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>II.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>THE HUMAN SPIRIT A. Being the Dwelling Place of the Holy Spirit</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Why are we emphasizing the difference between the Holy Spirit and the human spirit?</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>It is because our greatest problem is that we do not know the indwelling Spirit or realize that the human spirit is the very dwelling place of the Holy Spirit; neither do we know that these two spirits are being mingled together as one Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>This is a pity!</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>It is the mark of God's economy, and many Christians are missing this mark.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>It is like a house that is inaccessible because the key is missing.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Only the key will open the house to us that we may enjoy everything in it.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>For centuries the enemy has covered the key.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>What is the key?</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>It is that our human spirit is the dwelling place of the Holy Spirit, and that our human spirit is one with the wonderful Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>B. Being the Strategic Point of the Inner Life</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The human spirit is the strategic point for the inner life.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>We all have to know our human spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>It is here that we have been born again and it is here that we worship God.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>"God is Spirit; and those who worship Him must worship in spirit" John 4:24 , not in the Holy Spirit, but in our human spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>In our reborn human spirit we worship God, we serve God, we fellowship with one another, and we grow in life.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>We even have the church life here.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>C. Being the Receiving Organ</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Man can be likened to a radio.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The Holy Spirit is like the heavenly radio waves.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The spirit in man is like the radio receiver.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The receiver is our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>God has done His part, and we have to take care of our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>We have to cooperate with God by preparing the proper organ to receive what He is, what He has done, and what He is going to do.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>There is no need for us to take care of the side of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>That has been fully taken care of by God.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>We simply need to take care of our side, the human spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>III.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>THE THREE PARTS OF THE SPIRIT</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>THE CONSCIENCE, FELLOWSHIP, AND INTUITION</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Let us go on to see something about the composition of the human spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The spirit is a complete unit, composed of three parts or functions: conscience, fellowship, and intuition.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The shaded area in the diagram below illustrates the parts of the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The conscience is found in Romans 9:1, "My conscience bearing witness with me in the Holy Spirit."</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Comparing Romans 9:1 with Romans 8:16, the conscience is located in the human spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>On the one hand, the Holy Spirit bears witness with our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>On the other hand, our conscience bears witness with the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>This proves that the conscience must be a function of our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>It is easy to understand the conscience.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>We are all familiar with this.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>To perceive right from wrong is one function of the conscience Psa 51:10; 34:18 .</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>To condemn or to justify is another one of its functions 1 Cor 5:3 .</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>It is also easy to comprehend the fellowship.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The fellowship is our communion with God John 4:24; Rom 1:9 .</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Within our spirit, such a function makes it possible to contact God Eph 6:18; Luke 1:47; 1 Cor 6:17 .</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>In a simple word, fellowship is to touch God.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>But it is not very easy to understand the intuition.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Intuition means to have a direct sense or knowledge Mark 2:8 .</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>There is such a direct sense in our spirit, regardless of reason, circumstances, or background.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>It is a sense without reason, a sense that is not "reasonable" 1 Cor 2:11 .</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>It is a direct sense of God and a direct knowledge from God.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>This function is what we call the intuition of the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Thus, the spirit is known by the functions of the conscience, the fellowship, and the intuition.</S>
