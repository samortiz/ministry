   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>PROGRESSIVE REVELATION</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>To know God is indeed easy.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>I believe there has never been a person on the earth who has not known something about God.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>All the Jews know about God, and even the heathen know of God.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>All people know about God.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In the classroom they may say that there is no God, but in private they ask, What about God?</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>In the school they may deny the existence of God, but at home they ask themselves, Suppose there is a God, what shall I do?</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>When we contact the unbelievers, we should not argue with them about God.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>They know about God already.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>To know God is easy, but to know Christ is not so easy.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>All the Hebrews know about God, but not all of them know about Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>They know God, but they do not know about Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>They know God, but they do not know Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>All the Muslims know God, but they do not know Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>To know Christ is a real improvement upon knowing God.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>All human beings know about God, but only a small number know both God and Christ, because Christ is a real mystery.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>He is God, yet He became a man.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>He was God, yet He was God in man.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>I do believe He was a small man while He was on this earth in the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Jesus was a small man, yet that small man was God.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>God was embodied in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Is this not wonderful?</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>So we see that to know Christ is not as easy as to know God.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>But those of us who are Christians know Christ as our God.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>However, to go on from Christ to know the church is even more difficult.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Many Christians know Christ, but not so many know the church.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>To know the church is a greater improvement.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>We all need to be improved again and again.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>We need to know God first, we need to know Christ second, and then we must go on to know the church.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The church is also a mystery.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>God is in Christ, and Christ today is in the church.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>God is embodied in Christ, and Christ is realized in the church.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>But this is not all.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>From the church we must go on to see the churches.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Comparatively speaking, it is easy to know the church, but it is not so easy to know the churches.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Some Christians know the church, but they do not know the churches.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>They talk a lot about the church, but they have not seen the churches.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>How many books do you have in your Bible?</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Of course, you will say that you have sixty-six.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Do you know God, and do you know Christ?</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>If you do, then you have the Old Testament plus the four Gospels.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>But do you know something about the church?</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>If you do not, you only have forty-three books in your Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Some may say that to know God and to know Christ is sufficient to go to heaven.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>This is true, but your Bible is still only of forty-three books.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>However, if your Bible has sixty-six books, you must know God, Christ, the church, and the churches.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Only then do you really have sixty-six books in your Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The Bible shows us clearly that the church has become the local churches in many localities.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Does this mean that the heavenly church is made earthly by making it local?</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>No; it means the heavenly church is made locally golden.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>It is local but not earthly.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>It is local and golden.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>In the past some have said that they know God, they know Christ, and they know the church.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>They are clear from Ephesians that the church is the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>But they will not agree to have the local churches.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Therefore, they cut off so many Epistles, but especially the last book, from their Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Their Bible only has sixty-five books.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>If we have sixty-six books in our Bible, we not only have God, Christ, and the church, but we also have the local churches.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>In the Old Testament we have God.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>In the four Gospels we have Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>In Acts and the Epistles we have the church and the churches, and in Revelation we have the churches, which are emphasized as being local.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Therefore, to know the churches, the local churches, is the greatest improvement in knowing the four main figures revealed in the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>BEING UP TO DATE</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>My burden is that we all must see the last book of the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Revelation tells us about the local churches, not the one church in the heavens.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>To know God is not adequate.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>To know Christ is also not adequate.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Even to know the church is not adequate.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>We must go on to know the churches which are local.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>If we are up to date in following the Lord, we will realize that today is the day of the local churches.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>In the last age of God s dispensation, and in the last book of His Scripture, the main thing is the local churches.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>I must repeat again that if we are up to date with the Lord, we must be in a local church.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>The last book of the Bible is written to the local churches.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>If we are not in the local churches, we are not in a position, and thus not entitled, to receive this book.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>We all know that the books of the Bible are part of the divine will given to us.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>It is a title deed, a testament, a will.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>The last part of this will is given to the local churches.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>If we are not in the local churches, we do not have the position to inherit this part of the will.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>But praise the Lord, if we get into the local churches, we are entitled to this part!</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>The book of Revelation was written to the local churches, so only in the local churches are we in the position to inherit this book.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>If we have nothing to do with the local churches, we have nothing to do with this book.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>We must be brought up to this book.</S>
