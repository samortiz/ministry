Beginning with this message, we will consider another matter-Christ as our experience, enjoyment, and expression
In the New Testament there are more than three hundred aspects of the experience, enjoyment, and expression of Christ
We look to the Lord that, as we study all these aspects, He will bring us into the excellency of the knowledge of Christ
In this excellency of the knowledge of Christ, we will surely enter into the rich experience and enjoyment of Him
The New Testament opens with these words: 'The book of the generation of Jesus Christ, the Son of David, the Son of Abraham'
If we know the New Testament as a whole, we will realize that the entire New Testament is wrapped up with these two titles
In His divinity, Christ is the 'Root of David,' his source; in His humanity, He is the 'Offspring of David,' his issue
The titles Son of David and Son of Abraham are not just for us to know the revelation concerning Christ's person
The authority to bind and to loose is given not only to Peter, the apostle for the church in 16:19, but also to the church itself
Go therefore and disciple all the nations, baptizing them into the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit'
God made man in His own image and after His likeness so that man could contain God, taking God as his life and life supply
The created race, the race of Adam, was a failure, so God came to another race, the chosen race, the race of Abraham
God made a covenant with Abraham, and this covenant concerns God's being the enjoyment and everything to His chosen people
In this fulfillment the processed Triune God consummated as the all-inclusive Spirit is the blessing to God's chosen people
In the gospel we have received the all-inclusive Spirit as God's consummation to be the life, life supply, and everything for our enjoyment
As a result of the covenant God made with Abraham, the processed Triune God as the consummated Spirit has become our enjoyment
Christ had to be the Son of Abraham to fulfill God's covenant with Abraham so that God, after being processed, could be our blessing
God must have a kingdom, a realm, a sphere, on earth with His chosen race to exercise His administration under His full, divine authority
In this administration He can come in to exercise whatever is on His heart to be the blessing promised to His chosen people
The reason for this is that there is the need of a kingdom a realm a sphere for God to exercise Himself to give us His allinclusive being
Even in John, the Gospel of life, we are told that if we are not regenerated, we cannot enter into the kingdom of God
There is the need of a kingdom so that God can exercise Himself to dispense Himself into us as our life blessing
In Matthew we have the King-Savior; in Mark, the Slave-Savior; in Luke, the Man-Savior; and in John, the God-Savior
If we do not repent and receive the Lord as the King-Savior, we cannot have Him as the Slave-Savior, the Man-Savior, and the God-Savior
In our experience our Savior, Jesus Christ, must first be the Son of David for the kingdom and then the Son of Abraham for the blessing
We need to be impressed with the fact that we must receive Christ first as the Son of David and then as the Son of Abraham
To receive Him as the Son of David is to recognize His kingly status and to realize that we should be under His kingship and sovereignty
If we have Christ as the Son of David, the greater Solomon, we will also have Him as the Son of Abraham, the real Isaac
Matthew 28:19 speaks of the believers' being baptized into the Triune God-into the name of the Father, of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit
As long as we have the Son of David and the Son of Abraham, we have the Triune God, and we are in the Triune God
The title Christ is emphasized in Matthew 1:16 to prove that Jesus is the very Christ, the Messiah, prophesied in the Old Testament
Concerning Jesus' being the Christ, John 1:41 says, 'He first found his own brother Simon and said to him, We have found the Messiah '
The term Messiah, the anointed One, is used in Daniel 9:26: 'After the sixty-two weeks Messiah will be cut off and will have nothing'
Matthew 1:21 says, 'She will bear a son, and you shall call His name Jesus, for it is He who will save His people from their sins'
Jesus is the Greek equivalent of the Hebrew name Joshua , which means 'Jehovah the Savior,' or 'the salvation of Jehovah'
Day by day we may experience enjoy and even express Christ as our Savior and as our salvation saving us from every sin both small and great
As the almighty God, He has the capacity in His divinity and the capacity in His humanity to meet all of our need in every way
By Him, with Him, and in Him we can be not only a proper and uplifted man but also a God-man, a divine man, as He is
Through incarnation Christ could be Emmanuel outside of His believers, but this would fulfill only part of His intention in being with us
His being with us outwardly does not fulfill His purpose to dispense Himself into our being, so He had to go through another process
Today Emmanuel is the very life-giving Spirit, who is the consummated Triune God as His presence with us moment by moment
We do and say things one way when we are alone, but when we have someone else with us, we do and say things differently
Jesus was not born in a recognized and honored royal home, and He did not grow up in a renowned city such as Jerusalem
All this made Him a Nazarene, a branch-not a lofty branch of a stately tree but a seemingly insignificant sprout from the stump of Jesse
According to His status in both His divinity and His humanity, He should have been highly regarded and greatly exalted
Due to the way He was born and the environment in which He was born, there was no sign that He should have been regarded and exalted
His way of living was not to make a show of Himself, and His way of working was quite peculiar to the human concept
Philip went to Nathanael and told him that he had met the Messiah and that He was the son of Joseph, a man from Nazareth
Although Jesus was from Nazareth and was a Nazarene, He, the seed of David, had not been born in Nazareth but in Bethlehem
If we experience Christ as such a One and walk in the way of the kingdom, we too will be rejected by the world and despised by others
The Holy Spirit, into whom Christ baptized those who believed in Him, is the Spirit of Christ and the Spirit of God
For this reason Matthew 28:19 speaks of the believers being baptized 'into the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit'
Later in 175 the Father declared the same thing this time to vindicate the Son in His transfiguration which prefigures the coming kingdom
The words the fullness of the Godhead refer to the entire Godhead, to the complete God, including the Father, the Son, and the Spirit
No one has ever seen God the Son as the Word of God and the speaking of God has declared Him in a full expression explanation and definition
The Son came in the Fathers name worked in the Fathers name did the Fathers will spoke the Fathers word and sought the Fathers glory
The Son is the embodiment and expression of the Triune God realized as the Spirit for our experience and enjoyment
Through incarnation, the Son of God became a man who was the last Adam, who through death and resurrection has become the life-giving Spirit
The Son of God, the embodiment and expression of the Triune God, became a man and in resurrection this One is now the life-giving Spirit
Paul refers to this in Ephesians 3:19, where he speaks of the believers being 'filled unto all the fullness of God'
In the church the Triune God is not expressed through an individual; He is expressed corporately through the Body
The tempter came and said to Him, If You are the Son of God, speak that these stones may become loaves of bread'
For Him to accomplish His ministry for the fulfillment of God's purpose, He had to defeat the enemy, the devil, Satan
The high priest asked the Lord if He was the Son of God, but He answered with 'the Son of Man,' the same way He had answered the devil
As the Son of Man, Christ had no place to lay His head , not even as the foxes having holes nor as the birds of heaven having roosts
As the Son of Man, Christ was delivered into the hands of the chief priests and scribes and was crucified by them
As the Son of Man, Christ resurrected in His humanity on the third day after His burial , being glorified with the Father's glory
The Lord Jesus possesses both the divine nature with its divine attributes and the human nature with its human virtues
As the Son of Man, Christ expressed in His humanity the bountiful God in His rich attributes through His aromatic virtues
God's attributes were lived out of the man Jesus, and all of God's attributes became the virtues of the man Jesus
Such a Christ now lives in us, and we need to experience and enjoy Him as the Son of Man with all the virtues of humanity
The shining of Christ as light within us is a strong confirmation that we have been born of God to be His children
The application of healing by divine power can only be a foretaste in this age; the full taste will be accomplished in the coming age
Christ, as the light of the world , came to Galilee, the land of darkness, and He came as a great light to shine upon the people in darkness
His teaching released the word of light to enlighten those in the darkness of death so that they might receive the light of life
Mark 1:22 says, 'They were astounded at His teaching, for He taught them as One having authority and not like the scribes'
As the great Teacher authorized by God, the Lord Jesus taught the things of life concerning the kingdom of the heavens
In Matthew 7:14 He said, 'Narrow is the gate and constricted is the way that leads to life, and few are those who find it'
To enter into the kingdom of the heavens we need to do two things: call on the Lord and do the will of the heavenly Father
He believed, not only in the Lord but also in His word, asking Him not to go personally but only to send His word
The Lord Jesus rebuked the winds and the sea because in the winds were the fallen angels of Satan , and in the sea were the demons
If they had believed that word, they would not have needed to pray as they did in verse 25: 'Lord, save us; we are perishing'!
In this message we will cover further aspects of the experience and enjoyment of Christ in the Gospel of Matthew
Because all the problems of mankind are the result of sin, sin must be dealt with if people are to be restored to God
Because the Lord Jesus is the God-man, He has not only the ability to save sinners but also the authority to forgive their sins
A judge's judgment is according to righteousness, whereas a physician's healing is according to mercy and grace
The Lord's word here, addressed to the Pharisees, indicates that the Lord Jesus heals man's spiritual illness, the illness of sin
Although the Lord may or may not heal us in our body, He is always ready to heal us in every part of our spirit and soul
In Matthew 9:14 the disciples of John asked the Lord Jesus, 'Why do we and the Pharisees fast much, but Your disciples do not fast'?
Jesus said to them, The sons of the bridechamber cannot mourn as long as the bridegroom is with them, can they?
John the Baptist had indicated to his disciples that Christ is the Bridegroom , and in Matthew 9:15 the Lord Jesus reminded them of this
The Lord did not answer with a doctrine but with the revelation of Himself as the Bridegroom with the sons of the bridechamber
No one puts a patch of unfulled cloth on an old garment, for that which fills it up pulls away from the garment, and a worse tear is made'
The Greek word here is agnaphos formed with a which means not and gnapto which means to card or comb wool hence to dress or full the cloth
The old garment in Matthew 9:16 signifies man's good behavior, good deeds, and religious practices by his old natural life
A patch of unshrunk cloth put on an old garment pulls away from the garment by its shrinking strength, thus making the tear worse
Putting a patch of unshrunk cloth on an old garment signifies trying to imitate what Christ did in His human life on earth
The Lord's word in verse 16 indicates that we should never cut a piece of His unshrunk cloth and use it to mend the 'holes' in our garments
His cloth is full of shrinking power, and when applied to old garments it will simply cause the holes in them to become larger
Before His crucifixion He was unshrunk cloth, but after His resurrection He is the new garment for us to put on
Rather, the Christ we apply is the One who has made Himself into a new garment through His death and resurrection
The new wine here signifies Christ as the new life, full of vigor and cheering strength, stirring us to excitement and satisfying us
As we contact the Lord, we should take Him not only as the new garment to cover us but also as the new wine to cheer us and to stir us up
We should never try to put the wine of Christ's life into the wineskin of old religious practices, for the wine will burst those practices
The Greek word rendered fresh here is kainos, which means 'new in nature, quality, or form; unaccustomed, unused'; hence, 'fresh'
The believers are built into the church, and the church is expressed through the local churches in which they live
Christ is not only the new garment and the new wine, but, being increased, He is also our new wineskin to contain the wine
According to Numbers 15:38-40, Israelite males had to wear a blue fringe on their garments, a ribbon in the color of blue
When the sick woman touched the fringe of His garment, the power of His virtue went out to her, and she was healed
To touch the fringe of the Lord's garment was to touch the Lord Himself in His humanity, in whom God was embodied
By such a touch His divine power was transfused into the touching one through the perfection of His humanity and became her healing
God, who dwells in unapproachable light , became touchable in Christ through His humanity for her salvation and enjoyment
The woman in Matthew 9:20-22 and the centurion in 8:5-10 both came to contact the Lord Jesus in the same way-with faith
Seeing the crowds, He was moved with compassion for them, because they were harassed and cast away like sheep not having a shepherd'
Christ as wisdom should unceasingly flow from God to us to be our present and practical wisdom in our experience
Day by day and hour by hour we should live in the spirit and exercise our spirit to call on the name of the Lord Jesus
Those who believe in Christ are the children of wisdom, those who justify Christ and His deeds and who follow Him as their wisdom
Matthew 11:19b says that wisdom is justified by her works, and Luke 7:35 says that wisdom is justified by her children
To learn from Him is not to imitate Him outwardly but to copy the Lord in our spirit by taking His yoke-God's will
The temple was founded upon a foundation of stone , and it was built of stone, cedar, and cypress overlaid with gold
Stone signifies transformed humanity; cedar, humanity in resurrection; cypress, humanity through death; and gold, divinity
With the temple we see the mingling of humanity with divinity through death and in resurrection and transformation
The temple built of these materials was a type of Christ as the real temple, as the One greater than the temple
David and his followers were not priests, but they entered into the house of God and ate the bread of the Presence
In a more particular way, it signifies Christ as the food for God's priests, since only priests were qualified to be in the Holy Place
One came on the scene who was so great that He could declare that He was greater than the temple and assert that He was Lord of the Sabbath
He was above all rituals and regulations, and since He was present, no attention should have been paid to such things
He, the Son of Man, was the very God who ordained the Sabbath, and He had the right to change what He had ordained concerning the Sabbath
Since the Lord is the Lord of the Sabbath, He has the full right to annul it, just as He had the full right to ordain it
Because we have Him as our rest and we are resting in Him all the time, the ritual of keeping the Sabbath is no longer needed
When Christ was baptized, the Holy Spirit descended upon Him and abode upon Him as the economical power for His ministry
Matthew 12:20 continues, 'A bruised reed He will not break, and smoking flax He will not quench until He brings forth justice unto victory'
Those who were opposing Him were like bruised reeds and smoking flax, but the Lord Jesus was still merciful toward them
Even those who had become bruised reeds He would not break, and those who had become smoking flax He would not quench
Among those who believe in the Lord Jesus today, many have become bruised reeds that can no longer give a musical sound
As the merciful Servant of Jehovah, He would use some of those who are as bruised reeds and smoking flax to bring forth justice unto victory
Due to the rejection by the Jewish religionists, the Servant of Jehovah, with His salvation, turned to the Gentiles
When the scribes and Pharisees asked for a sign, the Lord Jesus said that no sign would be given 'except the sign of Jonah the prophet'
Hades, equal to Sheol in the Old Testament, has two sections: the section of torment and the section of comfort
After he had remained there for three days and three nights, he came out to be a sign to that generation for repentance
In 1 Kings 10:1-8 a Gentile queen from Ethiopia, having heard of Solomon's wisdom and having been attracted by it, came to him
The Sower is the wonderful person of the Lord Jesus, and the seed sown is also the Lord Himself as the embodiment of the Triune God
The Body of Christ in reality is a plant growing out of Christ as the life seed into the human heart as the growing earth
Through Christ's feeding we receive eternal life, the divine life, that we may live daily by Him as our life supply
To eat the Lord Jesus is to receive Him into us to be assimilated by the regenerated new man in the way of life
Christ, therefore, is not only life but also the life supply, the food that sustains us to live because of Him in our daily walk
Matthew 14:24 and 25 say, 'The boat was already in the midst of the sea, being battered by the waves, for the wind was contrary
The Lord surely took notice that the boat was battered by the waves, and eventually He came to His disciples, walking on the sea
When Peter cried out for help, 'Jesus stretched out His hand and took hold of him and said to him, You of little faith, why did you doubt'?
In verse 26 the Lord Jesus said to the Canaanite woman, 'It is not good to take the children's bread and throw it to the little dogs'
Christ came to the children of Israel as the bread of life , who came down from heaven to satisfy the hunger of the world
The holy land of Israel was the table on which Christ, the heavenly bread, came as a portion to the children of Israel
In Matthew 1616 Peter receiving revelation from the Father declared concerning the Lord Jesus You are the Christ the Son of the living God
Christ's commission is to accomplish God's eternal purpose through His crucifixion, resurrection, ascension, and second advent
According to the Old Testament principle, anyone used by God to carry out His administration had to be anointed
Whereas Christ is the title of the Lord according to His commission, the Son of the living God is His title according to His person
The Son of God is the One who produces many sons of God to be the many members formed into the church as the one Body
The gates of Hades cannot prevail against the church built upon the revelation of the Christ and the Son of the living God
Jesus said to His disciples, If anyone wants to come after Me, let him deny himself and take up his cross and follow Me'
Because in resurrection He has become the life-giving Spirit dwelling in our spirit , we follow Him in our spirit
He was transfigured before them, and His face shone like the sun, and His garments became as white as the light
In God's economy the law and the prophets were only a testimony to Christ; they should not be put on the same level with Him
Verse 24 says When they came to Capernaum those who take up the temple tax came to Peter and said Does not your Teacher pay the temple tax
Peter had received the revelation concerning Christ's being the Son of God , and he had seen the vision of the Son of God
When the Lord Jesus said that the sons are free, He was indicating that He, as the Son of God, was free from paying the temple tax
Because we are free in Christ, we are no longer obligated to the law and its ordinances, practices, and regulations
In 51 Paul says It is for freedom that Christ has set us free stand fast therefore and do not be entangled with a yoke of slavery again
Christ has set us free through His redeeming death and life-imparting resurrection that we may enjoy this freedom and grace
By both faith and baptism we have been immersed into Christ; we have thus put on Christ; and we have become identified with Him
The basic principle of the meetings of the church is that the meetings are a gathering of the believers by the Lord into His name
Because we are the Lord's and have been saved by His name, we should gather only in that name and meet only in that name
For every church meeting we need the Lord to bring us out of everything other than Himself and to gather us together into His name
The Lord Jesus was the heavenly King, but He did not have the intention to come as a great King fighting or competing with others
Matthew 21:9 says, 'The crowds who went before Him and those who followed cried out, saying, Hosanna to the Son of David!
In their warm welcome of the heavenly King the people shouted out a quotation from Psalm 118 Blessed is He who comes in the name of Jehovah
According to this psalm, only the One who came in the name of the Lord was qualified to be praised in this way
The spontaneous praise of the people sovereignly indicated that this meek King did not come in His own name but in the name of Jehovah
As He was declaring a final word to them, He was still like a loving hen, stretching out her wings to brood over the little ones
Matthew 28:18 says, 'Jesus came and spoke to them, saying, All authority has been given to Me in heaven and on earth'
The Lord's being given all authority is for the believers to disciple all the nations, baptizing them into the Triune God
Because all authority had been given to Him, the heavenly King sent His disciples to go and disciple the nations
The believers have not yet fulfilled adequately the commandment, the charge, given by the Lord Jesus in verse 19
Among Christians today we can see the making of sinners into believers, but we cannot see much discipling of the nations
Our aim is to follow the Lord's charge to disciple people, to make them the proper subjects of the heavenly kingdom
If we are to disciple the nations, we must baptize those who receive our gospel preaching into the name, the person, of the Triune God
The Lord charges us to baptize the believing sinners into the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit
He promises to be with us until the consummation of the age, that is, until the end of this age, which will be the time of His parousia
As we approach the consummation of the age, we enjoy the presence of the Lord Jesus, the One who is the embodiment of the Triune God
In chapter twelve the Son, in the person of man, cast out demons by the Spirit to bring in the kingdom of God the Father
In chapter sixteen the Son is revealed by the Father to the disciples for the building of the church, which is the life pulse of the kingdom
In John 14:10 and 11 the Lord Jesus reveals that He is one with the Father-the Father is in Him and He is in the Father
Concerning the Father, the Son, and the Spirit, we may use three crucial words: source, expression, and realization
Because the Father is expressed in the Son and the Son is realized as the Spirit, Christ the Son is the center of the processed Triune God
We need to realize that even in this one Gospel Christ is revealed in so many aspects for our experience and enjoyment
In particular, we may experience and enjoy Him as the Son of David and eventually as the center, the embodiment, of the processed Triune God
In Matthew we can see Christ's divinity; He, along with the Father and the Spirit, is one of the Divine Trinity
Because this wonderful One, the God-man, lived the divine life in a human living, His human virtues were filled with the divine attributes
Christ is the One with divinity and humanity, the One who expresses the divine attributes in His human virtues
We simply need to touch Him once or have a glimpse of Him, and the loving element by which we love Him is transfused into us
Because we love the Lord Jesus and believe in Him, we may now experience Him and enjoy Him as the many items revealed in Matthew
As the center and embodiment of the processed Triune God, Christ is realized as the life-giving, indwelling, compound Spirit
Christ, the One who is the Son of David, our Escort, and so many other items, eventually consummates in the Spirit
The Father and the Son consummate in the Spirit, and it is as the Spirit that the Lord is with us all the days
In this message we will begin to consider the aspects of the experience and enjoyment of Christ revealed in Luke
The intention of this Gospel is to present Jesus Christ as a real man with a proper humanity full of human virtues
These verses reveal that our human Savior came not from the earth but from 'on high,' indicating that His source is the heavens
As the One who is light to us , He is the accomplisher and the center of God's redemption that His people may obtain salvation
If He had not been the rising sun dispelling the darkness that covered the earth, He could not have been our Savior
Now that we have been saved, having received Christ as our Savior, we can testify that we are in the way of peace
Before we experienced this shining, we were in darkness, knowing nothing about the universe, human life, and God
Many wonderful revelations have come to us, especially the revelation concerning the person and work of Christ
To the Gentiles Christ is light mainly for revelation; to God's people Israel Christ is light mainly for glory
The people of Israel have lost their glory because they have rejected Christ, the human Savior, who is to them the light as their glory
Speaking to Simon, the Lord Jesus said, 'A certain moneylender had two debtors: one owed five hundred denarii and the other fifty
In His parable the Lord said that since the two debtors had nothing with which to repay the moneylender, he graciously forgave them both
In verse 42 the Lord Jesus asked Simon which of the debtors would love the moneylender more as a result of having been forgiven by him
Concerning the experience and enjoyment of Christ as a moneylender, we need to pay attention to the three matters of faith, love, and peace
The robbers' leaving the man half dead signifies the Judaistic teachers' leaving the lawkeeper in a dead condition
But a certain Samaritan, who was journeying, came upon him; and when he saw him, he was moved with compassion'
In this message we will cover five more aspects of the experience and enjoyment of Christ revealed in the Gospel of Luke
The sheep-finder's going into the wilderness to seek the lost sheep indicates that the Son has come to the world to be with men
While he was still speaking, the father interrupted him and said to his slaves, 'Bring out quickly the best robe and put it on him'
The father in the parable of the returned prodigal says, 'Bring the fattened calf; slaughter it, and let us eat and be merry'
As we eat Christ as the fattened calf, taking Him into our being, we are filled with the divine life for our enjoyment
Whereas the best robe is for us to be justified outwardly, the fattened calf is for us to be satisfied inwardly
Eating is the taking of something which is outside of you into you and then digesting it so that it becomes organically part of you
As the fattened calf, Christ is to be eaten, digested, and assimilated by us to become the very fibers of our being
Christ as our righteousness is for our outward salvation; Christ as our life and life supply is for our inward salvation
The best robe qualified the prodigal to match his father's righteousness, and the fattened calf satisfied his hunger
The robe signifies the judicial aspect of God's salvation, and the calf signifies the organic aspect of God's salvation
Today we are experiencing and enjoying Christ as our outward righteousness and as our inward life and life supply
Wearing Christ as our robe, we feed on Him as the fattened calf, digesting Him, assimilating Him, and being constituted with Him
In the Lord's answer to the Pharisees, there is the strong indication that the kingdom of God is actually Christ Himself
The Lord Jesus was telling the Pharisees that they could not see the kingdom of God, even though it was among them
The kingdom of God, therefore, is actually the God-man, Jesus Christ, sown as the seed of life into His believers
Now when we exercise the life of the new creation, the divine life received through our regeneration, we are exercising the kingdom of God
When we exercise that part of us which is the old creation, we are, in a practical way, living in the kingdom of Satan
The kingdom of God is the sphere in which God exercises His authority so that He may express His glory for the fulfillment of His purpose
In such a kingdom, what matters is not eating and drinking but righteousness, peace, and joy in the Holy Spirit
The kingdom within the believers in the church is thus a triangular life, a life of righteousness, peace, and joy
If we are righteous toward others, toward things, and toward God, we will have a peaceful relationship with others and with God
In this way we will be filled with joy and with the Holy Spirit and will live out righteousness, peace, and joy in the Holy Spirit
The last aspect of the experience and enjoyment of Christ in the Gospel of Luke concerns His being the One prophesied in the Old Testament
The Law of Moses, the Prophets, and the Psalms are the three sections of the Old Testament, that is, 'all the Scriptures'
The Savior's word here unveils that the entire Old Testament is a revelation of Him and that He is its center and content
In verse 46 the Lord Jesus said to His disciples Thus it is written that the Christ would suffer and rise up from the dead on the third day
The Bible reveals that the very God in His reaching element, the Holy Spirit, came into a human virgin and was born in her and of her
As the conception was of the Holy Spirit, so what was born of that conception was a 'holy thing,' something intrinsically holy
Luke 1:35 seems to indicate that the Holy Spirit would be upon Mary only as the power for her to conceive the holy child
Through this, God joined Himself to humanity that He might be manifested in the flesh and might be a Man-Savior
Today we receive Him as such a One, and we experience and enjoy the transaction whereby God comes into man and man is brought into God
