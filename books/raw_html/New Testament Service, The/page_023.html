 <h2 class="head1">OUTSIDE OF CULTURE</h2>
<p>John&rsquo;s way of living not only offended religion, but it also offended culture. He was not only outside of religion, but also outside of culture. It seemed that there was no culture at all with him. He ate wild honey and locusts, and he remained in the wilderness. What kind of person is this? He offended the religious people, and he also offended the cultured ones.</p>
<p>We all need to realize that, if we would give a strong testimony for Christ, we need to be completely outside of religion and outside of tradition. I am afraid that we are still too refined and too cultured. No doubt we are a people with a high culture. If we remain in our culture, however, we are through as far as Christ is concerned. All the strong witnesses of Christ need to be &ldquo;wild,&rdquo; according to the principle of John the Baptist, and they need to give up religion and culture as well.</p>
<p>Some may tell us today that, if we would testify for Christ, we need to have much education with many degrees. However, John the Baptist, who was the first witness, the first martyr of Christ, kept nothing of religion and nothing of culture. By wearing camel&rsquo;s hair and eating locusts and wild honey, he was no doubt considered &ldquo;wild&rdquo;; he was fully outside of religion and outside of culture. When we read the history of the church from the first century to today, we see that whoever remained in culture and religion was through with Christ. To be the living witnesses of Christ, we need to be outside of religion and outside of culture, and we may find that we offend the religious ones and the cultured ones.</p>
<h2 class="head1">A CHANGE OF CONCEPT</h2>
<p>What did John do when he came forth to minister? Did he teach the Ten Commandments? Did he teach one of the five books of Moses? No! The first word that came out of his mouth was &ldquo;Repent!&rdquo; This word in Greek means to change your mind. It means to have a change in your life. We need to change our mind and change our concept. John did not teach from any book of the Bible, he did not teach any commandment, and he did not teach any part of the law. The first word he uttered was &ldquo;Change!&rdquo; You need to have a change in your concept.</p>
<h2 class="head1">NO SCRIPTURAL GROUND</h2>
<p>Some have argued with me by saying that the coming of John the Baptist was prophesied in the Old Testament. There is no doubt about this. Isaiah said that he was a voice crying in the wilderness (Isa. 40:3). Nevertheless, where could you find any prophecy concerning John&rsquo;s baptism? In the entire Old Testament you cannot find such a prophecy, for the baptism of John was something entirely new. In fact, there was no scriptural ground for it. Therefore, many would even say that it was unscriptural!</p>
<p>The Lord Jesus was very wise when the Pharisees questioned Him regarding His authority. He did not answer, but instead turned the question to them. He asked them if the baptism of John was of heaven or of man. This was a very wise question, for there was no scriptural ground for John&rsquo;s baptism. The Pharisees were troubled. If there was scriptural ground, the Pharisees surely would not have any argument. Yet they dared not say that John&rsquo;s baptism was of man lest they risk being stoned, for the multitude recognized John as a prophet. Neither could they say that it was of heaven, because the Lord would then ask them why they did not believe it. To them it seemed that the best way was to follow the liar, Satan, and tell a lie. They told the Lord Jesus that they did not know. The Lord answered them by saying that He would not tell them either. In effect, He said, &ldquo;I know that you know, but you will not tell Me; therefore, I will not tell you either.&rdquo; Praise the Lord, the Lord is really the Lord.</p>
<p>John the Baptist did something for which he had no scriptural ground, something &ldquo;unscriptural.&rdquo; To the religious people, it may seem that this is not at all right. He did not take care of the law; he simply told people to change their mind and their concept. If they would do so, he would bury them. That was all. The way he lived, the way he talked, and the way he acted surely offended religion and culture. For this reason the religious ones rejected him and condemned him, and the political ones put him into prison, where he was eventually beheaded. In principle, this is the destiny of the witnesses of Christ. In a sense, it is our destiny to offend people. If we are outside of religion, we will surely offend the religious world. If we do not care for culture, we will offend the cultured world. In that case, in principle our destiny will be the same as John&rsquo;s.</p>
