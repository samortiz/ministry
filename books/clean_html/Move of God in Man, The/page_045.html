<P>In this message we want to see the move of God in man in our living in the resurrection of Christ. In the resurrection of Christ, God moves in us, and this is God's move in man.</P><P>The resurrection of Christ is crucially related to us. Christ's resurrection was not for Himself just as His death was not for Himself. His death and resurrection were altogether for us. If a man has no relation to Christ's death, he is fallen and will perish. Only the death of Christ saves us from our fall and from eternal perdition. Christ not only accomplished an all-inclusive death for us but also completed an all-surpassing resurrection for us. Today many saved, regenerated Christians know to some extent how much the death of Christ is related to them. But we need to go further to see how the resurrection of Christ is related to us and how God moves in us in the resurrection of Christ.</P><P>A number of Christians know that the Christian life is something related to the Spirit, but few know that the Christian life is related to Christ's resurrection. Surely the Christian life is related to the Spirit, but we need to see that the Spirit is the reality of the resurrection of Christ. Without the Spirit, we cannot have the resurrection of Christ today. God moves in man as the Spirit, and the Spirit is the reality of Christ's resurrection.</P><P>God's move in man is God's history. Our Christian life today should be a part of God's history in man. If your Christian life is not a part of God's history in man, you are a false Christian. You are not a genuine, spiritual, divine Christian. Our daily life should be a part of God's history in man.</P><P>We need to see that the Christian life is altogether a life in the resurrection of Christ. We should live a life in Christ's resurrection. The inner-life people stressed that the Christian life is a crucified life, but the Christian life is not only a life of death but also a life of resurrection. We are not only terminated persons but also resurrected persons. Galatians 2:20 says that it is no longer I who live but it is Christ who lives in me. "No longer I" means crucifixion; "but it is Christ who lives in me" means resurrection. If Christ had never resurrected, He could not live in us. Actually, the inner-life people did not stress adequately the highest peak of the divine revelation. To speak of the Christian life being a crucified life is like being "three thousand feet above sea level," but to speak of the Christian life being a life in resurrection is like being "six thousand feet above sea level." Of course, if a person really lives a crucified life, this crucifixion will usher him to the goal. The goal of Christ's death is resurrection.</P><P>The Bible says that Christ died and after three days He resurrected (Matt. 12:40; 16:21; 1 Cor. 15:4). These three days were not a full period of seventy-two hours. According to the Jewish calendar, the day begins in the evening at sunset. Genesis 1 says a number of times that the evening and the morning are one day.</P><P>We can see the period of time between the Lord's death and His resurrection by considering the final days of His life on this earth. John 13 tells us that the Lord washed the feet of the disciples just before He established His table. After He washed their feet, He gave a morsel to Judas and told him, "What you do, do quickly" (John 13:27). Then Judas went to see the chief priests to betray the Lord. After that the Lord gave a long word of three chapters in John 14&#151;16. This word was concluded by His prayer in John 17. Then He went to the garden of Gethsemane. When He was there, Judas brought the chief priests, the Pharisees, and the soldiers to arrest Him (18:1-3). In the morning the Lord Jesus was sentenced to death by Pilate, and He was brought to Calvary to be crucified there. He died on the cross at the ninth hour, 3:00 P.M. (Matt. 27:45-50). He was buried in a new tomb for a full day and then resurrected early in the morning on the first day of the week (28:1-6). This shows that the period of time from His death to His resurrection was much less than a full three day, seventy-two hour, period of time.</P>
