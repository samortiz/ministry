Who will deliver me from the body of this death?", and one day he experienced deliverance. Then he said, "For the law of the Spirit of life has freed me in Christ Jesus from the law of sin and of death" (Rom. 8:2). This is not a new grace but a new revelation; it is not a new gift but a new vision; it is not receiving something new from God's hand but discovering something that God has already given. The law of the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus has freed us! According to the Greek "freed" is in the past tense; it is already "freed." The law of the Spirit of life has freed us! The verse does not say, "going to free," "will soon free," "can free," or "intends to free," but "has freed." The law of the Spirit of life has already freed us; therefore, we are delivered from the law of sin and of death.</p><p>We need to realize that the experience and the acts in Romans 7 are unnecessary. Hallelujah! There is no need to go through the experience in Romans 7, and there is no need to act according to Romans 7. The exercise of the will in Romans 7 is even more unnecessary. Suppose your surname is Wang. You have had the surname for decades, and every day your surname continues to be Wang. You do not have to exercise your will to call yourself Wang or resolve to be surnamed Wang, because your surname is Wang. If you are a Wang, you do not need to desire to be called Wang. If this is your desire, it means that you are not a Wang. Here you should see one thing: If you are in the Lord, the Lord will use a law&mdash;the law of the Spirit of life&mdash;to free you from another law. Once you see this, you will immediately say, "Thank the Lord! Praise the Lord! I do not need to exercise my will anymore. If I release my grip, I will not fall to the ground; I will fall into another law." Thank the Lord, this is a fact. All experienced Christians understand the meaning of these words.</p><p>Many Christians fear that if they let go or if they do not exercise their will to act like Christians, things will become unpleasant. Many Christians say, "I cannot let go of myself. If I let go of myself, things will be unpleasant. Even though I am keeping a tight grip on myself, I still cannot speak or walk properly; I am still weak and failing. What would happen to me if I let go?" Many Christians are obsessed with this fear and dare not release their grip. But God's Word is very clear! If we believe in what God has already given us and release our grip, we will not fall to the ground; rather we will fall into a new law.</p><p>May God open our eyes to see that no one can resist the law of sin by his will; nor can anyone resist the law of sin by willing to do good. No one can do the will of God or resist the law of sin and of death by his own will. The will can never contend with the law of sin and of death! Thank and praise God! There is another new law that can contend with the law of sin and of death. Thank and praise God! This is not only a new life; this is also a new law.</p><p>Oh, what a joy that this life is a law! God has given us not only the Holy Spirit but also the law of the Holy Spirit. God has given us not only life but also the law of life. In the past we were dead in our offenses and sins; we had not only sin and death but also the law of sin and of death. We did not have to resolve or force ourselves to sin. Rather, there was a law that compelled us to sin. If God had only given us a life and nothing else, it would seem reasonable to be good sometimes and bad at other times. But God has given us a life-law; it remains the same all the time, and it never changes. Just as sin and death are a constant law that does not allow exceptions, the life that the Lord has given us is also a constant law that does not allow exceptions. There is a law of life, not just a life. This is why we can release our grip. Because we have seen that this is a law, we can release our grip. Because we have seen that there is a treasure laid in us, no glory goes to us; all glory goes to the Lord who raises the dead. If we have seen this, we will praise God. Brothers and sisters, if we live by another law, a new law, we will experience a wonderful thing&mdash;we will not feel the existence of the old law anymore. Remember the words of the Scripture which say, "For the law of the Spirit of life has freed me in Christ Jesus from the law of sin and of death." It does not say that the law of sin and of death has been annihilated or abolished; rather, it says that we are freed from it. The law of sin and of death still exists, but we are no longer living under its power. We are living under another law.</p><p>Brothers and sisters, if you want to know what the law of life is, simply lift up your eyes and look at the birds in the air. How do they fly? They fly because their life has a law of flying. They have a life, and in their life there is a law. This law enables them to fly. Their life has a law which enables them to overcome the force of gravity and fly in the air. If there is a heavy snowfall one day and a crow or sparrow falls dead in your courtyard, you will see how great the force of gravity is. Gravity draws it to the earth. The force of gravity is always present. The bird has life, and this life has a law which overcomes the force of gravity and enables it to fly in the air. When the life is gone, the law of life is also gone, and the law of gravity overcomes it. Thank the Lord! God has indeed given us grace and dispensed a new life as well as a new law to us. This renders the law of sin and of death of none effect. It is not destroyed; but it is rendered of none effect. God did not eradicate the force of "gravity"; rather, He gave us another law of life, so that the "birds" can now overcome the law of "gravity." We know that when we are strong physically, we do not feel the law of gravity. We only feel the law of gravity when we are weak. When we are weak, even walking, standing, or sitting makes us tired. We are relieved only when we lie down. Those who are the weakest feel the force of gravity the most. Thank God, our life is still with us today. This is why we do not feel the force of gravity so much. Someday when our life is nearing its end, the force of gravity will become stronger for us. If you have ever had to lift a corpse, you know how great the force of gravity is. You cannot make a corpse stand up straight; once you let go, the corpse will fall.</p><p>Some have been Christians for twenty or thirty years, yet they still do not know that sin and death are a law and that life is also a law. You need to know that God's way of salvation has nothing to do with resolving to be someone you are not. There is a life in you that delivers you from the law of sin and of death. God has no intention that you will, hope, desire, or purpose to be a certain kind of Christian. If you try to do it by your own will, it will seem as if you are hung up in midair; the endeavor will be quite strenuous. If you have ever seen a talkative Christian, you know how difficult it is for him to try to talk less. He knows that he should not speak so much, yet he cannot refrain from speaking. It is very difficult for him to stop speaking. Have you ever seen a quick-tempered Christian? It is really hard to ask him to be patient. If he tries to practice patience, sooner or later he will become sick from repression. But thank God! The way of salvation is not to be someone you are not; rather, it is living out a new law of life from within. When this law is lived out from within, sin will appear to be nonexistent and annihilated, and the power of death will seemingly disappear. If you are healthy, you will not feel the force of gravity when you are walking. You can lift up your feet because there is a greater power in you. This is the meaning of the law of life.</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_058.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_060.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Collected Works of Watchman Nee, The (Set 2) Vol. 38: General Messages (2) &nbsp; pg 59</div><br></body></html>
