   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>A Love for Sinners' Souls</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Concerning the second question, my answer is that you can pray for a love for sinners' souls.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>First, you have to see the pitiful condition of a sinner.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>This will stir up your love for him and give you an earnest sense of responsibility which can never be shaken off.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>It will become a driving force within you.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>On the one hand, you can ask God to give you a love for sinners' souls.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>On the other hand, this is a kind of revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Once you have such a revelation, your spirit will be empowered.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>A Levite's Living</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Concerning the third question, my answer is that the Levites in the Bible serve as a pattern for our living.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Ordinary brothers and sisters are different from us; they have fixed incomes.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>We do not have any fixed income.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>When the Israelites offered up their sacrifices, the meat that was left went to the Levites.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>This means that when there were many offerings, they had much meat.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>When there were few offerings, they had little meat.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Some think that the Levites had a great deal of meat to eat.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>But they fail to see that the living of the Levites is related to the living of God's people.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The book of Malachi speaks of the people of Israel robbing God's offerings 3:8-10 and thus depleting the supply of His priests.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Many people only saw Paul in his abundance; they did not see him in his poverty.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Every worker should maintain his dignity before the brothers and sisters and should appear rich to them; he should not appear poor.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Anyone who cannot stand on the ground of trusting God in financial matters is not qualified to work for Him.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>We would rather have men consider us rich than have them consider us poor.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Paul said, "But I, I will most gladly spend and be utterly spent on behalf of your souls" 2 Cor 12:15 .</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Paul spent himself for others.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>I am not afraid of criticisms against a worker, who is spending himself on others, for being well-dressed and well-fed.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Those who criticize him for this are critical because they are not willing to offer their money.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>When they see others offering money, they become jealous.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>This is wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>It seems that more money has gone out of my hands than from any other person's hand.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>But it can also be said that I have the experience more than others of holding one last dollar in my hand.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>If the brothers in the church in Chefoo do not intend to support you, take up a secular profession.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>You do not need to spend their money.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Paul had a profession of making tents when he said, "You yourselves know that these hands have ministered to my needs and to those who are with me" Acts 20:34 .</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>For Paul to say this was not a glory for the Corinthians but a loss.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Paul had to make tents in Corinth.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>In Philippi he did not have to do this.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>When the church is short of regular supply, we have to think of ways to make a living.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>But we should not pay too much attention to this matter.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Finally, I do not have much to say to you personally.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>This is a very critical hour, and we should give ourselves to the work.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>When darkness comes, no one will be able to do anything.</S>
