   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE CONCLUSION OF THE NEW TESTAMENT MESSAGE TWO HUNDRED TWENTY-SIX THE CHURCH THE OVERCOMERS IN THE CHURCH 1</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In the foregoing messages we covered the failures in the churches and the degradation in the church.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In this message we shall begin to consider the overcomers in the church.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>XIII.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>THE OVERCOMERS IN THE CHURCH</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The Christian life plus the church life is altogether an overcoming life.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>This matter of overcoming began with our believing in the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Our believing in the Lord was a strong step of overcoming.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The entire universe is against people believing in the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Therefore, to believe in the Lord is real overcoming, a real victory.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>A. Having Overcome through Faith in Christ to Inherit the Eternal Life and to Be the Sons of God for Eternity</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>We overcome through faith in Christ to inherit the eternal life and to be sons of God for eternity.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>This is revealed in Revelation 21:6b-7.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>"I will give to him who thirsts from the spring of the water of life freely.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>He who overcomes shall inherit these things, and I will be God to him, and he shall be a son to Me."</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>This word refers to our enjoyment in the New Jerusalem in the new heaven and the new earth.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>In the age of eternity we shall enjoy the eternal life, and we shall be sons of God as the composition of the New Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The meaning of "overcome" in Revelation 21:7 differs from that in chapters two and three of Revelation, where it is used seven times.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>In 21:7 it means to overcome by believing, as in 1 John 5:4 and 5.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The overcoming in Revelation 2 and 3 qualifies the overcoming believers for participation in the enjoyment of the millennial kingdom as a particular reward in God's dispensational administration, whereas the overcoming in 21:7 qualifies all believers for participation in the New Jerusalem with all its enjoyment as a common portion of God's eternal salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The "son" in 21:7 is the believer who will dwell in the New Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The sons of God in the New Jerusalem are the constituents of the New Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>They are the regenerated believers who have the divine life and the divine nature.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The New Jerusalem is constituted of all these saints who have been born of God, for the New Jerusalem is a composition of all the reborn children of God.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Every reborn child of God is a part of this living composition.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Because the sons of God are the constituents of the New Jerusalem, they will also dwell in the New Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The sons of God will participate in all the enjoyment of the New Jerusalem, especially the enjoyment of the water of life.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>We should not confuse the enjoyment of the saints with the enjoyment of the nations.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The nations will enjoy the common blessing, but the saints will have a particular enjoyment.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Mainly, the saints will enjoy the life supply of the water of life Rev 22:1 .</S>
