   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>After the destruction of Jerusalem in A.D.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>70, there was a change of the dispensation.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The Jewish church which was formed at Pentecost had ceased.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In fact, it had ceased long before, but it was not officially announced until then.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The Christian faith and Judaism were completely separated after this.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Christians had to go outside the Judaic camp.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The church established by Peter among the Jews had already failed.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Christ could no longer carry out His authority among them.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Not only was this the case among the Jews, it was the same among the Gentiles.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The churches which were established by the Lord through Paul among the Gentiles had also fallen and could not inherit the inheritance abandoned by the children of Israel.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Paul said, "For all seek their own things, not the things of Christ Jesus" Phil 2:21 .</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>All they of Asia including the church in Ephesus had turned away from him 2 Tim 1:15 .</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Even those who had known the church truth so well were not able to stand in faith.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Truly, the apostasy had begun from that time.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The mystery of iniquity had already been at work.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Both Peter and Paul's works went through a dispensational change, but John's work did not involve the matter of dispensation.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>He only declared that the Lord Jesus is the eternal life.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>This eternal life will never change.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Although the dispensation changes, and people and things change, the eternal life, whether it is in the Lord Jesus or in the believers, will never change.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Although the church was spewed out of the Lord's mouth, the Lord remains unchanged.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>John's work continues after Peter and Paul, and makes up their lack.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>John's period links the first coming of Christ with His second coming.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>He works between these two comings.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>He preaches Christ's Person and eternal life.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Although the dispensation changed outwardly and things had become corrupt, the eternal life is the same from beginning to end. We can see this from the last two chapters of his Gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>In chapter twenty we see a picture of the remnant of Israel receiving Christ, beginning from His resurrection until the end time.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Thomas's look on the pierced Savior was a type.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>In chapter twenty-one we see a type of the full millennial gathering.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Then at the close of chapter twenty-one the particular ministry of John and Peter was spoken of.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Paul's teaching concerning the church, which was fully heavenly, was of course not covered here.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The children of Israel as the sheep of Christ were entrusted to Peter.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>However, Peter was to die.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>His work could not last and would come to an end after all.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Eventually, Peter's ministry ended, and the church of the circumcision was left without a shepherd.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Before long, Jerusalem was destroyed and his ministry was completely over.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Here, Peter asked about John.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>It is strange that our Lord did not talk about the end of John.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>He only told Peter to follow Him, that is, to end his ministry in death.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Peter might have secretly thought that John's ministry would continue until He comes.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Although the Lord tarried and John died, John's ministry never died.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>His writings and teachings continue to work until the Lord comes again.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The ministries of these three apostles are very important.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>If the Lord permits, a book will be written some other time specifically about them.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>John's ministry is between the two comings of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Now we can see the truth concerning the church.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Peter spoke about the failure of the Jewish church; Paul spoke about the failure of the Gentile church.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>John was neither the minister of the circumcision nor the minister of the uncircumcision.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>He had no dispensational truth committed to him.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Therefore, he did not talk about any changes that took place in the Jewish church nor in the Gentile church.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>In the book of Revelation, he talked only about the actual conditions of the church at that time.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>He did not talk about how the church went through changes until it arrived at its state then.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>He talked only about the conditions after the degradation of each individual church and how the Lord was going to judge them.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>When the work of Peter and Paul were over, John continued their work and depicted the situations of the churches that had degraded at the time of Peter and Paul's work.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>The church he talked about, other than the one reference in Revelation 22:17, was different from the church Paul talked about.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>John testified from the point of view of the individual churches.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Some lampstands of the church have the possibility of being removed.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>The churches he saw were degraded and backslidden and were judged by Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>The churches had failed!</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>The Gentiles who were grafted in by faith did not continue in God's goodness.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Paul's truth concerning the church was primarily conveyed to the church in Ephesus.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>However, as she had left her first love, it was not long before her lampstand was removed.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>As the children of Israel were cut off in the past, now the church would also be cut off in the same way.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>But God's patience was shown towards the church as it was shown toward the children of Israel then.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>However, like Israel, the church did not maintain God's testimony in the world.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>The church had decayed and had failed.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>In spite of the fact that the dispensation of grace was prolonged, God's rejection of the church on earth had begun at the time of Revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>The Lord had to use another way.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>On the one hand, the Holy Spirit indicated that God had rejected the church.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>On the other hand, He also indicated that Christ will obtain His kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>The kingdom was the goal from then on.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>The Lord used the seven existing churches at that time to represent the church as a whole.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>He showed that God had rejected the church and that the end time was near.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>If the Lord delayed, these seven churches would be the history of the outward church on earth.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>Thus, the Lord indicated that the end time was near, and He Himself would come at any time.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>This is the wisdom of the Holy Spirit!</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>The Lord indeed delayed, and Revelation chapters two and three became a description of the situations of the church from John's time until the Lord's second coming.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>We should realize that by the time of Peter and Paul, the church had already failed.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>Knowing this will help us to understand the teachings concerning the church in the first three chapters of Revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>Because of the failure of the church, we see that Christ is no longer an interceding Priest, but a judging Priest.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>From this, we understand why there is no perfect church today.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>In this way, we will not have a vain hope.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>We will know what kind of attitude we should have toward the church.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>All men are false; only God is truthful.</S>
