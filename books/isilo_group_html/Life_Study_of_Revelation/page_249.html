ITS STREET</h2><p>Verse 21 says, &ldquo;And the street of the city was pure gold as transparent glass.&rdquo; The gates are for entering into the city, whereas the street is for the daily walk, the daily living. The entering into the city is through Christ&rsquo;s death and resurrection, whereas the daily walk, the daily living in the city, is according to the divine nature, signified by the street being pure gold. Following the entrance of regeneration, the daily life and walk of the saints must be in the way of the divine nature. The divine nature is their way.</p><p>The Bible is different from the natural human concept. According to the human concept, we firstly walk on the street and then enter the gate. But in the Bible we firstly enter the gate and then walk on the street. In Catholicism people are told that they must first work and then receive salvation. This thought is devilish. In God&rsquo;s economy we receive salvation first, and then we work. Firstly, we enter into grace; then we walk in grace. Never think that by walking or working you will eventually be qualified to receive grace. No, grace is free. After you have entered in through the gates by grace, you will begin to walk, and you will need to walk a long way.</p><p>It is a very long way from the gates to the top of the golden mountain where the throne of God is. Recall that the New Jerusalem, a golden mountain, is twelve thousand stadia high (more than thirteen hundred and sixty miles). Furthermore, the golden street is a spiral, and this makes the way a great deal longer. Nevertheless, we have no choice except to walk on this street. I have been walking on this street for more than fifty-one years, and I am still on the way. Although I may desire to walk faster, sometimes the brothers drag me back, and I am forced to wait for them.</p><h2 class="head2">A. Uniquely One</h2><p>The street in New Jerusalem is uniquely one. There is no maze, no leading astray, and no getting lost. This street is unique. No matter through which gate you enter into the city, you will find yourself on the same street. In the New Jerusalem there is no such thing as a Baptist street, a Presbyterian street, a Methodist street, or a Lutheran street. Neither is the street in New Jerusalem related to any &ldquo;ism.&rdquo; The street is God&rsquo;s divine nature. In this divine nature we are one.</p><h2 class="head2">B. Being Pure Gold</h2><p>Verse 21 says that the street of the city is pure gold. We have seen that gold signifies the divine nature. After we are saved and enter into New Jerusalem, we must walk on the divine nature as our way. The divine nature is our way and our strength. Suppose a sister says to me, &ldquo;Brother Lee, I love the Lord and I want to live in the New Jerusalem. Can you tell me the style of clothing I should wear and how I should fashion my hair?&rdquo; I would tell this sister that she should choose her clothes and fashion her hair according to the divine nature within her. The style, color, material, and design of her clothing should be according to the divine gold within. The divine nature is our street, our way, and we all must walk according to it. Today, our way is not that of regulations; it is the divine nature. Do you not have the gold nature within you? Then walk according to it. Since you have the divine life with the divine nature, why do you not walk upon it? Is your speaking according to the divine nature or according to your muddy human nature? May we all see that today the nature of God is our street.</p><p>We in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery are walking in the divine nature. As many of the leading brothers can testify, I do not tell others what to do. Rather, I encourage them to walk according to the divine nature within them. Because the divine nature is our golden street, in the church life we have no need for regulations. The street itself is our regulation, for nothing regulates people more than a street. Every driver of an automobile is spontaneously regulated by the street on which he drives. In the New Jerusalem everyone is regulated by the unique street, by the golden nature of God within us.</p><h2 class="head2">C. As Transparent Glass</h2><p>The pure gold, which symbolizes both the street and the city proper of New Jerusalem, is as transparent glass (v. 18), signifying that the whole city is transparent. The golden street is crystal clear, without any opaqueness. Although the pearls may be opaque, every one of them is a great open gate, which will not be shut by day or by night.</p><h2 class="head2">D. A Spiral, Coming Down<br />from the Throne of God</h2><p>The street of New Jerusalem is a spiral, coming down from the throne of God to reach all God&rsquo;s chosen ones. Hence, this street reaches every gate. It also leads us from the gates to God&rsquo;s throne.</p><h2 class="head2">E. One Street Serving Twelve Gates<br />in Four Directions</h2><p>The one street serves all twelve gates in four directions. On this street all God&rsquo;s redeemed walk in absolute oneness as they are led by the street to the throne of God. Hence, in New Jerusalem there is one street leading to one goal.</p><h2 class="head2">F. With the Life Supply</h2><p>Revelation 22:1 says, &ldquo;And he showed me a river of water of life, bright as crystal, proceeding out of the throne of God and of the Lamb in the middle of its street.&rdquo; This verse reveals that the river of water of life is flowing in the middle of the street. Therefore, in this street is the life supply. Furthermore, as 22:2 says, &ldquo;And on this side and on that side of the river was the tree of life, producing twelve fruits, yielding its fruit each month.&rdquo; Here we see that the tree of life, which is in the river, grows on the two sides of the river along the street. Thus, all the life supply is related to the street. The more we walk, act, and have our being according to the divine nature, the more of the life supply we shall receive. However, if you do not care for the divine nature within you, but do things according to your taste, you will immediately lose the supply of life. But if you take care of the divine nature within you in a practical way in your daily life, you will enjoy the rich life supply found along the golden street.</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_248.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_250.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Life-Study of Revelation &nbsp; pg 249</div><br></body></html>
