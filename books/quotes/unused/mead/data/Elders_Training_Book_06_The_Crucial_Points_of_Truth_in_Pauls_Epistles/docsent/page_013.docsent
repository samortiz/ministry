   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER FOUR THE CRUCIAL POINTS OF THE TRUTH</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>IN SECOND CORINTHIANS</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Prayer: Lord, bring us all into Yourself.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Lord, we are here with You, waiting on You.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>We believe that You are really with us.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>O Lord Jesus, open Yourself to us and open Your Word to us.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Lord, help us to open ourselves to You, to Your Word, and to Your up-to-date revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>We trust in You for Your speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Lord, do cover us and cleanse us.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Once again, Lord, we take You as our sin offering and trespass offering that we may be accepted in You by God the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Lord, do anoint us.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Amen.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>I believe that all the saints can attain to the standard of the truth as presented here.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>I do not know how much the Lord will do and how far the Lord will go, but I believe a number of new ones and young ones will be raised up among us who will be able to exceed us in knowing the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Those who follow after us will be excellent.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>I believe this will bring in a new age among the Christians, an age of speaking the higher things and the deeper things.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>If we are faithful, after a few years all the truths which we present will become so common to many of the Lord s children.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>All the saints will speak these truths very commonly, and they will never be so hidden or so hard to understand.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>ATTACHED UNTO THE ANOINTED ONE</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Now we shall consider the crucial points of the truth in Second Corinthians.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Second Corinthians is much deeper than First Corinthians.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>For this reason, in this chapter we can only consider the most crucial points.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The first crucial point is found at the end of chapter one, in verses 21 and 22.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>These verses say, But He who firmly attaches us with you unto Christ and has anointed us is God, who has also sealed us and given the pledge of the Spirit in our hearts.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>This crucial point is the base of all the truths found in this book.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The base of all the following truths is that we have been attached to Christ, the anointed One.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The apostles, who preached Christ according to God s promises and lived Christ according to their preaching, and the believers who received Christ according to the apostles preaching, are attached, joined to Christ, becoming one with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Christ, the anointed One, is full of ointment, full of anointing.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Hallelujah, God attaches the apostles with all the believers to this anointed One!</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Because we have been attached to Him, the ointment flows in us.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>This point, as well as the other points of the truth presented here, have been covered in the Recovery Version footnotes and in the Life-study Messages.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>CAPTIVES AND INCENSE BEARERS</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Another crucial point is found in 2:14-16.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Verse 14 says, But thanks be to God, who always leads us in triumph in the Christ, and manifests through us the savor of the knowledge of Him in every place.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Verse 15 says, For we are a fragrance of Christ to God in those who are being saved and in those who are perishing.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Here two figures of speech are used; one is the celebration of a victory, and the other is the scattering of the incense in the celebration.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>In the first figure of speech we are captive ones in the triumphal procession.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>In ancient time a procession, consisting mostly of captives, was used to celebrate the victory.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>We all are the captured ones.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>While Paul was traveling in his ministry, he was a minister.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>But as he was traveling in his ministry, he considered that he was a captive and that his ministry was a procession celebrating Christ s victory.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The gospel team must consider themselves as captives in the procession celebrating Christ s victory.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Whenever you go to a campus, you go as captives in a procession.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>You may give a message to present this point to people.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>You can tell the students, Friends, we are not preachers; we are captives.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>We are not merely in the ministry but rather in a procession to celebrate Christ s victory.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>We hope that you would join us in this procession.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Eventually, all the captives become incense bearers.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>First, we are the captives in the procession celebrating Christ s victory, then right away we become incense bearers to scatter incense or fragrance, the savor of the knowledge of Christ in His triumphant ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>The apostles, being permeated with Christ, become a fragrance of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>They are not merely a sweet savor produced by Christ, but Christ Himself is the savor being exhaled in their life and work to God, both in those who are being saved, as a savor from life to life, and in those who are perishing, as a savor from death to death.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>The phrases unto death and unto life in 2:16 refer to the different effects of the apostles ministry upon different persons.</S>
