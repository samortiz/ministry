<H2 CLASS=HEAD4>d. The Genuine Perfection</H2><P>The genuine perfection is according to the pure vision of God's highest divine revelation of the age of grace and is brought forth by the fullness of the riches of the consummated Triune God and through the crucifixion of the cross of Christ for the bringing forth of the Body of Christ to consummate in the New Jerusalem as God's eternal enlargement and expression.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>B. The Snaring of the Top Apostle</H2><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>1. Paul Rejecting the Law in Galatians</H2><P>Paul, according to the pure vision of the divine revelation concerning God's eternal economy, rejected the law in Galatians 2:16, 19; 3:2, 5, 10-13; 5:1-4, 18 and condemned the Jewish believers who sinned willfully by going back to Judaism and offering the sacrifices of cattle in Hebrews 10:18 and 26.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>2. James Persuading Paul to Go Back to the Law</H2><P>James persuaded Paul to go back to the law, even to enter into the temple and wait to offer sacrifices for the completion of others' Nazarite vow.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>3. The Lord Not Tolerating It</H2><P>But the Lord did not tolerate it and came into the situation to blow away the whole deal.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>4. That Snare Causing Paul to Be Arrested</H2><P>However, that snare caused Paul to be arrested and eventually transferred to the prison of Caesar in Rome (Acts 21:18-36; 25:10-12).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>IV. THE WIPING OUT BY GOD</H2><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>A. By the Thorough Destruction<br>of the City of Jerusalem with Its Temple</H2><P>By the thorough destruction of the city of Jerusalem with its temple in A.D. 70, God terminated the Jewish religious service to Him, symbolized by the temple, and the nation of the Jews, symbolized by the city of Jerusalem. The nation of the Jews and their religion were wiped out by the destruction of the Roman prince Titus. This was prophesied by the Lord Jesus. One day the Lord Jesus was lamenting over Jerusalem and He told the disciples that not long from that time the temple would be torn down, leaving no stone upon another stone (Matt. 23:37&#151;24:2).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>B. God's Wiping Out the Vague Situation and Mixtures among the Believers</H2><P>By the destruction of Jerusalem God also wiped out all the vague situation and mixtures among the believers caused by James's vague vision and mistake and separated the believers from the Jewish people and anything Jewish.</P>
