Many children of God do not pay enough attention to the matter of the family. But in the Epistles, especially in Ephesians and Colossians, the two books with the highest spirituality, the matter of the family is not overlooked. In particular, they speak of submission in the family. Neglect of this matter will cause trouble in God&#8217;s service. First Timothy and Titus are books on work, but they also speak of the family, lest the family affect the work. First Peter is a book particularly on the kingdom, and in this book we see that to rebel against authority in the family is to rebel against the kingdom. When man meets authority, family problems decrease.<p>God establishes the husband as the deputy authority of Christ, and the wife as the representation of the church. Unless the wife sees the authority that the husband represents, the authority that God has set up, it is difficult for her to submit. She has to see that it is not a matter of her husband but a matter of God&#8217;s authority. Titus 2:5 says young women should be &#8220;subject to their own husbands, that the word of God would not be blasphemed.&#8221; First Peter 3:1 says, &#8220;In like manner, wives, be subject to your own husbands, that even if any disobey the word, they will be gained without the word through the manner of life of their wives.&#8221; Verses 5 and 6 say, &#8220;For in this manner formerly the holy women also, who hoped in God, adorned themselves, being subject to their own husbands, as Sarah obeyed Abraham, calling him lord.&#8221;<p>Ephesians 6:1-3 says, &#8220;Children, obey your parents in the Lord, for this is right. &#8216;Honor your father and mother,&#8217; which is the first commandment with a promise, &#8216;That it may be well with you and that you may live long on the earth.&#8217;&#8221; Of the Ten Commandments, this one has special reward. When a man honors his parents, he will be blessed and live long on the earth. Many probably die early because they do not honor their parents. Some brothers are at odds with their parents. Hence, they are often sick. Not until they become obedient will they become well. Colossians 3:20 says, &#8220;Children, obey your parents in all things, for this is well pleasing in the Lord.&#8221; We have to submit ourselves to our parents&#8217; authority. This also requires that we first see God&#8217;s authority.<p>Servants should obey their masters, even as they obey the Lord. In their attitude they should be in fear and trembling, not being deceitful or crafty, rendering only eye-service. Whether one sees his master or not, he has to serve just the same. He should not serve only within the sphere of his master&#8217;s sight, but should rather serve according to the honesty in the heart, not as unto man, but as unto the Lord, for we serve the Lord Christ. First Timothy 6:1 says, &#8220;As many as are slaves under the yoke should regard their own masters as worthy of all honor, lest the name of God and our teaching be blasphemed.&#8221; Titus 2:9-10 says, &#8220;Exhort slaves to be subject to their own masters in all things, to be well pleasing, not contradicting, not pilfering, but showing all good faithfulness that they may adorn the teaching of our Savior God in all things.&#8221; You must first uphold the Lord&#8217;s authority yourself, and then others will uphold the Lord&#8217;s authority which is with you. When Paul and Peter said these words, they were still under the Roman Empire where slave trading was very prevalent. Whether or not the system of slavery is right is one thing, but God ordains that slaves should obey their masters.<h2 class=head2>In the Church</h2><p>God has His appointed authorities in the church. They are the elders who take the lead well and those who labor in word and teaching. God commands that all should submit to them. In addition, all the younger ones should submit to the older ones. First Peter 5:5 says, &#8220;In like manner, younger men, be subject to elders.&#8221; Chapter five speaks of those who are elderly in age, while 1 Corinthians 16:15 speaks of the household of Stephanas as &#8220;the firstfruits of Achaia (indicating seniority in the order of salvation), and they have set themselves to minister to the saints.&#8221; Stephanas was exceedingly humble and had set himself to minister to the saints. In verse 16 the apostle further said, &#8220;You also be subject to such ones, and to everyone co-working and laboring.&#8221;<p>In the church the woman also has to submit to the man. First Corinthians 11:3 says, &#8220;But I want you to know that Christ is the head of every man, and the man is the head of the woman, and God is the head of Christ.&#8221; God appointed man to be the authority as a type of Christ and the woman to submit as a type of the church. For this reason the woman should have authority on her head for the sake of the angels. Furthermore, the woman must submit to her husband. First Corinthians 14:34 says, &#8220;The women should be silent in the churches, for they are not permitted to speak; but they should be subject, even as the law also says.&#8221; If there is anything that they want to learn, they can ask their husbands at home. Some sisters may ask, &#8220;What if my husband does not know?&#8221; If God tells you to ask, just go and ask. If you keep asking, your husband will know after a period of time. Because he is being asked, he will have to seek to understand in order to answer. In this way you help yourself and you help your husband as well. First Timothy 2:11 also speaks of women learning in &#8220;quietness in all subjection.&#8221; Women are not permitted to exercise authority over a man, for Adam was formed first, then Eve (vv. 12-13).<p>Among God&#8217;s children, everyone should gird himself with humility and should submit one to another. Some like to pretentiously show off their position or authority. This is low and shameful.<p>Not only has God set up His deputy authority in the universe, He has also set up His authority in the spiritual world. Second Peter 2:10-11 says, &#8220;Especially those who go after the flesh in the lust for defilement and despise lordship. Daring, self-willed, they do not tremble while reviling dignities; whereas angels, though they are greater in strength and power, do not bring a reviling judgment against them before the Lord.&#8221; Here we have a very important matter. In the spiritual universe there are lordships and dignities, and God has put even angels under them. Although some lords and dignities failed, the angels still dare not revile them today, for these lords and dignities were once their authorities. Today, even though some lords and dignities have fallen, the other angels can only mention the facts. They cannot pass on their judgments. If they add their judgments to the facts, they are reviling. Jude 9 says, &#8220;Michael the archangel, when he contended with the devil and disputed concerning the body of Moses, did not dare to bring a reviling judgment against him but said, The Lord rebuke you.&#8221; At one time God set up Satan to be the head of the archangels. As one of the archangels, Michael was under Satan&#8217;s authority at one time. One day Moses will resurrect. Perhaps it will be on the mount of transfiguration. Michael followed God&#8217;s command to look for the body of Moses, but Satan deterred him. Michael could have countered the rebellious spirit with a rebellious spirit. He could have rebuked Satan in a flagrant way, but Michael dared not do this. He only said, &#8220;The Lord rebuke you.&#8221; (It is different with human beings. God never put human beings under Satan. We have fallen under his power; we were never put under his authority.) The same principle applies to David. Once he was under Saul, the deputy authority of God; therefore, he dared not overturn Saul&#8217;s former authority. How dignified is a deputy authority in spiritual matters! It cannot be reviled. The ones who revile will lose their spiritual power.<p>Once you touch authority, you will see God&#8217;s authority wherever you go. The first question you should ask is to whom you should submit and to whose word you should listen. A Christian should have two kinds of feelings: one is the feeling of sin, and the other is the feeling of authority. When two brothers are together discussing or considering ideas, both can speak. But when the time of decision comes, one makes the judgment. Acts 15 records a big conference. Everyone, whether old or young, was free to rise up to speak. Every brother could speak. Later Peter and Paul spoke. Then James made the decision. Peter and Paul gave the facts; James made the decision. There was a lining up even among the elders and apostles. Paul said that he was the least among the apostles (1 Cor. 15:9). There is even a distinction between great and small among the apostles. This is not a matter of someone lining us up. Rather, it involves knowing our proper position. This is the most beautiful testimony and the most wonderful picture. This makes Satan tremble, and this will bring down his kingdom. When we all take the way of submission, God will judge the world.<br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_018.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_020.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Authority and Submission &nbsp; pg 19</div><br></body></html>
