   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>VIII.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>BUILT WITH TREASURES</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The city of New Jerusalem is built with treasures.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>It is built with three kinds of precious materials, signifying the building by the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Firstly, the city proper with its street is of gold vv.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>18, 21 .</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Gold, the symbol of the divine nature of God, signifies the Father as the source, producing the element for the substantial existence of the city.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Secondly, the twelve gates of the city are pearls, which signify the Son s overcoming death and life-imparting resurrection, through which entrance to the city is gained.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Thirdly, the wall of the city and its foundation are built of precious stones.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>This signifies the Spirit s work of transforming the redeemed and regenerated saints into precious stones for the building of God s eternal habitation that they may express God corporately in His permeating glory.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>In the garden of Eden these three kinds of treasures were merely materials Gen 2:11-12 , whereas in the city of New Jerusalem these precious materials are built up for the fulfillment of God s eternal purpose, His corporate expression.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>A. Gold for the City Proper</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The New Jerusalem is a mountain of gold.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>As a golden mountain, New Jerusalem is the ultimate, unique, and eternal golden lampstand.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>In typology gold signifies the divine nature.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Therefore, this city is absolutely composed of God s divine nature.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>This gold is pure and transparent.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>If we see the vision of the New Jerusalem built with God s divine nature, we shall renounce everything that does not belong to God s nature and reject anything that does not match it.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The church today must also be built with God s nature, not with brick, clay, or wood.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>B. Twelve Precious Stones</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>for the Twelve Foundations</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>In verses 19 and 20 we see that the foundations of the wall of the city are adorned with precious stones.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>This indicates that the twelve apostles have been transformed into precious stones to be the twelve layers of the foundation of the city.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>C. Jasper for the Wall</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Verse 18 says, And the building material of its wall was jasper.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Jasper is the appearance of God 4:3 .</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Hence, the jasper wall signifies that the whole city, as the corporate expression of God in eternity, bears the appearance of God.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>When we are in New Jerusalem, we shall marvel to see that the whole city has the same appearance, the appearance of jasper.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>This means that we all must speak the same thing, express the same thing, and have the same appearance.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Today s Christianity, however, is much different, for there everyone has his own color and his own opinion and speaks his own mind.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>But New Jerusalem has one appearance, one expression, and one color.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>D. Twelve Pearls for Twelve Gates</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Verse 21 says, And the twelve gates were twelve pearls; each one of the gates was, respectively, of one pearl.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Thus, even the gates of the city are built with treasures.</S>
