   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>SATURATING, SANCTIFYING, TRANSFORMING</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The sealing of the Holy Spirit is the saturating, and the saturating is the sanctifying.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Wherever the sealing saturates, there the sanctifying is.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Furthermore, the sanctifying is the transforming.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Thus, wherever the sealing of the Holy Spirit reaches, there is sanctification and transformation.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>For example, when our mind is sealed with the Spirit, it is sanctified and transformed.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>All the different terms sealing, sanctifying, and transforming denote the same thing.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>When our soul is thoroughly and fully sealed by the Holy Spirit, it will be sanctified and transformed.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>One day even our body will be sealed with the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>At that time our body will also be sanctified.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Our body has not yet been sanctified; that is, it has not yet been transfigured.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>But on the day of redemption, our body will have been thoroughly sealed with the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>It will be sanctified and transfigured.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>THE SPREADING OF THE SEALING</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Many Christians think that, as long as we are saved, we shall be raptured when the Lord Jesus comes back.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>This is a very superficial understanding of the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Rapture denotes maturity.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>No farmer reaps a crop until it reaches maturity.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>If a crop is still green, the farmer will not reap it.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>We are God s crop.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Therefore, the time of reaping depends upon maturity.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>We have seen from 1:13 and 14 that we have been sealed with the Holy Spirit unto the redemption of the acquired possession.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The sealing of the Holy Spirit in our spirit is with a view to the redemption of our body.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The redemption of our body depends upon the spreading of the sealing of the Holy Spirit into our whole being.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>When this has taken place, a decision can be made concerning the time of the redemption of our body.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The sealing of the Spirit should not be considered something that is once for all.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>No, it continues to go on in us, spreading throughout our being.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The Holy Spirit is moving within us, and His moving is His sealing, sanctifying, and transforming.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>When will our body be transfigured?</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>This depends upon how much sealing of the Holy Spirit has been taking place within us.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The sealing of the Holy Spirit has a great deal to do with the redemption of the body.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>This implies that the sealing of the Holy Spirit is still taking place, that it is daily saturating our mind, emotion, and will.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>After a child graduates from elementary school, he is not ready for college.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Before he can go to college, he must go to junior high school and then to high school.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Likewise, after we are sealed with the Holy Spirit in our spirit, we are not yet ready for the redemption of our body.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>On the contrary, we need to be sealed in our mind, emotion, and will.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>In so many things, we still need to be sealed by the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>We have pointed out that the sealing of the Spirit is the moving of the Spirit within us.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>We have a living seal in us; it is constantly moving.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>After the Spirit seals one part of us, He desires to seal another part and then another.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>He wants to seal every part of our being.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Until this is completed, the spreading of the sealing will continue.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>I am quite certain that you have never heard that the sealing of the Spirit is still going on.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>But this fact is implied by the word unto in 1:14.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>We have been sealed with the Holy Spirit unto the redemption of the acquired possession.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>This sealing will continue unto the day of redemption.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Do not take this merely as a doctrine, but apply it to your situation.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Are you under the Spirit s sealing today?</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Is it still going on within you?</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>We need to have the assurance that the sealing of the Spirit is spreading in our being.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>When our whole being has been sealed, we shall be ready for the redemption of the body.</S>
