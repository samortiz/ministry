The Pasture Lands Given to the Levites</H2><P>Pasture lands of three thousand cubits from the wall of the city outward all around each city were also to be given to the Levites for their cattle, livestock, and animals (vv. 2b-5). This was a rather large piece of land, and it indicates that God's giving is without scarcity. God's gift is always plentiful.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD4>c. The Large Tribes Giving More<br>and the Smaller Tribes Giving Fewer</H2><P>For the forty-eight cities given to the Levites, the large tribes were to give more and the smaller tribes fewer (v. 8). This was right and fair, and it was according to the riches given by God. How much we can give and should give depends upon how much God has given us. If God gives us a large amount, we should give more. If He has given us a smaller amount, we may give less.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD4>d. The Forty-eight Cities Given<br>to the Levites to Be Scattered among Israel</H2><P>The forty-eight cities given to the Levites were to be scattered among Israel, changing Jacob's curse on Levi in Genesis 49:7 into a blessing. According to the Bible, it is a blessing to be gathered but a curse to be scattered. As Jacob was blessing his twelve sons, he pronounced a curse on Levi, saying that because of his cruelty he would be scattered. In Numbers 35 the forty-eight cities were also to be scattered among Israel. In this way the curse on Levi was changed into a blessing.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD4>e. Six Cities to Be the Cities of Refuge</H2><P>Out of the forty-eight cities given to the Levites, six were to be the cities of refuge (v. 6).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>2. The Cities of Refuge</H2><P>Numbers 35:9-34 speaks of the cities of refuge.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD4>a. To Be Selected<br>after the Sons of Israel Crossed the Jordan<br>into the Land of Canaan</H2><P>The cities of refuge were to be selected after the sons of Israel had crossed the Jordan into the good land (vv. 10-11a). This indicates that the land east of the Jordan was not a part of the land of Canaan.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD4>b. The Manslayer Who Killed<br>Any Person without an Intent<br>Fleeing to One of the Cities of Refuge</H2><P>The cities of refuge were provided so that the manslayer who killed any person without an intent might flee there (v. 11b). Verse 12 says, "The cities shall be for you a refuge from the avenger, that the manslayer may not die until he stands before the assembly for judgment." In this way, a manslayer could be protected from the avenger.</P><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_174.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_176.html">Next</a> </body></html>
