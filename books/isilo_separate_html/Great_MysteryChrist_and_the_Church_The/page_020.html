<h1 class="title">THE CHURCH BEING<br />
THE BEAUTIFUL COUNTERPART OF CHRIST</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Eph. 5:25-32</h1>
<h2 class="head1">THE CENTRAL VISION&mdash;CHRIST AND THE CHURCH</h2>
<p>The Lord has given us a revelation over the last sixty years concerning Christ and the church, and we have published many periodicals and books with messages related to Christ and the church.</p>
<p>The Bible reveals that Christ is not only all-inclusive but also deep and vast; He is unfathomably deep and boundlessly vast. Although Ephesians speaks of the church, its revelation of the church is according to Christ. In Ephesians 3:18 Paul refers to Christ using the words <em>breadth, length, height,</em> and <em>depth.</em> Nothing is wider than Christ, nothing is longer than Christ, nothing is higher than Christ, and nothing is deeper than Christ. Christ is the breadth and length and height and depth of the universe. Christ is not only all-inclusive but also all-extensive. Our Christ is truly inexhaustible.</p>
<p>Christ is universally large, and so is the church&mdash;His Body. If my head were bigger than my body, I would be a monster. Regrettably, in Christianity today people speak of Christ, but they do not speak much about the church, the Body. Some even erroneously regard the church as a chapel. The Bible shows that the church is the Body of Christ; it is an inexhaustible mystery. The vision that we have seen for the past sixty years is not simple or superficial. It includes not only the revelation on the surface but also the central vision, the deep mystery in the Bible.</p>
<p>Ephesians 3 presents three crucial points: the mystery of Christ (vv. 4-6), the unsearchable riches of Christ (v. 8), and Christ making His home in our hearts until we become the fullness of God (vv. 17-19). Chapter 4 also presents three crucial points. The first crucial point is that the church is the Body of Christ because it is mingled with the Triune God. The Triune God is mingled with the church&mdash;the Spirit is the essence of the Body, the Son is the course of the Body, and the Father is the source of the Body. The Triune God is spoken of in verses 4 through 6, and in verse 6 alone, which says, &ldquo;One God and Father of all, who is over all and through all and in all,&rdquo; the Triune God is implied: <em>over all</em> refers to God the Father as the source, <em>through all</em> refers to God the Son as the Lord and Head being the Accomplisher, and <em>in all</em> refers to God the Spirit as the life-giving Spirit being the Executor in us. Therefore, in the reference to the Father in verse 6, we can see the aspects of the Father, the Son, and the Spirit. He is over all, through all, and in all. <em>Over</em> refers to the source, <em>through</em> refers to the process, and <em>in</em> refers to the result, the issue, which is the Triune God and the Body of Christ being fully mingled as one.</p>
<p>The second crucial point is that the Body needs to be built up, even though it has been mingled as one with the Triune God. The Body is built up through the growth in life, and the growth in life depends on the increase of God&rsquo;s element in us. The more God&rsquo;s element increases in us, the more we grow. Our growing together is the building. We need to grow in life to fulfill our function and build up the Body in love (vv. 13-16).</p>
<p>The third crucial point is that the Body needs to be transformed by putting off the old man and putting on the new man. Transformation produces the new man. The Body is a matter of life, and the new man is a matter of person. We need to put off the old man and put on the new man so that the Body may become the new man (vv. 22-24).</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_019.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_021.html">Next</a> </body></html>
