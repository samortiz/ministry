   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Christ Becoming Our Redemption</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Not only has Christ become righteousness to us from God, and not only has He become sanctification to us from God, but He has become redemption to us from God.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The meaning of redemption is to buy back or to free by paying a ransom.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>There are three things which are indispensable in any act of redemption.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The first is the person redeemed, the second is the redeemer, and the third is the price of redemption.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>All the redeemed ones were formerly sold under sin Rom 7:14 ; they were the slaves of sin.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Now the Lord Jesus has paid the price of the blood Matt 20:28; Mark 10:45; 1 Tim 2:6 and has redeemed us out of the curse of the law Gal 3:13 .</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>This shows us that the Lord is our Redeemer.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>But we have to go on one step further.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The Lord Jesus is not only our Redeemer, but also our redemption.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>If the Lord Jesus is only our Redeemer, He is still separated from the redeemed ones, in spite of the close relationship between the two a relationship of grace, of saving our lives.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The Lord Jesus has not only become our Redeemer but has become our redemption.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>This means that when we are redeemed, we are not only joined to a thing, but to a person.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>When we are redeemed, the Lord Jesus becomes one with us; the two become one.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Our redemption is a person.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>When we have Him, we have redemption.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Without Him we do not have redemption.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>If we want redemption, we need Him.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Once we have Him, we have redemption because He is the redemption.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Our redemption is not just a thing.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Our redemption is a person who is joined to us.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Christ has become our redemption.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Therefore, all those who have been washed by the blood can come boldly to God.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>While God judges the sinners, He can righteously pass over all those who are under the blood of the Lamb Exo 12:12-13; Rom 3:25-26 .</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>All the redeemed ones have experienced a full redemption.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>In God's eyes, all He sees is Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>It is as if He does not see any person; all He sees is Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Christ is the slain Lamb; His blood removes man's sin-record before God.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>When a man comes to God through Christ, God will no longer condemn him, because Christ has satisfied God's righteous requirement on man's behalf.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>He has borne sin's punishment on man's behalf.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Once a man has Christ, he has redemption.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>When God sees Christ, He sees redemption.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Christ is not only our redemption before God; He is also redemption within us.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Christ as our redemption within is particularly related to our body.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Christ as our redemption within not only delivers us from the law of sin in our members Rom 7:23; 8:2 , but has become life to our body.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Romans 8:11 says, "And if the Spirit of the One who raised Jesus from the dead dwells in you, He who raised Christ Jesus from the dead will also give life to your mortal bodies through His Spirit who indwells you."</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>This does not mean that we will be resurrected after we die.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>It means that He will give life to our mortal bodies today.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Second Corinthians 4:10-11 says, "Always bearing about in the body the putting to death of Jesus that the life of Jesus also may be manifested in our body.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>For we who are alive are always being delivered unto death for Jesus' sake that the life of Jesus also may be manifested in our mortal flesh."</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The most outstanding thing here is that verse 11 seems to be a repetition of verse 10.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Actually it is not a repetition.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Verse 10 says that the life of Jesus is manifested in our body, while verse 11 says that the life of Jesus is manifested in our mortal flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>With many believers, the life of Jesus may be manifested in their body, but may not be manifested in their mortal body.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The difference here is great.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Many believers are obedient and patient in times of sickness; they are not anxious, and they do not murmur.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>They feel the Lord's presence and manifest the Lord's virtues in their expression, their voice, and their actions.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Indeed the life of Jesus is manifested in their body through the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Yet they do not know that the Lord Jesus is able to heal their sickness.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>They do not know that the Lord Jesus' life is also for their body of humiliation.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>They receive grace from the Lord to endure the pain, but they do not receive the healing.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>They have the experience of verse 10, but do not have the experience of verse 11.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Brothers and sisters, we have to realize that Christ is redemption to our body.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>For our mortal body to be made alive does not mean that the nature of the body is changed or that we become immortal.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>The nature of the body remains the same, but a new life comes in to supply strength to the body.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Originally, the natural life was the source of strength of our body.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Now we are supplied by the life of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>When our body is sustained by the resurrection life of Christ, our body is enabled to work in a strong way.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Christ becoming our redemption is a big subject.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Christ as our redemption is not merely a matter of Him being the life of our body today, but it affords us a great hope, which is "the redemption of our body" Rom 8:21-23; 1 Cor 15:50-54; Phil 3:21 .</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>One day God will show everyone the way that He has redeemed the creation and the way that He made us His own.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Then our body will be redeemed and will put off corruption to put on incorruption; we will no longer be under the bondage of corruption, and we will enter into the liberty of glory.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Then the dead will rise up, and we will be changed.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Our body of humiliation will be transfigured to be conformed to the body of His glory.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Then we will see that our redemption is Christ!</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Who are those who have the assurance that they will be in the first the best resurrection?</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Who are those who have the assurance that their body will be transfigured one day?</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>We believe and we have the assurance because Christ is our redemption.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>First Corinthians 15:42-44 shows us that when a Christian dies, he is not buried, but is "sown."</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>We know that to sow something and to bury something are two entirely different things.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>For example, when you bury a piece of copper in the ground, that is all there is to it; it will not grow up again.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>But if you sow a grain of wheat into the ground, it will grow after a few days.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>When a Christian dies, he is not like a piece of copper buried in the ground, but like a grain of wheat sown into the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>One day he will spring up again.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>He can spring up again because he has the life of Christ within him.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>This life is a life that cannot be imprisoned by death, because the life of Christ is the resurrection life.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>This life is in the believer.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>This is why he will resurrect one day.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>Because Christ is our redemption, He will make us grow.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>Christ will not be imprisoned by death.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>A regenerated Christian has Christ within him.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>Christ is his redemption, and he will inherit a resurrected body which is incorruptible, glorious, strong, and spiritual.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>This is not all.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>Because Christ is our redemption, some Christians will not see death, but will be raptured.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>There was a young girl who once asked a preacher, "Does it not take a great effort for a Christian to be raptured away?"</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>For a child, the rapture takes great effort.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>But we know that the rapture is not something according to our concept.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>A Christian is raptured because Christ is in him.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>Christ is his redemption, and Christ will take him away.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>Christ as our life is the foundation of the Christian life.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>The first step in our salvation is regeneration.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>The last step in our salvation is the redemption of our body.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>But from beginning to end, the basis is Christ as our life.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>The relationship between Christ and us is a life relationship.</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>In other words, it is an indissoluble relationship.</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>Christ does not become something outside of us.</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>He has come into us to be our life.</S>
   <S PAR='98' RSNT='1' SNO='98'>A relationship in life is an indissoluble relationship.</S>
   <S PAR='99' RSNT='1' SNO='99'>If we have not received Christ as our life, we have nothing to do with Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='100' RSNT='1' SNO='100'>But since we have received Christ as our life, we have an indissoluble relationship with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='101' RSNT='1' SNO='101'>After Adam sinned, God immediately guarded the way of the tree of life with the cherubim and a flaming sword which turned every way Gen 3:24 .</S>
   <S PAR='102' RSNT='1' SNO='102'>He did this because if Adam had eaten the fruit of the tree of life, he would have bonded an indissoluble relationship with God.</S>
   <S PAR='103' RSNT='1' SNO='103'>Thank God that our relationship with Christ is a relationship which Adam did not have; it is an indissoluble relationship.</S>
   <S PAR='104' RSNT='1' SNO='104'>Even God Himself cannot dissolve this relationship.</S>
   <S PAR='105' RSNT='1' SNO='105'>This life lives in us all the time, and it is bringing us into glory, into eternity.</S>
   <S PAR='106' RSNT='1' SNO='106'>What a great power this is!</S>
   <S PAR='107' RSNT='1' SNO='107'>What a glorious hope this is!</S>
   <S PAR='108' RSNT='1' SNO='108'>May the Lord open our eyes to see that God has put us into Christ and made Christ our wisdom: righteousness, sanctification, and redemption.</S>
   <S PAR='109' RSNT='1' SNO='109'>May the Lord show us that of all the gifts He has given us, none is greater than His Son.</S>
   <S PAR='110' RSNT='1' SNO='110'>May the Lord show us that Christ is the gift and also all the gifts.</S>
   <S PAR='111' RSNT='1' SNO='111'>He is the singular gift and also the plural gifts.</S>
   <S PAR='112' RSNT='1' SNO='112'>We have to learn to know Christ as our wisdom.</S>
   <S PAR='113' RSNT='1' SNO='113'>We have to learn to know Christ as our righteousness, we have to learn to know Christ as our sanctification, and we have to learn to know Christ as our redemption.</S>
   <S PAR='114' RSNT='1' SNO='114'>May the Lord deliver us from foolishness and darkness so that we realize that there is no matter or thing in the spiritual realm.</S>
   <S PAR='115' RSNT='1' SNO='115'>All we have is just Christ.</S>
