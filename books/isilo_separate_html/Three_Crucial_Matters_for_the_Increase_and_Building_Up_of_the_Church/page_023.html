<h1 class="title">PREACHING THE GOSPEL OF THE KINGDOM<br />
IN THE WHOLE INHABITED EARTH</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Matt. 24:14; 28:18-20</h1>
<h2 class="head1">THE THREE GREAT ASSETS OF THE LORD&rsquo;S RECOVERY</h2>
<p>We have three great assets in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery, which no other Christian group has. We have the truth, we have churches all over the entire earth, and we can produce full-time serving ones. From 1922 to 1984 the Lord released more truths among us than among any other Christian group throughout history. From 1974 to 1984 we expounded the twenty-seven books of the New Testament. These messages are printed in more than one thousand Life-study messages. These truths are also in the footnotes of the Recovery Version of the New Testament. We inherited most of these truths from the believers who went before us, beginning with the church fathers in the first century to those in the Brethren assemblies in the last century. We did not invent these truths. Our understanding of the Bible is a combination of the light the church has received from the Lord over the past two thousand years and the revelation we have received from the Lord. For example, none of the believers who went before us clearly expounded the truth concerning the New Jerusalem, but in the book <em>God&rsquo;s New Testament Economy</em> we thoroughly and clearly expound the truth concerning the New Jerusalem.</p>
<p>A theological seminary in the Far East put out a publication in which they said that for the past forty years the local churches have influenced the exposition of the Bible among the Chinese. This is the situation in the Far East and in the West. There are many different Christian groups and broadcasters in America who use our publications as material for preaching. Christians cannot deny that during the past sixty years God has commissioned us with the truth. Therefore, the truth is our first asset.</p>
<p>The churches that have spread over the six continents are our second asset. In a little over twenty years more than three hundred churches were raised up in the West. This was not the work of man. Nearly eighty percent of these churches were raised up through reading our publications. At present there are about one hundred churches in the United States and Canada, approximately one hundred churches in South America, Central America, and Mexico, and about one hundred churches in Europe, Africa, and Australia. These are the three hundred churches that are in the Western hemisphere. There are more than three hundred churches in the Eastern hemisphere. From Japan and South Korea in the north to Hong Kong, Thailand, Malaysia, and Indonesia in the south, there are one hundred churches. There are eighty churches in Taiwan, and there are one hundred twenty churches on both the northern and southern islands of the Philippines. Therefore, there is a total of six hundred churches in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery in more than thirty different countries on the earth. No other Christian group has spread throughout the entire globe as the Lord&rsquo;s recovery has spread.</p>
<p>The ability to produce full-time serving ones is our third asset. There is no place on the earth that can compare to Taiwan in relation to producing full-time serving ones. In Taiwan transportation and communication are developed, education is widespread, public security is good, and the economy is well developed. These factors create the best situation for us to produce full-time serving ones. If we sent one thousand full-time brothers and sisters to South America, they would not meet the need; neither would three to five hundred full-time serving ones meet the need in Africa. Of course, the ones going to South America would need to speak Spanish, and the ones going to Africa would need to speak English. Taiwan needs to produce five hundred full-timers every year, and they must be fluent in foreign languages. We must gospelize Taiwan within the next five years and then go abroad to spread the truth.</p>
<h2 class="head1">SPREADING THE GOSPEL OF THE KINGDOM<br />
TO THE WHOLE INHABITED EARTH</h2>
<p>In the upcoming full-time training the saints will be trained in foreign languages. We need to strengthen the trainees in their ability to speak foreign languages, and we must teach them how to preach the gospel, that is, how to visit people from house to house in order to lead people to salvation. We must also teach the trainees how to establish churches. After the gospelization of Taiwan we will send a group of trainees abroad. They will go to Latin America, Indonesia, and Africa. Then they will learn Arabic in order to go to the Arabic-speaking world.</p>
<p>Matthew 24:14 says, &ldquo;This gospel of the kingdom will be preached in the whole inhabited earth.&rdquo; The Gospel of Matthew is a book on the kingdom. It presents the gospel of the kingdom, which is different from the gospel of the forgiveness of sins presented in Mark and Luke. According to the Lord&rsquo;s word in Matthew 24:14, the gospel of the kingdom must be preached wherever there are people. At the end of the Gospel of Matthew the Lord said, &ldquo;All authority has been given to Me in heaven and on earth. Go therefore and disciple all the nations, baptizing them into the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit, teaching them to observe all that I have commanded you&rdquo; (28:18-20). This word means that the Lord wants us to go and make all the nations His disciples.</p>
<p>The end of the Gospel of Mark says, &ldquo;Go into all the world and proclaim the gospel to all the creation&rdquo; (16:15). The end of the Gospel of Luke says, &ldquo;That repentance for forgiveness of sins would be proclaimed in His name to all the nations&rdquo; (24:47). The gospel referred to in these two portions is the general gospel. Only the gospel referred to in Matthew is the gospel of the kingdom. After the Lord rose from the dead, all authority in heaven and on earth was given to Him. Therefore, He wants us to establish His kingdom by discipling all the nations. He does not merely want us to go out and gain believers, but even more, He wants us to go out and gain disciples. Disciples are those who are trained and who live the kingdom life.</p>
<p>Our authority to announce the gospel of the kingdom depends on our knowledge of the truth. Many of our publications are concerning the truth of the kingdom presented in Matthew and the truth of the divine life presented in John. Paul also spoke of the kingdom and of life, because he considered the church to be the kingdom. Our commission is to go and preach the gospel of the kingdom to every part of the inhabited earth and to cause every believer to become a disciple of the kingdom. In this last age the Lord has given us the highest and the final truths. This is His sovereign arrangement. In the past missionaries from different countries traveled great distances across the oceans to preach the gospel in China. Now Chinese &ldquo;missionaries&rdquo; must go to the different countries to preach the truth. They will not go as pioneers; rather, they will go to fight the battle with the truth, to bring the gospel of the kingdom to the whole inhabited earth.</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_022.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_024.html">Next</a> </body></html>
