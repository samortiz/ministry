[1]  CONTENTS Our Urgent Need The Spirit of the Triune God Not Good or Evil but Life Two Kinds of Fruit Out of the Divine Life
[2]  CHAPTER ONE OUR URGENT NEED THE SPIRIT OF THE TRIUNE GOD Scripture Reading: John 1:29, 32-33; 3:5-6; 4:24; 6:63; 7:37-39; 14:17; 16:13; 20:22; Rev 2:7; 5:6
[3]  In this small book and particularly in this chapter, we want to see what our urgent need is today.
[4]  If we desire to have a proper church life, we need to live and work according to the tree of life, not according to the tree of the knowledge of good and evil.
[5]  We need to walk by the Spirit to bear the fruit of Christian virtues so that we can be prevailing in the gospel to bear the fruit of saved persons regenerated with the divine life.
[6]  When you are living in your daily life, do you realize that you are one with God, that you are one spirit with the Lord?
[7]  The Spirit of God, the life-giving Spirit, and the Holy Spirit are the one Spirit.
[8]  THE SPIRIT AS THE REALITY OF ALL POSITIVE THINGS
[9]  The reason that we become old is because we are short of the Spirit, who is the processed Triune God.
[10]  CHAPTER TWO NOT GOOD OR EVIL BUT LIFE Scripture Reading: John 4:10-14, 20-21, 23-24; 8:3-9; 9:1-3; 11:20-27
[11]  The book of John stresses our need of the Spirit, who is the reality of the divine life.
[12]  In her talk with the Lord, He pointed out to her that she needed the living water v. 10 . The living water is the Triune God, even the Son of God, the very Christ who became the life-giving Spirit 1 Cor 15:45b . This was all that the woman needed.
[13]  They asked the Lord, "Rabbi, who sinned, this man or his parents, that he should be born blind?" v. 2 . Jesus answered, "Neither has this man sinned nor his parents, but that the works of God might be manifested in him" v. 3 . This case is a small one, but its principle is very great.
[14]  The case in chapter nine shows us that whatever situation we are in should remind us that we need Jesus, and this very Jesus today is the life-giving Spirit.
[15]  Life is the processed Triune God; the tree of life indicates God, Christ, and the life-giving Spirit as one Person.
[16]  I had just seen something of the tree of life and had repented that my past had been so much in the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, involving matters of right or wrong and yes or no. Therefore, I dared not to answer yes or no. I dared not to exercise anything of the tree of knowledge.
[17]  We do not care for anything but this one living Person, who is life, resurrection, God, the Spirit, and the reality of all the divine things to us.
[18]  TWO KINDS OF FRUIT OUT OF THE DIVINE LIFE Scripture Reading: Gal 5:16-26; 2 Pet 1:3-11; John 15:16
[19]  In this chapter we want to see the truth of the two kinds of fruit out of the divine life.
[20]  According to the revelation of the Scriptures, there is a divine principle set up by God as His design, as His economy.
[21]  This design is that God wants to dispense Himself into us human beings to live in us as our life.
[22]  According to the Bible and according to our experience, this life produces two categories of fruit.
[23]  In godliness, the expression of God, we need to supply brotherly love v.
[24]  Then in this brotherly love, we should supply love, the divine love, the nobler and higher love v. 7 . This love is much higher, stronger, and greater than brotherly love.
[25]  At this point in the growth in life, we are fully with God, in God, and have God Himself as our love.
[26]  Faith may be considered as the seed of life, and this nobler love may be considered as the fruit of the seed of life in its full development v. 8 . Faith is God and love is also God.
[27]  Then if we are diligent to supply virtue to faith, knowledge to virtue, self-control to knowledge, endurance to self-control, godliness to endurance, and brotherly love to godliness, we will reach God Himself as the very substance of the divine love.
[28]  THE FRUIT OF SAVED PERSONS REGENERATED WITH THE DIVINE LIFE
[29]  If we are such fruit-bearing believers in the Christian virtues, the second category of fruit will be borne by us.
[30]  The Lord said that He is the vine tree and we are the branches v. 5 . The branches of the vine tree do not merely bear the fruit of the Christian virtues.
[31]  The fruit borne by the branches in John 15 denotes the saved persons regenerated with the divine life through the dispensing of the branches v. 16b . This is proved by the requirement that the bearer of this fruit should "go forth" v. 16a . To bear ethical and moral virtues as fruit does not require us to go forth.
[32]  In simplicity we should take Christ as our divine power, energizing within us, and take Him as the life- giving Spirit, the very companion with whom we should walk all day.
