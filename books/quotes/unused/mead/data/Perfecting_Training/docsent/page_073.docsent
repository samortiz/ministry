   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>REGENERATED AND RECONSTITUTED</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>You have to realize that to be a son of God, you first need to be regenerated.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>We were not born sons of God; we were born sons of men, descendants of Adam.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>We were born sons of man; we were constituted sons of man; we were educated sons of man.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Then suddenly we were reborn to be sons of God.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>As sons of God we had a new start, our regeneration.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Following regeneration we need reconstitution.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>We need both regeneration and reconstitution.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>You may have been regenerated, but have you been reconstituted?</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>To be transformed and conformed is to be reconstituted.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>You were a son of man, and you have been regenerated to be a son of God.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>But today you don t live like a son of God.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>You still live like a son of man.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>You have been reborn, yet you have not been reconstituted.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>This reconstitution will continue to take place even to the time of the redemption of our body.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Although some have not experienced the redemption of their body, yet they have been reconstituted to a certain extent.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Because they have been reconstituted, they can control and subdue the unredeemed body.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Even now we are much under the influence of our body.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Our body exercises a big role in our daily life, our family life, and, unfortunately, even in our church life.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>But when we will have been reconstituted to a certain extent, our body will be fully under the control of the reconstitution.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>This means that the body will not play that much role in our daily life and our fleshly body will not exercise too much influence over our Christian walk.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>This is why the opening words of chapter twelve indicate that we need to offer our body.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>In chapter twelve you could see consecration on the surface.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>That is somewhat superficial.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>It is not just a matter of consecration; it is a matter of the full control and the full subduing of your body.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Most Christians misinterpret the offering of the body in chapter twelve.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>In certain meetings people may be encouraged to offer their body to be a missionary.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>But Romans twelve says we offer our body not to be a missionary, but to be a sacrifice.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Everyone may like to be a missionary; nobody likes to be a sacrifice.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>To offer your body as a missionary doesn t need any subduing, any control, of the body.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Your body, because it is still not yet redeemed, is rebellious.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Unless your entire being has been reconstituted, you cannot control your rebellious body.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Now we are going deeper and deeper to touch some part of the depths of Romans.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Why could we not enter into the practical Body life?</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Because our body is still so rebellious.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Our unredeemed body is still not under any kind of bridle; we cannot manage it.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Why?</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Because we are still short of reconstitution.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>We have been regenerated, and now we are being reconstituted.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Our reconstitution has not reached that standard where we are able to control this unredeemed body.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>We all have to see that to enter into chapter twelve of Romans, we must pass through chapter eight.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>If we are going to enter into the Body life, we must pass through the sonship.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The sonship is just the building up of the organic union.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>We have been regenerated.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>We secured the organic union in our regeneration.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>But after securing the organic union we need to build it up.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The building up is the sonship.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>When we are living practically as the sons of God, we are the members of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>The Head of this Body is the firstborn Son of God, and all the members of this Body are the many sons of God.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>They are the many brothers of the firstborn Son of God.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>You have to see what the Body of Christ is.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>It is just a composition of the sons of God.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>The Body of Christ is totally just a composition of the divine life.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>The sons of God are just the expression of the divine life.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>The Son of God is the expression of the Father, the divine life, and we are the many sons; so we also are the expression of the divine life.</S>
