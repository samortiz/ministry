   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER EIGHTEEN THE DIVINE DISPENSING</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>OF THE DIVINE TRINITY ISSUING IN</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>THE BUILDING UP</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>OF THE BODY OF CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>INTO A FULL-GROWN MAN Scripture Reading: Eph 4:1-32 GRACE GIVEN ACCORDING TO THE MEASURE</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>OF THE GIFT OF CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Ephesians 4 is a long chapter containing many diamonds.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The first of these diamonds is the grace revealed in this chapter.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Verse 7 says, But to each one of us was given grace according to the measure of the gift of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Here grace is given according to the gift, but in Romans 12:6 the gifts differ according to grace.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Grace is the divine life that both produces and supplies the gifts.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>In Romans 12 grace produces the gifts, and therefore the gifts are according to grace.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>But in Ephesians 4 grace supplies the gifts, and therefore grace is according to the measure of the gift.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>First the divine life produces the gift, and then it supplies the gift.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Such a producing and supplying life is grace, which is given according to the measure of the gift.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The measure of the gift of Christ refers to the size of a particular member of His Body.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>This measure can be compared to the way blood is supplied to the members of our physical body according to their size.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>A shoulder, being a large member, receives a large volume of blood, whereas a finger, being a small member, receives a small amount of blood.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The supply of blood is according to the size of the members of our body.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>In the Lord s Body, the Body of Christ, certain members are large.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>These members include the apostles, prophets, evangelists, and shepherds and teachers.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Paul, Peter, and John were large members of the Body, and much grace and divine life were supplied to them.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>According to Ephesians 4:7, grace is something high and profound.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Grace is actually the divine life dispensed into our being to supply us as gifts in the Lord s Body.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Grace is also mentioned in verse 29: Let no corrupt word proceed out of your mouth, but only that which is good for needful building up, that it may give grace to those who hear.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Grace is Christ as our enjoyment and supply, and our word should convey this grace to others.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The word that builds up others always ministers grace to those who hear.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>In verses 7 and 29 grace refers to Christ as the divine life dispensed into our being for our enjoyment and supply.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>THE TRUTH IN JESUS</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Another diamond in Ephesians 4 is truth: Since indeed you have heard Him and been taught in Him as the truth is in Jesus v. 21 . The truth in Jesus is the real situation of the life of Jesus as recorded in the four Gospels.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>In the godless walk of the nations, the fallen people, there is vanity.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>But in the godly life of Jesus there is truth, reality.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Jesus lived a life of doing everything in God, with God, and for God.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>God was in His life, and He was one with God.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>This is the truth in Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>We, the believers, regenerated with Christ as life and taught in Him, learn from Him as the truth is in Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The truth in Jesus is God Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>According to the Gospels, Jesus lived a life not merely of morality or ethics, but of God.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>His life expressed God.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>God is the reality of His life, and this reality is truth.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Therefore, instead of saying as the truth is in Jesus, we may say as God is in Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Concerning truth, verse 24 says, And have put on the new man, which according to God was created in righteousness and holiness of the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The definite article before truth in this verse is emphatic.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>As the deceit in verse 22 related to the old man is the personification of Satan, so the truth here related to the new man is God s personification.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>As mentioned in verse 21, this truth was exhibited in the life of Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>In the life of Jesus righteousness and holiness of truth were always manifested.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>In the righteousness and holiness of this truth, which is God realized and expressed, the new man was created.</S>
