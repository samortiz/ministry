   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>III.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>LUKE</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>A. The writer s , the place, and the time: The early church recognized Luke as the author of both this Gospel and Acts.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Luke s authorship is evident from the style of composition of the two books.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Luke was a Gentile Col 4:14, cf.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>11 , probably an Asiatic Greek, and a physician Col 4:14 .</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Starting in Troas, he joined Paul in his ministry and accompanied him in his last three ministry journeys Acts 16:10-17; 20:5 21:18; 27:1 28:15 .</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>He was a faithful companion of Paul until Paul was martyred Philem.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>24; 2 Tim 4:11 .</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Hence, his Gospel should represent Paul s views, as Mark s represents Peter s.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>This book was written before the book of Acts Acts 1:1 , probably about A.D. 60.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>It may have been written in Caesarea while the apostle Paul was in prison there.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>It was written to Theophilus 1:3 and footnote 2 .</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>B. The subject: the gospel of redemption proving that Jesus Christ is the Man-Savior living a life in the highest standard of morality.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>C. The background: It may seem that the Gospel of Luke is not as profound as the Gospel of Matthew or as mysterious as the Gospel of John.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The reason for this is that Luke gives us a record of our Savior, the Lord Jesus, as a Man.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>A man, of course, is not profound when compared to God.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Although the Gospel of Luke is not the most profound or mysterious of the four Gospels, it is the most sweet and pleasant of the Gospels.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Yes, God is profound.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>But when He became a man, He became sweet and pleasant.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Luke does not stress the dispensational aspect or the Jewish background as Matthew does.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The Gospel of Luke is the Gospel written to mankind in general, announcing the good news to all people 2:10 .</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Its characteristic is absolutely not Jewish, but Gentile 4:25-28 .</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>It is a Gospel to all sinners, both Jews and Gentiles.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>As such, its record is according to the sequence of morality, not according to the sequence of historical events.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>In this respect Luke is similar to Matthew.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Matthew s sequence is the sequence of doctrine concerning the kingdom, and Luke s sequence is the sequence of morality.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Therefore neither Luke nor Matthew was written according to the sequence of historical events.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>D. The central thought: According to the Gospel of Luke, our Savior lives, behaves, and works in the highest standard of morality.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Moreover, His salvation is carried out in the highest standard of morality.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Therefore, we need to keep in mind that the subject of the Gospel of Luke is the Man-Savior and His salvation in the highest standard of morality.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>This highest standard of morality is an issue of His human virtues being fully strengthened and enriched by the Father s divine attributes.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Today the very Christ who lives in us is still the One who possesses the human virtues strengthened and enriched by the divine attributes.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>While He was on earth, He lived a life in the highest standard of morality.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Such a life was a composition of the divine attributes and the human virtues.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Of course, the Lord Jesus lived this kind of life outside the disciples.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>But from the time of His resurrection He has been living this kind of life within the believers.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>This means that within us today the Man-Savior is still living a life in the highest standard of morality, a life that is a composition of the divine attributes and the human virtues.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>If we see this, we shall say with Paul, It is no longer I, but Christ lives in me Gal 2:20 .</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>E. The general sketch: The gospel of Luke displays and presents to us mainly five crucial and excellent aspects concerning the Man-Savior: His birth, ministry, death, resurrection, and ascension.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>His birth is of and with the Spirit of God essentially, making Him a God-man to be the Man-Savior 1:35 .</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>His ministry is by and through the Spirit of God economically to carry out God s economy in His jubilee 4:18-19 .</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>His death is by the God-man to accomplish God s redemption for man 23:42-43 and to release Himself into man as the fire of life to burn on the earth 12:49-50 .</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>His resurrection is: a God s vindication of Him and of His work; b His success in all His achievements; and c His victory over the universal enemy of God.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>His ascension is God s exaltation of Him, making Him the Christ of God and the Lord of all Acts 2:36 , to carry out His heavenly ministry on the earth as the all-inclusive Spirit poured out from the heavens upon His Body composed of His believers Acts 2:4, 17-18 , as recorded also by Luke in his further writing called the Acts.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>F. The sections: 1 introduction 1:1-4 , 2 the preparation of the Man-Savior in His humanity with His divinity 1:5 4:13 , 3 the ministry of the Man-Savior in His human virtues with His divine attributes 4:14 19:27 , 4 the Man-Savior s presentation of Himself to death for redemption 19:28 22:46 , 5 the death of the Man-Savior 22:47 23:56 , 6 the resurrection of the Man-Savior 24:1-49 , and 7 the ascension of the Man-Savior 24:50-53 .</S>
