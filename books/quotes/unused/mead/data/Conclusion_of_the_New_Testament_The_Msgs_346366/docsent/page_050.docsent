   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The Sphere and Element of Grace</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>In 2 Timothy 2 Christ is presented as the sphere and element of grace.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>This passage reveals that Christ is the seed of David, raised from the dead v. 8 for the salvation of God s chosen people with eternal glory v. 10 , and that Paul, His servant, was empowered in the grace which is in Christ Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>a. The Seed of David Raised from the Dead</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>In verse 8 Paul says, Remember Jesus Christ, raised from the dead, of the seed of David, according to my gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The word raised indicates Christ s victory over death by His divine life with its resurrection power.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The expression seed of David indicates Christ s dignified human nature, which was exalted and glorified along with His divine nature.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The words my gospel indicate that the apostle s gospel is the glad tidings of the living person, Christ, who possesses both the divine nature and the human nature, who was incarnated to be the Son of Man and resurrected to be the Son of God, as related in the parallel portion, Romans 1:1-4.</S>

   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>For the Salvation of God s Chosen People</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>with Eternal Glory</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>In 2 Timothy 2:10 Paul continues, Therefore I endure all things for the sake of the chosen ones, that they themselves also may obtain the salvation which is in Christ Jesus with eternal glory.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The chosen ones denotes the believers in Christ, who were chosen by God the Father before the foundation of the world Eph 1:4 and selected from among mankind for salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The apostle endured all sufferings for the sake of us, the chosen ones, that we too may obtain salvation, as he did.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>In 2 Timothy 2:10 Paul does not speak of salvation and eternal glory but of salvation with eternal glory.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Eternal glory is the ultimate goal of God s salvation Rom 8:21 ; God s salvation leads us into His glory Heb 2:10 .</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>This encourages us to endure sufferings for the gospel Rom 8:17 .</S>

   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>In This Grace</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>His Servant Being Empowered</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>In 2 Timothy 2:1 Paul says to Timothy, Be empowered in the grace which is in Christ Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>This verse indicates that Christ is the sphere and element of grace.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>While the church was degrading, Timothy was empowered to stand against that degradation.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>He could do this by the grace which is in Christ Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>God s grace is powerful, enabling us to bear anything.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>This empowering grace will make us living and strong.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>We should be strong in the power of the Lord s grace for God s economy.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Whereas 2 Timothy 1:1 reveals that the promised life constituted Paul an apostle, 2:1 unveils that grace empowered Timothy.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>These two verses show that we may serve God not only by the constituting of the promised life but also by the empowering of grace.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Today we need to be empowered in the grace, which is the processed Triune God dispensed into us for our enjoyment, so that we may commit the healthy words that we have experienced to faithful men, who will be competent to teach the same healthy words to others also v. 2 . We are to be empowered in this grace not to do miracles but to commit the healthy words that we have enjoyed to faithful men to produce many competent teachers, whose speaking will inoculate the church against the decline.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Being empowered in the grace will issue in our becoming a teacher v. 2 , a soldier v. 3 , a contender v. 5 , a farmer v. 6 , a workman to cut straight the word of God v. 15 , and a vessel unto honor v. 21 .</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>89.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The Deliverer of the Believers</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>from Persecutions</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>In 2 Timothy 3:11-12 we see that we may experience and enjoy Christ as the deliverer of the believers from persecutions.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>a.All Who Desire to Live Godly in Christ Jesus</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Being Destined to Be Persecuted</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>In 2 Timothy 3:12 Paul says, Indeed all who desire to live godly in Christ Jesus will be persecuted.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The Greek word translated desire can also mean determine.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>To live godly is to live a life of godliness.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>All those who desire, determine, to live a life of godliness in Christ Jesus will be persecuted.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>For this reason we should not expect good treatment from today s religion.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Instead, we should expect persecution for living a godly life in an ungodly situation.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>As long as we stand for God s economy, we will be condemned, opposed, and attacked.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Rumors will be spread concerning us, and our names will be smeared and defiled.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Such persecution comes mainly not from the worldly people but from so-called Christians.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>In John 16:2 the Lord Jesus said that the time is coming when those who kill the disciples will think that they are serving God.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Out of their zeal for God, they will kill the followers of the Lord, simply because these ones do not follow the traditional way.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>If we desire to live godly in Christ Jesus, we should expect nothing but persecution.</S>
