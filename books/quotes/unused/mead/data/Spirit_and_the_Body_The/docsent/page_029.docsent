   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE EARNEST</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The anointing and the sealing are the earnest, the foretaste, the guarantee.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The Greek word for earnest has an interesting background.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>When an ancient Greek purchased a parcel of land, the seller gave the buyer a box of soil from that land.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>That box of soil was called the earnest or guarantee.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>It assured the buyer that he was not purchasing poor land.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>By receiving a sample of the soil, he could be assured that the land was rich and fertile.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The sample, the foretaste, was the guarantee that all the land was exactly like the soil in the box.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>It was the guarantee of receiving a good parcel of land.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>God is our inheritance, our parcel of good land.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>We have not yet possessed the whole of this land.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>What we are enjoying today is simply the box of soil, the foretaste.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>This foretaste is the earnest, the guarantee, assuring us that the day is coming when we shall receive our inheritance.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The whole of our inheritance will be the same as the foretaste, just as the whole piece of land was the same as the soil in the box.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Hence, the foretaste is the guarantee that the full taste is coming; it is the guarantee of the whole inheritance, which is God Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>An illustration of the foretaste of the Spirit is seen in cooking.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Before sisters serve a meal, they often enjoy a foretaste of that meal in the kitchen.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The day will come when we shall inherit God in a full way.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>What we are enjoying of Him today is the same in element, in taste, and in substance as what we shall enjoy in the future as the full taste.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The difference is only in quantity, not in quality.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>We are enjoying the foretaste, and we are looking forward to the full taste.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Although the anointing we enjoy today is rich and wonderful, it is simply the foretaste; the full taste is yet to come.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The anointing brings us the divine element, the sealing gives us the divine image, and the foretaste gives us the divine taste.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Now we have the divine element, the divine image, and the divine taste.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>How wonderful!</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Day by day the all-inclusive, life-giving Spirit brings us the divine element.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>At the same time it gives us the divine image and the divine taste.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Now we are tasting our God, who is our inheritance.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>THE FIRSTFRUIT</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>This foretaste is the firstfruit mentioned in Romans 8:23.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>We all have this firstfruit of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Suppose you have a peach tree in your yard.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Although the tree may be full of fruit, only a few of the peaches will ripen first.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>These are the firstfruit.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Today the Spirit of God within us is the firstfruit.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The harvest will take place when we are raptured.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>At that time, we shall enjoy God as our full crop, our full harvest.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>But today we are enjoying Him as the firstfruit.</S>
