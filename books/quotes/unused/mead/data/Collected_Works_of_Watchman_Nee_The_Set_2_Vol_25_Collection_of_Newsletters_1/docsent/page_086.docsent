   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>A LETTER FROM NING HAI, CHEKIANG PROVINCE</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>To my brother in the Lord, Brother Yueh Chiao:</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>May the Lord preserve you brothers in Shanghai in peace and may your bodies and spirits remain healthy in this very hot summer.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The meeting in Ning Hai held a ten-day training for the workers from July 18 to July 28.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Many believers came from all the localities to attend the training.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Brother David Hsu was led by the Lord to come bear the responsibility for the meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>In the mornings he spoke about how Christ is the Head over all things and about the position of the overcomers.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>In the evenings, he preached the gospel to sinners.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>In the afternoons, we discussed the truth concerning the church.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>We really praise the Lord because He gave a good testimony through Brother Hsu and drew many people to the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Some among us have already written a letter corporately to the China Inland Mission requesting that they allow us to meet freely in the Lord's name.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The only relationship we will have with them is our relationship in the Lord, nothing else.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>If they do not concede, a small number of us will leave.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>As for the other matters, we do them one by one as we receive the light.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The most difficult point is how to discern those who still have doubts concerning the matter of salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>This matter requires the prayer of the brothers.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Brother Hsu is still here now.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>I exhorted him to rest several days before leaving.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Is Brother Nee in Shanghai?</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Have Brother Chang Kuang Jung and Brother Chou Hsin Yi returned from Tsinan?</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Please greet them for me.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Parts omitted.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>I bless you with peace in the Lord!</S>

   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>When this letter arrives, please send us an answer quickly.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>If you yourself cannot come, it would be best if you could send another brother.</S>
