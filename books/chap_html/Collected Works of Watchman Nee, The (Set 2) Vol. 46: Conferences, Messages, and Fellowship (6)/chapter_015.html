<h1 class="msg">CHAPTER ONE HUNDRED SEVENTY-THREE</h1><h1 class="title">GOD'S ETERNAL PURPOSE</h1><p>The first thing we should recognize is that God is a God of purpose. In Matthew 10:29 the Lord said, "Not one of them [sparrows] will fall to the earth apart from your Father." Even the death of a sparrow, which seems too trifling to note, is something that God takes account of. The Creator of the whole universe has a will regarding even one sparrow.</p><p>God is a God of purpose, and He has a purpose concerning creation. Creation was not an accident, but the expression of a definite purpose on the part of God. God purposed and creation was with a view to the accomplishment of that purpose. Modern theology makes redemption more important than creation. Yet creation was part of God's original purpose, redemption was only remedial. Redemption was brought in to restore that which had been diverted from God's purpose. God sought to arrive at a purpose by creation, but something intervened. Redemption brings things back to God's original intention.</p><p>Ephesians 1:5 speaks of "the good pleasure of His will," and verse 9 speaks of "the mystery of His will according to His good pleasure, which He purposed in Himself." Verse 11 says, "The purpose of the One who works all things according to the counsel of His will." Ephesians 3:11 also says, "According to the eternal purpose which He made in Christ Jesus our Lord." In Ephesians 1 the eternal purpose is referred to as something that God "purposed in Himself," while in chapter three we read that this purpose was "made in Christ Jesus our Lord."</p><p>We have to go back to eternity past to discover what this purpose was. In eternity past God purposed something very definite in Himself (Eph. 1); then all this definite purpose was summed up in Christ Jesus our Lord (Eph. 3). God in eternity past had a counsel with His Son. His purpose was that His Son should be "all and in all" (Col. 3:11). The creation was with this end in view. It was for the purpose that the Son should be the sum total of the universe (Eph. 1:10).</p><p>God is the eternal Creator, and it is essential to His nature that He express Himself in creation. He could not be satisfied in any other way. An artist cannot be content without expressing his art in painting. A musician must express the music that is in his soul, and a mechanic craves to do work suited to his temperament and gift. In the same way, the Creator must express Himself in creation. Being such a God as He is, the creation of mere inanimate objects could not possibly satisfy Him. He had to create beings capable of responding to Him; hence, these beings had to have a free will. God created two orders of beings&mdash;angelic and human&mdash;both with a free will. In creating free-will beings, He necessarily ran a great risk, because it lay with them whether they would set their wills for or against Him.</p><p>God first created the angelic beings. These were to be ministering spirits. In His foreknowledge He was aware that some of them would rebel and that the archangel would become His archenemy. Their rebellion consisted of raising the created will against the uncreated will. Note the many "I wills" of Satan in Isaiah 14. God could easily have destroyed all of His enemies with one word from His mouth, but the destruction of an inferior power in that way would not have been glorifying to the name of the Almighty God. It was "His good pleasure" to bring in another order of created beings&mdash;men&mdash;also free-will agents, that they might link their wills with His and cooperate with Him in dealing with the rebellious will. God brought man in to undo what Satan had done. Man was created and put in the garden of Eden to "keep it." The original word implies to "guard it." This implies that there was an enemy seeking to intrude and that God was seeking man's cooperation against him. Man was put in the place of authority to deal with the situation. (The rebellion of Satan touched the entire universe; therefore, it was necessary for Christ in redemption "to reconcile all things to Himself...whether the things on the earth or the things in the heavens" (Col. 1:20). Hebrews 2:9 says, "So that by the grace of God He might taste death on behalf of everything," not "every man" as in the King James Version. According to 9:23, there had to be a purifying of the very heavens by the blood of Christ.)</p><p>God did not nullify Satan's power after his rebellion, but in a moral and spiritual way, He sought to deal with it through man. Therefore, Satan still held sway throughout the universe. When God created man, Satan immediately sought to make man his ally against God. However, his deception of man was a great mistake because his sphere of activity, which until then had been unlimited, became confined to the earth. When Satan tempted man and gained man's allegiance, God could righteously pronounce judgment on him and confine his sphere to the earth. Satan sought to involve man in his rebellion. Yet in the process, he became involved with man and became related to this earth. "Upon thy belly shalt thou go, and dust shalt thou eat all the days of thy life." Genesis 3:14 was God's verdict upon the serpent. His sphere of movement was the ground, and his food was "dust," that is, what man was made of before God breathed into him "the breath of life." Because man capitulated to the devil, the adversary was authorized to have the "dust" element of man for his subsistence. He had judicial rights in that realm. Man had given him ground and submitted to him, and Satan has a just claim upon man. The "flesh" (the carnal nature of man) is Satan's ground. Christ did not deny Satan's claim, but He took this ground away from him through His cross and removed his judicial right to man. In order for us to wield authority over the enemy, it is necessary for the cross to deal with the entire "flesh" element in us.</p>
