   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>LIFE-STUDY OF ROMANS MESSAGE THIRTEEN THE BONDAGE OF THE LAW IN OUR FLESH 2 II.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>THREE LAWS</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In the previous message we saw the two husbands revealed in Romans 7:1-6.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In this message we shall consider the three laws revealed in 7:7-25.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>I would like to read each verse and, when necessary, make some comments on it.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>What shall we say then?</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Is the law sin?</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Certainly not!</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>But I had not known sin except through the law; for I had not known coveting except the law had said, You shall not covet v. 7 . This verse makes it quite clear that the law gives us the knowledge of sin, for the law exposes sin and identifies it as sin.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>But sin, taking occasion through the commandment, wrought in me coveting of every kind.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>For without law sin is dead v. 8 . Sin utilizes the law, and the law helps sin to work in us.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Hence, the law was not given to help us, but to assist sin.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Without law, or apart from the law, sin is dead.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>For I was alive without the law once; but when the commandment came, sin revived and I died v. 9 . Surely the law does not help us; it helps sin.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The law came to revive sin, to make sin alive.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Before the law came, sin was dormant.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>However, when the law appeared, sin was quickened and revived.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>And the commandment which was unto life, this was found to me to be unto death v. 10 . Although the law was supposed to be unto life, eventually, as far as we are concerned, it was death.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>For sin, taking occasion through the commandment, deceived me, and through it killed me v. 11 . Sin is a killer and the law is the killing instrument.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The law is the knife used by sin to kill us.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Without a knife or killing instrument it is difficult to kill people.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Sin, using the law, firstly deceives us and then kills us.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Since the acts of deceiving and killing are certainly the behavior of a person, we must consider sin as the personification of Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>So that the law is holy, and the commandment holy and just and good v. 12 . There is no problem regarding the nature of the law.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The nature, the essence, of the law is holy, just, and good.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Did then that which is good become death to me?</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Certainly not!</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>But sin, that it might appear sin, working death to me through that which is good; that sin through the commandment might become exceedingly sinful v. 13 . This verse is additional proof that the law does not help us.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Instead, the law makes sin exceedingly sinful.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Are you still attracted by the law?</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>We must stay away from it.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>For we know that the law is spiritual; but I am fleshly, sold under sin v. 14 . The phrase sold under sin means sold to sin.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Sin is the buyer, the buying master, and we have been sold to him.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>For what I do, I do not acknowledge; for what I will, this I do not practice; but what I hate, this I do v. 15 . The word acknowledge in this verse does not mean that we do not know.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>How can we say that we do not know what we do?</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Certainly we know.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>This verse means that Paul did not acknowledge what he did.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>It means that although we may act wrongly we do not acknowledge it or approve it.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>But if what I do not will, this I do, I agree with the law that it is good.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>So now it is no longer I that do it, but sin that dwells in me vv.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>16-17 .</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Paul says that it is no longer he who does what he does not want to do, but sin that dwells within him.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The word dwells is not the same Greek word that is elsewhere translated abide ; it is a Greek word that actually means make a home, because the verb has the root meaning of home or house.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Therefore, this verse does not mean that sin simply abides or remains within us for awhile, but that sin makes its home in us.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Thus it is no longer we who do the evil that we do not want to do, but sin that makes its home within us.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>For I know that in me, that is in my flesh, nothing good dwells; for to will is present with me, but to do the good is not v. 18 . Paul does not say that there is nothing good in him; he says that there is nothing good in his flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>We must pay careful attention to the modifier used by Paul in my flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Never say that there is nothing good in you, for there is good within you.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>However, in our flesh, that is, in our fallen body, nothing good dwells.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>In our fallen body, which the Bible calls flesh, sin dwells with all its lusts.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Thus, nothing good is found in our flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>For the good which I will, I do not; but the evil I do not will, this I practice v. 19 . This verse proves that there is good within us, for we do have a good will, a will to do the good.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>However, we are unable to practice the good that we will to do.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>But if what I do not will, this I do, it is no longer I that do it but sin that dwells in me.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>I find then the law that, at my willing to do the good, the evil is present with me vv.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>20-21 .</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Verse 21 mentions the law that operates whenever we will to do good.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>This law is evil, for whenever we attempt to do good, the evil is present with us.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>The Greek word translated the evil in this verse denotes that which is evil in character.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>For I delight in the law of God according to the inner man, But I see a different law in my members, warring against the law of my mind and making me a captive in the law of sin which is in my members vv.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>22-23 .</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Verse 22 mentions the law of God in which Paul delights according to the inner man.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>We may label this as law number one.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>In verse 23 Paul refers to the law of the mind, which we may label law number two.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Since this law is the law of the mind and the mind is a part of our soul, it means that there is a law in our soul.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Verse 23 also mentions what Paul calls a different law in my members.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Since this law is in our members and our members are a part of our flesh, our fallen body, it means that in our flesh is another law.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>This law, law number three, wars against the law of our minds.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>In 7:23 we find two laws fighting against one another, warring against one another.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Paul says that this different law in our members makes us captive to the law of sin.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>This law of sin which is in my members is equivalent to the different law in my members mentioned earlier in the verse.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>This law is the third law.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Thus, in this one verse we find two laws: one is a good law in our mind, and the other is an evil law in our members.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>Wretched man that I am!</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>Who will deliver me from the body of this death? v. 24 . Why is our body termed the body of this death? Because in our body is the evil law that wars against the good law in our soul.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>This evil law makes our body a body of this death.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>What is this death ?</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>It is the death of being defeated, the death of being made captive and carried away by the law of sin in our body.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>Thanks be to God through Jesus Christ our Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>So then with the mind I myself serve as a slave the law of God, but with the flesh the law of sin v. 25 . This verse gives the answer to the question raised in the preceding verse.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>According to verse 25, deliverance from the body of death is through Jesus Christ our Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>In this verse Paul tells us that with his mind by himself, not in his spirit by the Lord Jesus, he served the law of God as a slave.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>He also says that with his flesh he served the law of sin.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>In 7:7-25 we see three laws, and it is possible for us to locate them.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>A. The Law of God</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>The law of God is just, good, holy, and spiritual vv.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>12, 14, 16 .</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>This law is outside of us or we may say that it is above us.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>This law of God makes many demands and requirements of the fallen man that he might be exposed vv.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>7-11 .</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>B. The Law of Good</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>While the law of God is above us and outside of us, making demands upon us, the law of good is in the mind of man s soul vv.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>23, 22 .</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>We may say that the law of good in our mind corresponds to the law of God and responds to its demands, trying to keep it vv.</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>18, 21, 22 .</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>Whenever the law of God places a demand upon us, the good law in our soul responds to it.</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>If the law of God says, Honor your parents, the good law in our mind immediately replies, Amen!</S>
   <S PAR='98' RSNT='1' SNO='98'>I will do it.</S>
   <S PAR='99' RSNT='1' SNO='99'>I will honor my parents.</S>
   <S PAR='100' RSNT='1' SNO='100'>This has been our experience throughout life.</S>
   <S PAR='101' RSNT='1' SNO='101'>Each time the law of God made a demand the law of good in our soul responded and promised to fulfill it.</S>
