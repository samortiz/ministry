   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>QUESTION THIRTY-THREE CONCERNING THE TIME</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>OF OUR CRUCIFIXION</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>At what moment were we crucified with Christ?</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Was it between the time He was put on the cross and the time He expired, or was it at the very moment He expired?</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>ANSWER</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>If we understand question thirty-two, we can conclude that we were crucified with Christ at the moment He expired.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Prior to His expiration, He was engaged in the work of redemption, bearing our sins, and dying for us.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>If we were crucified with Him during that time, we would have been participating in His redemption and, thereby, we would have become saviors.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Saying this would be a great mistake.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Some say that since the Lord Jesus was on the cross for six hours and did not die instantly, we must also have been crucified with Him for six hours.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>If this were the case, we would have also participated in the Lord's redemption.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>This is absolutely not so.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>We died with Christ at the moment He expired.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The only One who suffered was the Lord Himself, but the effect is ours.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>We thank and praise God!</S>
