   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>II.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>LIFE BEING CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>God is life.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>This is wonderful.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>But how can we fallen sinners contact and receive God to be our life?</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>God knows how.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>He comes to us in His Son Jesus Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The Bible further reveals to us that God became flesh, which is Christ John 1:1, 14 .</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Since Christ is God Heb 1:8 , He has the life of God in Him John 1:4 , therefore, He is also life 1 John 5:12 .</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>He said many times that He is life John 11:25; 14:6 and that He came to earth that we may have life John 10:10 .</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Therefore, we who have believed and received Him have Him as our life Col 3:4 .</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Just as life is God Himself, so also life is Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Just as having life is having God Himself, so also having life is having Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Just as to live out life is to live out God Himself, so also to live out life is to live out Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Just as life is not different in the least from God, likewise life is not different in the least from Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Just as a slight deviation from God is not life, likewise a slight deviation from Christ is not life.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>For Christ is God being life.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>It is through Christ and as Christ that God is manifested as life.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Hence, Christ is life and life is Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Without Christ, we do not have God nor do we have life Eph 2:12; 1 John 5:12 .</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>By receiving Christ, we receive God as our life.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Then all the riches of God that are in Christ become ours to enjoy every day.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>III.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>LIFE BEING THE HOLY SPIRIT</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>After seeing that Christ, the embodiment and manifestation of God is life, we may ask where Christ is today and how can we contact Him and receive Him as life?</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Although Christ is life, it is difficult for Christ to give you life.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Who gives life?</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>It is the Spirit that gives life John 6:63; 2 Cor 3:6 .</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Christ is life, but it is the Spirit who gives us Christ as life.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Without the Spirit Christ may be life, but Christ as life cannot be given to us.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>By being the Spirit Christ is imparted into us as life.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Today, after being processed, the very Christ is the life-giving Spirit 1 Cor 15:45b .</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Never forget that Christ is the very God, Jehovah the Savior, God with us.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Christ is God.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>This Christ, after being processed, is now the life-giving Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>We have to enjoy Him in His fullness as such a Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>After the Lord Jesus said He was life in John 14:6, He made known to His disciples not only that He and God are one vv.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>7-11 , but also that the Holy Spirit and He are also one vv.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>16-20 .</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>In verses 16 and 17 the Lord referred to the Holy Spirit as "He," but in verse 18, He changed the pronoun from "He'' to "I."</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>By changing the "He'' to "I'' the Lord was saying that "He'' is "I."</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>This reveals that the Holy Spirit He spoke of in verses 16 and 17 is He Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>From verses 7 to 11 He showed us that He is the embodiment of God He is in God, and God is in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Hence, His being life means that God is life.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>From verses 16 to 20, He further revealed that the Holy Spirit is His embodiment, His other form; and when His physical presence leaves us, this Spirit of reality who is Himself as another comforter comes into us and abides with us.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>This Spirit living in us and abiding with us is just He Himself living in us as our life that we may live.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>These two passages therefore show us that it is by God being in Him and Him being the Holy Spirit that He is life.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>God is in Him as life, and He is the Holy Spirit as life.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>First Corinthians 15:45 says, "The last Adam became a life-giving Spirit.''</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>The last Adam is the Lord Jesus who was crucified to end the fallen adamic race.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>In His resurrection, He became a life-giving Spirit; therefore, all that Christ has received from the Father is now in the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>This Spirit is called the Spirit of life in Romans 8:2.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>As the Spirit of life He is able to free us from the law of sin and death.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>He is also life in our spirit, may be life in our mind, and is able to give life to our mortal body Rom 8:10, 6,11 .</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>The way to have life is the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>The way to be saved in His life is the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>The way to reign in life is the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>The way to walk in newness of life is the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>The way to be sanctified in life is the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>The Spirit is the way.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Life belongs to the Spirit, and the Spirit is of life.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>These two are actually one.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>We can never separate life from the Spirit, nor the Spirit from life.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>The Lord Jesus Himself said, "The words that I speak unto you, they are Spirit, and they are life'' John 6:63 .</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>In this word the Lord Jesus connects the Spirit and life.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>If we have the Spirit, we have life; if we do not have the Spirit, we do not have life.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>If we walk in the Spirit, we walk in life, but if we do not walk in the spirit, we do not walk in the newness of life.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Thus, the way to experience the divine, eternal, uncreated life is the Spirit.</S>
