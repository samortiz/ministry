   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Many groups of Christians call themselves churches.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>But what ground are they standing on when they call themselves churches?</S>

   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>They are shaking hands over a fence.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Some call themselves non-denominational churches.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>These are like those in 1 Corinthian 1:12 who said that they were of Christ.</S>
