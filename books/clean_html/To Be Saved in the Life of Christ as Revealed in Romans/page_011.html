<h2 class=head3>In the Light of the Judgment Seat</h2><p>We must receive the believers in the light of the judgment seat of Christ (Rom. 14:10, 12). In receiving the believers, we surely need to exercise a certain amount of discernment. However, we should not overjudge others in our unbalanced concept and in our personal preference. When we are about to judge another Christian, we must realize that we ourselves have many shortcomings and weak points that need to be judged. Therefore, we should not judge others today according to our view. All the believers, including us, will be judged at the judgment seat of Christ. We should receive every believer in the light of this judgment.<h2 class=head3>In the Principle of Love</h2><p>The church life is altogether a life of love. The Lord has charged us with this more than strongly in John 13:34-35 and 15:12 and 17; the apostles also repeated the Lord’s charge to us (1 Thes. 4:9; Heb. 13:1; 1 Pet. 1:22; 1 John 2:10; 3:14; 4:7). In receiving the believers, we must do it in the principle of love (Rom. 14:15a). Whatever we would do and say to other believers must be based on and controlled by the divine love that we have enjoyed and continue to enjoy all the time. We must not forget that all the believers are a treasure to the Lord in His affection because He has obtained them with His own blood in His love (Acts 20:28; Eph. 5:25b). We need to walk in love toward them. We should not destroy by anything the believers for whom Christ died (Rom. 14:15b).<h2 class=head3>According to the Kingdom Life</h2><p>This kind of receiving of the believers for the proper church life is according to the kingdom life. Romans 14:17 says, “The kingdom of God is not eating and drinking, but righteousness and peace and joy in the Holy Spirit.” The church life which is God’s kingdom life today is a matter of righteousness, peace, and joy in the Holy Spirit. God’s kingdom life is not a matter of diet, nor of the keeping of days, nor of any kind of formality and custom, but a matter of the reality of the divine life in the Spirit of God, such as righteousness in strictness toward ourselves, peace in the all-embracing love toward others, and joy in the exulting praise toward God. Our receiving of the believers must be in such a sphere with such an atmosphere.<h2 class=head3>According to Christ</h2><p>Our receiving of the believers should also be according to Christ (Rom. 15:5), who did not please Himself (Rom. 15:3). We should take Christ as our pattern, our center, and our everything in the practice of the church life. Whether or not we receive someone depends on whether or not Christ has received him. If Christ has received someone, we must receive him, as Christ also received us to the glory of God (Rom. 15:7).<h2 class=head2>Turning Away from Those Who Make Divisions and Causes of Falling</h2><p>The living of the church life in a locality also involves turning away from those who make divisions and causes of falling (Rom. 16:17-18). The present rebellion among us involves mainly two things: divisions and causes of falling. Those involved in the present rebellion are attempting to proselytize the saints, to make them leave the recovery. If they are unsuccessful at this, they try to cause the saints to be disappointed. This disappointment causes the saints to fall. In Romans 14 and 15 Paul encourages us to be all-embracing concerning the believers. But in Romans 16 Paul tells us to turn away from those who make divisions and causes of falling (v. 17). We should be all-inclusive toward the believers, but we still need to have some discernment for the keeping of the oneness of the Body of Christ. We must discern what we should receive and what we should turn away from. Chapters fourteen, fifteen, and sixteen of Romans are all on the proper church life. To have the proper church life, we must practice according to these three chapters. First, we must receive all the believers; second, we must be all-embracing toward the believers; and third, we also must exercise discernment concerning the divisive ones and those who make causes of falling. To turn away from the divisive ones and those who make causes of falling is to quarantine these divisive ones. When a person in a family is sick with a contagious disease, the members of the family turn away from the infected person so that they will not be contaminated with the same disease. If they do not turn away from the infected member, they may become infected themselves and spread the contagious germs to other members of their family. This does not mean that the members of the family do not love the infected member or have given him up; it simply means that the other members want to prevent the spread of the contagious germs.
