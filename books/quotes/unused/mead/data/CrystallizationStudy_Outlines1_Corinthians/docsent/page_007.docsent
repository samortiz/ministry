   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Message Seven The Lord s Table and the Lord s Supper Scripture Reading: 1 Cor 10:14-22; 11:17-34 The record regarding spiritual eating in the Bible is a strong indication that God intends to dispense Himself into us by the way of eating Gen 2:9, 16-17; Exo 12:1-11; 16:14-15; Deut 8:7-10; Rev 2:7, 17; 3:20; 22:14: To eat is to contact things outside of us and to receive them into us, with the result that they eventually become our constitution Gen 2:16-17.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Food is anything we take into us for our satisfaction; whatever we desire, hunger, and thirst after is the diet according to which our being has been constituted Job 23:12b; Jer 15:16; Num 11:4-6.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>What a person eats gets into him and causes him to become an expression of that thing; this is based on the principle that eating is a fellowship, a participation 1 Cor 10:16, 21.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Eating is the way to experience God s dispensing and to be mingled with Him for His expression Gen 1:26; 2:9.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>We are what we eat; therefore, if we eat God as our food, we will be one with God and even become God in life and in nature but not in the Godhead John 6:32-33, 35, 41, 48, 50-51.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>We live according to that with which we are occupied and saturated; if we eat Christ and are saturated with Him as the life-giving Spirit, we shall live Christ v. 57; Phil 1:21a.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The entire Christian life should be a feast, an enjoyment of Christ as our banquet 1 Cor 5:7-8; 10:16-17: We should all eat the same spiritual food, not eating anything other than the Lord or enjoying anything in place of the Lord vv.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>3-4.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Eating is related to enjoyment; if our enjoyment is something other than Christ, then in the sight of God that enjoyment is idolatry vv.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>7, 14, 22.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The emphasis of the Lord s table is the fellowship of His blood and body, the participation in the Lord, the enjoyment of the Lord in mutuality, in fellowship vv.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>16-17, 21: The Lord has given Himself to us that we may partake of Him and enjoy Him by eating and drinking Him: The One who presents His body and blood to us is Christ as the all-inclusive Spirit 15:45b; 2 Cor 3:17.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>This wonderful Christ is everything to us for our enjoyment; all that He is, is for our participation and enjoyment.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The cup of blessing which we bless, is it not the fellowship of the blood of Christ?</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The bread which we break, is it not the fellowship of the body of Christ?</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>1 Cor 10:16: Fellowship here refers to the believers communion in the joint participation in the blood and body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The fellowship makes us, the participants in the Lord s blood and body, not only one with one another but also one with the Lord; we make ourselves identified with the Lord in the fellowship of His blood and body.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>In 1:9 the fellowship is the fellowship of the Son of God; in 10:16 the fellowship is the fellowship of His blood and body, indicating that He has been processed for our enjoyment.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Seeing that there is one bread, we who are many are one Body, for we all partake of the one bread v. 17: We are all one Body because we all partake of the one bread; our joint partaking of the one bread makes us all one.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Our partaking of Christ makes us all His one Body; the very Christ of whom we all partake constitutes us His one Body.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The table with the body and blood of Christ is the reality of Christ as the good land; whenever we come to the Lord s table to enjoy Him as the all-inclusive One, in our experience we are in the good land enjoying the riches of the land.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Our participation in the Lord s table must be in the unique fellowship of His unique Body, without any division either in practice or in spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The emphasis of the Lord s supper is the remembrance of the Lord 11:24-25: At the Lord s table we receive His body and blood for our enjoyment; at the Lord s supper we give Him our remembrance for His enjoyment.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Regarding the Lord s table and the Lord s supper, there is mutuality; the Lord s table is for our enjoyment, and the Lord s supper is for His enjoyment.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The word unto in verses 24 and 25 implies a result a continual remembrance of the Lord for His satisfaction.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The real remembrance of the Lord is to eat the bread and drink the cup vv.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>24-25: The bread is of life, and the cup is of blessing John 6:35; 1 Cor 10:16.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>To eat the bread and drink the cup is to take in the redeeming Lord as our portion, our life and blessing; this is to remember Him in a genuine way.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>As often as you eat this bread and drink the cup, you declare the Lord s death until He comes 11:26: To take the Lord s supper is not to remember the Lord s death but to declare and display it.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>We should take the Lord s supper unto the remembrance of Him by declaring His redeeming death until He comes back to set up God s kingdom Matt 26:29.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>When we eat the Lord s supper with a view to a continual remembrance of Him in His first and second comings, that supper becomes a satisfaction to Him in relation to the kingdom, God s administration.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>In taking the Lord s supper we must discern the Body to determine whether the bread on the table represents the unique mystical Body of Christ 1 Cor 11:29.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Eating the Lord s supper should remind us to live a life in the church to bring in the kingdom for the satisfaction of the Lord Jesus v. 26; Matt 26:29.</S>
