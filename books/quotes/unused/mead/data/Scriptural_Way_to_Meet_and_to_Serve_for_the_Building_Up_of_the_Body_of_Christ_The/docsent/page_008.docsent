   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>A Teaching to Minister Christ</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>and the Things Related to God</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>A saint may also have a teaching to minister Christ and the things related to God for the edification of the believers and the building up of the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Learn to give a teaching.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>A proper teaching can take from two to five minutes to present.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Our teaching is mainly to minister Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Do not teach concerning other things.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The saints come to the church meetings to learn to know, enjoy, and receive Christ and the things related to God.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>To teach in the way of ministering Christ is for the edification of the saints and the building up of the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>A Revelation to Unveil the Economy of God</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>When we come to the meetings, we may also have a revelation to unveil the economy of God concerning Christ and the church as the Body of Christ for the corporate expression of the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Some sisters in certain places may come to the meetings to teach others how to eat vitamins, take herbs, and get the proper exercise.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Do not do this.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>You have to limit your speaking and concentrate your speaking on Christ, the church, and other things related to God.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Speak words that edify the Christian life and that build up the Body of Christ Eph 4:29 .</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>We have many books that can help us and provide us with the proper utterances with which to speak.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>We have the Holy Bible in our hands and publications such as the Life-studies and Life Lessons that open up the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>We should not say that we do not have time to get into this material.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>We all have time.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>If we spend time in these life-giving publications, we will discover that we do have the time.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>If we will not exercise to do this, we will always feel that we are too busy.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Even a person without a job may feel that he is a busy man.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>We need to pick up the burden to learn how to be a speaking Christian at all times.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>We should learn to speak God, speak Christ, speak the word of the Lord, speak salvation, and speak the life supply to the young believers.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Then whenever we come to the meeting, we will be bubbling with much to say.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>A Tongue to Magnify God or an Interpretation</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>to Make a Tongue Understandable</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>In the Christian meeting, a believer may have a tongue to magnify God for a sign to the unbelievers and for the building up of the church Acts 10:46; 1 Cor 14:22, 5 or an interpretation to make a tongue understandable to the attendants 1 Cor 14:13 .</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>When we come to the meeting, we should have something of the Lord to minister to others from the items listed in 1 Corinthians 14:26.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>If all the attendants have something of Christ to share, the meeting will be full of mutuality.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>THE REQUIREMENTS ON THE BELIEVERS</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>FOR THEIR MEETINGS To Be Filled with the Spirit and with Joy</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Now we need to see the requirements on the believers for their meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The first requirement is to be filled with the Spirit and with joy Acts 13:52 .</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>We should not think that it is hard to be filled with the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>To be filled with the Spirit is easy and normal.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>In the past, Christian teachers made a mistake by telling people that it is very difficult to be filled with the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Some taught that one must fast and pray for a certain period of time and fulfill other requirements in order to be filled with the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Over fifty years ago, I believed all these things.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>But gradually through the years, I have learned that it is not that hard to be filled with the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>When I was a young Christian, I was also told that it was not so easy to be regenerated.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The inner life people called regeneration the first blessing.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>After a person was regenerated, they said that he must have the fullness of the Spirit, which was the second blessing.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>If someone had the first blessing, they would rejoice over him, and if someone had the second blessing, they would rejoice even more.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Eventually, I found out that both regeneration and the fullness of the Spirit are very easy to receive and are normal experiences.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Brother Nee illustrated by snapping his fingers to show how instant and easy regeneration is.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>He said, To be regenerated is just like this, and he snapped his fingers.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>When a sinner hears the gospel, repents of his sins, and calls on the name of the Lord, he is instantly regenerated.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>An unbeliever may pray a short prayer such as, O Lord Jesus!</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>I love You.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>I take You as my Savior.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Lord, thank You for dying on the cross for my sins.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>At a certain point in his prayer, something clicks like the click of a camera taking a picture, and the divine scenery of Christ gets into him.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>The living Christ comes into a person instantaneously like the click of a camera or the snap of one s fingers.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Although regeneration is instant, it is also miraculous.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>D. L. Moody said that regeneration was the biggest miracle in the universe, but he also illustrated that it was instantaneous.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>After one of his gospel preaching meetings, he came down from the platform to talk to a lady who was a new one.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Right at the critical juncture when the click was about to occur, someone made a disturbance.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Moody said that he did his best to bring that lady back to that critical juncture, but he could not.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>I have experienced the same thing in the preaching of the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>In our training of the full-time young people, we train them how to go out with The Mystery of Human Life.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>We teach the trainees to watch and observe the one with whom they are speaking, to look for the critical juncture when they will receive the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Right at that juncture, the trainees are charged to ask them to pray.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>They are instructed not to ask the new ones to pray earlier or later than this juncture.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>They must watch for the appropriate time when the click of regeneration can occur.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>The camera has to take the picture at the right time.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>In 1958 I bought a good camera with the intention of taking pictures during a trip I was taking to England and Denmark.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Before that time, I had never used a camera.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>I happily took many pictures on my trip, but when I received the film back from the developer, every picture was blank.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>At first I did not know what had happened, but then I recalled that I had never taken the lens cover off of the camera.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>We should not go out to use The Mystery of Human Life in the way that I tried to take those pictures.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>In our speaking to the unbelievers, we must try to remove their lens cover.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>When we realize that the cover is off, we should immediately ask them to pray.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>When the cover is still there and you ask them to pray, they will not receive the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>To be filled with the Spirit and with joy is also miraculous but easy and normal.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>This requires a thorough confession of your sins, failures, wrongdoings, defeats, shortcomings, bad points, and mistakes, great or small.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>Make a thorough confession.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>As a rule it will usually take about twenty minutes.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>As long as you have finished a thorough confession of your sins, you have to realize that you have been filled with the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>The Spirit is not far away from you today.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>He is within you Rom 8:9 , and He is waiting to fill you up.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>He is like the air waiting to fill an empty vessel.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>As long as the vessel is full, the air is unable to fill it.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>The extent to which the vessel is empty is the extent to which the air can fill it.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>When you empty yourself thoroughly, the Spirit fills you thoroughly.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>This filling does not depend upon your feeling.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>As long as one really repents and believes into Jesus Christ, he will be regenerated by the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>Likewise, as long as you confess all your failures and sins, you will be filled with the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>One of the top signs of being filled with the Spirit is that we have joy and peace.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>Before we make a thorough confession, we may not have that much joy and peace.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>But if we would confess all of our failures and make a thorough confession, we will immediately have joy and peace within.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>Acts 13:52 says that the disciples were made full of joy and of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>As long as we can rejoice in the Lord, that is a sign that we have the infilling of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>Whenever we come to a meeting, we must come with the infilling of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>To be filled with the Spirit also requires faith in the Triune God according to the word of the Scriptures.</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>Since we have cleared up our situation with God, we have the ground to have faith in Him, believing with full assurance that He is within us and that He is our everything.</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>We must have this kind of faith in God and come to the meetings with such a faith.</S>
