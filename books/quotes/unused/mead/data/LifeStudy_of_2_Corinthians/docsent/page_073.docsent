   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>BECOMING SOBER RIGHTEOUSLY</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In 1 Corinthians 15:34 Paul says, Become sober righteously and do not sin, for some are ignorant of God.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In this verse, to become sober is to awake to soberness from a drunken stupor.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>It is to cease, righteously, to be drunken.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Anyone who is spiritually asleep is not right with God, with others, with himself, or with the church.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The context of this verse is Paul s word concerning resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>To say there is no resurrection offends God and man, and it is a sin.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Hence, the apostle advised the misled Corinthians to awake soberly from this sin to be right with God and man.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>They were drunken unrighteously in a stupor of the no-resurrection heresy.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>They needed to cease being in that stupor.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>To take in the heretical thought that there is no resurrection is to allow one s self to be drugged, to be put into a drugged condition.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>This is also to be asleep.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Those who are in such a drugged stupor talk in a nonsensical way with respect to resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>As a result, they are not right with God, with the church, or with themselves.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Rather, they offend God, the church, and even others in their family.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Those who are drugged often cause trouble without realizing it.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Therefore, Paul charges the Corinthians to wake up, to become sober righteously.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>What does it mean to become sober righteously?</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>It means to become sober in such a way that we are right with God, with others, and with ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>A believer who is sober righteously will be right with his wife, with his children, with his neighbors, with all the saints, with the church, and also with himself.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Those who are not right in all these ways are in a stupor.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>EXPERIENCING THE MINISTRY OF THE SPIRIT</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>IN THE CHURCH LIFE</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>If we did not have the new covenant ministry, we would not have the Spirit, and we would not have righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Before you came into the church life and received the ministry in the Lord s recovery, how much did you experience of the Spirit as the life supply in you?</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Of course, as a saved person you had the Spirit dwelling in you.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>But probably you did not have much consciousness that the Spirit was living, active, real, and substantial in you.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Many of us can testify that after coming into the church life, we began to realize that there is something within us that is living, real, and substantial.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>This is the Spirit within us working and making us joyful, peaceful, and restful.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>This is the Spirit of life ministered into us as the life supply by the ministry in the Lord s recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Before you experienced the Spirit in this way, it may have been very easy for you to argue with your wife or husband.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>But if you experience the Spirit as your life supply, something within restrains you when you want to argue.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>For example, a sister may be tempted to blame her husband, but deep within she realizes that she should go into her room and pray.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>This experience comes from the Spirit as the life supply that is ministered into us through the new covenant ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Perhaps in a church meeting not a word is spoken concerning the Spirit as the life supply.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>You may have no consciousness of the Spirit being ministered into you.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>But although nothing is said concerning this, it is nevertheless a fact that in the meeting the Spirit is ministered to you.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>There is a ministry in the recovery which inscribes the processed Triune God as the life-giving Spirit into our being.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Often in the meetings of the church we receive the supply of the Spirit without being conscious of this fact.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>I can testify that many times I have returned home after a meeting feeling somewhat unhappy.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>It seemed that I was angry with everyone and everything.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Nevertheless, something within me was moving and living.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>This is the life-giving Spirit I experienced in the meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Even when we are angry or unhappy, this Spirit operates within us.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>If we turn to the Lord and say, Lord, our unhappiness or our anger will be swallowed up.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>This comes from the life-giving Spirit who has been ministered into us without our being conscious of it.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Because I receive the supply of the life-giving Spirit in the church meetings, I very rarely miss a meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>It does not matter to me who speaks in a particular meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>My only desire is to be in the meeting and to receive the supply.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>In particular, I enjoy the prayer meeting of the church in Anaheim.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>During that meeting I am infused and saturated with the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Afterward, it seems that everything is golden and that within me the tree of life is growing and the river of life is flowing.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Although there is no message and even no word of encouragement, the life-giving Spirit is ministered into my being.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Many among us can testify of this experience.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>BECOMING RIGHTEOUS</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>As a result of experiencing the Spirit living and working within us, we become righteous.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Spontaneously our inner being is transparent, crystal clear, and we know the heart of God.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Immediately, without effort, we know the mind of the Lord and have a clear understanding concerning His will and work.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Then what we do is according to the Lord s mind and will.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>This is righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Many Christians have the concept that when we do something wrong, we are not right with God.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>This concept of righteousness is too superficial.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Even when we do not do anything wrong we still may not be right with God, for our being may not be in the mind and will of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Apparently we are not wrong in any way; however, our entire being may be far short of being right with God.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>We may not be according to the Lord s mind, and what we are doing may not be His will.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>As long as we are not doing God s will, we are not right.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Instead we are wasting our lives and everything the Lord has given us.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Suppose a young person at school does not do anything wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>But he does not study properly.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Furthermore, when he sits in class, he is absent-minded.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Even though he may not do anything wrong, he is more wrong than other students.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Outwardly he may not be wrong, but inwardly his whole being is wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>In the same principle, outwardly many saints are not wrong in anything.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>Actually, their being is not in the will of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>This understanding of being right with God is not merely according to doctrine, but even the more, it is according to experience.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>If you are infused and saturated by the life-giving Spirit, your inner being will become transparent.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>Then you will know what is in the Lord s mind.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>You will also understand what the will of the Lord is.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>Spontaneously, you will be in His will and do His will.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>As a result, you become right with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>Moreover, you will realize how you should act toward others and even how you should deal with your material possessions.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>Then you will become a righteous person, one who is right in small things as well as in great things, one who is right with God, with others, and with himself.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>This is a person who expresses God, for his righteousness is the image of God, God expressed.</S>
