<h1 class="title">THE ENJOYMENT OF CHRIST<br />
FOR THE CHURCH MEETINGS</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: John 3:15-16; 6:48; Eph. 3:8; 1 Cor. 15:45b; Phil. 1:19; John 6:57; Eph. 6:17-18; John 6:63; Rev. 2:7, 4-5, 17, 15; 3:20, 15, 18</h1>
<p>In the previous chapters of this book we have seen much concerning the riches of Christ as the embodiment of the processed Triune God. The purpose for seeing these things is that we may enjoy Christ. Our enjoyment of Christ is for the church meetings. Many Christians attend church services, but few know the relationship between the enjoyment of Christ and the Christian meetings.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE PRACTICE OF THE CHURCH LIFE</h2>
<p>In the United States twenty-five years ago, I discovered that the words e<em>njoy, dispense,</em> and <em>practice</em> were not used in regard to the Christian experience. I have used such words in order to minister what I have seen of the Lord concerning the experience of Christ. One day in Los Angeles in 1964, several of the leading ones came together to draft a statement which described the purpose of our meetings. The brothers also asked me to compose a part of this statement. This statement required the use of the word <em>practice;</em> therefore, I included this word in the phrase, &ldquo;the practice of the church life.&rdquo; Today this phrase is very common among us, but in those days, it was not a very familiar term. One of the leading brothers was a high school teacher in English. When he read my composition, he questioned the use of the phrase &ldquo;the <em>practice</em> of the church life.&rdquo; He felt that this phrase was not good English, so I asked him to improve it. After trying for a period of time to find a better way to say it, he said that he could not think of anything better and that we should use the phrase I composed. From that day until now, the word <em>practice</em> has been accepted for use in our church life.</p>
<h2 class="head1">EATING CHRIST</h2>
<p>We also use the word <em>enjoy</em> to describe our experience of Christ. Christ is enjoyable. He is even eatable and drinkable. Our eating and drinking is our enjoyment. Since 1958 I began to use the word <em>eat</em> concerning the enjoyment of Christ. Today I use it very emphatically. In 1958 before I visited England, I held a conference with the church in Taipei. During that conference, the term <em>eating Christ</em> came to me. The burden concerning this matter was quite heavy. One night after a strong message on eating Christ, a learned brother, who was a professor from a prominent university in Taiwan, came to see me. He said, &ldquo;Brother Lee, the message was very wonderful. But the word <em>eat</em> seems to be too wild. Could we really eat the Lord Jesus?&rdquo; He asked this question because to eat someone up in Chinese slang has a very poor meaning. I said, &ldquo;Brother, this word <em>eat</em> is not my invention. The Lord Jesus Himself spoke this word in John 6:57&mdash;&lsquo;He who eats Me shall also live because of Me.&rsquo;&rdquo; When I pointed out this verse to him, he said, &ldquo;I have nothing to say because the Lord Jesus said this.&rdquo; Then I responded, &ldquo;Since the Lord Jesus said to eat Him, surely we also have to say the same thing.&rdquo; We all have to learn to say that Jesus is eatable. He is the bread of life (John 6:35, 48, 51). If we have a piece of bread, is it not right to say that the bread is eatable?</p>
<p>Some Christian groups may speak about and stress that Jesus is the bread of life, but very few have told people to eat Christ. In John 6:48 the Lord Jesus said that He was the bread of life, and in John 6:57 He said, &ldquo;He who eats Me shall also live because of Me.&rdquo; In Greek the word for &ldquo;eats&rdquo; in verse 57 is literally &ldquo;masticates.&rdquo; To masticate is to eat finely, thoroughly, and absolutely. Jesus came not only to die for our sins but also to be our daily bread, our food. Christ being the bread of life and the matter of eating Him are mentioned together in the same chapter. This is logical. The Lord Jesus told us that He is the bread of life, and He must also show us how to take Him as the bread. The bread is not for our appreciation outwardly; it is for our eating.</p>
<p>Years ago I put out a series of messages entitled, &ldquo;Eating, Drinking, and Enjoying God.&rdquo; This may sound very rough and wild to some. When John the Baptist was preaching in the wilderness, everything about him seemed wild. His eating was wild, his clothing was wild, and his way of living was wild. He denounced the entire culture at that time. Then the Lord Jesus came to tell people to eat Him. This may also seem wild, but in reality we must eat Christ, who is the embodiment of the Triune God. The more we eat Christ, the better. The best way to eat Him is to masticate Him. When we taste Him in such a way, we will surely testify that Jesus is eatable and delicious (Psa. 34:8; 1 Pet. 2:3; Heb. 6:4-5).</p>
<p>At the start of God&rsquo;s relationship with man in Genesis 2, God placed man in front of the tree of life (Gen. 2:9). Immediately, God brought this man out of His creating hand to the tree of life. This indicates that what God wanted man to do was to eat the tree of life. The tree of life is a sign, signifying that the creating God is the life supply to His created man. Then in Revelation 2:7 the Lord Jesus says that he who overcomes will be given to eat of the tree of life. At the end of the Bible there is the holy city with the river flowing with the living water (Rev. 22:1). In the flow of the living water grows the tree of life (v. 2).</p>
<p>This tree of life is the Lord Jesus. In the Gospel of John the Lord Jesus told us that He is the vine (John 15:1, 5). The description in Revelation 22 indicates that the tree of life is a vine tree. Verse 2 says that the tree of life is &ldquo;on this side and on that side of the river.&rdquo; What tree, other than a vine tree, can grow in this way? It does not grow upward like a pine tree&mdash;tall and stretching toward the heavens; but it grows like a vine close to the earth on the two banks of the river. If the tree of life were tall like a pine tree and its fruit were at the top, its fruit would be too high for us to reach without difficulty. But the tree of life as a vine is lower than we are; thus, it is so easy to obtain its fruit.</p>
<p>In the Gospel of John the Lord Jesus told us that He is the vine, and He also told us that He is the life (14:6; 11:25). Putting these two things together&mdash;the vine tree and the life, we can see that Jesus is the tree of life. The vine tree must be the tree of life. As the tree of life He is a fruit tree for eating, not a pine tree for building materials. He is a vine full of life for eating. For eternity, we are destined to eat Christ as the tree of life, which is the fullest expression of Jesus Christ. The riches of Christ are not for us to study; they are for us to eat and enjoy. Before 1958 there was very little realization concerning this matter in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery. To eat Jesus is a new term among the Lord&rsquo;s children today.</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_035.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_037.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>The Scriptural Way to Meet and to Serve for the Building Up of the Body of Christ &nbsp; pg 36</div><br></body></html>
