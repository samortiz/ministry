<h1 class="msg">CHAPTER TWO</h1>

<h1 class="title">THE PROGRESSIVE REVELATION OF GOD<br />
IN THE BIBLE</h1>
<p>It is a great blessing to have the Bible. There is only one revelation in this divine book. From the first chapter to the last chapter, the revelation is consistent yet progressive. All believers know that the Bible reveals God. Of course, nature, including the heavens, the earth, and man&rsquo;s being, reveal something of God (Rom. 1:20). The efficient and beautiful design of our physical body clearly shows that there is a God who designed us. For instance, our front teeth function like knives to cut our food, and our tongue efficiently moves the food to our back teeth, which grind it up to be swallowed and digested. Someone must have designed this. The heavens, the earth, and the living things on the earth did not come into being through evolution. It is truly foolish to say that there is no God. Although creation reveals the existence of a Creator, to try to know what kind of God He is by examining nature would be very difficult. Today we have a clear revelation of God in the Bible. In this divine book God gives us a progressive revelation of Himself.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE &ldquo;BACHELOR&rdquo; GOD</h2>
<p>There is a wonderful progression in the Bible. In the first chapter of this divine book God was only God. We may say that He was a &ldquo;bachelor&rdquo; God, a term that might not seem proper according to the religious concept. We all need to be freed from the &ldquo;cage&rdquo; of religion to soar in a clear sky to see the revelation in the pure Word. In Genesis 1:1 God was alone. Of course, God by Himself was rich, perfect, and complete, but He was a God without someone to match Him. We know that God realized that it was not good for Him to remain alone, for He said that it was not good for the man whom He had made in His image to be alone (v. 26; 2:18). It was not good for God to remain as a bachelor. He desired to obtain a match, a counterpart.</p>
<p>One day the &ldquo;bachelor&rdquo; God created the heavens, the earth, and man. According to Zechariah 12:1, the heavens are for the earth, the earth is for man, and because man has a spirit, he is for God. Today science proves that the heavens are for the earth, for without the sun and the atmosphere life on earth would be impossible. Furthermore, the earth is perfectly situated for man&rsquo;s existence. If the earth were a little closer to the sun, we would be burned up. If the earth were a little farther from the sun, we would freeze. The distance between the earth and the sun is perfect for us to enjoy life. The heavens are for the earth, and the earth is for us. Because of sunshine, air, and rain, many things that are good for food can grow on the earth. Everything on the earth&mdash;the minerals, the vegetables, and the animals&mdash;is for us, as those prepared by God to contain Him, to exist.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE INCARNATED GOD</h2>
<p>One day God came into the man whom He had created. God was conceived in the womb of a virgin named Mary and was eventually born in the flesh (Matt. 1:18). When God was incarnated, He became &ldquo;God-plus.&rdquo; For this reason His name was not only God but Emmanuel, meaning &ldquo;God with us&rdquo; (v. 23). The little phrase <em>with us</em> is a big &ldquo;plus.&rdquo; We all need to say, &ldquo;Hallelujah for God with us!&rdquo; Jesus is God with us, God-plus. In Genesis 1:1 God is the &ldquo;bachelor&rdquo; God, but in the four Gospels He has become the incarnated God. Thus, we see that the revelation of God has progressed from the &ldquo;bachelor&rdquo; God to the incarnated God.</p>
<p>While the incarnated God was living on earth, He was a little Nazarene named Jesus, yet this man was irresistibly attractive. When He called Peter and John to follow Him, they were attracted. No one could understand what was attractive about this Nazarene. Moreover, during the three and a half years of His earthly ministry, He did many wonderful things that no one could explain. Therefore, the Jews doubted and wondered who He was. They knew His mother and His brothers and sisters (Matt. 13:55-56), and they knew He came from Nazareth, but they did not know who He truly was. They did not know that He was not merely God or merely a man but the God-man, the incarnated God, God manifested in the flesh. Outwardly, He was flesh, but inwardly, He was nothing less than God Himself. Isaiah prophesied of Jesus when he said, &ldquo;A child is born to us... / And His name will be called... / Mighty God&rdquo; (9:6).</p>
