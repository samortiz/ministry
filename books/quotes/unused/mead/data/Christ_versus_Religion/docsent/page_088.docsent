   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE SPIRIT OF PROPHECY</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Never think that the Book of Revelation is merely a book of prophecy.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>We have read Revelation 19:10 saying that "the testimony of Jesus is the spirit of prophecy."</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>I agree that Revelation is a book of prophecy, but you must not merely care for the prophecy and forget the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>We would rather forget the prophecy and care for the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>When you come to this book, don't try to analyze and understand it.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Just say Amen from your spirit to every word; then you will be endued with the spirit of prophecy.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>To be concerned with the prophecies is one thing; to care for the spirit of the prophecies is another.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>THE GOD OF OUR SPIRITS</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The last chapter of this book says that the Lord is "the God of the spirits of the prophets" 22:6 .</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>God is the God of our spirits; He is not the God of our mind; He is not the God of our outward activities.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Never get into your mind, never get into the teachings, never get into the doctrines.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>You can never meet God in all those realms He is not there.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>God is in your spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>God is the God of your spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>You must be in your spirit to be with God and touch God.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Today I am at a certain address in Los Angeles.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>If you go to San Francisco, you will miss me.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>If you go to any other street in Los Angeles, you will miss me.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>If you stand outside my house on the street corner, you will miss me.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>You must come to the door and enter my dwelling to be where I am.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>God is the God of the spirits of the prophets.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>We all need to turn to our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>This is why the Apostle John was in spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Today is the age of the Book of Revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>In this age the sevenfold, intensified Spirit of God is versus religion.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Let us look to the Lord desperately that we all may be fully taken out of religion and religion fully taken out of us.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>May we only be the seven shining stars in the seven burning lampstands with the sevenfold, intensified Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>O Lord!</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Amen!</S>
