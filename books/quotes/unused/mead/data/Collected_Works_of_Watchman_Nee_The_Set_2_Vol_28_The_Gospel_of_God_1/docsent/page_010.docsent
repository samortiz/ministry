   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>God So Loved the World</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>This is not all.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>God Himself is love, but when this love is applied to us, we find that "God so loved the world" John 3:16 .</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>"God is love" speaks of His nature, and "God so loved the world" speaks of His action.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>God Himself is love; hence, that which issues out from Him must be love.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Where there is love, there must also be the object of that love.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>After showing us that He is love, God immediately shows us that He loves the world.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>God has not only loved us, but has also sent forth His love.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>God could not help but send forth His love.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>He could not help but love the world.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Hallelujah!</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The greatest problem the world has is that it thinks that God always harbors evil intentions for man.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Man thinks that God makes severe demands, and that He is strict and mean.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Since man has doubts about the love of God, he also doubts that God loves the world.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>But as long as God is love, He loves the world.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>If love is His nature, He can conduct Himself toward man in no other way except in love.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>It would make Him uncomfortable if He did not love.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Hallelujah!</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>This is a fact!</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>God is love.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>He cannot help but love.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>God is love, and what spontaneously follows is that God loves the world.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>We can blame ourselves for our sins, for being susceptible to Satan's temptation, for being entangled by sin.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>But we cannot doubt God Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>You can blame yourself for committing a sin, for having failed, for succumbing to temptation.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>But if you doubt God's heart toward you, you are not acting like a Christian, for to doubt God's heart toward you is to contradict the revelation in the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>I cannot say that you will never fail again.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Nor can I say that you will never sin again.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Perhaps you will fail and you will sin again.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>But please remember that for you to fail or sin is one thing, but God's heart towards you is another.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>You must never doubt God's feeling toward you simply because you have failed or sinned.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Although you may sin and fail, God does not change His attitude toward you, for God is love and He loves the world.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>This is an unchangeable fact in the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>On our side, we change and turn.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>But on the side of the love of God, there is no change or turn.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Many times your love can change or become cold.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>But this does not mean that God's love is affected.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>If God is love, no matter how you test Him, what comes forth from Him is always love.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>If there is a piece of wood here, no matter how you hit it, you will always get the sound of wood.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>If you hit it with a book, it will give you the sound of wood.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>If you hit it with your palm, it will still give you the sound of wood.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>If you hit it with another piece of wood, it will again give you the sound of wood.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>If God is love, no matter how you "hit" Him if you reject Him, deny Him, or cast Him aside He is still love.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>One thing is sure: God cannot deny Himself; He cannot contradict Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Since we are just hatred itself, it is altogether natural for us to hate.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Since God is love, it is altogether natural for God to love.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>God cannot change His own nature.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Since God's nature cannot be changed, His attitude toward you cannot be changed.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>So we see that God loves the world.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>God's Expression of Love</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Does the whole matter stop with God loving the world?</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>"God is love" speaks of God's nature; it speaks of God Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>"God so loved the world" speaks of God's action.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>But God's love toward us has an expression.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>What is this expression of His love?</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Romans 5:8 says, "But God commends His own love to us in that while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us."</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>God's love has an expression.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>If I love a person and merely tell him that I love him, that love has not yet been consummated.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Unless love is expressed, it is not consummated.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>There is no love in the world that is without an expression.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>If there is love, it must be expressed.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>If a love is not expressed, such a love cannot be considered love.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Love is most practical.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>It is not vain and is not merely a verbal matter.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Love is expressed through actions.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>If you put a ball on a surface that is not level, you can be sure that something will happen; it will end up rolling down.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>The same is true with love.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>You can be sure that it will have an expression.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Since God loves the world, He has to be concerned about man's need.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Hence, He must do something for man.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>We are sinners.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>We have no other choice but to go to hell, and no other place to be except in the place of perdition.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>But God loves us, and He will not be satisfied until He has saved us.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>When God says, "I love you," His love will step up to bear all our burdens and remove all our problems.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>Since God loves us, He must provide a solution to the problem of sins; He must provide the salvation that we sinners need.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>For this reason, the Bible has shown us this one great fact: the love of God is manifested in the death of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>Since we are sinners and are unable to save ourselves, Christ came to die in order to solve the problem of sin for us.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>His love has accomplished something substantial, and this has been put before us.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>Now we can see His love in a substantial way.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>His love is no longer merely a feeling.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>It has become a thoroughly manifested act.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>In this great matter of God's love, we must take note of three things: the nature of God's love, the action of God's love, and the expression of God's love.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>Thank and praise God!</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>His love is not only a feeling within Him.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>It is also an action, and even an expression and manifestation.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>His love made Him do what we cannot do by ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>Since He is love and since He has loved the world, salvation has been produced.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>Since man has sin and since God is love, a lot of things follow.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>If you are not poor, you will have no need of me.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>But if I do not love you, even if you are extremely poor, I will not be concerned at all.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>The situation today is that man has sinned and God has loved; therefore, things begin to happen.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>Hallelujah, a lot is happening because man has sinned and God has loved.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>When you put the two things together, the gospel comes into being.</S>
