<h2 class="head1">THE PROBLEM OF MEMORIAL SERVICES<br />(IN MEMORY OF MR. SUN YAT SEN)</h2><p>To our fellow members in the Lord, our dear brothers,</p><p> Mr. Watchman Nee, Mr. Chang Kuang Jung, and</p><p>Mr. Witness Lee:</p><p>We are writing this letter to you because we want to place a problem we have before all the brothers and sisters so that we can all seek God's will and He may be glorified.</p><p>There is a Brother Ts'ao here (Brother Chang knew him well in Tsinan) who works for the local office of public works. This brother wants the Lord very much, and he is willing to partake of the Lord's table, but every week the department of public works has a memorial service. All government employees must attend the service. They strictly enforce it. At first we thought that this was a matter of worshipping idols and that it could not be accepted. So we temporarily set aside the matter of accepting this brother.</p><p>A few days ago, several brothers thought about the same passage in the Bible without discussing it beforehand. They remembered that the Bible gives us a pattern for this kind of matter. We thought of the record in Daniel 3. They did not worship, but they obeyed the command and stood before the idol. So we are asking, if a brother stands before the picture of a dead person (of course he cannot bow to it), should we receive him at the table or not?</p><p>We also thought that attending a memorial service can be considered an attitude of sin, but can we say that he is serving an idol or worshipping an idol? On the other hand, we felt that if we passed over this matter loosely, we might encourage some of God's weaker children to enter into another temptation. We will be faced with this matter before long. We confess that we do not have clear light, nor do we want to act independently among the brothers. So we are writing this letter to you who are leading us in this way. We hope that you can give us an answer soon. Peace in the Lord!</p><p>Your little brothers,<br />Ts'ai Chih Wen, P'an Huei Sheng, Chou Hsing Yi<br />August 3, 1934</p><p>P.S. By the Lord's grace, the brothers are continuing to stand firm in the meeting since Brother Chang returned to Shanghai. However, we will soon move our place of meeting. Two weeks ago, two brothers and two sisters were baptized in Ta Ming Lake according to the teaching of the Bible. (One of these was Brother Ts'ao, whom we mentioned.) Our hearts are really rejoicing because we saw the Lord's victory again, and some were gained for the Lord's side. We are really young and ignorant before the brothers (this is not polite humility). We have many (spiritual) weaknesses and lacks, so we ask the elder saints to pray especially much for us before the Lord.</p><h2 class="head2">Answering Letter</h2><p>Dear brothers:</p><p>Your letter caused us to consider much before the Lord, because we should not be stricter than the Bible, nor should we be more lax than the Bible, lest we miss the will of God.</p><p>We really express our sympathy to Brother Ts'ao in this matter. We know how difficult it is for him. We hope that what we write will be of some help in God's hand.</p><p>(1) We agree that it would be best if he could completely avoid the memorial service.</p><p>(2) If he attends the memorial service, it is all right if he does not bow to the picture, because the memorial service is the government's command to remember Mr. Sun Yat Sen. It does not matter what our personal opinion of Mr. Sun Yat Sen is. We should obey the authority (Rom. 13:1). Furthermore, the apostle clearly says, "Render...honor to whom honor is due" (v. 7), which means to obey those over us. If the country wants to remember Mr. Sun Yat Sen, we should not disobey. But some believers feel that the memorial service is bad because the memorial service involves the ceremony of bowing to his portrait. A report, a minute of silence, an exhortation, or a speech in the memorial service do not contradict the Bible. The only thing in the service that contradicts the Bible is bowing to the portrait of a dead man.</p><p>As believers our principle toward our country is that we should obey anything which is not contrary to God's commandment. If there is a conflict, however, we would rather pay any price to obey God and not man.</p><p>The memorial service is not wrong. We have nothing to say against the service, so we should obey. However, we cannot agree with their method of memorial. In other words, we are willing to obey the goal of their memorial, but we cannot obey their procedure.</p><p>Why is it wrong to bow to the portrait of a dead man? Our brother, Jan Ch'i Yu, has a good explanation. Do you remember what the second commandment says? "Thou shalt not bow down thyself to them [graven images], nor serve them" (Exo. 20:5). God forbids two things: One is bowing down to the image of anything in the heavens, the earth, under the earth, or in the water; the second is serving them. First, He forbids us to bow down, no matter the reason. Second, He forbids us to serve them. This refers to service with a religious significance. The first cuts off the factor that leads to corruption. The second forbids the real problem.</p><p>Portraits of dead men are included in the images of things in the heavens, on earth, under the earth, and in the water. Therefore, we cannot bow to memorial portraits, even if it does not have religious significance.</p><p>This matter is very simple. We should obey in the matter of the memorial service, but God forbids the practice of bowing to the portrait during the service. This is something we cannot do.</p><p>Therefore, it is all right if our brother goes to the meeting as long as he does not bow to the portrait.</p><p>The passage in Daniel 3 which you mentioned is a good proof of this. They only rejected the part of the ceremony which God had forbidden. Furthermore, there is a passage in the Bible which gives us a great deal of light. Do you remember the passage where Naaman the leper was cleansed? He went into the Jordan River and came out clean. After he was cleansed, he said to Elisha, "Thy servant will henceforth offer neither burnt offering nor sacrifice unto other gods, but unto the Lord. In this thing the Lord pardon thy servant, that when my master goeth into the house of Rimmon to worship there, and he leaneth on my hand, and I bow myself in the house of Rimmon: when I bow down myself in the house of Rimmon, the Lord pardon thy servant in this thing" (2 Kings 5:17-18). How did Elisha, the prophet of God, answer his request? "Go in peace" (v. 19). Therefore, with regard to this matter, God wants us to be gracious to the brothers as He is gracious to us.</p><p>However, there is one thing we must guard against. We cannot lie to people. If they ask us, we must explain why we do not bow. This is our testimony. We should also say that we are willing to use any other method to respect the things that our country requires us to respect, but we cannot bow down.</p><p>Brothers, we can also say, "Go in peace!"</p><p>We hope that what we have written is a help to you. May God give us light to know how to act according to His will. Please greet Brother Ts'ao for us and greet the brothers in the meeting. Peace!</p><p>Your brothers,<br />Witness Lee, Chang Kuang Jung, Watchman Nee<br />September 15, 1934</p>
