   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>When a person enjoys sin and casts off restraint, it seems as if he is following the desires of his heart, but actually he is going against them and contradicting his conscience to be a slave and captive of sin.</S>

   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The truth in this verse is the Lord s word v. 31 , which is the Lord Himself 14:6 . The Lord and His word are found in the Bible, so the Bible can set us free.</S>

   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>This truth, which is the Lord Himself and His word, will free us from sin and its bondage, making us free indeed.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>4.</S>

   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>God tells us in His Word, the Bible, that our sinful old man with its sins has been crucified with Christ and has died with Christ.</S>

   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>We were crucified and resurrected together with the Lord Jesus, so we are no longer under the law but under grace; therefore, sin can no longer lord it over us.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The more an unbeliever relies on himself to keep God s law, the more he feels sin lording it over him, and the more he is unable to escape the power of sin.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>When he receives the Lord s salvation and life, he will see that his old man was crucified with the Lord.</S>

   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>In the past, the law of sin and of death was a spontaneous power within us, preventing us from escaping sin and death.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Now God has placed the Spirit of life in us as another law, a spontaneous power, that nullifies the law of sin and of death and nullifies the spontaneous power of sin and of death.</S>

   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>In the past, we condemned ourselves because we could not overcome the law of sin; instead, we were continually captured by sin to do evil.</S>
