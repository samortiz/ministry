        <h2 class="head2">Advancing from the Mind of the Spirit<br />
to the Spirit of the Mind</h2>
<p>Ephesians 4:23 also speaks of the mind and the spirit: &ldquo;That you be renewed in the spirit of your mind.&rdquo; The expression <em>the spirit of your mind</em> is different from <em>the mind set on the spirit</em> used in Romans 8:6. The experience of Ephesians 4:23 is more advanced than what is described in Romans 8. With the mind set on the spirit, the mind is directed toward the spirit, but with the spirit of the mind, the spirit has entered into the mind. In Romans 8 the Spirit of God has entered into our spirit, but our mind is not yet occupied by our spirit. In Ephesians 4 our mingled spirit is in our mind, which represents our soul. In other words, the Spirit in our spirit has spread and entered into our mind. Hence, our mind is called the spirit of our mind.</p>
<p>When we regularly turn our mind to contact our spirit, our mind will become the mind of our spirit. When we continue to exercise in this way, gradually our spirit will occupy our mind, because the Spirit of God mingled with our spirit will spread into our mind. Thus, we will have the spirit of our mind.</p>
<p>Romans 8 also speaks of minding the things of the flesh and the mind set on the flesh (vv. 5, 7). When we set our mind on the things of the flesh, our mind becomes the mind of the flesh. The Lord delivers us when we turn our mind to the things of our spirit (v. 5). When we mind the flesh, our mind is turned away from our spirit, but when we mind our spirit, our mind is turned toward the depths of our being. By minding the spirit, our mind becomes the mind of the spirit, and the spirit gains its proper position. The issue of minding the spirit is life and peace. When we turn to our spirit, we touch the fellowship, and we receive the life supply.</p>
<p>Do not think that we are getting into too many details or that our analysis is too fine. Genuine spiritual experiences are very fine. In Mark 12:30 the Lord quoted the Old Testament, saying, &ldquo;You shall love the Lord your God from your whole heart and from your whole soul and from your whole mind and from your whole strength.&rdquo; How fine this is! The Lord spoke of our heart, our soul, our mind, and our strength. The heart includes the soul, and the mind is a part of the soul. The heart, the soul, and the mind are related. Nevertheless, the Lord spoke of them separately. Our exercise in fellowship must be fine; otherwise, our experience will not be genuine. The things that we have mentioned are not doctrine; they are practical matters in our spiritual experience. We need to exercise in a practical way.</p>
<h2 class="head1">KNOWING GOD AND THE SPIRIT</h2>
<h2 class="head2">The Fellowship of the Spirit Being<br />
Fellowship with God</h2>
<p>To turn our mind to our spirit is to turn our being to God because He is in our spirit. Hence, the fellowship of our spiritual life is the fellowship of God. God is not only in the Spirit; He is the Spirit. Likewise, He is life. According to His person, God is Spirit, and according to His content, He is life. Whether we touch the fellowship of life or the fellowship of the Spirit, we are touching the fellowship of God; that is, we are touching God.</p>
<p>We can use electricity as an illustration. When we touch an electric current, we touch electricity. Electricity can be touched only through its current. Wherever there is an electric current, there is electricity. Similarly, if there is the fellowship of God, God is present; and if there is no fellowship of God, God is not present. We can touch God practically only when we are in fellowship. In the fellowship of God we touch the Spirit and the divine life.</p>
<p>God can have a relationship with us because He is the Spirit as well as life. Genesis 6:3 says, &ldquo;My Spirit will not strive with man forever, for he indeed is flesh.&rdquo; This word clearly reveals that God&rsquo;s desire to have a relationship with man is related to the Spirit. In order to have a deep relationship with man, God must enter into man. When He enters into man, He is not only the Spirit as a person but also as life, which is the content of God. When God enters into us, we have His Spirit as a person in us, and we have life as the content of God. Regarding His person, God is in us as the Spirit; regarding His content, God is in us as life. God being the Spirit refers to His person and nature, whereas God being life refers to His content. Hence, the fellowship of the Spirit is the fellowship of life, and it is also the fellowship of God. The divine flow within us is the Spirit as well as life. This flow is mutual; hence, it is also called fellowship. This mutual flow, this fellowship, is in our spirit.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Fellowship Depending on<br />
the Flow of God&rsquo;s Spirit</h2>
<p>We can fellowship with one another because the flow of God is within us. There are many light bulbs in this room, and electricity is flowing through them and in them. Although there are many light bulbs, there is only one electric current. Another example is the blood circulating in our body. This circulation brings all the members in our body into fellowship. Likewise, the fellowship among the saints exists in the flow of the Spirit. When a brother praises God, there is an echo in our spirit; therefore, we also praise God. If his praise is not from the spirit, there will be no echo. However, if his praise comes from the spirit, there will be a response with us, because there is a flow of the Spirit. This also applies to prayer. If a brother&rsquo;s prayer is from his mingled spirit, his prayer will touch our spirit, because we are in the one fellowship of the Spirit. The Spirit is the flow and also our oneness.</p>
<p>The church does not need unity. The church needs oneness. The oneness of the saints is the fellowship, the flow of the Spirit. There are many saints, but there is one flow of the Spirit within us. When we live in this flow, we are one spontaneously; we do not need to be united. If we are fleshly, the flow will be blocked. This does not mean that the Spirit is not in us but that the flow of the Spirit is obstructed by the flesh. If we live in the spirit, we will respond to each other&rsquo;s spirit whenever we see one another, because we are in the same flow. If we do not fellowship in the one flow of the Spirit, our dealings with one another will merely be political and social. In spiritual terms such dealings are called leprosy.</p>
<p>When a person with a strong spirit invites a brother to a love feast out of a burden for fellowship, he is living in the spirit, even if the invitation is not accepted. Fellowship among the saints requires that both parties live in the spirit. If one party is not in the spirit, the flow will be cut off. Hence, it is possible to have fellowship with some saints but not with others. There is fellowship only when both parties are in their mingled spirit. Otherwise, there will not be a flow. Without the flow in our spirit, we are being political. Those who learn the lesson of fellowship are genuine, without pretension, disguise, or insincerity. They learn to live in spirit in singleness, simplicity, and purity.</p>

 	<h2>Noise Words</h2>
 	<p>Common words, such as "and", "is", "but", and "the", also known as noise words, are bypassed in a search. The search string, the Spirit &amp; who, would result in an error since who, which stands by itself, is a noise word. The following is a list of noise words:</p>
	<p>$, a, also, an, and, another, any, are, as, at, be, because, been, being, both, but, by, came, can, did, do, each, for, has, had, he, have, her, here, him, himself, his, how, if, in, into, is, it, like, make, me, might, much, my, of, on, or, our, out, over, said, should, since, some, still, such, take, than, that, the, their, them, then, there, these, they, this, those, to, too, very, was, way, we, well, were, what, where, which, while, who, with, would, you, your</p>

  	<h2>Ranking</h2>
  	<p>Rank is a value from <strong>0</strong> to <strong>1000</strong> indicating how closely a match scored or ranked against the original search string. Rank values are affected by the following factors:</p>
		<ol>
            <li><span>The total number of occurrences of the original search words/phrases in a portion of a book.</span></li>
            <li><span>Content that includes the search words in close proximity to each other are ranked above those that do not. Therefore, a portion of a book that has the search words in close proximity may have a higher ranking than another portion of a book that has a higher hit count but the words are not in close proximity to one another. Therefore, we also include a search word hit count for reference.</span></li>
            <li><span>The rank values are relative to each other. Therefore, it is not possible to interpret the RANK value as a percentage or group the rank values into high/medium/low ranges. Think of rank as a method to order the results for a specific search.</span></li>

 	<h2>Search Scope</h2>
 	<h3>Include All Word Forms</h3>
	<p>This option breaks out the search string into its individual words and generates all conjugations and declensions for each word in the search phrase. A search on the word, dwell, would search for dwell, dwelling, dwelling's, dwells, dwelt, and dwelled.</p>
	<p>There is no need to use ^ (inflectional search) or * (prefix search) when using the Include all word forms search scope.</p> 
	<h3>Specified Word Forms</h3>
	<p>This option searches for exact matches of the specified words or phrases used in the search string. Use of ^ (inflectional search) with a particular word in the search string will broaden the search for that given word in that all conjugations and declensions for that word will be searched. Similarly, use of * (prefix search) with a particular word in the search string will broaden the search for that given word in that all words with that prefix will be searched as well.</p> 
	<h3>Note</h3>
	<p>Common words, such as "and", "is", "but", and "the", also known as noise words, are bypassed in a search. A list of all noise words is as follows:</p>
