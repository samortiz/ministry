   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>On the fifth day, after the dry land and the celestial bodies had been restored, God prepared to create living organisms to inhabit the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>"Let the waters bring forth abundantly the moving creature that hath life, and fowl that may fly above the earth in the open firmament of heaven" v. 20 . God's commandment expressed God's purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>"And God created great whales, and every living creature that moveth, which the waters brought forth abundantly, after their kind, and every winged fowl after his kind" v. 21 . God created these things out of nothing.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>We do not know what materials God used to make fish and aquatic life.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>As for the birds, 2:19 tells us that they are made out of the ground.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Science tells us that living organisms first existed in the water, then on the ground.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Aquatic organisms are the most primitive species among all the animals.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Even today, the ocean is still home to the majority of the living creatures.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Birds, on the other hand, are the most primitive species of all warm-blooded animals.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>We can see how closely science resembles the description in the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Although science proves these words, faith believes without the help of science!</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>On the sixth day God went on to create the beasts, the cattle, and the creeping things.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Finally, He created man in His own image.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>We will discuss the creation of man in more detail in later messages.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Here we will deal only briefly with the subject.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Chapter one covers the creation of man in a brief way to show us man's position among the creatures, while chapter two describes the origin of man in detail to show us man's relationship with God.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>We should notice that man was "created" by God v. 27 . Man did not evolve from a lower class of animal.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The word "creation," as we have mentioned, means the making of something out of nothing.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>It is a special work of God and not a natural process of evolution.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The Bible does not give credence to the theory of evolution, which will forever be a vain idea!</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>On the third day God ordered each type of vegetation, the trees, grass, and vegetables, to yield seed after its kind.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Grass cannot change into a tree, neither can one tree change into another kind of tree.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>On the fifth day aquatic life and birds were all after their kinds.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>On the sixth day the beasts, cattle, and creeping things were also after their kind.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Every creature is after its kind.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The Bible does not tell us how these kinds were classified, yet the words "after his kind" is sufficient proof that in those days every creature was of a different kind.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Since God has said that everything was "after his kind," the boundary of each kind was set by God.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>There is absolutely no possibility for one kind to evolve into another kind.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Plants cannot change into animals; even one kind of plant cannot change into another kind of plant, neither can one kind of animal change into another kind of animal.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>We Christians believe in the Word of God.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Anything beyond "thus saith the Lord," we will not believe.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>How much less should we listen to a theory that is contradictory to the Word of God?</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The Word of God is sufficient to solve all the problems.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The world may be scornful of our logic, but we are satisfied with God's Word.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Pitiful mortals do not believe in our God.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>As a result, they drift aimlessly and devise theories for themselves on which to base their faith!</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>They think that it is too incredible for God to bring something out of nothing into being, and to make man out of the dust of the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>To us, however, for a tiny embryo of one kind of animal to undergo the numerous processes of evolution to become a monkey, and then after many more steps of evolution, to change from a monkey into a man, is something that is far more incredible.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Just for a monkey to evolve into a man is incredible.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>It is much more incredible than God creating man!</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>I warn my readers not to believe such end-times nonsense.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Not only should we not believe such talk; we should not even listen to it.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>We should not read magazines or books that contain these kinds of theories.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>We thank God that His words are clear and easy to understand.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>He said, each "after his kind," and all around us we see all animals and plants behaving according to this word.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Formerly, evolutionists said that man's ancestors were some sort of animal many thousands of years ago.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Now they tell us that after many more thousands of years, our descendents will be formless animals without fingers or toes.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>They are talking things that belong to many thousands of years ago or many thousands of years in the future, things which we will never see or be able to hold up for questioning!</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Our Bible is a book of the present.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>At present, all creatures multiply after their own kind.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>The Bible does not make irresponsible statements!</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>As noted by many previous writers, "Elohim," one of the names for God in the original Scriptures, is plural in number.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>However, in Genesis 1:26 the verb used after God is singular in number.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>It seems incompatible to have a plural noun with a singular verb.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>However, this indicates that God is three-in-one and one-in-three.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Since there is more than one person in the Godhead, the noun does not have a singular designation.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Neither are there two persons.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Hence, the designation is not dual.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Rather, there are three persons.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Hence, there is the plural designation "Elohim."</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Although there are three, there are not three Gods.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>For this reason, the verb is not plural, but singular.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>This reveals that God is triune.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Although the Bible does not explicitly state that God is triune, we can find many proofs and indications of this fact in the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>There is no doubt that the doctrine of the Trinity is indeed a great doctrine in the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Furthermore, the word "us" in verse 26 indicates the plural number in the divine Persons, while the verb "make" indicates the oneness of God's purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>In chapter one, the words "God said" are used thirty-one times.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>What God said was God's Word.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>When we read the Gospel of John 1, we see that all things were made by the Word of God.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Genesis 1 alludes to the work of the Lord Jesus in creation.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>In this way, the Triune God works together in creation.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>We have "God," "God said," and "the Spirit of God."</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>The Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit are all here.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>Before God created man, He paused and had a discussion within the Godhead, saying, "Let us make man in our image, after our likeness: and let them have dominion."</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>As we meditate on this discussion, we realize that God was very serious about this matter.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>This seems to indicate that our previous exposition is correct.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>Satan, as well as the previous inhabitants of the earth had already failed.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>God restored the earth and heaven, and made them fit for human habitation.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>All the living creatures were ready.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>The Godhead seemed to be taking a pause to talk among Themselves, "Behold, We are going to create man now!"</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>This is the spirit of this passage.</S>
