The Process of Resurrection</H2><P>After He passed through the process of death, Christ entered into the process of resurrection. First Peter 3:18 tells us that when Christ was dying on the cross, He was crucified to death in His flesh, but not in His Spirit. His Spirit as His divinity did not die at the cross when His flesh died; rather, His Spirit as His divinity was made alive, enlivened, with new power of life, so that in this empowered Spirit as His divinity He made a proclamation to the fallen angels, proclaiming God's victory over Satan. When He was dying in the flesh on the cross, at the same time He was rising up in His Spirit. This was the beginning of His resurrection.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>2.
