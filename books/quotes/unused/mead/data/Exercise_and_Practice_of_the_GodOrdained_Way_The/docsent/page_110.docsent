   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE EXERCISE AND PRACTICE OF THE GOD-ORDAINED WAY MESSAGE TWENTY-NINE THE FORMATION OF GROUP MEETINGS THE ADVANCEMENT IN THE STUDY OF THE LORD'S NEW WAY</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In the fall of 1984 as we began to study the Lord's new way, I began to speak about the group meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>At that time I did not differentiate between the home meetings and the group meetings, because we considered these two terms as synonyms.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Gradually, through our study and practice over the past few years, we have learned that we should differentiate between these two types of meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The home meetings are for nourishing and cherishing the newly baptized ones in their homes.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>This nourishing and cherishing is like that of a nursing mother after the delivery of a child.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The group meetings, on the other hand, are more advanced because they are for the perfecting of the new ones.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>We were not so clear about the distinctions in these two types of meetings at the beginning of our study in 1984.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Now, we are clear.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>We also anticipate that there will be some improvement in the coming days.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>GROUP MEETINGS AS THE STRENGTH OF THE CHURCH</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The group meetings are crucial to the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Without the group meetings, the church cannot be very strong or increase very quickly.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>If a local church is to be strong, it must be built upon the group meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Without the group meetings, it is difficult to have remaining fruit.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The home meetings are for nourishing and cherishing the new believers in their homes.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>But these home meetings are only good for a short period of time in the initial stage of caring for the new believers.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>If you were to baptize a few new ones today, the interest of the new ones for the nourishing and cherishing in their homes would only last for about six months.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>If you continue to have the home meetings without the group meetings, the new ones will begin to lose their interest in meeting with you.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>GROUP MEETINGS VERSUS GOOD SPEAKERS</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The church should be built upon the group meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>According to the history in Christianity and also among us, the strength of a congregation is apparently determined by the speaker.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>If a congregation has a strong speaker, as long as the speaker is alive, the congregation seems to be strong.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>But when the speaker goes away or dies, the congregation begins to weaken.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>This is very common in Christianity, and we also have had similar experiences.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>When a church has a brother who is a good speaker and he remains in the church for awhile, speaking in a regular way, the church seems to ascend to the moon.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>But when that brother leaves to go to another place, the church quickly descends to the earth again.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>It seemed that the church was strong.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>But through many experiences, we have realized that it was not the church itself that was strong; it was the speaking or preaching that was strong.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The speaking was not that much related to the actual strength of the church itself.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The actual strength of the church itself depends upon the group meetings, not on the strong speaker.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>If the group meetings are built up, whether or not you have a strong speaker makes little difference as far as the actual strength of the church is concerned.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>A good speaker with good speaking only adds another "crown" to the church.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>If the church is strong, the church will be strong with or without the good speaker as a crown.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>When I was in Taipei from 1949 to 1955, I spoke in nearly every meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Apparently, the church in Taipei was strong, but eventually, I discovered that my constant speaking weakened the church there.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>In Shanghai, Brother Nee had a similar experience.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Brother Nee was a strong speaker, and the more he spoke in the church in Shanghai, the weaker the church became.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The factor for this weakness was the lack of the group meetings being built up.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>We may think that the more a good speaker speaks, the more a church will be strengthened.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>This may be the case when a church is first established.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>But over time this kind of speaking weakens the church.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The good speaking of a speaker is like good food prepared in a restaurant.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>If you eat such rich food three times a day every day for a long period of time, you will not be very healthy.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The emphasis must be placed, not on the good speakers, but on the group meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>This is because the strength of the church rests actually in the group meetings, and the strength of the group meetings depends upon our labor.</S>
