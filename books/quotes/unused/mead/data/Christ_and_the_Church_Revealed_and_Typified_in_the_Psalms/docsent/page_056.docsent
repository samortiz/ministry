   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Suppose now that the leading brothers of that particular local church hear these two young brothers speaking in such a way and are deeply offended.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>They arise to defend themselves and assert their authority.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>If the leading brothers react in this way, it means that they also are not under the headship of Christ, that they also are not giving Christ the pre-eminence.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>They should bow down and say, "Lord, the pre-eminence is Thine, the first place is Yours.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Though we may be the leading ones, we are nobody.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The young brothers are not wrong; we are really poor."</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Perhaps the brothers and sisters in that place may, in a sense, be poor, but they are giving the first place to the Lord, the pre-eminence to Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>There you will see the restoration of God's house.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>If they fight one with another, the young people against the leading ones, and the leading ones against the young people, there will only be desolation.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The young people will attempt to justify themselves, and the leading ones will vindicate their position.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>This is nothing but desolation.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>They are desolating the church.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Whenever Christ loses His pre-eminence among us, the church is wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>We all must submit ourselves to His headship and say, "None among us is anybody; You are the only One, Lord, who has the pre- eminence.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>We give You the pre-eminence, Lord."</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Regardless of how weak we are, regardless of how poor we are, if we take this attitude, there is the possibility for the restoration of God's house.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The desolation will be past; it will be swallowed up by the restoration.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Christ must be afforded the proper position by the people of God.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>God has already given Him the highest place in the universe.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Now every one of us, both the young brothers and sisters and the elder brothers and sisters, must give Him His due place.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Never take the pre-eminence among the Lord's people in the local church; the pre-eminence must always be given to Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The first secret for us in maintaining the house of God and restoring it from desolation is to give the pre-eminence to Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Sometimes the sisters in the local churches cause the problem by not giving the pre-eminence to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Philippians 4 speaks of two sisters, Euodias and Syntyche, who caused a problem in the church at Philippi.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>It is strange that I have never heard of parents naming their daughters by these two names.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>At the beginning, the situation in that church was excellent, but then a problem arose due to these two sisters.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Many times, simply because of two sisters, there is disunity in a church.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>In one of the local churches recently, I referred to these two sisters in Philippians 4, and on the very next day a sister stood up, weeping, confessing her faults and asking another sister to forgive her.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Both of them wept.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Some of the brothers said to me later, "When you spoke from Philippians 4, you prophesied concerning the condition here.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>These two sisters were the problem in this local church."</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>If any of us, especially any of the sisters, fail to give the pre-eminence to the Lord, there will be desolation in the church.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The church life will be restored if we will always say, "We are nobody; Christ is the only One; we give Him the pre-eminence."</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>You must pray-read these two verses, Psalm 80:15 and 17, and stay with them for some time.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>"And the vineyard maintain which thy right hand hath planted, and the son that thou madest strong for thyself.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Let thy hand be upon the man of thy right hand, upon the son of man whom thou madest strong for thyself."</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>This is Christ, the unique Man, the unique Son.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>This is the One who has been approved at the right hand of God the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>He has the pre-eminence, the first place in the entire universe, and we must recognize this.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>If we as God's people will give Him such pre-eminence, the restoration of the church life will take place.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The desolation of the church is due mostly to Christ not being given His rightful position.</S>
