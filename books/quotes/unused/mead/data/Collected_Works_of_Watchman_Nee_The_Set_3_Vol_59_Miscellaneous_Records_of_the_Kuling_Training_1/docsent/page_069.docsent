   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE NAME OF JESUS SIGNIFYING AUTHORITY</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>We have to realize that all our authority is identified with the name of Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Authority is embodied in the name of Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>When the seventy disciples went out in the name of the Lord, they were able to cast out demons; the demons had to obey them.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Some of the disciples might have been quite crude and uneducated, but when they cast out the demons in that name, it was very effective.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>This is because, in the Lord's own words, authority had been given to them.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>As soon as we speak the name of Jesus, the devil trembles.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>We have to see that authority is in the name.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Philippians 2:10 says that in the name of Jesus every knee should bow, of those who are in heaven and on earth and under the earth, because God has given the Lord the highest authority.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The supreme name of Jesus represents His supreme authority.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Jesus was exalted through His infinite, absolute, perfect, unquestionable, and immeasurable obedience.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>In man's eyes He was humbled to the lowest point.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>In God's eyes, however, "he who humbles himself shall be exalted" Luke 18:14 .</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The Lord Jesus was submissive to the end, when He met His death at the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>His death on the cross epitomizes His submission.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Through this submission He received all the authority.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Before He went to the cross, the Lord prayed in the garden of Gethsemane: "My Father, if it is possible, let this cup pass from Me; yet not as I will, but as You will" Matt 26:39 .</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The cup refers to the crucifixion.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The Lord did not drink the cup just because it came His way while He was on earth.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>He drank the cup only when He identified it with God's will.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The Lord did not pray, "If it is possible, let Your will pass from Me."</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Rather, He prayed, "If it is possible, let this cup pass from Me."</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>He was not afraid of the cup.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>His concern was whether or not the cup was God's will.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The Lord did not come for the cross, but for the carrying out of God's will.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>He would gladly go to the cross if this was God's will.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>If it was not God's will, He would not bind Himself to the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Hence, to Him the cross was not merely a symbol of suffering, but a symbol of submission to God's will.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>By itself suffering deserves no merit.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>It deserves merit only when it coincides with God's will.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Therefore, the Lord's crucifixion is the highest expression of His submission.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>After He expressed submission through the cross, God raised Him up to the highest point, even to the throne.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>On earth the Lord was a representative of submission.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>On the throne He is a representative of authority.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>This is the reason He was able to say to the disciples after His resurrection, "All authority has been given to Me in heaven and on earth.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Go therefore and disciple all the nations" Matt 28:18-19 .</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>He is now on the throne.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>On the cross He was the epitome of humility.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>On the throne He is the exemplar of supreme exaltation.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>He has received all authority on the throne, and this authority is now carried by His name.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The Lord received this name because He had perfected absolute submission.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>IN THE LORD'S NAME</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Before the Lord's resurrection, authority was in God's hand.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>After the Lord was crucified, resurrected, and exalted, God gave all authority to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>On one side we see total submission.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>On the other side we see the highest authority.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>When the Lord was exalted, God gave Him the name of Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Yet the Lord has passed on this name to us.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Today every aspect of our work is carried out in this name.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>In this name we preach the gospel, gather to meet, and teach and receive one another.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>If we do not know this name, how can we work for the Lord?</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>If we do not know submission, we will never know God's authority.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>It is not enough for us to know authority in an abstract way.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>We have to know it in a practical way through Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Had Christ not carried out submission to its consummate conclusion, He would not have been able to return to heaven.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>He took an unimaginable risk upon Himself when He chose not to return to heaven through the pathway of His divinity.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>In one sense He lived His human life without divine intervention.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>He exercised His submission in the position of a man.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>This was the basis of His exaltation.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Today Jesus is Lord; God has bestowed on Him the highest name, the name in which every knee must bow, of those who are in heaven and on earth and under the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Today we are commissioned to preach in this name, and we are made to partake of this name.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Here are two things: doing things in His name and coming under His name.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>What is the difference between these two things?</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Mrs. Weigh is free to do things in the name of Brother Weigh.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>This is because she has first given herself to come under his name.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>After she has given herself to come under his name, she has the right to partake of all that her husband has.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>In order for us to walk and do things in the Lord's name, we must first belong to His name.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>First, we are baptized into His name.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>This is the basis for us to walk and do things in His name.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Once we have the name of Jesus, everything becomes simple.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>We can overcome all things and deal with all problems.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>We are called Christians because we are called into Christ's name.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>We are the same as He is in everything, except that He is the male and we are the female counterpart.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>The names Solomon and Shulamite are the same word in Hebrew; one is masculine and the other feminine.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>The question now remains whether or not we are able to use His name and do things in His name.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>We have to realize the source of His name.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>He submitted Himself to the uttermost.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>There was no rebellion in Him whatsoever.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>He did not have any opinion of His own, and there was no trace of insubordination in word or attitude.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>He upheld God's authority to the uttermost.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>Through this submission He received His name.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>I do not know if you realize the gravity of this matter.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>When the Lord sent the seventy disciples to cast out demons, He told them to act in His name.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>This means He committed His name to the disciples and allowed them to use it freely.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>It seems as if the Lord was saying, "Take My name and tell the demons to get out!"</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>The Lord told the disciples in John 14 and 16 that whatever they asked of the Father in His name, the Father would give to them 14:13-14; 16:23 .</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>It seems as if the Lord was saying that whatever is asked of the Father in His name is counted as His own asking.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>Luke 24:47 says, "Repentance for forgiveness of sins would be proclaimed in His name."</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>The Lord intends for men to grant others forgiveness, to cast out demons, and to petition the Father in His name.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>The Chinese way of authorization is not by signature but by seal.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>As long as one has the right seal, he can conduct business.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>A seal is good enough for withdrawing money from the bank and for conducting transactions.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>If the government or the state commits its official seal to you, it is a very serious matter.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>If you use the seal by mistake, the government will bear the consequences.</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>When the Lord says that we can do things in His name, it means that He has entrusted His "seal" to us.</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>Whenever we use the seal, the Lord will validate it.</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>This name is committed to our hand.</S>
   <S PAR='98' RSNT='1' SNO='98'>Whatever we say, He will do.</S>
