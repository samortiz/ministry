   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>LEARNING THE TRUTH OF THE GOSPEL</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Those who are burdened to preach the gospel in the schools or in the community must learn the truth of the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>To learn the truth can be compared to receiving an education.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>A person who has an elementary school education speaks and behaves with the flavor of elementary school; a person who has a high school education speaks and behaves with the flavor of high school; and a person who has a college education speaks and behaves with the flavor of college.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>This speaking and behavior are related to one s level of education.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>This is the same as our learning the truth of the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Whether we serve full time or part time, we need to preach the gospel in the schools and in the community.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>But if we are not equipped in the truth of the gospel, we will be short of the element of the gospel when we speak with others.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>For this reason we must spend time to learn the truth of the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>In Christianity giving messages, preaching the gospel, and teaching the truth are taken care of by people who have attended a seminary.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>We cannot say that all the believers in the congregations do nothing, but very few of them do anything.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>In America there used to be a popular trend in which lay people were invited to give messages, preach the gospel, and serve as pastors.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>However, this trend could not continue, because there was no material with which to teach.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>According to the Bible, all believers are priests and should preach the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Not only those who are apostles, prophets, evangelists, and teachers should preach the gospel, but every believer is a priest and should preach the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>This is our practice.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The Bible</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>We need to preach the gospel to families, to students in school, to those who work, and to children.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>In order to announce the gospel, we must know the truth of the gospel, have the utterance of the gospel, and know the manner of the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>In order to know the manner of the gospel, we need to be educated.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Without a proper education, we cannot know the manner of the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Hence, we need to equip ourselves with the truth of the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>In particular, the full-timers should spend several hours every morning to study the New Testament and the Old Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>In addition, they should set aside time to read books concerning the truth of the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Crucial Truths in the Holy Scriptures</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Concerning the truth of the gospel, there are three books we would like to recommend.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The first is Crucial Truths in the Holy Scriptures.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The sixteen topics in volume 1 are concerning salvation, beginning with the condition of man and ending with the security of salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The condition of man speaks of man s need of salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The love of God speaks of the source of salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Christ s redemption speaks of the accomplishment of salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The work of the Holy Spirit speaks of the application of salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Repentance and believing speak of the conditions for obtaining salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>After a person believes into the Lord, he is forgiven, cleansed, sanctified, justified, and reconciled.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Thus, he is regenerated, receives eternal life, and obtains the freedom of being released.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>This is salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>After being saved, he still needs to know the assurance and security of his salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>We should have a thorough knowledge of these sixteen topics.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The verses quoted are the best verses for the gospel, and we should memorize them.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>We should memorize the verses related to justification, salvation, regeneration, sanctification, and obtaining eternal life.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>We need to know not only the verses but also the verse references.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>First Peter 2:24 says, Who Himself bore up our sins in His body on the tree, in order that we, having died to sins, might live to righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Acts 16:31 says, Believe on the Lord Jesus, and you shall be saved, you and your household, and 13:39 says, From all the things from which you were not able to be justified by the law of Moses, in this One everyone who believes is justified.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>We should memorize such verses so that whether we are at home, at school, or in the meeting hall, we can use these verses to preach the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>We need to read God s Word to others, because the Bible has the authority of God, and it has a unique place in people s heart.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Sometimes when we speak without using the Bible, our speaking is not so powerful.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>We can open the Bible and read from Acts 13:39: From all the things from which you were not able to be justified by the law of Moses, in this One everyone who believes is justified, and then we can ask the other person to read it.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>By reading the verse a few times, this word will enter into the person, and the Holy Spirit will operate.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Therefore, we need to learn the verses that we will use for the gospel and also learn their references.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>The young people should commit all the verses to memory.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>In 1938 in Chefoo we began to study Crucial Truths in the Holy Scriptures, which contained forty-two topics.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>By 1949, when we studied it again in Taipei, the number of topics was increased to sixty.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>The first sixteen topics are comprehensive, and the verses quoted are the most appropriate.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>If we can memorize all the verses for the first sixteen topics, we will be equipped for battle, just as the children of Israel were equipped in the Old Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>These verses are like sharp arrows.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>We should also read the explanations.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>In particular, the young people need these verses.</S>
