   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>BROTHER NEE'S SALVATION AND CALLING</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Now I would like to begin relating the history of the local churches, beginning in the early 1920s in China.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>China was a country with an ancient culture, full of the teachings of Confucius and full of Buddhism.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Eventually, however, the Lord sent His gospel there.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The Lord's name, which is the Lord Himself, the Bible, and the gospel were brought to China.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>I believe that the Chinese version of the Bible is one of the better translations.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>We thank the Lord for this.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>In 1920 there was a prevailing evangelist in China by the name of Dora Yu.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>She was saved when she was young and was sent by her family to England to study medicine.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>When her ship reached Marseilles, France, she went to the captain and told him that she had to go back to China to preach Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Thus, the captain sent her back.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Her parents were extremely disappointed with her.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Obviously, she came from a wealthy family who could send her to England to study medicine.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>But she was strong in her desire to preach Christ, and her family could not persuade her to do otherwise.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>They told her that they would have nothing to do with her and that she should go her way to preach her Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>From that time onward, she became prevailing in the preaching of the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>In 1920 she was invited to Brother Nee's hometown, Foochow, which is close to the province of Kwantung, near Hong Kong.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>She was preaching the gospel in the Methodist church where Brother Nee's parents attended.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Neither he nor his parents were saved at that time.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Brother Nee's mother spoke English well, and his father had a good position in the Chinese customs.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>His mother was saved in one of these meetings with Dora Yu.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Before being saved, his mother was very fond of playing mah-jong, a game of chance played by many of the Chinese.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>She was a very strong, talkative woman and was very dominant in their family, even over her husband.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Brother Nee's father was a very nice gentleman who was very quiet.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Brother Nee's family was composed of four brothers and four sisters, Brother Nee being the third child.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The two children above him were sisters.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The children also had the impression that their mother was too domineering at home.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>However, after their mother was saved in that gospel meeting, she came home and made a thorough confession to the whole family.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>She confessed all her failures and mistakes in a serious way.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>This was really the Lord's doing.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Brother Nee was amazed that she could be converted like this through one meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>He was so impressed by his mother's confession that he wanted to go and see what was there.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The next evening he went to listen to Dora Yu, and he was caught by the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>In those meetings many people wept with repentance.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>These meetings were very prevailing, and Brother Nee was fully caught.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>He was saved in the evening.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>That night, according to his testimony, he saw the Lord Jesus on the cross, and through that he was called by the Lord see pp.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>8-9 of Watchman Nee's Testimony published by Living Stream Ministry .</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>He was called on the night he was saved.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>He told me this personally.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>He told me many things that he kept as a secret from others, and I realized that he was speaking to me for my training.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>After being called by the Lord, the Lord began to prepare him and use him in a marvelous way for His intention.</S>
