   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Omitted</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>A WORD ON BEHALF OF THE EDITOR</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>1 Thank the Lord!</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>He heard our prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>We were able to mail out Issue No. 12 from Hankow before October 5.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Mail to and from Hankow will be stopped beginning October 23.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Therefore, beginning with Issue No. 13, we will move the publication work to Shanghai.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>By the grace of God, we hope to put out at least one more issue.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>2 It is difficult to send letters from one place to another.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Before the mail routes become clear, we hope to send out one or two more issues of this magazine.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The churches and co-workers who receive the magazines first should spread the news to other brothers and sisters.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Those who receive the magazine later by surface mail should also try their best to distribute it to other brothers and sisters who can read.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>3 In the past there were shortcomings in the way we handled the correspondence in this magazine.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>I am, of course, guilty of such mistakes.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>I pray that God would give me the grace and the leading of the Spirit to work more carefully in the future.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>I also pray that the message in every letter would be written under His grace so that it will express the pure love in Christ, manifest an unceasing union in the Spirit, and relate all the work of God through the saints and the real condition of the gospel work everywhere.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>May all the correspondence bear spiritual value and be for the furtherance of the gospel and the benefit of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>4 Some brothers and sisters do not hold the same view concerning the truth as we do.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Their understanding of the church and the work may not be the same as ours.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Yet because of our relationship in Christ, we have spiritual fellowship one with another, and at times, we publish their news in the column "News of the Churches."</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>This is because we may know of gospel activities in other places.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>If some brothers and sisters go to these places, they can receive the help.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>5 During this critical period we are trying our best to inform you of the whereabouts of the brothers and sisters.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>This is to allay the concern of others and to facilitate correspondence between the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>However, we do not know some saints very well and are not familiar with their spiritual condition.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>This is why we are not recommending anything here.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>6 Thank the Lord that His grace is sufficient in supplying the brothers and sisters who are in need because of the war!</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Most of the saints in Hunan and Szechuan have found means to take care of their livelihood.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>A few in Hankow still need relief; others have found jobs.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Brother Lan Tsi-yi has not been able to leave Hankow.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Both letters and telegrams cannot get through to Hankow.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>But, in reading his letter of October 21, we know that he is still taking care of brothers and sisters who are in difficulty.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Some saints who intended to go to Kansu and Sinkiang have found that the Lord has opened the way for them, and they are now serving in their jobs.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Some are still in north Hunan working part-time and waiting on a clearer leading from the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The mail route and money transfers are clear to and from Chou County, but Shu County still is not ready.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>We need to pray much concerning the matter of supplying the saints' needs so that those who really need our supply are not neglected.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>7 Thank the Lord that He has given the co-workers much light through the book Rethinking Our Work.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Of course, there are thousands of years of tradition and prejudice when it comes to questions related to the church and the work.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>If we want to return to the pattern of the Bible, we will have to pay a price inevitably.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Any new light is difficult at the beginning of its practice.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>In this transitional period, we should obey God on the one hand and do things properly on the other hand.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>The most important thing is that we carry on our practice according to the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Even if we do everything according to the letter, we may still be dead.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>We are living and full of life only when we are in the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Sister Sun Wen-hwa's letter from Denmark shows us that God has prepared the hearts of a group of people to pursue and receive His truth and to accomplish His work in this age.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>I beseech God today to raise up more such people, to prepare their hearts to receive His truth, and to propagate His truth through prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>8 I have to say a few words fearfully to our young co-workers.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>I am not more qualified or more experienced that I should say anything to you.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>But because I have seen something and because of our relationship, I feel that I have to say a few honest words.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>It is true that we are called and used by God, but we must still fear God.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Only then will our words and walk have discipline before men and carefulness when we are by ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Sometimes we may be misunderstood or reviled.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>"But we have renounced the hidden things of shame, not walking in craftiness nor adulterating the word of God, but by the manifestation of the truth commending ourselves to every conscience of men before God" 2 Cor 4:2 .</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Our corrupted self can neither cope with God's appointment nor His dealings.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>May the Lord be merciful to us and enlighten us so that we will know what the flesh and the self are.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>May we accept the dealing of the cross and give no ground to the flesh or to the activities of the self.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>The days are few.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>There are so many souls waiting to be saved!</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>We should learn the lessons in a serious way and be dealt with in a proper way so that we can become useful vessels in the hand of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Finally, we have to remember the brothers and sisters in and around Shansi, Kuling, Hankow, I-Chang, Ch'ang-sha, Ch'ang-Teh, and Canton.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>May the Lord lead them and protect them in everything.</S>

   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>The whole process of proofreading, mailing, and printing takes more than a month.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>The movements of the brothers and sisters are always changing.</S>
