[2]  This book is part of a three-volume set containing messages given by Brother Witness Lee during the years 1978 and 1979.
[3]  CHAPTER ONE BUILDING BY KEEPING THE ONENESS THROUGH GROWING IN LIFE
[4]  In this message we need to see what the building of the church is.
[5]  THE BUILDING OF THE CHURCH BEING THE GROWTH IN LIFE
[6]  We thank the Lord for showing us that the building is taking place now.
[7]  I would remind you that the title of this message is building by keeping the oneness through growing in life.
[8]  By considering our experience and by examining the Word, we have found that if we do not keep the oneness, we have no way to grow in life.
[9]  In a family there are the grandparents, the parents, and children of various ages.
[10]  This is true not only among the saints, but also among the churches.
[11]  Because all the churches are in different stages, we should not expect them to be the same.
[12]  In this message I want to fellowship with you about how to grow in life.
[13]  Because the building is the growth in life, it is important that we know how to grow in life.
[14]  In this message I have the burden to share about this matter in a very practical way.
[15]  During our private time with the Lord, we should also read and study the Bible.
[16]  I am concerned that many of the young people do not read the Bible or study it.
[17]  The Gospel of John reveals to us even more than the book of Revelation what God's economy is.
[18]  Why did God create the heaven? the earth? the universe? mankind? you?
[19]  In chapter seventeen, verses 21 to 23 say, "That they all may be one; even as You, Father, are in Me and I in You, that they also may be in Us, that the world may believe that You have sent Me. And the glory which You have given Me I have given to them, that they may be one, even as We are one; I in them, and You in Me, that they may be perfected into one, that the world may know that You have sent Me and have loved them even as You have loved Me." These verses are hard to follow.
[20]  I believe you are persuaded that John is not so simple.
[21]  This book is on the profound economy of God.
[22]  There is talk among us about how to meet.
[23]  You may get up in the morning and find that your spirit is on fire.
[24]  But when you get home from work that evening, you are as cold as a block of ice.
[25]  Come to the Bible not with the purpose of understanding it.
[26]  Come not even with the purpose of receiving light or the life supply.
[27]  Eventually, the Lord knows when, light will come, life support will come, secretly, wonderfully, even mysteriously, but not at your time and not in your way.
[28]  CHAPTER FOUR A PRACTICAL WAY TO ABIDE IN THE VINE 1
[29]  Throughout the centuries scholars and philosophers have tried their best to find out the meaning of the universe and the meaning of human life.
[30]  But after such an experience and such resolve, I still did not express much Christ.
[31]  Of all God's creatures, only human beings have a conscience.
[32]  This is the part within that either accuses or excuses you cf.
[33]  Thus, to abide in Christ we must first purify our conscience by making a thorough confession.
[34]  Once your conscience is purged, you can be poor in spirit.
[35]  If you are proud, your spirit is not open to the Lord and He has no way to abide in you.
[36]  If your conscience is not purified and your spirit not open to the Lord, if you are not poor in your spirit and pure in your heart, what kind of mind will you have?
[37]  How can I deal with the Lord to get Him to act on my prayers?
[38]  This question opens up a field that covers the whole Christian life.
[39]  How can I distinguish between a prayer burden and my own desire to pray for something?
[40]  Do not have your mind made up about what you will pray.
[41]  Paul said he practiced to have a conscience void of offense toward God and toward men Acts 24:16 .
[42]  There is a principle in the Bible Matt 5:23-24 that if we offend another, we must go to that one and confess.
[43]  Shouldn't we confess as soon as we do something wrong?
[44]  After you confess in the morning, you do not need to confess again until something sinful arises.
[45]  If I keep having special fellowship with a certain brother day after day, this fellowship will become a friendship.
[46]  In this message I would like to share with you how to carry this on in a daily way.
[47]  By His mercy and grace I would like to share with you how to live Christ, grow Christ, and produce Christ.
[48]  In verse 7 the Lord says, "If My words abide in you," and in verse 26 He says, "I will send to you from the Father, the Spirit of reality."
[49]  In yourself you are off; it is only in His name that you are in. If you will say, "O Lord, I am before You in Your name," you will sense right away that you are no longer off.
[50]  If you really touch the Word, you will find life.
[51]  You will know there is life in the Word because you will be enlightened.
[52]  The writings of the Apostle John are in three categories the Gospel, the three Epistles, and the book of Revelation.
[53]  Verse 3 says, "That which we have seen and heard declare we unto you, that ye also may have fellowship with us: and truly our fellowship is with the Father, and with his Son Jesus Christ."
[54]  The word translated "declare" means to hand over, not just to show you my hymn book, for example, but also to hand it over to you.
[55]  We hand this eternal life over to others that they may have fellowship with us, with the Father, and with His Son Jesus Christ.
[56]  Verses 8 and 9 say, "If we say that we have no sin, we deceive ourselves, and the truth is not in us.
[57]  If we confess our sins, he is faithful and just to forgive us our sins, and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness."
[58]  Your actions may not have been sinful, but under this light you will see that you have wronged this brother, you have cheated that sister, in this matter you were unjust, and in that matter you were unrighteous.
[59]  In chapter two of 1 John we shall consider only verse 27.
[60]  "But the anointing which ye have received of him abideth in you, and ye need not that any man teach you: but as the same anointing teacheth you of all things, and is true, and is no lie, and even as it hath taught you, ye abide in him" Gk.
[61]  Before we consider an Old Testament picture of the Spirit and its relationship to our abiding in Christ, we shall answer some questions based on the previous two messages.
[62]  I don't understand the difference between growing Christ and producing Christ.
[63]  We stressed that the Father wants us to live Christ, grow Christ, and produce Christ.
[64]  In the matter of confessing, what about things you do repeatedly?
[65]  When you clean a room in a hurry, it does not get very clean.
[66]  Later, when you come to look it over, you can see it needs a much more thorough job.
[67]  One of the Old Testament pictures that helps us to understand the mysterious abstraction of the Spirit is the anointing ointment, described in Exodus 30:23-25.
[68]  The Spirit, as we have said, is compounded with the death and resurrection of Christ.
[69]  Then you will find that the more you abide in Christ, the more you experience His death and participate in His resurrection.
[70]  CHAPTER NINE THE WORD OF THE CROSS AND THE WORD OF LIFE
[71]  If you have only a superficial knowledge of the New Testament, you may think that its pages contain just stories and teachings.
[72]  Buried beneath its surface, however, are the implications of the death and resurrection of Christ.
[73]  Should we have a specific time to come to the Lord to confess?
[74]  We do not go to the Lord with a certain purpose; we go because we love Him and want to be with Him.
[75]  How did Paul deal with the problems in the church at Corinth?
[76]  "The word of the cross is to them that perish, foolishness; but unto us which are saved, it is the power of God" 1 Cor 1:18, Gk.
[77]  Notice the connection between these two verses: "For if you live according to flesh, you are about to die; but if by the Spirit you put to death the practices of the body, you will live.
[78]  For as many as are led by the Spirit of God, these are sons of God" Rom 8:13-14 .
[79]  You may think it is awkward English to title this message "The Life Way to Take the Word," but I want to suggest some ways for you to get more life from your reading of the Word.
[80]  I do not say "The Living Way " because sometimes "living" connotes excitement or loudness rather than life.
[81]  Before we consider how the Word can bring us into life, we shall answer some questions based on the previous message.
[82]  I'd like to know how to deal with inward things like pride.
[83]  You deal with this in the same way as the outward matters.
[84]  Whenever you sense something sinful, you should repent, confess to the Lord, and get cleansed.
[85]  If you take in the Word, the Word will become the Spirit to show you your pride and then to live out Christ instead of pride.
[86]  The appearance of evil is so apparent wherever we turn.
[87]  Even when I go on the campus, I sense a spiritual leak in myself after a short time there.
[88]  Before you go into such a situation, you must be clear that you go there just for the gospel's sake, for no other purpose.
[89]  Then you must be in prayer for the Lord to cover and safeguard you.
[90]  Matthew 4:4 makes it clear that the Bible is good for food: "Man shall not live on bread alone, but on every word that proceeds out through the mouth of God."
[91]  So does Jeremiah 15:16: "Thy words were found, and I did eat them; and thy word was unto me the joy and rejoicing of mine heart: for I am called by thy name, O Lord God of hosts."
[92]  The Word of God even brings health to our body.
[93]  "For the gate is narrow and the way is constricted which leads to life, and few are those who find it" Matt 7:14 .
[94]  Before we consider various aspects of the way which leads to life, we shall answer a few questions.
[95]  Could you clarify the distinction you made between living by Christ and living Christ?
[96]  Submission is surely against your conscience if it leads you to worship an idol or to do something against the truth.
[97]  Our meetings must be a show window of our Christian life.
[98]  God's economy ordains that we should live, grow, and produce Christ.
[99]  This matter is resolved in our daily life in our married life, in our business life, and in our school life.
[100]  The real growth in life is to have Christ added to us.
[101]  If you will get into the Word regularly as I have exhorted you, even if you consider such legality like a cold blast of winter, in two months you will see what a difference it makes in your life and in the church life.
[102]  Do you think there are only ten commandments and that they are all in the Old Testament?
[103]  Christ is the portion of the saints Col 1:12, Gk.
[104]  . God has prepared this eternal, unlimited portion for us to enjoy.
[105]  Before we consider how we can partake of Him daily, let us answer some questions.
[106]  Suppose after fifteen minutes in the Word and prayer, you feel you haven't gotten anything.
[107]  Should you persist, or by faith consider you have gotten something?
[108]  Of course, your normal feelings help, but if you have a high fever, you may feel it is warm when it is not.
[109]  In the Epistle to the Colossians Christ is portrayed as the Head; the book of Ephesians deals with the Body.
[110]  We shall consider some of the descriptions of this Christ, our divinely allotted portion, as they are given in Colossians, and then go on to discuss how we can daily partake of Him.
[111]  "It pleased the Father that in him should all fulness dwell" 1:19 .
[112]  God is rich, full, and complete; all His fullness dwells bodily in Christ 2:9 .
[113]  CHAPTER THIRTEEN GOD'S GIFTS THE WORD AND THE SPIRIT
[114]  Too often, however, we neglect two of the greatest gifts, the Holy Bible and the Holy Spirit.
[115]  In the Bible we find Christ as light and life; in the Spirit we also find Christ as light and life.
[116]  Not only was life in this One who was both the Word and God John 1:1 ; "the life was the light of men" v. 4 . In John 10:10 He further said, "I came that they may have life and may have it abundantly." He called Himself "the bread of life" 6:48 and "the living bread which came down out of heaven" 6:51 . How much He is the Word, God, life, light, and the bread of life!
[117]  Christ lives in us, yet we cannot see Him.
[118]  What you say is logical, but how can you prove that the Christ you preach is real?"
[119]  What is true of the Spirit is also true of the Bible.
[120]  There is both a killing factor and a nourishing factor in the Word.
[121]  "Where there is no vision, the people run wild" Prov 29:18, Heb .
[122]  For us to run a straight course we need a vision.
[123]  For us to appreciate the Lord's recovery, it is helpful to know what the background was.
[124]  We cannot go back because of the Lord's desire.
[125]  In the New Testament economy nothing is more serious than insulting the headship of Christ.
[126]  In the previous Life Message we pointed out that the church is built with Christ as life and with oneness as its ground.
[127]  Among any group of people there is a need for organization.
[128]  Though we say the church has none, there are practical matters to be taken care of and relationships to be worked out.
[129]  "God hath set some in the church, first apostles, secondarily prophets, thirdly teachers, after that miracles, then gifts of healings, helps, governments, diversities of tongues" 1 Cor 12:28 .
[130]  For over fifteen years the recovery has been in this country.
[131]  Throughout this period I have made it a point never to give orders to anyone.
[132]  I am not a leader and I have no rank, though some of you may so regard me.
[133]  The Lord's presence, as you receive the Word and touch the Spirit, will benefit you in every way.
[134]  This habit of contacting Him will make your mind sober, without your even thinking about it.
[135]  In chapter four of Ephesians I would call your attention first of all to the Spirit: "Being eager to keep the oneness of the Spirit in the uniting bond of peace" v. 3, Gk.
[136]  The matter of oneness is a common topic among Christians today.
[137]  We are one not because we have common concepts, similar interests, and the same goal, nor because we are doing the same kind of work.
[138]  Ephesians 4:3 refers to the oneness of the Spirit, while 4:13 refers to the oneness of the faith.
[139]  When you believed in the Lord Jesus, the Spirit of God entered into you.
[140]  CHAPTER EIGHTEEN HOW TO BEHAVE IN THE HOUSE OF GOD 1
[141]  If Timothy needed such instruction, how much more do we!
[142]  Let us answer some questions before we consider together our behavior in the house of God, which is the church.
[143]  In order for us to behave properly in the house of God, we must realize that God has made Christ Head over all things to the church Eph 1:22 .
[144]  In God's administration there was a specific time when this inauguration of Christ into the headship of the universe occurred.
[145]  Proper behavior in the house of God firstly means that above all else we honor the One whom God has exalted.
[146]  It is God's intention that there be no other head among His people.
[147]  Do you remember the request of the mother of the sons of Zebedee?
[148]  It is not so among you; but whoever wants to become great among you shall be your servant, and whoever wants to be first among you shall be your slave" Matt 20:25-27 .
[149]  Besides being called the house of the living God, the church is also called the pillar and base of the truth.
[150]  The two Epistles to Timothy were written when the church had become degraded.
[151]  In such a time of confusion, Timothy needed these two letters on how to behave in the house of God.
[152]  Let us say that for several years you have been listening to the word that the Triune God wants to dispense Himself into us, that all His riches are embodied in Christ, and that Christ today is the life-giving Spirit indwelling us.
[153]  Suppose a brother comes among us and begins to rebuke the churches in the recovery for their failure to practice foot-washing.
[154]  The Lord Jesus Himself set us an example of this in John 13 and specifically told us that we ought to wash one another's feet v. 14 . This is a New Testament teaching.
[155]  Whatever is related to God is reality or truth.
[156]  "As ye have therefore received Christ Jesus the Lord, so walk ye in him: Rooted and built up in him, and stablished in the faith, as ye have been taught, abounding therein with thanksgiving" Col 2:6-7 .
[157]  You opened to Him, repented and confessed your sins, and asked Him to come in. He came into your spirit 2 Tim 4:22 , not into your heart, though you may have sung that well-known chorus, "Into My Heart." From your spirit, the center of your being, Christ is spreading into the surrounding parts mind, emotion, will, and conscience which make up your heart.
[158]  I'm new in the church and still very much under the influence of Christianity.
[159]  When I was studying to be a preacher of the gospel in an organization, it was drilled into me that I had to have a burden for souls.
[160]  I would feel guilty if I didn't say something about the Lord to every one I met on the street, or at least give him a tract.
[161]  The verse we quoted Col 2:6 exhorts us to walk in Christ in the same way that we received Him.
[162]  We need to be clear that Christ today is not just far away in the third heaven; He is now also the life-giving Spirit 1 Cor 15:45, Gk.
[163]  Not only in preaching the gospel but in everything else as well, we have no way but Christ.
[164]  We may never have learned how to pray, but because we do know how to walk in Christ, we shall find that spontaneously, throughout the day, we are praying.
[165]  "For you are not under law but under grace" Rom 6:14 .
[166]  Such a teaching comes into the church in a time of degradation, when some will turn "the grace of our God into lascivious-ness" Jude 4 .
[167]  Sometimes when I want to share something in the meeting, I'm not sure if it is from my spirit or from my soul.
[168]  If you release it in the spirit, it is something in the spirit.
[169]  If you keep it within you, it may become something in the soul.
[170]  The New Testament law, written upon our hearts, liberates us.
[171]  "For the law of the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus has freed me from the law of sin and of death" Rom 8:2 .
[172]  There are two descriptions of the church found in 1 Timothy which are not found elsewhere in the Bible.
[173]  Only in this Epistle is the church called "the church of the living God" and "the pillar and base of the truth" 3:15 .
[174]  In Hebrews 3 we are exhorted not to withdraw "from the living God," and in chapter nine we are told that the blood of Christ purifies "our conscience from dead works to serve the living God."
[175]  The law was given by Moses, but truth came through Jesus Christ.
[176]  Paul uses several descriptive terms which indicate the direction some at Ephesus were taking away from the truth.
[177]  In 6:3-5 we have a clear contrast between what is healthy teaching and what is not: "If any man teach differently, and consent not to healthy words, even the words of our Lord Jesus Christ, and to the teaching which is according to godliness; he is proud, knowing nothing, but sick about questions and strifes of words, whereof cometh envy, strife, railings, evil surmisings, perverse disputings of men of corrupt minds, and destitute of the truth, supposing that gain is godliness: from such withdraw thyself" Gk.
[178]  This thought of mingling our reading of the Scriptures with prayer we call pray-reading.
[179]  Though we introduced this term about ten years ago, the prayerful reading of the Word has been practiced by many saints of old.
[180]  CHAPTER TWENTY-THREE THE LIFE, THE REALITY, AND THE WAY
[181]  In John 14:6 Jesus said, "I am the way, and the reality, and the life; no one comes to the Father except through Me."
[182]  To experience Christ as the way and as the reality, we must first experience Him as our life.
[183]  If I were to ask you how Christ can be our life, you would perhaps be at a loss for words.
[184]  For Christ to become our life, He had to take two steps.
[185]  The first "became" was God becoming a man to accomplish redemption; the second "became" was Christ becoming the Spirit so that He might reproduce Himself in us.
[186]  If you check J. N. Darby's translation, you will see that he puts verses 7 through 16 in parentheses, indicating that the thought in verse 17 directly follows that in verse 6, which says, "The letter killeth, but the spirit giveth life." By putting these two verses together, we can see that the Lord is the Spirit that gives life.
[187]  "For the Jews require a sign, and the Greeks seek after wisdom: but we preach Christ crucified, unto the Jews a stumblingblock, and unto the Greeks foolishness; but unto them which are called, both Jews and Greeks, Christ the power of God, and the wisdom of God" 1:22-24 .
[188]  "As it is written, Eye hath not seen, nor ear heard, neither have entered into the heart of man, the things which God hath prepared for them that love him.
[189]  But God hath revealed them unto us by his Spirit: for the Spirit searcheth all things, yea, the deep things of God" 1 Cor 2:9-10 .
[190]  "For as the body is one, and hath many members, and all the members of that one body, being many, are one body: so also is Christ" 12:12 .
[191]  From this verse we can see that Christ is not only the Head but also the Body.
[192]  In the new man there is no room for you nor me; Christ is all in all Col 3:10-11 .
[193]  How rich is this book in which God has spoken!
[194]  If you are asked by a learned professor where Christ is, do not reply that He is in the heavens; that is too far away.
[195]  In addition to taking Him in as our nourishment, there is another way by which God becomes our constituent.
[196]  Even if you take just ten minutes in the morning, you will find a supply there.
[197]  From the time that I received the Lord, I realized that His life was in me.
[198]  John 3:16 states clearly, "For God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son, that every one who believes in Him should not perish, but have eternal life."
[199]  I knew that by believing in Him I had received eternal life.
[200]  Two people are involved, the husband and the wife, but for a happy marriage, there can be only one life lived.
[201]  As you go through the day, you need to realize that Christ and you have only one life, not yours but His.
[202]  For this to be your experience, your own life has to be put aside.
[203]  Then you two will have only one living, not His but yours, because His is concealed.
[204]  You can try the educational world if you would like to be somebody.
[205]  In the opening chapters of the Bible the tree of life is presented to us.
[206]  When we come to its closing chapters, again there is this tree.
[207]  I have already commented on how different God's approach to Adam was from what mine would have been.
[208]  God showed no interest in telling him what to do or how to behave.
[209]  Here is the first promise given to the overcomers: "To him who overcomes, to him I will give to eat of the tree of life, which is in the paradise of God" Rev 2:7 .
[210]  The tree of life is here again offered to man.
[211]  Because this tree grows in the river of water of life, the tree is no doubt included in the final invitation to man, "Let him who is thirsty also come; he who wills, let him take the water of life freely" v. 17 . By taking the water of life, surely you will get the tree of life growing in it.
[212]  In times past you may have tried to find out the Lord's will for your life.
[213]  You may have spent time praying about what you should do and should not do.
[214]  The marvelous picture of the man created in God's image was soon marred.
[215]  Eating the legs of the lamb is a reminder to us that we need to eat Christ in His walk on this earth.
[216]  After the Israelites left Egypt, they were sustained in the wilderness for forty years.
[217]  As the Jews many years later told the Lord, "Our fathers ate the manna in the wilderness, as it is written, He gave them bread out of heaven to eat" John 6:31; cf.
[218]  What occupied the children of Israel during those forty years?
[219]  "And the manna ceased on the morrow after they had eaten of the old corn of the land; neither had the children of Israel manna any more; but they did eat of the fruit of the land of Canaan that year" Josh 5:12 .
[220]  Here is the third stage of eating in the life of God's people.
[221]  The Christ we eat is first for our full salvation, as is depicted for us by the eating of the Passover.
[222]  While manna was the only food provided for the children of Israel in the wilderness, the produce of the good land was varied.
[223]  The produce of the good land did not rain down from heaven as the manna had done.
[224]  The more we come together with our hands full of Christ, the more we offer Him to God and enjoy Him in the presence of God, the more we are worshipping Him.
[225]  One of the complaints brought against the Lord Jesus was, "This man receiveth sinners, and eateth with them" Luke 15:2 .
[226]  The servants were also told to put a ring on the son's hand.
[227]  This is a picture of our being sealed with the Holy Spirit Eph 1:13; 4:30 .
[228]  Christ is our fatted calf, our bread of life, to supply us and to bring us joy.
[229]  When the Lord was about to leave His disciples and return to the Father, He gave them a way to remember Him.
[230]  "And he took bread, and gave thanks, and brake it, and gave unto them, saying, This is my body which is given for you: this do in remembrance of me.
[231]  To remember the Lord, as we do from week to week at His table, is not a ritual, but a partaking of Him.
[232]  The proper remembrance of Him is not to recall what He is and what He has done, but rather to take Him in. The Lord's table is a testimony of our daily living.
[233]  When Paul wrote of how he had cared for the Corinthian believers, he said, "I have fed you with milk, and not with meat" 1 Cor 3:2 .
[234]  The way Paul took care of the Corinthians was not to teach them but to feed them.
[235]  The thought in Hebrews 5:12-14 is similar to that in 1 Corinthians 3:2.
[236]  In these five messages we have surveyed the subject of eating from Genesis to Revelation.
[237]  In every stage of God's relationship with man in the garden of Eden, in Egyptian bondage, in the wilderness wanderings, in the good land, when Christ was on earth, when the churches were being established, in the millennial kingdom, and in the New Jerusalem He made provision for His people's eating.
[238]  Day by day we need to come to the Word and, by praying over what we read, take in the very Christ as our food.
[239]  When Saul fell to the ground, his eyes were opened.
[240]  One aspect of this heavenly vision seen by Paul is that Christ has to be wrought into our being.
[241]  Galatians 4:19 says, "My little children, of whom I travail in birth again until Christ be formed in you."
[242]  When I open to the Lord in the morning and turn to the Word, I usually find it easy to pray and tell Him I love Him.
[243]  But then doubts and extraneous thoughts will sometimes come in, and I don't seem to be able to go back and get into the Word with an open spirit.
[244]  How can we know if what we are doing to please God is from ourselves?
[245]  First of all we must see that God wants only Christ, not our good works nor our good behavior nor even our spirituality.
[246]  However well we eat, if we do not breathe the proper air into every part of our being, we shall not have good health.
[247]  I experience Christ and I do like to be in the meetings, but sometimes I get tired of having so much preaching.
[248]  Let me say something further regarding the Old Testament type.
[249]  If you say you have had enough of the life messages and enough of the ministry, that they are all stored within you and that you have reached your capacity like a camel, then I would propose that we suspend the life supply for four years or so.
[250]  If you will eat the Word faithfully three times a day and keep opening to the Lord by praying unceasingly, coming to Him just as you are, you will find that your life will be changed and that when you come to the meetings you will not be empty-handed.
[251]  God's good pleasure was expressed firstly in the creation of the earth.
[252]  As happened when the foundations of the earth were laid, the heavenly hosts rejoiced also at the incarnation.
[253]  "And suddenly there was with the angel a multitude of the heavenly host praising God, and saying, Glory to God in the highest, and on earth peace, good will toward men" Luke 2:9-14 .
[254]  What made God so pleased with the advent of the "Savior, which is Christ the Lord" v. 11 ? Before the incarnation, the earth was the earth, man was man, and God was God.
[255]  "For it is God which worketh in you both to will and to do of his good pleasure" Phil 2:13 .
[256]  CHAPTER THIRTY-FOUR LIVING A DIVINE LIFE GOD'S GOOD PLEASURE
[257]  God has predestinated us human beings to be His sons Eph 1:5 .
[258]  Sometimes I have observed wives very busily doing one thing after another with the intention of serving their husbands.
[259]  To practice putting aside your will and your glory is not easy.
[260]  You may feel that you are willing or at least willing to be made willing.
[261]  But very soon a situation will arise, and you will see that you are not.
[262]  Why is it that you have been seeking the Lord and meeting with the saints for so many years and yet have so little growth in life?
[263]  I can do nothing from Myself; as I hear, I judge; and My judgment is just, because I do not seek My own will, but the will of Him Who sent Me. For I have come down from heaven, not to do My own will, but the will of Him Who sent Me. He who speaks from himself seeks his own glory, but He Who seeks the glory of Him Who sent Him, this One is true, and unrighteousness is not in Him" John 5:19, 30; 6:38; 7:18 .
[264]  CHAPTER THIRTY-FIVE THE RESURRECTION OF CHRIST GOD'S GOOD PLEASURE
[265]  The Lord Jesus told us that He is the resurrection and the life John 11:25 .
[266]  The life that was in Him, contrary to the life that we were born with, is a life that cannot be terminated.
[267]  The Jews foolishly sought to kill Him in order to be rid of Him John 5:16, 18; 7:1 , not realizing that death only released His life in multiplication.
[268]  You are probably aware that three Greek words are translated life in the New Testament.
[269]  Bios denotes the life of our physical body; psuche, the soul or the soulish life; and zoe, the uncreated, eternal life, which we did not have until we received the Lord Jesus.
[270]  John 14 continues directing the disciples away from the flesh and toward the Spirit.
[271]  "I will ask the Father, and He will give you another Comforter, that He may be with you forever; even the Spirit of reality you know Him, because He abides with you and shall be in you.
[272]  I will not leave you orphans; I am coming to you.
[273]  Yet a little while and the world beholds Me no longer, but you behold Me; because I live, you shall live also.
[274]  Where is this One who is the resurrection and the all-inclusive Spirit?
[275]  Jesus Christ today is in our spirit 2 Tim 4:22 .
[276]  Now, if you deduct the feelings in your mind, emotions, will, and heart, you will sense that there is yet another part of you, welling up to say that it would like to go and asking you to disregard the opinions of your mind, emotions, will, and heart.
[277]  Nothing is so neglected by Christians as our spirit.
[278]  How can we stay on the pathway of life when we come to the Word?
[279]  I have been trying to do this and praying that the Lord will help me to experience life in His Word.
[280]  But for so many years I came to the Bible for knowledge that even when I am in the midst of seeking the Lord, I find I have turned back to knowledge.
[281]  Yes, we formerly came to the Bible for knowledge, but now you must realize your need of the life supply.
[282]  We may realize that the spirit is the switch, but throughout our daily life we use our mind, not our spirit.
[283]  Even while we are sitting in the meeting, our mind may be on other things.
[284]  Paul tells us that God has revealed the mystery of Christ to us in spirit Eph 3:4-5 .
[285]  In Ephesians it is the church that is referred to as the mystery of Christ.
[286]  As human beings, made up of body, soul, and spirit, we need to understand more about our person.
[287]  The body is not our person, but a vessel containing it.
[288]  God wants us to be persons in the spirit.
[289]  The soul's use is as an organ; it is not to be our person.
[290]  This phrase, especially the word into, troubled me for years.
[291]  When the Lord wholly occupies us, we are one with all believers.
[292]  "Being built upon the foundation of the apostles and prophets, Christ Jesus Himself being the cornerstone, in Whom all the building, being fitted together, is growing into a holy temple in the Lord, in Whom you also are being built together into a dwelling place of God in spirit" Eph 2:20-22 .
[293]  CHAPTER THIRTY-EIGHT WORSHIPPING IN SPIRIT GOD'S GOOD PLEASURE
[294]  The New Testament reveals that when we were regenerated a great change took place in our constitution.
[295]  God's New Testament economy is focused on our human spirit and is carried out by the divine Spirit and the human spirit being mingled together.
[296]  First Corinthians 6:17 states, "He that is joined unto the Lord is one spirit."
[297]  For centuries that unique center, Jerusalem, kept the children of Israel in oneness.
[298]  The males were required to appear there before the Lord three times a year; otherwise, they would be cut off.
[299]  In the church life we should all "be filled in spirit, speaking to one another in psalms and hymns and spiritual songs, singing and psalming with your heart to the Lord" Eph 5:18-19 .
[300]  "Let the word of Christ dwell in you richly in all wisdom; teaching and admonishing one another in psalms and hymns and spiritual songs, singing with grace in your hearts to the Lord" Col 3:16 .
[301]  We are to be filled not only with the riches of God, but with the Word of God.
[302]  CHAPTER THIRTY-NINE THE FATHER'S LIFE AND THE SON'S LIVING
[303]  Though most Christians know that the subject of the Gospel of John is life, few know how to take such a life.
[304]  Yes, it is correct to say that believing in Christ is the way to take this life, but how can we live such a life out?
[305]  Since my youth, when I received the Lord, I knew He was my life, yet I kept wondering how I could live by His life.
[306]  The life is the Father's, but the living is the Son's. John 6:57 says, "As the living Father sent Me, and I live because of the Father, so he who eats Me shall also live because of Me." Then 5:26 says, "For even as the Father has life in Himself, so He gave to the Son also to have life in Himself." By considering these two verses together, you can see that the life was the Father's, yet He wanted the Son to live it out.
[307]  Does 5:26 mean that the Father has the life and lives, while the Son also has the life but with a separate living?
[308]  What I am sharing with you is the fruit of what I have learned and experienced these many years.
[309]  As I have said, in the early years we collected many spiritual books on the way to have a holy, victorious life.
[310]  The daily walk of a Christian is not a matter of morality or ethics.
[311]  CHAPTER FORTY TWO PERSONS WITH ONE LIFE AND ONE LIVING
[312]  For many years I have considered what the nature of the Christian life is and how it can be described.
[313]  It is a life involving two persons, but these two persons have only one life and one living.
[314]  Some have expressed the opinion that those who are in the church are just "a bunch of dummies."
[315]  Perhaps it is more accurate to say that we are nobodies.
[316]  CHAPTER FORTY-ONE THE REVELATION OF LIFE AND THE WAY TO TAKE CHRIST AS LIFE
[317]  Even though we know that the Bible is a book of life and that Christ is life, to some extent we are still short of the revelation of life.
[318]  Though many of us have heard about the matter of life in the Bible, we nonetheless do not see it adequately.
[319]  Suppose I go home and knock at the door for my wife to let me in. When she does not open it fast enough to suit me, I knock again hard.
[320]  In the early days of my Christian life I repented many times for my sins, weaknesses, and failures.
[321]  Now, however, most of my repentance is for being short of Christ.
[322]  A number of times after I have been with the brothers and treated them in a courteous, humble way, I have gone to the Lord to repent.
[323]  When I was young, I heard it said that Christ was the bread of life.
[324]  I remember wondering: if He is the bread of life, how do I eat Him?
[325]  For us to take Christ as our life, we must realize that Christ is mysterious, that He is God, that He is the Spirit, and that He is the Word.
[326]  The tree of life indicates the source of life; the bread of life, that this life is edible; the water of life, that it is drinkable; the Spirit of life, that life is just the Spirit of God; and the word of life, where that life is to be found.
[327]  Besides being the word for you to eat, Christ is also the Spirit for you to drink.
