[1]  CHAPTER ONE THE HEAVENLY CALLING OF PAUL Scripture Reading: Acts 9:1-15; 26:13-19; Gal 1:11-17; 2:20; 3:27; 4:19; Col 1:24-29 THE NEED FOR PAUL S MINISTRY
[2]  Between chapters two and nine Christ s ministry was proceeding, but Paul s had not yet begun.
[3]  There may be many preachings, but they do not adequately complete God s revelation.
[4]  Firstly, we would not realize that Christ is in us, that He must live in us and be our life and life supply.
[5]  It is Paul who tells us that Christ must live in us, must live in our spirit, and be in us as the life-giving Spirit.
[6]  Because of Paul s writings, we know that Christ in us is the hope of glory, that Christ is the all-inclusive One, and that the church is the Body and Christ the Head.
[7]  Before you came into the recovery, I doubt that you saw much of these three matters: Christ in you as the hope of glory, Christ all in all, and the church as the Body with Christ as the Head.
[8]  CHAPTER TWO CHRIST LIVING IN ME Scripture Reading: Gal 1:13-16; 2:20; 3:27, 28; 4:19; Col 1:25-27; 3:3, 4, 8-10; 2 Cor 13:5; Phil 1:21; Eph 3:17
[9]  As we said in the previous message, there are three crucial points to Paul s ministry.
[10]  The first of these, which we shall consider in this message, is Christ living within us.
[11]  That Christ should live in us was purposed and planned by God in eternity.
[12]  This people will be the Body of Christ to express God Himself in Christ.
[13]  It is no longer I who live, but Christ lives in me Gal 2:20 .
[14]  It is extraordinary to say that another person lives in us.
[15]  The second crucial point in Paul s completing ministry is the all-inclusive Christ.
[16]  We shall cover this from Paul s two books, Romans and 1 Corinthians.
[17]  To go through a book and see all the varied aspects of Christ presented in it will deeply impress you with His Person.
[18]  In Romans 1 Christ is first presented as the Son of God: His Son, Jesus Christ our Lord, Who came out of the seed of David according to the flesh, and was designated the Son of God in power according to the Spirit of holiness out of the resurrection of the dead vv.
[19]  John, however, describes Him especially in His divinity, as the only begotten One, whereas Paul says in Romans that Christ is of the seed of David according to the flesh, and was designated the Son of God in power according to the Spirit of holiness.
[20]  Then in 8:29, where Christ is called the Firstborn of many brothers, Paul is implying that it is according to Christ being the firstborn Son of God with the human nature that we are His brothers and the sons of God.
[21]  Romans 5:15 says, If through the offense of the one the many died, much more the grace of God and the gift in grace of the One Man Jesus Christ have abounded to the many.
[22]  Compare this reference with 9:5, where He is the Christ, Who is over all, God blessed forever.
[23]  From these two verses we can see that Christ is both man and God.
[24]  It is in Paul s writings that we find this clear declaration that Christ is man and also God.
[25]  In this one book of Romans he says strongly that this Christ, the very One whom we have received and are experiencing, is both man and also God blessed forever.
[26]  CHAPTER FOUR THE ALL-INCLUSIVE CHRIST 2 Scripture Reading: 2 Cor 3:17-18; 11:2; Col 1:12,15,18, 19, 27; 2:2, 3, 9, 10, 16-17; 3:4, 10, 11
[27]  When I was young, I especially loved the Gospel of John because in that Gospel there are more than ten items used to describe what the Lord Jesus is.
[28]  As I began to study the Epistles of Paul, however, I found many more.
[29]  What Paul tells us of Christ, furthermore, is more related to life and more for our enjoyment.
[30]  It is no wonder then, that Paul tells us he has received a commission to complete the word of God Col 1:25 .
[31]  In Genesis 1 we have the Spirit of God brooding over the dark waters v. 2 . As the Old Testament progresses, the term Spirit of Jehovah, or Spirit of the Lord, is used.
[32]  The Spirit is the ultimate consummation of the Spirit of God, the Spirit of Jehovah, the Holy Spirit, and the Spirit of Jesus Christ Phil 1:19 , who is the Spirit of life Rom 8:2 and the Spirit that gives life John 6:63 .
[33]  You may remember from the Colossians training that in this short book of only four chapters, there are fourteen different items of what Christ is.
[34]  These items, I must say, are more precious to me than those in 1 Corinthians.
[35]  Because Christ is God s image, when we see Him, we see God.
[36]  In Colossians 2 Paul prays that the hearts of the saints may be comforted unto the full knowledge of the mystery of God, Christ v. 2 . This wonderful Christ is the mystery of God.
[37]  Without the ministry of the Apostle Paul we would lack a clear vision not only of Christ but also of the church.
[38]  In the four Gospels the church is mentioned only twice, both times in Matthew.
[39]  In chapter sixteen the Lord says that He will build His church and that the gates of Hades shall not prevail against it v. 18 . In chapter eighteen He mentions the local church v. 17 .
[40]  If you exercise your spirit and pray over these verses, you will see this mystery: the mystery of Christ, which is the church, containing His unsearchable riches and making known God s wisdom according to His eternal purpose.
[41]  The church is also the fullness of the One Who fills all in all v. 23 . This is hard to explain.
[42]  CHAPTER SIX THE CHURCH 2 Scripture Reading: Eph 2:19-22; 6:11-18; Gal 6:10, 16
[43]  Many Christians consider the church as merely the gathering of God s called-out ones.
[44]  This is correct, but it does not touch the significance of the church.
[45]  Actually, the church is Christ s continuation, reproduction, multiplication, and spread.
[46]  The New Testament in Paul s writings, which conclude the divine revelation tells us that Christ is the mystery of God and that the church is the mystery of Christ.
[47]  In the same principle the church as the mystery of Christ is Christ s expression and His story.
[48]  This household of God is being built upon the foundation of the apostles and prophets, Christ Jesus Himself being the cornerstone, in Whom all the building, being fitted together, is growing into a holy temple in the Lord, in Whom you also are being built together into a dwelling place of God in spirit Eph 2:20-22 .
[49]  From these verses we can see that the household of God needs to be built up.
[50]  Even though we are God s family, for us to become His dwelling place we must be built up.
[51]  From the exhortations in Ephesians 6:11-18 we can see that the church is also a warrior, needing the whole armor of God to stand against the stratagems of the Devil.
[52]  We put on Christ, wearing Him like a garment and hiding in Him, to fight the battle for God.
[53]  The ten descriptions of the church that we have already considered the mystery of Christ, His Body, His fullness, the new man, His bride, God s masterpiece, God s family, the kingdom of God, God s dwelling place, and the warrior are all found in Ephesians.
[54]  CHAPTER SEVEN THE SPIRIT AND OUR SPIRIT Scripture Reading: Rom 8:9; Luke 1:35; Acts 16:7; Phil 1:19; 2 Cor 3:17-18; Rom 8:2; 1 Cor 15:45b; John 7:39; Gal 3:14; John 3:6b; Rom 8:16; 1 Cor 6:17; Rom 8:6b, 4
[55]  Without the Spirit in our spirit all the matters we have covered about Christ living in us, about His being so many different items for our enjoyment, and about what the church is, cannot be prevailing.
[56]  It is by His being the Spirit in our spirit.
[57]  How can Christ be enjoyed by us in the many different aspects we have mentioned?
[58]  How can the church be the mystery of Christ, the Body of Christ, and the new man?
[59]  From this Old Testament picture we learn that in the Spirit of Jesus Christ, this compounded Spirit, there is divinity, humanity, human living, the death of Christ even the cutting on the cross and its effectiveness, the resurrection of Christ and its power.
[60]  Now the Lord is the Spirit: and where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is liberty.
[61]  But we all, with unveiled face beholding and reflecting as a mirror the glory of the Lord, are being transformed into the same image from glory to glory, even as from the Lord Spirit 2 Cor 3:17-18, lit.
[62]  It is clearly revealed in the Bible that God s intention is to work Himself into man so that He can be man s life and that man may be His expression.
[63]  It was for this very purpose that God created man in His own image; man thus had the possibility of expressing God.
[64]  Man was also created with a spirit; this was so that he might be able to receive God the Spirit into him.
[65]  It is indeed wonderful to have the Spirit with our spirit, but we have also a soul and a body.
[66]  The Triune God is in our spirit, but our soul may contain very little Christ.
[67]  Life is simply the Triune God, who, after passing through a lengthy process, became the Spirit of life.
[68]  Once we receive this life, the New Testament tells us, it begins to grow within us, to saturate us, to transform us, and to build us together as God s dwelling place.
[69]  For many years I tried to find out what is meant by the growth in life.
[70]  The Bible does emphasize the need for us to grow in life, or for the divine life to grow in us.
[71]  I could not come to a clear understanding of what this meant or how it could come about, even after studying the Bible, reading various spiritual books, and considering my own experiences.
[72]  First Corinthians 3 says: I planted, Apollos watered, but God made to grow....You are God s farm, God s building....But if anyone builds on the foundation gold, silver, precious stones, wood, grass, stubble, the work of each shall become manifest vv.
[73]  When we meet together for the church life, we can praise the Lord that He has regenerated us and that His Spirit indwells our spirit.
[74]  Problems arise, however, with our soul, which is full of our opinions and natural concepts.
[75]  For the perfecting of the saints unto the work of ministry, unto the building up of the Body of Christ; until we all arrive at the oneness of the faith and of the full knowledge of the Son of God, at a full-grown man, at the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ, that we may be no longer babes...but...may grow up into Him in all things, Who is the Head, Christ, out from Whom all the Body, fitted and knit together through every joint of the supply, according to the operation in measure of each one part, causes the growth of the Body unto the building up of itself in love.
[76]  CHAPTER TEN THE CENTRAL VISION 1 GOD AS OUR CONTENTS Scripture Reading: Col 1:25-27; Rom 9:23-24; 2 Cor 4:7; Eph 3:19b; 4:6; Phil 2:14; Heb 13:20-21; 1 Tim 3:16 COMPLETING THE WORD OF GOD
[77]  Very few Christians have seen Paul s completing ministry.
[78]  This term, the completing ministry, is based upon Colossians 1:25, where Paul says he was commissioned to complete the word of God.
[79]  To complete the word of God means to complete the revelation of God.
[80]  No doubt the King James Version s rendering of complete the word of God as fulfil the word of God has somewhat obscured the real meaning.
[81]  Without Paul s writings the revelation of God is not complete.
[82]  Notice the two verses which follow Colossians 1:25 about the completing of the word of God: The mystery which has been hidden from the ages and from the generations, but now has been manifested to His saints; to whom God willed to make known what are the riches of the glory of this mystery among the nations, which is Christ in you, the hope of glory vv.
[83]  Let us consider Romans 9:23-24: And what if He should make known the riches of His glory upon vessels of mercy, which He had before prepared unto glory, even us, whom He has also called, not only from among the Jews, but also from among the nations?
[84]  God has chosen us to be His vessels, vessels of mercy unto glory.
[85]  For it is God Who operates in you both the willing and the working for His good pleasure Phil 2:13 .
[86]  What does this verse tell us God is doing?
[87]  Does it say that it is God who inspires us from the heavens to will and to do?
[88]  Is the almighty God reaching down from His throne to stir us up?
[89]  Now the God of peace Who brought up from among the dead our Lord Jesus, the great Shepherd of the sheep, by the blood of an eternal covenant, equip you in every good work for the doing of His will, doing in us that which is well-pleasing in His sight through Jesus Christ, to Whom be the glory forever and ever, Amen Heb 13:20-21 .
[90]  The blood opened the door for the new covenant also to come in. The new covenant is to write God s nature into our being as the law of life, to give us a new spirit, and even to put us into God the Spirit.
[91]  In the Lord s conversation with her He indicated that to worship God she must drink of the living water which is God in Christ through the Spirit.
[92]  Man was not created a beast or a monkey.
[93]  It is not that God wants you to behave immorally; His standard is far higher than yours.
[94]  Nonetheless, the concept of being ethical is contrary to God s desire for man.
[95]  In our day, however, God in resurrection through Christ has entered into us as the Spirit, is now indwelling us, is one with us, and has made us one spirit with Himself!
[96]  Before we continue with the central vision of the Apostle Paul s completing ministry, I would like to tell you some of my history in the hope that you will see my gradual realization of the importance of this vision.
[97]  To do good things for others apart from the Lord is to be in the circles of our natural concepts.
[98]  There is yet another circle, separate and distinct from these, which we shall call God in you.
[99]  In Colossians 2:2 Christ is called the mystery of God.
[100]  If we want to receive God, we must receive Christ.
[101]  Paul tells us that Christ is God Himself, the very Triune God; then he also tells us that He became a life-giving Spirit.
[102]  Ephesians 3:14-19 is another reference to the Triune God.
[103]  For this cause I bow my knees unto the Father, of Whom every family in the heavens and on earth is named, that He would grant you, according to the riches of His glory, to be strengthened with power through His Spirit into the inner man, that Christ may make His home in your hearts through faith, that you, having been rooted and grounded in love, may be strong to apprehend with all the saints what is the breadth and length and height and depth, and to know the knowledge-surpassing love of Christ, that you may be filled unto all the fullness of God.
[104]  God the Father listens to the prayer; God the Spirit fulfills the prayer; and God the Son completes what is asked, namely, that Christ make His home in us that we be filled unto all the fullness of God.
[105]  First there is the Father, then the Spirit, then Christ the Son, and finally all the fullness of God.
[106]  The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ, and the love of God, and the fellowship of the Holy Spirit, be with you all.
[107]  . Here is the love of God the Father, the grace of Christ the Son, and the fellowship of God the Spirit.
[108]  CHAPTER TWELVE THE CENTRAL VISION 3 THE CHURCH AS THE MYSTERY OF CHRIST Scripture Reading: Col 1:25-27; Eph 3:3-5, 9-11; 1:19-23; 4:4-6, 12-16; Col 2:19; Rom 12:4-5; 1 Cor 12:12-13, 18, 27
[109]  In the two previous messages we considered God and Christ, and in this message we shall consider the church.
[110]  But to speak of God as our contents, Christ as God s mystery, and the church as Christ s mystery, surely is to speak in a way unfamiliar to most Christians.
[111]  Satan might say, God, You cannot enter into these sinful human beings, but God would reply, Yes, they were sinful, but I have redeemed them.
[112]  Many Christians have only an objective, superficial belief that we were fallen sinners; that God the Father loved the world and sent His Son to be our Savior and Redeemer; that He came as the Lamb of God and died on the cross for our sins; that He was buried; that after three days He was resurrected; that He ascended to heaven and is now seated on the throne; that He sent down the Holy Spirit as His instrument to inspire sinners to repent and believe in Him; that this Holy Spirit as the Representative of the Christ in heaven indwells those who thus believe; that when we have problems we pray to the Father about them; that our Mediator is there on the throne praying for us, taking care of our case and seeing that our prayers are answered.
[113]  There is only one writer in the Bible who tells us of the Body of Christ.
[114]  The mystery of Christ, which is His Body, has been made manifest only in the New Testament age.
[115]  God, Christ, the Spirit with His death and resurrection now indwells us, to make our spirit life v. 10 , to make our mind life v. 6 , and to make even our mortal body life v. 13 . Is this not a mingling? Is this not an organic wrapping up of the Triune God and us, the tripartite man? I tell you, this is the way the members of the Body will be produced.
