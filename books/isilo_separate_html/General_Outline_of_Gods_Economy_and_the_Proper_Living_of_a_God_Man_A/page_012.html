But, O Lord, we truly regret that due to our dullness we have hindered You. We have lived in the natural realm; we have lived in our religious understanding, our ethical understanding, and our own understanding. We ask for Your forgiveness. We really do not want to remain veiled as we were in the past. We pray to You as the blind man did: &#8220;Lord, that I may receive my sight!&#8221; Today, since the age has changed, cause us to have a change that we may catch up with this age. O Lord, enable us to forget the things which are behind, as the apostle Paul did, that we may press forward to the things which are before us-Your vision and revelation.<p>We pray that You would visit us here again that we may earnestly pursue not only to see or know something but also to see a vision, even Your present vision. O Lord, grant us Your visitation. We also need the covering and protection of Your precious blood from the enemy&#8217;s attack. We truly recognize that You have put us in the days of warfare to wage a long-term battle. O Lord, cover us again and resist the enemy&#8217;s attack for us. Amen.<p>Based on the fellowship in the preceding three messages, my burden in this message is to speak concerning the proper living of a Christ-pursuing God-man. Very few in Christianity have a proper understanding of the term &#8220;God-man&#8221;; some of them even oppose the use of this term. They reject not only the teaching concerning our being God-men but also the teaching concerning Christ&#8217;s being a God-man. However, if you do not believe that Christ is a God-man, this is tantamount to not confessing that Christ has come in the flesh (1 John 4:2-3). Only a small number of people confess that Christ is a God-man, and among this small number, there are some who do not acknowledge that today we are God-men. They say that we are Christians, believers, and saints but not God-men, and that to say that we are God-men is blasphemy. Hence, there is a great debate regarding the truth concerning the God-man.<p>In A.D. 325, Athanasius, a young theologian who was a student under the church fathers and who assisted in the drafting of the Nicene Creed, made a statement: &#8220;God became man that man might become God.&#8221; This statement became an aphorism in Christianity for generations. But in the past several hundred years it has been seldom referred to in Christian literature.<br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_011.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_013.html">Next</a> </body></html>
