   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Examples of Items Related to the Body</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Some may ask whether or not the receiving of a brother is a local administration matter or something related to the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>We must realize that to receive a brother is very serious.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Receiving the saints is quite crucial because this decides whether or not you are sectarian.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>If your receiving of the saints does not cover all the genuine saints, that receiving is sectarian.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>By this we can see that the receiving of the saints is not merely a local administration matter because it affects the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>If you receive every genuine believer, you are a part of the Body representing the Body and not a sect representing yourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>However, if you receive the saints according to your taste, this is sectarian.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>We should not say that receiving the saints is merely a local matter.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>A decision to have seven meetings a week or four meetings a week is merely, purely, and singly a local administration matter.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>This does not affect any other local churches and has nothing to do with the testimony or with the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>To receive the saints on the positive side and to exclude the saints on the negative side, however, means a lot because it affects the entire Body.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>You should not consider this as a local matter because this is a matter belonging to the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>If you exclude one from your local church, you exclude one from the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>If you are not receiving one into your local church, you are not receiving one into the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>This aspect is above the regions and also above the churches.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>It is a Body matter and not just a local church matter.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Let me cite another illustration to show that something done by a local church may not merely be a local church matter, but fully related to the entire Body.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>For a local church to receive a ministry that is different from the general ministry which produces the churches, establishes the churches, and is still edifying the churches affects the entire Body.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Paul's ministry was a general ministry to produce the Gentile churches, to establish them, to edify them, and to help them grow.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>I refer to Paul's ministry as a general ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Then Apollos came in with another ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>For the church in Corinth to receive such a ministry, they must consider the effect of receiving such a ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Undoubtedly, you have the right to receive any ministry because you are a local church.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>However, you must consider that your receiving of such a ministry is not merely a local matter.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>This is not like making a decision as to how many meetings a local church should have.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>We must also realize that for a local church to print and distribute publications affects the testimony of all the churches.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>When a local church puts out a printed testimony it should be done in a very careful way with much consideration as to how this would affect the Lord's testimony universally.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>We must always consider the effect of what we do on all the local churches.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>These three illustrations are good enough and strong enough to tell us that it is not right to think that just because we have a regional work with a few churches under this regional work, we have the full jurisdiction to do everything according to our choice without caring for the Lord's universal testimony, universal Body, universal ministry, and universal move.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>If we think and practice in this way, we will get in trouble, and we will make trouble for others.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Every local church does have its own jurisdiction, but whatever a local church does must be done in a careful consideration as to how this would affect the Lord's universal testimony, universal Body, universal move, and universal ministry.</S>
