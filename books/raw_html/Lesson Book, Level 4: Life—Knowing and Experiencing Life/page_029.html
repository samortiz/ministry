We have been saved and regenerated. The law of life and the light of life are in us. We have the sense of life and have been brought into the fellowship of life. We see that we have been purchased by and for God, and we have consecrated ourselves for God’s satisfaction because of His love. It seems as though we have all we need and have done everything there is to do. However, there is much more to our Christian life. We may have everything already, but now is the time to experience these things item by item, to grow in life and to mature in life.<p>In this lesson, we will learn how to preserve our whole being, spirit and soul and body, so that we may be a person of life. [Through the fall our body has been ruined, our soul has been contaminated, and our spirit has been deadened. In God’s full salvation, our entire being is saved and made complete and perfect. For this, God is preserving our spirit from any deadening element (Heb. 9:14), our soul from remaining natural and old (Matt. 16:24-26), and our body from the ruin of sin (1 Thes. 4:4; Rom. 6:6). Such a preservation by God and His thorough sanctification sustain us to live a holy life unto maturity that we may meet the Lord in His parousia] (second coming).
