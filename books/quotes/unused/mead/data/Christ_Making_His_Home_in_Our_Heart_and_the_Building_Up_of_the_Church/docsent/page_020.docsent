   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER EIGHT THE SIGNIFICANCE OF BREAKING BREAD LIFE AND BUILDING Scripture Reading: 1 Cor 10:16-17, 21b; 11:17-29 THE TWO ASPECTS OF THE SIGNIFICANCE</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>OF BREAKING BREAD</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>We have the bread-breaking meeting every Lord s Day.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>There are two aspects of the significance of breaking the bread, and both aspects are related to life and building.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>God entered into us to be our life so that we can be built up together.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>God is in us to be our life.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>This is a crucial matter.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Another crucial matter is that God causes us to be built up together as a corporate entity.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Hence, God s intention with man has two crucial aspects: He desires man to receive Him as life, and by means of this life and through this life, He builds us up into a corporate entity.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>If we comprehend the significance of the Lord s setting up of His table, we will see that according to His intention, the matter of breaking bread includes life and building.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Receiving the Lord into Us</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>and Enjoying Him as Life</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The first aspect of the significance of the bread-breaking meeting is that the Lord wants us to receive Him as the bread of life.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>When the Lord established His supper, He said, This is My body which is being given for you; do this in remembrance of Me Luke 22:19 .</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>This shows that true remembrance of the Lord is to receive Him and enjoy Him.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Every time we break bread, we receive the bread and take it into us.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>This may seem to be an outward form; however, we know that this is a symbol which speaks of a spiritual fact.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Therefore, when we receive the bread with our hand, we should also use our spirit to contact the Lord Jesus as the bread of life.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>When we take the bread into us, we should also use our spirit to receive the Lord Jesus as the bread of life into us.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>As we contact the Lord, receive the Lord, and enjoy Him in this way, we receive Him into us.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>This is our true remembrance of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>For many Christians, to remember the Lord is to think about the Lord and to praise Him a little.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>However, this is the way people in the world remember their family members or a famous person.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Our remembrance of the Lord far exceeds this kind of remembrance.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>There are many times when we think of the Lord and praise Him.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>However, this cannot be considered as our remembrance of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The central focus of our remembrance of the Lord is that we enjoy Him and receive Him into us as our element.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>This is our central focus: the Lord has entered into us to be our life and our food.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>If in our remembrance of the Lord, we merely think of Him and praise Him, without receiving Him and enjoying Him, then our remembrance of Him is lacking, and we have not touched the intention of His heart.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>None of our relatives can work themselves into us nor can any famous person.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Even our parents, who love us the most, cannot work themselves into us.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>All their acts of love and favor are merely outward.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>When they pass away and we remember them, our remembrance, at the most, will be to miss them and thank them.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>What the Lord has done for us far exceeds all the things that our parents can do for us.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Not only has the Lord blessed us outwardly; He is also working Himself into us to be our life.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The focus of what the Lord is to us is that He enters into us to be our life.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Hence, when we remember Him, we should not think merely of how great He is and how much He has done for us.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>When we remember the Lord, we must touch the central point; we must receive Him with our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>What we do outwardly is merely a symbol that represents what we do in our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>When we receive the bread into our hand, our spirit should contact the Lord as the bread of life.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>When our mouth eats the bread, our spirit should receive the Lord as the bread of life.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>To receive and enjoy the Lord in this way is true remembrance of Him.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>When the Lord established the breaking of bread with His disciples, He said, Take, eat; this is My body Matt 26:26 .</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>He also said, This is My body which is being given for you; do this in remembrance of Me Luke 22:19 .</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The Lord did not say that praising and thanking Him are our remembering of Him.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>He said that when we take and eat Him, we are remembering Him.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>We can use our spirit to receive, absorb, and enjoy the Lord, and we can have sweet fellowship with Him in our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>He said that contacting and enjoying Him in this way is our remembrance of Him.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>This is the first aspect of the significance of breaking bread.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Believers Being Blended as One Entity</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>to Be the Mystical Body of Christ</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>The second aspect of the significance of breaking bread does not concern what the Lord is to us or what we are to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>It concerns our relationship with one another.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>The bread that we take during the bread-breaking meeting is produced from many grains that have been ground into powder and blended together.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>The bread does not refer only to the physical body of the Lord Jesus, which was given for us on the cross; even more, it refers to His mystical Body, which is composed of all the saved ones who are blended together.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Everyone who is saved is a grain of wheat.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>We are many grains.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>God does not intend for each grain to remain whole and intact.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>God desires each grain to be broken and blended together with other grains to become one loaf.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>In John 12:24 the Lord said, Unless the grain of wheat falls into the ground and dies, it abides alone; but if it dies, it bears much fruit.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Formerly, the Lord was the one grain of wheat.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>After His death and resurrection, He brought forth many grains.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>The many grains are all those who have been saved and have His life.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>The Lord desires that all of us, the many grains, be broken and ground together as wheat.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>We will be ground until I no longer look like myself, and you no longer look like yourself.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>As the many grains, we will be ground into powder so that we can be blended into one loaf.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>This one loaf is the mystical Body of Christ, which is the church 1 Cor 10:17 .</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Although there are thousands of saved ones, we are still one bread, one Body.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>The first significance we touch at the Lord s table is that the Lord Jesus gave up His body on the cross so that He could impart Himself into us for our enjoyment.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>The second significance concerns the joining of every believer to be the one mystical Body of Christ, the church.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>The Lord Jesus gave up His own body on the cross so that He could impart Himself into us to produce His mystical Body.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>When the Lord Jesus was living and walking in the regions of Judea and Galilee, He had only His body of flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>When He was crucified on the cross, He gave up this body.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>The giving up of His body was so that He could impart Himself into us and that we could have His life.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>As a result, thousands of believers have become His mystical and enlarged Body.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>After His death and resurrection, He continues to live on the earth in His enlarged Body.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>Even today, He is living on the earth in this enlarged Body.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>His physical body is His alone by birth; His mystical Body is composed of the believers, thousands of saved ones.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>Through death He gave up His physical body on the cross; through life in resurrection He gained a mystical Body.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>He gave up a physical body and gained a mystical Body.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>By giving up His body, He gained us.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>The significance of the bread that we receive at the table meeting has these two aspects.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>On the one hand, this bread speaks of the physical body that was given up for us; that is, the Lord Jesus gave up His body on the cross for us.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>Therefore, when we take the bread and eat it, we enjoy the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>On the other hand, this bread speaks of the enlarged Body of Christ, which includes thousands of believers.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>When we receive the bread, we are in this enlarged and mystical Body, having fellowship with thousands of saints and enjoying them in the fellowship.</S>
