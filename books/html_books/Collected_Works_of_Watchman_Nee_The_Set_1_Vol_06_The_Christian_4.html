This is a very important question! Salvation or perdition depends on whether or not you are at peace with God. If you are at peace with God, you are very secure because you have passed from death to life and received the blessing God has prepared in the Lord Jesus. But if you are not at peace with God, you are in a dangerous and pitiful condition because God's wrath abides upon you. How terrible this is! You should answer this question in an honest way. Are you at peace with God? You should not be careless or presumptuous. If you are at peace with God, you are at peace. If you are at enmity with God, you are at enmity. There is no middle ground. If you have not drawn nigh to God by the death of the Lord Jesus, you are God's enemy. The world is at enmity with God. Fighting against heaven is not the meaning of being at enmity with God; you do not have to fight against heaven to be at enmity with God. When you walk according to the flesh and ignore God's demand, caring only for living in your lusts, you are at enmity with God. The Bible says, "The mind set on the flesh is enmity against God; for it is not subject to the law of God, for neither can it be" (Rom. 8:7). A man does not have to purposely oppose God or rebel against Him in order to become an enemy of God. Dear readers, as long as you set your mind on the flesh, this is enmity against God. You may agree with religion, admire Christ, and help the church. All these things are good. But they do not indicate that you are not an enemy of God. As long as you set your mind on the flesh, it is enmity against God. When you set your mind on the flesh, you are not subject to the law of God, neither can you be. Setting the mind on the flesh is rebelling against God's law. How holy and righteous is God's law! Can you keep His law? How many times have you walked according to your flesh and the lusts of your flesh? How mild is the expression "the mind set on"! It does not require a rebellious act to be at enmity with Him; all that is required is a little private act of setting the mind on the flesh in the hidden part of your heart. This is enmity against God! Man not only disobeys God's law; he is even unable to submit to God's law. Man is corrupted in his very nature. Dear ones, do you know that your nature is corrupted? Many times you consider God's law to be good and upright, and you desire to keep it. But what is the result? You find that you cannot keep the law. It is impossible for you to keep the law. Although at times you may want to keep God's law, there seems to be a power within that forces you to set your mind on the flesh and break God's law. Your nature is corrupted; it is impossible for you to obey God's law. You must acknowledge that you are completely corrupted before God's salvation can come. Is it not true that there are many times when you do not want to indulge yourself in dissipation and wantonness? Then why do you fall into them again and again? Man's nature is corrupted. The world is at enmity with God, and you are included in this world!</P><P>Moreover, is it not true that your heart loves the world? Does praise of the world touch your heart? "Adulteresses, do you not know that the friendship of the world is enmity with God? Therefore whoever determines to be a friend of the world is constituted an enemy of God" (James 4:4). This is God's Word. An actual act of adultery is not necessary in order to become an adulterer in the Lord's eyes. The meaning of adultery is having a friendship with those whom you should not have a friendship. The world crucified the Lord Jesus. How can you be friendly with those who crucified the Lord and not be an enemy of God? Has the world changed? Is the world better than when Christ was on earth? If it is not, why are you fellowshipping with the world? Look at the lovely worldly people, the interesting worldly things, and the adorable worldly objects. You have established an inseparable bond with the world through its people, things, and objects. Therefore, you are an enemy of God. A man who is not at peace with God through regeneration is filled with the thoughts of people, things, and objects in the world all day long. He seeks after worldly fame, profit, and power. His face is toward the earth, and his back is turned against heaven. He ignores God's demand and is an enemy of God. Readers, have you been washed in the precious blood of the Lord? If you have not, and if you are a friend of the world, you are an enemy of God.</P><P>Your conduct is a great proof that you are an enemy of God. You do not do what God wants, and you do what God does not want. Daily you commit many sins. Your evil acts are an expression of your inward enmity. You are "alienated and enemies in your mind because of your evil works" (Col. 1:21). Evil works! Sins! Defilements! These are indelible evidences of man being at enmity with God. The Scripture says, "There is none righteous, not even one" (Rom. 3:10). No flesh can justify itself before God. No one in the world can be justified before God through his works. All the conduct of the world is evil work in the eyes of God. Although a great deal of behavior is acceptable before men, in God's eyes it is still full of defects and part of the "evil works." Does your conduct before God tell you that you are at enmity with Him? Do not think that you are better than others. You have to realize that there are many evil works such as pride, vainglory, and self-justification in all of the so-called good works! Please acknowledge your poor condition, and trust in the Lord Jesus Christ. There is still the possibility of salvation. But if you are self-satisfied and self-contented, you will die in your sins. May the Holy Spirit convict you of sin, so that you will realize your true condition! Unless those in the world put themselves in the place of a sinner and acknowledge that they are enemies of God, they cannot receive God's grace. Unless men confess that they cannot please God and that their nature, desires, and conduct are contrary to God, they will not and cannot come to the cross to seek for God's salvation. Unless men realize that it is terrible to be an enemy of God, and unless they are aware of the coming eternal wrath, they may say that they believe in Christ, but their believing will not be a true believing. What is man? Is he not but a speck of dust? Is he not but a worm? How small a place does he occupy in the universe! What is there to boast in? Who is God? He is the Almighty. Heaven is His throne, and the earth is His footstool. Trying to speak of His greatness would exhaust a man's lifetime. For a little mortal to be an enemy of the great God is not only unfortunate, but unthinkable. Can the world escape perdition when it is at enmity with God? No. The Bible says, "The wrath of God abides upon him" (John 3:36). Therefore, do not be deceived. Do not think that your outward behavior is very good. You have to realize that it is a fatal thing to be "enemies in your mind" (Col 1:21). Do not think that it is a small thing to be at enmity with God. Nothing is worse than this.</P><P>Thank and praise the Lord! He loves the world. He is not willing to see any perish. He desires that all men be saved. He does not want to condemn man for his sins. Although the world-you and I included-are at enmity with Him, He patiently forbears. He sent His only begotten Son, Jesus Christ, to the world to die on the cross for us, to be our propitiation, and to propitiate God's righteous wrath. He has suffered on our behalf all the punishment that we deserve for our sins. We disobey God, oppose Him, and hate Him. The perdition that we deserve because of our nature, mind, and conduct have been borne by Him. He stood in the place of the sinner and enemy, saying, at the time of His crucifixion, "My God, My God, why have You forsaken Me?" (Matt. 27:46). He is God's Beloved. God is pleased with Him, and God is always near to Him. By taking up our sins and standing on our behalf as an enemy to suffer God's righteous judgment of wrath, He saw the dear Father forsake Him. Through His death and rejection for us, He has accomplished peace and salvation once for all. What grace this is!</P><P>Therefore, dear ones, through the accomplished salvation of the Lord Jesus, we are "reconcile[d]...to God through the cross" (Eph. 2:16). We do not have to try to change for the better, mortify ourselves, or inflict pain upon ourselves. None of these can satisfy God's heart. Everything that we need is "through the cross." Salvation is accomplished; there is nothing more to add. The Lord Jesus has "made peace through the blood of His cross" (Col. 1:20). When the Lord Jesus suffered on the cross, He shed His blood. His blood speaks better things than the blood of Abel. Peace has been established. Christ has fully accomplished salvation for us. We do not have to accomplish anything or strive for anything because everything is done.</P><P>Before the Lord Jesus accomplished salvation, God loved the world, but the sin of the world forbade Him from drawing near to men and forbade men from drawing near to God. Now the Son of God has died. "God in Christ was reconciling the world to Himself" (2 Cor. 5:19). Now the relationship between God and man is changed. The death of Christ did not change God's heart, because He has always loved the world. Neither has His death changed the heart of man, because the world still lives in sin and disobedience to God. But thank the Lord, when Christ died, the relationship between God and man changed. God has judged the Lord Jesus, and now He can receive the world without any obstacle. We can illustrate this matter with a story. Suppose that a judge had an only begotten son whom he loved dearly. Then the son stole some money which belonged to his father's office and ran away. Although the father still loved the son, the father-son relationship changed. Even though they were father and son, the father could not treat him as a son after he was caught. He must judge and condemn him, considering him the same as all the other criminals. Although his father loved him, the son could not break the law. But the father could sell his possessions to pay the penalties so his son could be free. Then the father could receive the son unhindered. We have sinned and offended God. We deserve to be judged and condemned. We deserve to suffer eternal perdition. But God loves us. He Himself came to be a man-the Lord Jesus is God-and He suffered on the cross to pay the debt of sin for us; He has changed the relationship between God and man. Now God can receive sinners. Peace is established. The question is whether or not man will receive this peace. This will determine his salvation or perdition.</P><P>Readers, are you at peace with God? Are you saved? Are you at peace with God through the Lord Jesus? God's way is "peace toward God through our Lord Jesus Christ" (Rom. 5:1), and to be "reconciled to God through the death of His Son" (v. 10). It is not your own merit that puts you at peace with God. You may be a church member; you may have been baptized and have partaken of Holy Communion. You may go to church, read the Bible, and pray often. You may even have exhorted others to believe in the Lord. You may be a preacher, one who bears responsibilities in the church, or a church leader. But if you are not reconciled to God through the death of the Lord Jesus and have not believed that His death is for the accomplishment of salvation and for the bearing of your sins, you are still God's enemy and a perishing sinner. Do not think that work and zeal will reconcile you to God. No, the price for reconciliation with God is not that cheap. If God considered the death of the Lord Jesus to be necessary, He will not be satisfied with anything less than the death of the Lord Jesus. Man either is reconciled to God through the Lord Jesus or remains God's enemy through rejecting the Lord and trusting in himself. The result is eternal perdition.</P><P>God has paid all the price. He has accomplished a full salvation. The Lord Jesus has fully accomplished peace. Salvation and perdition are before you. You cannot be saved by your righteousness, and you do not have to perish because of your sin. The question is whether or not you will trust in the Lord Jesus' accomplished salvation.</P><P>During the American Civil War, one winning general told the enemy troops, "I am now setting aside a few miles as the zone of peace. If any enemy soldier drops his weapon and steps into this zone, he will be spared from death. Otherwise he will be killed." Many who believed the general ran into this zone. Everyone who dropped his weapon was saved. Those who doubted and refused to walk into the zone were slaughtered. Dear ones, God has ordained the cross of Golgotha as the place of peace. You were at enmity with God. If you are willing to forsake your sins, stand on the ground of the cross, and trust in the peace that the Lord Jesus has accomplished, you will be saved. If you continue to doubt, you will die in your sins. Whether or not an enemy soldier will live or die depends on whether or not he will step into the zone. Perhaps some were standing outside the line; perhaps some were just a few feet away from the line and could have stepped inside with one stride. But they were still outside the line, and they were killed. Dear ones, do not delay! Do not miss by a step! Trust in the Lord and be saved. Why not do it now? "Let him who wills take the water of life freely" (Rev. 22:17). Come!</P><P>If you come and receive the Lord's accomplished peace, you will be delivered from your sins and need not fear the judgment of sin. The Scripture says, "God in Christ was reconciling the world to Himself, not accounting their offenses to them" (2 Cor. 5:19). What a joy this is! We will surely be saved. "We will be saved...having been reconciled" (Rom. 5:10). Since we have received salvation, sin will not condemn us anymore. What joy this is! "Boasting in God through our Lord Jesus Christ, through whom we have now received the reconciliation" (v. 11).</P><P>Dear ones, let me ask you again: Are you reconciled to God? You should answer this question quickly. Your destiny depends on how you answer this question today. "On behalf of Christ then we are ambassadors, as God entreats you through us; we beseech you on behalf of Christ, Be reconciled to God" (2 Cor. 5:20). "And coming, He announced peace as the gospel to you who were far off, and peace to those who were near" (Eph. 2:17). May the Holy Spirit touch the hearts of all those who read this article to receive the Lord as their Savior.</P><P>"Lord, I was Your enemy. Now through Your demonstration of love on the cross, and through the peace You established, I believe in You. Lord, save me, a sinner!"</P><H1 CLASS=MSG>MESSAGE TWO</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>CAN MORALITY SAVE US</H1><H2 CLASS=HEAD4>Issue No. 3</H2><P>(The translation of the Chinese title for this message is "Can Man Be Saved by Doing Good." The title above was given by the author on the English cover of the original magazine.)</P><P>Can man be saved by doing good? The world's answer is yes. But God's answer in the Bible is no. The authority to decide our salvation is in the hand of God. Salvation is not according to our will. Our salvation is related to God; we cannot make any decision on our own. We cannot be saved just because we think we are. Nor can we be unsaved just because we think we are. Readers, listen to the voice of God. You have to listen to what He has to say. Do not think that as long as you can do good, you will be saved. You have to know that this matter is decided by God.</P><P>Can morality save men? No. Absolutely no. Blessed is the man who knows this fact. Today men think that exhorting others to believe in Jesus is the same as exhorting them to do good. Little do they realize that exhorting men to believe in the Lord Jesus is really proving to them that they cannot do good. Even many believers do not realize that man is not saved by doing good. Their thought is to try their best to keep God's Word, attend services, offer money, help the church, and strive to be good, hoping that by so doing, they will be saved. Little do they realize that these things are all vain! These things do not help at all in the matter of their salvation. (Of course I do not mean that we should not keep God's Word, offer money, etc. I am saying that we cannot be saved by these things.)</P><P>It is most vain to argue and reason with man's words. Let us then turn to God's Word. Whatever God says is fixed. "For we account that a man is justified by faith apart from the works of the law" (Rom. 3:28). The meaning of "works of the law" here is to try to do good. The law was enacted by God. It shows men what they ought to do. If a man could keep God's law, he would be the best person on earth. But God says here through the apostle that He has reckoned, that He is perfectly clear, that man is not justified by keeping the law and doing good. What is the meaning of justification? It means that God not only forgives your sins, but reckons you righteous. In other words, to be justified is to be saved. A justified person is a saved person. God teaches that you cannot be saved or justified by keeping the law. For this reason, my dear sinners, do not trust in your works, and do not think that you can be saved by doing good. Stop your own work! Confess that you are a hopeless sinner! Accept the Lord Jesus as your Savior, and you will be saved.</P><P>God is worthy of man's praise because His salvation of man is not based on man's good works. He says, "Where sin abounded, grace has superabounded" (Rom. 5:20). Readers, do you know that you are sinners? Does not your conscience condemn you? Do you not think that men such as you are helpless? Do not be deceived in thinking that you can be saved by doing good, or that you can be saved by joining a church, singing in a choir, praying, or attending services. Do not try to mend your transgressions by human ways. You are sinners, and no matter how much you mend yourselves, you are still sinners. It is like a black man from Africa. No matter how much he tries to put on powder or paints himself with white paint, he is still a black man. Do not try to do good by yourselves anymore! No matter how much you have sinned, the blood of the Lord is able to cleanse you. Come!</P><P>Mr. Spurgeon of England was an evangelist who was greatly used by the Lord. Once he said that if the Lord would save him only if he did good, he would never want to be a Christian. He gave an illustration. Suppose he had done many good things, and then presented this goodness before God and asked, "Since I have done so much good, can I be saved?" Since God is the God of all goodness, surely He would not approve of Spurgeon's goodness. He would shake his head and say, "You have not done enough!" Spurgeon said he would then go away in discouragement and would try to do better. After a few years, he would present his goodness before God again, asking God if his goodness was good enough, and if he could be saved. God would answer again, "You are still not good enough. You still cannot be saved." This could go on for two or three more times, and God would still not be satisfied. How then could he be saved? If God expected him to do good before he could be saved, He would probably never be satisfied, and Spurgeon would not be saved even if he worked himself to death. Is this not a pitiful thing? Spurgeon concluded that if God expected him to do good before he could be saved, then he would not want to be a Christian in the first place because he would find out after striving for many years on earth that God would not be satisfied with him and whatever he would have done would have been in vain. We have to thank the Father because we do not have to do good. All we need to do is to believe in God's Son, and we shall be saved. Although it is true that God is not satisfied with our works, and although it is true that we do not have any merit of our own, He is pleased in His Son, the Lord Jesus. He is satisfied with the righteousness that the Lord Jesus accomplished on the cross. Although we cannot and will not do good by ourselves, the minute we believe in His Son and accept the merit of His Son's shed blood on the cross, we will be saved.</P><P>Dear readers, do not be deceived by Satan into thinking that you will be saved by doing good. You must realize that just as you cannot build a ladder that reaches heaven, you cannot secure God's salvation through doing good. We do not obtain God's justification through good works. Rather, we are "being justified freely by His grace through the redemption which is in Christ Jesus" (Rom. 3:24). "If by grace, it is no longer out of works; otherwise grace is no longer grace" (11:6). Are not these two verses very clear? We are justified and saved by God, not because of works, but because of His own grace. Grace and work are two principles that are completely opposite. Grace means that God is willing to save whether a man is good or bad. Man is not worthy to be saved, but because of mercy, God gives him salvation freely. Work, on the other hand, is very different. Work means that only good people will be saved, while bad ones will perish. In other words, man has to do good to save himself, and all those who cannot save themselves will perish. We know that we are all sinners. Although we may not have committed the sins of murder or arson, our nature is corrupted; our thoughts and conduct are full of deceit. We are truly sinners! How can we be saved through works? Thank and praise God that He does not save us because of our work. He is saving us because of His free grace, a grace which we do not deserve.</P><P>Many people today think that even though salvation is of God's grace, we should, nevertheless, have our work. They think that God's grace should be supplemented with our work before we can be saved; otherwise, we will still perish. Alas, the man in the flesh always wants to be saved by his own self! We should remember the words in Romans 11:6: "But if by grace, it is no longer out of works..." Grace and work cannot stand side by side. Either we have grace or we have work. We can never have grace and work at the same time. "Otherwise..." Here the apostle speaks from the negative angle. If one mixes grace with work, then "grace is no longer grace." God's boundless, incomparable, royal grace, if supplemented by man's ragged works, will become something unseemly and awkward. Man's work will not accomplish God's grace. On the contrary, it will make grace "no longer grace." Therefore, sinners, if you want to be saved, you must never think that you should do good, or that doing good will help you to be saved. You should humble yourselves and acknowledge that you are helpless sinners. You should accept God's grace with faith and thanksgiving; by His Son's accomplishment on the cross, you will be saved. Wonderful grace is given freely to sinners!</P><P>We can look again at God's Word to see how good works cannot save. "A man is not justified out of works...we might be justified...not out of the works of law, because out of the works of law no flesh will be justified" (Gal. 2:16). "For as many as are of the works of law are under a curse" (3:10). "By law no one is justified before God" (v. 11). I have told you that the meaning of keeping the law is to do good. To be justified by the law means to be saved through works. What do these few verses say? Those who are saved are not saved through doing good. Not only will they not be saved through doing good, but they will be cursed if they want to be saved through good works! The Bible tells us explicitly that no one is saved through good works. If that is the case, why struggle to do something that can never be achieved? Friends, here is the Lord Jesus' accomplished work. He has paid all the price, and has been crucified on the cross for your sake. You do not need to mournfully seek for salvation. He has accomplished His work. If you receive what He has accomplished, you will be saved. Why struggle in your own ways? Believe in Him! After you believe in Him, praise Him because He has so loved you and has prepared salvation for you!</P><P>There are two verses which explain the question of salvation clearly. We can take a look at them. "For by grace you have been saved through faith, and this not of yourselves; it is the gift of God; not of works that no one should boast" (Eph. 2:8-9). After reading these two verses, we should realize that they concern the question of salvation. This is why in the first sentence there is the expression "you have been saved." This clearly concerns salvation.</P><P>How are you saved? Is it by good works? No. Is it because you are stronger than others? No. How then is man saved? The Bible tells us that salvation is by two things: God's grace and man's faith. "By grace you have been saved through faith" (2:8). Grace is given by God. God has prepared a Savior for us. He has "caused the iniquity of us all to fall on Him" (Isa. 53:6) by sending Him to the cross to die and bear all the punishment for our sins. Through His suffering and bearing pain for us and by drinking the cup of God's righteous wrath, He accomplished a full salvation for us. How great is this grace! This is God's grace; it is the basis of salvation. Man can render no help; He has accomplished everything on our behalf. God has now prepared salvation and presented it before us. Salvation is placed before every sinner-it is placed before you.</P><P>We have seen God's grace manifested on the cross of Calvary. But how can we be saved? It is not by doing good or by mortifying ourselves. Neither is it by improvement or by attending church services. "By grace you have been saved through faith" (Eph. 2:8). Now we come to another aspect of salvation. No doubt God gives grace. Even though God gives grace, we cannot be saved unless we believe. The immense grace of God prepared a death-substituting salvation on the cross of Calvary for us. We must believe in Him before we can be saved.</P><P>What is the meaning of believing? To believe is to receive (John 1:12). God has prepared the grace. When we receive it, we are saved. If a man gives you something precious, it is yours when you receive it. When you receive the grace of salvation which God gives you, grace will be yours, and you will be saved. I must persuade you not to delay but to receive Him now. I wish that you would stretch out the hand of faith and accept God's great grace to you. Here is an illustration: a rich man saw many poor people about to die of cold in snowy winter weather. He became very charitable and began to investigate the names and addresses of many of the poor people. Then he ordered his servant to go out with a carriage full of coal to give to them. His servant accordingly took the carriage, and when he reached the first door, he asked if that house was the right number on the right street and if the name of the person living there was so-and-so. When the person who opened the door said yes, the servant told him that his master had sent him to offer coal. The poor man thought that this was a mistake; he thought that he did not have such a kind friend. As a result he closed his door to the servant. The servant could not do anything but go to another door. The man at the second door also thought that he did not have such a kind friend. Although the servant used many words to convince him, he was still doubtful and would not accept the coal. The servant had to go to another house. This happened at the next few houses. None of the people in those houses had faith. They all thought that there could not be such a kind person who would buy coal and give it away for free. They would not accept the coal. Later the servant went to the house of a widow. When she learned of the intention of the servant, she gladly received the coal and thanked the master. With the coal she was able to pass through that winter. Friends, this is the way with God's grace; it is absolutely free. Now the servant of the master has sent the Lord's salvation to the door of your heart. If you would receive it, you will enjoy the joy of this salvation. Do not follow the example of the doubting ones, who simply inflicted sufferings on themselves and lost their opportunity forever! You only need to receive. You do not need to do anything else. Once you receive, it is yours.</P><P>Ephesians 2 does not stop at the teaching that salvation is of grace and through faith; it goes on to teach about the nature of salvation. "This" salvation is first "not of yourselves; it is the gift of God"; and second "not of works that no one should boast" (vv. 8-9). "This" refers to the great grace of salvation because the previous sentence speaks of salvation. There are also two types of "not" in salvation: first it is not of ourselves, and second it is not of works. How clear this is! Notice that salvation is not of ourselves. It does not matter whether you think you are more intelligent than others or more ignorant than others. It does not matter whether your morality is above others or below others. It does not matter whether you are very rich or penniless. These things have nothing to do with your salvation. If you receive God's grace, whether you are wise or foolish, moral or immoral, you will be saved. If you do not receive, no matter what kind of person you are, you will still perish. Salvation is not based on your condition. It is based on God's free gift. Salvation is not of works either. It does not depend on what kind of person you are, or your conduct. God did not say that those who do good will be saved. God said that salvation is not of works. You cannot be saved even if you are the best person on earth, and neither can you perish because you may be the worst person on earth. Perdition or salvation do not depend on your work, but on whether or not you will accept God's grace. My dear sinners, do not consider all your goodness! Consider rather your sins! Why would you not come before God with a contrite heart, confessing that you are a sinner, that you have no goodness to boast of, no merit to depend on, and trust solely in the grace that God has given you through the cross of His Son? I invite you to come quickly. While you are reading this, please kneel down and pray. Tell God that you will now receive the Lord Jesus as your Savior. Ask Him to forgive your sins, and be a saved person!</P><P>Why will God not save man according to his works? There are many reasons, but one is "that no one should boast" (2:9). If man is saved by his works, he will surely boast in himself and not give glory to God. The greatest sin of man is to forsake God, to be independent, not trusting in God. The same is true with respect to salvation. Why would someone want to be saved by his own works and not by the salvation that God has prepared? The reason is man's pride. How humbling it is for one to trust in God! There is nothing for that one to boast in! Man wants to be saved through his own works so that he can boast in himself. But God does not want man to be saved this way, for He does not want man to boast in himself. If one can boast in himself, his salvation is not the true salvation.</P><P>Let us look at another passage of the Scriptures. "Not out of works in righteousness which we did but according to His mercy He saved us" (Titus 3:5). After reading this verse, we see that even if we think that we have done much righteousness, God will not save us because of it. Do we really have any righteousness? "For all of us became like him who is unclean, / And all our righteousnesses are like a soiled garment" (Isa. 64:6). We think that our righteousnesses are worth much. But in God's eyes, they are nothing! If God is to save us according to our righteousness, we would all perish because all our righteousnesses, without exception, are as filthy rags. What kind of righteousness can this be considered as? How can it save us? Can God save us by our filthy, rag-like righteousness? No. No. Thank God that He has given us His grace. He saved us because He has mercy on us. He did not save us because of our righteousness. If He saved according to our righteousness, none of us would be saved. We cannot be saved through good works! The meaning of mercy is to give grace to a person who does not deserve it, despite his unworthiness, and to do so through love. We were the sinners. How could we have deserved God's salvation? Yet He has loved us without a reason. He passed over our sins and caused the Lord Jesus to die for us on the cross, bestowing grace to us. "According to His mercy He saved us" (Titus 3:5).</P><P>Therefore, readers, do not think that you can be saved by your good works! You should hurry to believe in the Lord Jesus. He does not want you to do good. He wants to save you. He will save you. You do not have to do good. You only have to believe in Him. Although you have not done any good and although you are most sinful, His crucifixion on the cross was a substitutionary death for you to redeem you from sin. He has borne your evil works and the sin of your evil works. You can now come just as you are before Him, in your condition of failure in doing good works. Receive Him as the Savior. He will save you. He will receive you, and He will change you.</P><P>Perhaps you are a so-called member of a church already. Perhaps you have been baptized and have been received into the Holy Communion. Perhaps you are a leader of a church. But you should know that none of these will save you. If you do not believe in the Savior who has died for you and has borne your sins, whatever good you have done and whatever position you occupy will not change you from being a perishing man. You are still no different from anyone else! Before God, nothing will shelter a man from the wrath of God except the blood of the Lord Jesus. Any kind of good work will fail. Only the saving work of the cross of the Lord Jesus is trustworthy. Every way to salvation that depends on your own work is from the bottomless pit and is destined for hell. God has established only one way of salvation, which is to accept the grace which comes from the cross. There is no other way to be saved than to take God's way.</P><P>Finally, let me read you one verse from the Scriptures, "I do not nullify the grace of God; for if righteousness is through law, then Christ has died for nothing" (Gal. 2:21). Salvation does not come through good works. If a man can be saved through good works, then Christ has died in vain! If a man can satisfy God's heart by doing good himself, God would not have been so foolish as to send His Son to the world to die in vain and give up His life for nothing. If you think that doing good will help you be saved, you are nullifying the grace of God. Sinners, God may be foolish, but He is still wiser than you. If a man can be saved by good works, God would surely not have given up His Son in vain. Since He has caused His Son to die for us and bear our sins, this proves that we cannot do good and cannot be saved by doing good. He has established the way of salvation. If you will receive the Lord Jesus as the Savior, you will be saved. Alas, we are truly sinners! God indeed loves us! He is willing to receive us! Though we have no goodness to boast of and no righteousness to call our own, His salvation does not diminish. On the contrary, it is made more manifest. How wonderful this is! I wish that His love would touch you to come to Him in faith, saying, "O God! I am truly a sinner! I know that none of my good works are worth anything before You. I pray that You will receive me and save me because of the substitutionary death of the Savior Jesus Christ."</P><P>"Him who comes to Me I shall by no means cast out" (John 6:37).</P><H1 CLASS=MSG>MESSAGE THREE</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>THE SUFFERING OF THE CROSS</H1><H2 CLASS=HEAD4>Issue No. 5</H2><P>Whenever the Holy Spirit touches me to consider how the Lord Jesus Christ died for me, a sinner, so that I could be free from the punishment of sin and have eternal life, I thank Him with tears for His grace. What suffering my Lord endured on the cross! "O my Lord, how piteous You were to die on lonely Calvary for my sins!"</P><P>The Lord Jesus was the God of glory in heaven. He was the Most Holy One. He did not have to die, and He could not die. But He had compassion for the sinners of the world. He came into this sinful world and took the form of a man. He stood in the position of a sinner and suffered the punishment which sinners deserve. He died so that we may have life. What love is this! Sins were committed by us, the sinners. Evils were done by us, the evil doers. But the punishment of sin, the suffering of hell, fell on the Lord Jesus Christ! What is this? This is substitution, this is love, and this is grace. O sinners, do you know that your sin has crucified the lovely Lord Jesus? I wish that you knew this and that through the love of the Lord Jesus, you would right now be moved to believe in this kind Savior.</P><P>When the Lord Jesus was incarnated into the world, He was born in a manger because there was no room for Him in the inn. How desolate and sad this is! But even today many people have no room for Christ in their hearts. The Bible records that after He was born, they wrapped Him in swaddling clothes and laid Him in a manger. How cold were the swaddling clothes! How hard was the manger! Is this the portion an honorable guest from heaven deserves from the hand of the world? As the Most High Lord, He did not have to come into such a situation. Since He loved you and me, He bore the suffering of this birth. Alas! Our sins afflicted Him.</P><P>He lived on this earth for over thirty years, without coming out from under the shadow of the cross for even a day. He had no settled home or the luxury of a settled meal. Day by day He had no rest, but He was leading the world to believe in His coming death and to have the eternal blessing. While He lived on earth, nothing could refresh His heart. Although His disciples gave Him brief moments of joy, their doubt and ignorance and the world's unbelief and opposition, continually caused Him groaning and heartbreak. He realized that the world was hardened in its heart and could not be turned back. The result was His weeping over Jerusalem. He wept not only for that sinful city, but also for the rebellious hearts of today. O Lord, You became such a One because of my sin! If You did not love me, why did You suffer so many offenses from sinners? While the foxes had holes and the birds of the air had nests, the Son of Man, who loved us, had no place to lay His head! Why did He put Himself into such a situation? He did so only because He loved us. The sins we committed caused Him to suffer all this. In order to save us, He suffered hunger and cold, bearing insults and shame. For our sake He was often hungry and thirsty, traveling everywhere, and eventually dying on the cross. Oh, how great is this grace! Pitiful Savior! How detestable are my sins! You are truly my Savior! I am willing to believe in You.</P><P>Although Christ's sufferings on earth were hard to bear, they were relatively easy compared to His suffering on the cross, where He bore our sins for us. His suffering in His daily life was a foreshadowing of Calvary. He came, not to live, but to die. He came to die for us, that we might live. O sinners, you must realize that if it were not for your sins, the Lord Jesus would not have had to die, and He would not have died. What a pity that we are sinners. He came to die for us. Hard-hearted sinners, will you receive the Lord Jesus as your Savior? He has died for you. Why would you ignore Him?</P><P>Remember the night He was in Gethsemane. The night weather was very cold. Many people sat and warmed themselves at the fire (Mark 14:54). During such a cold night, your Savior was outside in the garden, praying earnestly. Even "His sweat became like great drops of blood falling down upon the ground" (Luke 22:44). What kind of scene is this? Do not laugh, and do not relax! Do not be indifferent, and do not be stubborn! Christ was this way because of your sins and because of my sins. It was as if God had begun putting our sins on Him already in the garden. The shadow of the cross came over Christ completely at that time. He was full of sorrow and pain, and in agony His sweat became like drops of blood. Oh, how I wish that you would know the suffering of sweating drops like blood! It was as if He saw, at that moment, all the sin and evil of the world, the awesomeness of God's wrath, and Himself in the midst of them both. This was a foreshadowing of His bearing man's sin and God's wrath. Because of this He suffered such pain. Yet these were merely shadows of His coming crucifixion. But even while they were shadows, Lord, Your suffering was great.</P><P>Look! His captors came! He could have asked the Father to send twelve legions of angels to rescue Him, yet for the sake of saving us, He was willing to be arrested and have His hands bound. The Old Testament records that the angel of the Lord smote over one hundred thousand Assyrians (Isa. 37:36). One legion totals over six thousand. Surely twelve legions of angels is a large number! The power of twelve legions of angels would be great! On that day they could have easily slaughtered all the people of Jerusalem! But because He wanted to be our Savior, He bore the insults and was willing to be taken in order to die such a death. Was God taken away by man? Yes, because He wanted to save man. The God of heaven wanted to save the world, so He was willing to be taken like a thief by man! All of this was because of your sin and mine!</P><P>Behold, the Son of God taken away by man! First, He was taken to the high priest, Annas. There our Savior was struck by the hand of an ignorant servant! Why did He suffer such an offense from sinners? Because He wanted to save us from perdition and give us eternal life! Our sins afflicted Him!</P><P>Then men took Christ, bound, from Annas to Caiaphas. The Bible says that He was bound as a criminal. He stood in the position of a sinner, and He suffered what sinners deserve, in order to save them. When He was before the high priest, "they spit in His face and beat Him with their fists, and others slapped Him" (Matt. 26:67). Did He commit any sin? No one could convict Him of sins. He endured this treatment for no other reason than our sin!</P><P>Later, men brought our loving Lord Jesus to the council for another trial. There He suffered many malicious offenses and unbearable pain from the world! He wants to save us, the sinners, so He suffered to this extent. We inflicted these sufferings on Him!</P><P>The world mistreated Him without a cause. But it did not stop here. They did not give up until they had put Him to death. He was delivered to Pontius Pilate the governor and was maligned with the crime of rebellion. But God proved His Son's guiltlessness through Pontius Pilate. Three times the governor repeated that He was innocent. Why, then, was He crucified? He was found guiltless. Why should a guiltless One need to suffer punishment for sin? There is no other reason than that there are sins in the world, and the world is sinful. "Him who did not know sin He made sin on our behalf that we might become the righteousness of God in Him" (2 Cor. 5:21). The sinless Jesus Christ was crucified because of your sins. Will you still harden your heart and refuse to receive Him as your Savior? O Lord, have pity on us!</P><P>In order to absolve himself of any responsibility, Pilate delivered the Lord Jesus to Herod. There He suffered the despising and mockery of the soldiers. They put a scarlet robe on Him. Did they respect the Lord Jesus? No! The Bible says that they mocked Him. O Savior Jesus, my sin afflicted You! You endured the insults and bore the shame because You love me. I want to believe in You and love You this very moment! Finally, they took the Lord Jesus back into the common hall of the governor. My dear sinners, do you realize that He never closed His eyelids during the long night until daybreak? He was bound by men and taken here and there. He was dragged over many miles through the night. How unbearable was the grinding He suffered! He bore it all because He loves you and He loves me. Although Pilate acknowledged His innocence, he crucified Him in the end against the law.</P><P>"And Pilate...scourged Jesus and delivered Him up to be crucified" (Mark 15:15). "Scourging" seems to be a common word, but how much suffering is involved! What does it mean? A Roman whip had a wooden handle and at the end of the wooden handle were many leather thongs. At the end of each thong were heavy metal pieces. The victim would be tied to a wooden stake, with his back bared to the whipper who held the wooden handle and whipped with the leather thongs. Three stripes alone could rip open the victim's body. For our sins, the glorious Christ suffered scourging on our behalf. Did the cruel Roman soldiers care about our Savior? No, they were just like all the other sinners. "Swift are their feet to shed blood" (Rom. 3:15). How sad that our Lord Jesus was put into their hands. But thank God! "By whose bruise you were healed" (1 Pet. 2:24). You who are wounded and sick in soul, come with haste to be healed, for He has already received the bruise.</P><P>"And they clothed Him in purple and wove a thorny crown and put it around His head. And they began to salute Him: Rejoice, King of the Jews!" (Mark 15:17-18). This kind of mocking and jeering was intolerable and shameful! The world did not give the Lord Jesus a glorious crown but a crown of thorns. The Lord Jesus bore the curse for us! He wore a crown of thorns which come from the curse of the world's sins. How pointed and sharp were those thorns! How could His perfect forehead endure such piercing? Yes, He was willing to endure pain and shed His blood because He knew that if He did not suffer, we would perish forever.</P><P>"And they beat His head with a reed" (Mark 15:19). The Lord Jesus had a crown of thorns. Surely, this smiting with a reed would push the thorns into His flesh more deeply. As God, Jesus Christ had never experienced this manner of piercing pain. He took man's place and died on the cross because of His love for man, saving man from the eternal perdition of the lake of fire. For this reason, He endured such unspeakable suffering. The soldiers, as instruments of the world's sins, not only afflicted Christ's body, but even afflicted His soul. They "spat at Him. And kneeling down, they bowed before Him" (Mark 15:19). After they finished mocking Him, they led Him away to be crucified.</P><P>There a soldier offered Jesus wine, mingled with gall and myrrh, to drink. It is said that if one drank this wine, the pain of crucifixion would be lessened. But our Savior would not drink it. He did not escape any suffering. He had already counted the cost before He came. He was full of love for all the sinners of the world. He was willing to bear all the affliction and all the punishment for our sins. He tasted death for sinners once for all that we might have eternal life. He was willing to take the place of sinners by tasting all the bitterness of the punishment of sins, so that sinners might have the joy of His righteousness.</P><P>At Calvary men crucified Him. Did just the Roman soldiers and Jewish council crucify Jesus Christ? In reality our sins crucified Him! A cross is constructed of a horizontal and a vertical piece of wood. The soldiers laid the Lord Jesus on the cross, propped open His hand, and nailed His hand to the wood with large iron nails. His flesh was broken, His blood flowed, and the pain pierced His inward parts! The same was done to His other hand and feet! Then they erected the cross, and all the weight of the Lord's body hung on those iron nails! Was God too severe in judging the Lord Jesus this way? No! The sins of the world are truly heavy! Our sins are numerous! The proper punishment for sins is eternal suffering in hell. The suffering of the Lord Jesus on the cross was what we sinners should have suffered. God's judgment of Him was not too severe because we should have suffered such punishment. The work of the Lord Jesus' death for sinners is accomplished. Therefore, "He who believes into Him is not condemned; but he who does not believe has been condemned already, because he has not believed into the name of the only begotten Son of God" (John 3:18). Our sins are like iron nails; they have crucified the Lord Jesus. When the Lord was crucified on the cross, He bled, and His blood soaked the iron nails. Our sin has crucified Him, but His blood covers our sin! This is salvation, yes, what a salvation! "And the blood of Jesus His Son cleanses us from every sin" (1 John 1:7b).</P><P>The Lord Jesus was lifted up on the cross. Sinners, look at His blood-like sweat! Look at His forehead, bleeding from the piercing of thorns! Look at the blood on His back from the stripes! Look at the blood on His hands and feet! Look at the blood beneath His arms! Look at the blood from His whole body! Oh, look at the blood from His very heart! "Without shedding of blood there is no forgiveness" (Heb. 9:22b). This bleeding Savior can forgive your sins. Why do you delay? Do not be cheated by thinking that He bled and suffered only as a pattern for man. The Lord Jesus Himself said, "For this is My blood of the covenant, which is being poured out for many for forgiveness of sins" (Matt. 26:28). Please do not misunderstand; He shed His blood in your stead, and He was crucified in your place. All the suffering He endured was to bear your sins. "For Christ also has suffered once for sins, the Righteous on behalf of the unrighteous, that He might bring you to God" (1 Pet. 3:18). "Who Himself bore up our sins in His body on the tree" (2:24). Sinners, if you are oppressed by sin, where are your sins? Will you bear them by yourself or hand them over to Christ? You must remember well: the death of Christ is a death for you. He loves you. Do not harden your heart. You should consider His sufferings so that, on the one hand, you may know His love and, on the other hand, realize the suffering of the coming judgment if you do not believe in Him.</P><P>We have mentioned the suffering in His body. The suffering in His heart was not any less! His disciples escaped and hid. Some cheated and betrayed Him, and some denied Him! How lonesome He was as He hung on the cross. He tread the winepress alone! No one had compassion on Him. It was a dark scene indeed! He is God, the Most Holy One, who hates sin to the uttermost. But He bore the sins of the world; He was made sin for the world. No one can fully understand such humiliation. On the one hand, Satan and his evil demons mocked Him. "If You are the Son of God, come down from the cross!" (Matt. 27:40). On the other hand, God abandoned Him. "My God, My God, why have You forsaken Me?" (Matt. 27:46). What a desolate scene! Friends, God hates sins even if they are upon His only begotten Son, who was bearing the sins of others. God cannot tolerate sin. He had to forsake His Son even when He was bearing the sins of others. God also has to forsake sinful sinners. If you will not receive Christ as your Savior, you will be forsaken by God forever. O Lord Jesus, the suffering which You endured on the cross is beyond my mind to fathom. O Lord, You suffered to the uttermost. How pitiful You were! I want to receive You as my Savior today.</P><P>Psalm 22 describes the suffering of the Lord Jesus on the cross. David, in his experience, prophesied of the Lord's suffering. Verses 11 through 18 say, "Trouble is near, / For there is none to help me." This speaks of the scattering of the disciples. "Many bulls surround me, / The mighty bulls of Bashan encompass me. / They open their mouth at me, / Like a ravening and roaring lion." This was the rampage of Satan and his forces against the Lord. It could have been through men. "I am poured out like water." Isaiah 53:12 also says, "He poured out His soul unto death." What a suffering to pour out one's life in such a way! "All my bones are out of joint. / My heart is like wax." This describes His suffering as He hung on the cross. His heart was broken. "My strength is dried up like a shard, / And my tongue is stuck to my jaws; / You have put me in the dust of death." This was the judgment of God's flaming wrath on Him at the cross. This was also bearing man's suffering in the lake of fire. At this time, He said, "I thirst." If you compare this with the rich man's unbearable thirst in Hades, you will begin to realize the suffering of the Lord Jesus. "For dogs surround me; / A congregation of evildoers encloses me." This describes the scene around the cross. "They pierce my hands and feet." This refers to nailing His hands and feet. The Son of God was crucified on a cross! "I count all my bones." This shows the suffering of being nailed on the cross. "They divide my garments to themselves, / And for my clothing they cast lots." This was fully fulfilled on Calvary. I hope that whoever reads these few lines will ponder over these verses from the Bible until the crucifixion of the Lord Jesus becomes a vivid reality before their eyes. Alas, His death was the most cruel death in the history of the world. No one ever died as He did! Because He was full of compassion to redeem all sinners, He died such a death. Readers, if the punishment of the lake of fire cannot cause you to fear, you should be moved by the love He demonstrated on the cross and receive Him.</P><P>Now salvation is accomplished! You do not need to do anything. The Lord Jesus has completed the work of salvation for you. He paid the entire price so that you could receive a free salvation. You do not have to pay anything.</P><P>He came down from heaven so that you could ascend to heaven.</P><P>He bore the offenses of sinners so that you could obtain God's acceptance.</P><P>He was forsaken by God for a time so that you could be welcomed by God forever.</P><P>He became poor so that you might become rich.</P><P>He died on the cross so that you might live in heaven eternally.</P><P>What love can be greater than this? Sinners, please do not remain hard-hearted, and do not delay. This is the moment you should come swiftly to Him. He has not given up hope for you.</P><P>"Surely He has borne our sicknesses, / And carried our sorrows; / Yet we ourselves esteemed Him stricken, / Smitten of God and afflicted. / But He was pierced because of our transgressions; / He was crushed because of our iniquities; / The chastening for our peace was upon Him, / And by His stripes we have been healed. / We all like sheep have gone astray; / Each of us has turned to his own way, / And Jehovah has caused the iniquity of us all / To fall on Him" (Isa. 53:4-6).</P><P>"What must I do to be saved?...Believe on the Lord Jesus, and you shall be saved" (Acts 16:30-31).</P><H1 CLASS=MSG>MESSAGE FOUR</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>THE LAMB OF THE PASSOVER</H1><H2 CLASS=HEAD4>Issue No. 7</H2><H1 CLASS=SCRIPTURE>Scripture Reading: Exo. 12</H1><P>God's people, the Israelites, were enslaved in Egypt for many years. God saw their affliction and brought down ten plagues upon the Egyptians to punish them so that they would release His chosen people. After nine plagues had passed, the Egyptians were still hard-hearted. They did not want to lose their slaves. Therefore, God sent down the last plague to show His wondrous might and accomplish His deliverance.</P><P>We want to see how the last plague shows us the way of our salvation. God told the Israelites that He had decreed that all the firstborn in the land of Egypt should die. Whether the firstborn of an Israelite or Egyptian, God had decreed that they should die. "All the firstborn in the land of Egypt shall die" (Exo. 11:5). But God established a way of salvation. He told the Israelites that every household should prepare a lamb without blemish, kill the lamb, put its blood in a basin, and with a bunch of hyssop strike the blood on the two side posts and upper doorpost of each house. At midnight the angel of the Lord would pass through the land of Egypt and smite all the firstborn in houses that did not have the blood of the lamb on the side posts and upper doorpost. By midnight Jehovah had smitten the firstborn of many Egyptians in the houses which did not have the blood of the lamb on the side posts and upper doorpost. Those who did not die denote those who are saved, while those who died denote those who are perishing.</P><P>We should realize that all the firstborn in Egypt should have died. Egypt was under God's judgment. The Israelites were also under God's judgment. The firstborn typifies all sinners (1 Cor. 15:46). Egypt typifies the world, and Pharaoh typifies the devil. All sinners who live in the world and have become the slaves of the devil are under God's judgment. They will all receive God's punishment, eternal death. All have sinned and there is no distinction (Rom. 3:22-23). The wages of sin is death (Rom. 6:23). My dear sinners, please do not take this matter lightly. Do not forget this! You are a sinner, your sins will be punished, and this punishment is eternal perdition and suffering in the lake of fire. You ought to consider your sins more! You ought to consider the punishment that awaits you! Regardless of whether you attend a church, the wrath of God is always upon you unless you are saved and delivered from your sins (John 3:36). O sinners! Do not forget that God is righteous. He surely will judge sins.</P><P>Nevertheless, we are not without hope; there is still a way to salvation. Although we do not have a way by ourselves, God has a way. There is no other way of salvation except God's way. The Bible says, "Neither is there another name [but Jesus] under heaven given among men in which we must be saved" (Acts 4:12). He told the Israelites to prepare a lamb. This lamb was their savior. The blood of the lamb saved them from death.</P><P>This lamb of the Passover signifies our Lord Jesus Christ, for the Scripture says, "For our Passover, Christ, also has been sacrificed" (1 Cor. 5:7). "Behold, the Lamb of God, who takes away the sin of the world!" (John 1:29). "You were redeemed...with precious blood, as of a Lamb without blemish and without spot, the blood of Christ" (1 Pet. 1:18-19). In the past God saved the Israelites with the lamb. Now He is saving us through the Lord Jesus. The Lord Jesus is our Lamb. The Israelites were saved by the lambs and we are saved by the Lord Jesus.</P><P>Do you want to be saved? If not, there is nothing more to say. But if you know that you are a sinner under the judgment of God and cannot escape His righteous judgment, and you wish to be saved, there is a saving way. God has prepared a salvation. He wants to save you.</P><P>The Lord Jesus has been crucified on the cross for our sins. Salvation has been accomplished, and whoever accepts Him as their personal Savior will be saved. The Israelites could not be saved by any other means. They relied on the blood of the lambs. Similarly, only the precious blood of the Lord Jesus can save you. Only the precious blood can save sinners!</P><P>Suppose that I could go back in time with you to the house of an Israelite. (Of course, this is only hypothetical.) Suppose we found a father and son sitting comfortably at home, and I asked him, "I heard that God is going to kill your son at midnight tonight. Why are you still sitting here comfortably? Aren't you afraid of death?"</P><P>The man might answer, "We have nothing to fear, for God has prepared a lamb for us, and the lamb can save our lives. Look at my lamb! How fat! How white! How attractive! How lovable! And listen to the pleasing sound he makes! My lamb is the best; the lambs of my neighbors are not as good as mine. Since I have such a nice, good, and kind lamb, what more do I fear?"</P><P>What he said seems to be correct, but I tell you, at midnight his son will die! He will be killed by the angel of God!</P><P>Why? Has the word of God come in vain? Does he not have a lamb?</P><P>Indeed, he has a lamb. But God wants a dead lamb, not a living one. Let me tell you, a living Lord Jesus cannot save us; only a crucified Lord Jesus can save us. While the Lord Jesus was living on earth, He could not save us. Only after He was crucified could He redeem us. Bethlehem, Nazareth, and Galilee are places that condemn us; only Golgotha is the place which gives us eternal life. Do not marvel at this statement. Many people claim that Jesus is our model, a great man and a great teacher. Others think of Him as a man of good behavior, good morals, noble humanity, and great might. But, let me tell you, the more excellent the Lord Jesus is, the more your inadequacy is exposed! His goodness cannot save you; it will only condemn you! When God sees Him, God is satisfied. Although we may try our best to imitate Him, the more we try, the more our inward sinful nature and outward evil acts demonstrate our unworthiness. Our conduct will never please God. The more we imitate, the more we find that we will not and cannot imitate Him.</P><P>Do not be deceived! Although you may speak about the excellency of Christ's humanity and the loftiness of His morality, only He is excellent and only He is lofty. He and you have no relationship. Thank and praise God! His Son did not come into the world to be our model. God does not want us to imitate Christ with our own efforts so that we can be saved. He sent His Son to die for us sinners and accomplish salvation on our behalf. We do not need to do anything by ourselves, because He has already accomplished everything. We were sinners and the punishment we deserved was death and perdition. However, the punishment we deserved and the judgment we should have received have all been borne and received by the Lord Jesus. He died as sin in our place. His death should have been ours, but He died in our place. Therefore, we do not need to be punished for our sins anymore. "Surely He has borne our sicknesses, / And carried our sorrows / ...But He was pierced because of our transgressions; / He was crushed because of our iniquities; / The chastening for our peace was upon Him, / And by His stripes we have been healed" (Isa. 53:4-5).</P><P>We are all sinners (Rom. 3:9-20) and deserve to die (Ezek. 18:4). If the Lord Jesus had come only to live for us, what could have saved us from our sins and delivered us from perdition? Praise be to God that He did not come to live, but to die-to die in our place, to bear our sins, and to receive the punishment due to us. Since we have Him as our Substitute, we do not need to die anymore! We now have a way to salvation! If we merely take Jesus as a model, intending to imitate Him as a means of salvation, we will end up perishing because there is no one on earth who can be like the Lord Jesus. No one can be saved by trying to imitate the Lord Jesus (Gal. 2). Those who believe on His substitutional work shall be saved! (Acts 16:31). The word of God says, "Without shedding of blood there is no forgiveness" (Heb. 9:22).</P><P>Suppose we go to the next house and see the parents and children there, and we asked them: "I heard that God is going to kill your firstborn tonight. Is it true?"</P><P>They may answer, "Yes."</P><P>Then I would ask again, "Why are you not afraid? Do you realize that your firstborn will die soon?"</P><P>They might answer, "We are not afraid because God has established a salvation. He told us to prepare a lamb, kill it, and put the blood in a basin. Look! The lamb has been killed, and the blood is in the basin. We Israelites are sinners, but the lamb has died on our behalf. Therefore, we have no fear."</P><P>But, let me tell you, at midnight, the firstborn of this family will still be killed by God's righteous wrath! If you act like those of that household, you will also perish!</P><P>Consider what the fault is of this man. The first household lost their firstborn because of the absence of the blood of the lamb. But the second household had a live lamb, slaughtered it, and shed its blood. Why then should they perish? They had the blood, but where was the blood? Blood in the basin cannot save a man. Unless the blood of the lamb was sprinkled upon the side posts and the upper doorpost, it could not save them from death.</P><P>There are too many people like the ones in this household. I am afraid that these people may even be members of a church! You have already heard the gospel of the Lord Jesus and also know that He died on behalf of the sinners of the world. You have read from the Bible and newspapers about the Lord Jesus' substitutional death. You have heard it from the pulpits. But you have not come to God devotedly to receive His Son as your Savior. You know that the death of the Lord Jesus is a substitute for sinners; but you have not accepted Him as your personal Savior. You know that He died for the world, but do you believe that He died as sin for you? In your mentality you have heard and known all these things. But you have not exercised your heart to believe and to trust in Him. You have heard and known, but you stop right there and do not go further to seek after God's grace. You may be tired of hearing the teaching of the cross of the Lord Jesus, but you still have not mixed your faith with the Word preached to you (Heb. 4:2). You are still a man of perdition! Although you have known, you have not believed. Because you have not exercised your faith to receive the Lord Jesus as your personal Savior, your knowledge cannot help you at all, and you are still a man bound for hell! Blood that is in the basin, but unapplied to the side posts and upper doorpost, cannot save you. If the heart (Rom. 10:10) has not believed in the Lord Jesus, what good is the knowledge of the gospel in the head? Salvation is not for the one who knows, but for the one who believes (Acts 16:31; John 3:16).</P><P>Therefore, let me ask you, has the upper doorpost of your heart been sprinkled with the precious blood? Have you received the Lord Jesus in your heart as your Savior? I am not asking about your age or family status, nor do I inquire about your education or health. There is only one question in the world, the most important one-have you been saved? Have you received eternal life? Do you have the precious blood sprinkled upon the upper doorpost of your heart? This is the most vital question! Please answer God. Have you been saved?</P><P>Blood in the basin, if not applied to the side posts and upper doorpost, is unable to save men. Although you know that the Lord Jesus has died for you, you will still perish if you do not exercise faith to apply His blood on the upper doorpost of your heart. The night of judgment is coming soon! The sinner-judging angels of the Lord will soon come forth! Eternity is now before you! Eternal life and eternal death are both eternal!! My dear sinners, apply the blood now! What are you waiting for? While you are reading this line, pause for a few minutes and pray, "O God, have pity on me, a sinner! I want to believe in the Lord Jesus as my personal Savior. Lord, forgive all my sins." The Lord will save you. Only come quickly!</P><P>On that night the Israelites used hyssop to dip in the blood and strike on the upper doorpost. If you want to rely on the precious blood of the Lord Jesus, you must have your own hyssop. According to the Scripture, hyssop is the smallest of all plants (1 Kings 4:33) and is despised by men. Speaking truthfully, I have never seen a proud man who can believe in the Lord Jesus. Unless we see ourselves as sinners and are willing to stand in the position of a sinner, we will not receive the Lord Jesus as our Savior. Therefore, you who are proud, please do not be proud any longer. Humble yourself before the feet of the Lord Jesus. Confess that you are a sinner; accept His salvation, and you will be saved!</P><P>When the blood was still in the basin, the Israelites were not safe; when the blood was applied, they were safe. If anyone knows about the salvation of the Lord Jesus but does not accept Him with faith, he is in danger. But the moment his heart is cleansed by the precious blood of the Lord Jesus, he is secure forevermore. What a pity that so many who have believed in the Lord Jesus do not know that they are secure and will not come into judgment!</P><P>Have you believed in the Lord Jesus? Have you been saved? Many Christians answer "yes" to the first question, but concerning the second question, I am afraid that many answer, "I don't know," "I dare not say," or, "I hope I can be saved."</P><P>These answers are not correct because the Bible says, "Believe on the Lord Jesus, and you shall be saved" (Acts 16:31). If you believe in the Lord Jesus, then you will be saved. This is the Word of God. How can you believe in the Lord Jesus and yet not be saved? If you are not saved, even if you have believed in the Lord Jesus, then has not the Word of God become void? If this is the case, then the Lord is a liar! The Bible says, "This is the testimony of God that He has testified concerning His Son...And this is the testimony, that God gave to us eternal life and this life is in His Son. He who has the Son has the life; he who does not have the Son of God does not have the life. I have written these things to you that you may know that you have eternal life, to you who believe into the name of the Son of God...He who does not believe God has made Him a liar because he has not believed in the testimony which God has testified concerning His Son" (1 John 5:9, 11-13, 10). The teaching of the Scripture is this: He who believes in the Lord Jesus has the Lord Jesus, and he who has Him has eternal life. Those who have read this testimony of God can know that they have eternal life. If a man does not believe that God has given us eternal life and does not believe that he who has the Son of God has life, he has made God a liar! We should not make God a liar. He said that we can be saved by believing, and that if we have His Son, we have eternal life. Since we have believed and received His Son, the Lord Jesus, as our Savior, surely we are already saved. The word of the Scripture says that we can know whether we have been saved.</P><P>I once went to a certain place to preach, and I asked those who truly believed in the Lord Jesus as their Savior to raise their hands. Nearly everyone put up a hand. Then I asked those who were sure that they had been saved to raise their hands. Not one hand was raised! My visits to other places also led to the same experience. There are many who believe in the Lord Jesus, but there are few who know that they are saved! After I read the Bible, I could not understand how people could believe in the Lord Jesus and yet not know that they were saved. The Bible definitely says that those who believe in the Lord Jesus have eternal life. How can we believe in Him and yet not be saved? God cannot lie. To entertain such a thought is blasphemous enough; how much more serious is it to openly doubt His Word! He said that if we believe we have eternal life. We believe, and we surely have eternal life. "He who believes into the Son has eternal life" (John 3:36). This is the Word of God.</P><P>Let us consider the condition of another household in Israel. Suppose we went to a third house, and the moment we reached the door, we saw the upper doorpost and side posts smeared with the blood of the lamb. As we entered into the house, we saw the killed lamb and the basin with hyssop by its side. However, the people in the house were sitting and crying, with their firstborn also looking pale, crying, and trembling. They acted as if a great calamity was going to come upon them. If I asked them, "Why are you so sad?", they would answer, "Sir, don't you know about the calamity that will befall us at midnight? At that time God will kill all the firstborn in Egypt, and our son will be among them." Then they might cry again. But I would ask them, "Has God not established a way of salvation for you? Did He not order you to kill the lamb and smear the blood on the upper doorpost and side posts? Is your door not smeared with blood already? Why are you still worrying?"</P><P>They might answer, "Yes, God has indeed said this, and we have done so accordingly. But we don't feel that we are safe."</P><P>Then I would do my best to persuade them not to worry and cry because they have the precious blood, and they are in a safe and sound position. Despite my efforts, they may continue to worry over the thought that it is impossible to know they are safe just by the smearing of the blood on the upper doorpost.</P><P>Is it reasonable for this household to be so worried? Yes or no? You might laugh at their foolishness because once the blood was on their upper doorpost, everything was all right. Continuing to worry and suffer would merely be self-inflicted agony. But many times we are the same as they. Having believed in the Lord Jesus, having accepted Him as our personal Savior, and having applied His precious blood on the upper doorpost of our heart, we have entered into a safe and sound position. We are saved and will no longer perish! What more do we fear? Why do we still worry? The moment we believed in the Lord Jesus, we were safe. If we have not accepted the Lord Jesus as our Savior, then we ought to worry and cry for we are condemned already (John 3:18). If, however, we have believed in the substitutional death of the Lord Jesus on the cross, then we have no reason or right to worry and cry, because we are already saved. We ought to rejoice because God has already saved us. We have not saved ourselves. God has saved us. What a wonderful grace! We ought to start praising the grace of the Lord and worry no more. "Truly, truly, I say to you, he who hears My word and believes Him who sent Me has eternal life, and does not come into judgment but has passed out of death into life" (John 5:24). Therefore, we are already saved! Heaven is guaranteed to us!</P><P>Many people cannot understand how someone can be saved merely by believing in the Lord Jesus. Their difficulty lies in being unable to feel that they have been saved. I often hear people saying, "I have truly believed in the Lord Jesus as my Savior, but in my heart I still cannot feel that I am saved." Let us read Exodus 12:13, "And when I see the blood, I will pass over you, and the plague shall not be upon you to destroy you." Who saw the blood? God saw it, not the firstborn. The blood was applied to the upper doorpost and side posts; the firstborn could not see it, and even if they could, it would have been of no use. God said that He would see the blood, and when He saw the blood, He would not smite us. We do not realize how much value there is in the blood of the Lord Jesus. We cannot understand how God profoundly values the blood of the Lord Jesus. But God said that when He saw the blood, He would pass over. He will save all those who have the precious blood of His Son. Our duty is to believe in the Lord Jesus' substitutional death and His shedding of the blood on the cross. God sees the blood, He will save us. Whether we feel it or not matters little. The Scripture does not say that we are saved when we feel that we are saved, and that if we do not feel so, then we will perish. What the Scripture says is that God will pass over when He sees the blood. Therefore, dear friends, do not rely on your volatile feelings. God's words are reliable. When He sees us believing in the Lord Jesus, He will save us. What more do we have to fear? Even if we feel nothing, God has already seen. Could the Israelites, who remained indoors, see the blood on their upper doorpost? Therefore, there is nothing strange if we do not feel anything!</P><P>Some brothers always worry. They think that they are not yet saved, even though they have believed in the Lord Jesus as their Savior, because they repeatedly fall. Many times they are weak. The more they look at themselves, the more they think they are unworthy to be saved. They honestly believe in the Lord Jesus as their Savior. They know the grace of the Lord is great; however, when they look at their own failures, they are unable to believe that they are saved. But these thoughts are in vain. Let us again read God's Word. "When I see the blood, I will pass over you" (Exo. 12:13). What is the basis for God's salvation? What does God see? The Bible says that God sees the blood and nothing else. God saves us because of the precious blood of the Lord Jesus and only because of the precious blood of His Son, not because of a change in ourselves or in our conduct. The Scripture does not say, "When I see your good conduct, I will pass over you." Nor does it say, "When I see your perfect life, I will pass over you." It says, "When I see the blood, I will pass over you." The blood! We must pay attention to the blood. God sees the blood, not us, or even less, our conduct. Salvation and damnation are according to the presence or absence of the blood. Even if you were the best man in the world, if you do not believe in the precious blood of the Lord Jesus, you are still a man of perdition. If you were the worst man in the world, and by faith applied the precious blood of the Lord Jesus, you would immediately be saved. The precious blood can save sinners! The precious blood is especially for saving sinners! "For by grace you have been saved through faith, and this not of yourselves; it is the gift of God; not of works that no one should boast" (Eph. 2:8-9). We are saved entirely by the grace of God; it has absolutely nothing to do with our conduct. The more we look at ourselves, the more we will feel that we are not worthy to be saved and have less peace. Therefore, we should look to the Lord Jesus and rely on Him alone. Look to Him, and we will have peace and joy in our hearts. Although we are not trustworthy, He is trustworthy. The more we look to Him, the more we will be purified and sanctified.</P><P>The Israelites were saved because they relied on the blood of the lamb, not because of their own merits. The Egyptians perished because they did not have the precious blood of the lamb, not because of their evil deeds. Salvation or perdition depends on whether we rely on the precious blood of the lamb. If we have the precious blood, then we are saved. Otherwise, our situation is dangerous! Let us now leave the Israelites and come to the Egyptians. Suppose we entered into an Egyptian house and found them enjoying their family life, and I asked, "Why are you so happy? God said that He will kill your son by midnight tonight!"</P><P>They might answer, "Sir, my son is different from other people's sons. He has never committed murder or arson. He is just and honest. He has done everything according to his conscience. Will God punish such a man?"</P><P>I would say, "If you do not have the blood of the lamb on your upper doorpost, God will not pass over him. He will destroy him."</P><P>They might respond, "Others may need the blood of the lamb, but good people have no need of the blood of the lamb."</P><P>When midnight came, their son would perish! Let me tell you, the consequence for all those who rely on their own righteousness, rather than the precious blood of the Lord Jesus, is eternal perdition! Although you are better than your neighbor, and in the eyes of the world you are an honest man, can your small merit save you from the wrath of the most righteous God? All our righteousness is not up to God's standard. He still sees us as sinners; without the blood of the Lamb for our ransom, we will perish. Although the Israelites were evil (as we see from their experience in the wilderness), they had the blood of the lamb to redeem them from their sins. Therefore, they were saved. Although the Egyptians may have been good, they did not have the blood of the lamb to redeem them. Therefore, they perished. Salvation or perdition is not according to ourselves or our behavior; it is according to whether we accept the redeeming Savior who has died for us. In the book of Revelation the ones in heaven are there because of the precious blood of the Lamb, not because of their own conduct. Saved ones can go to heaven because they "have washed their robes and made them white in the blood of the Lamb" (Rev. 7:9-17).</P><P>As the Passover approached and the hours ticked away, the time came! The hour of judgment came! "At midnight the Lord smote all the firstborn in the land of Egypt" (Exo. 12:29). This is the destiny of those who do not believe in the gospel of the Lord Jesus! I advise you to no longer rely on your own conduct because of the imminent coming of eternity. Do not excuse yourself or delay any longer. Believe quickly in the Lord Jesus. While today is still today, come quickly! "Behold, now is the well-acceptable time; behold, now is the day of salvation" (2 Cor. 6:2).</P><P>"There was not a house where there was not one dead" (Exo. 12:30). In every Egyptian house, someone died. Even the Israelite homes were not without their dead! Both the Egyptian and Israelites had a death in each house! The only difference was that in the houses of the Israelites, the dead one was a lamb, while in the Egyptian houses it was a man. In every house there was death, either of a person or of a lamb. How frightful! How solemn! Either a man or a lamb died.</P><P>Dear readers, I do not know who you would rather see die. Would you rather bear all your sins and die, or would you believe in and rely on Jesus, the Lamb of God, and let Him die for you? Either you die or He dies for you; it is either one or the other! If the Lord Jesus does not die for you, then you must die. Who will die? Thank and praise God because "while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us" (Rom. 5:8). You do not have to die; you do not have to perish for your sins. From this point on, you will not perish because you are a sinner, but because you have not believed in the name of the only begotten Son of God (John 3:18). Therefore, do not let the Lord Jesus say to you, "You are not willing to come to Me that you may have life" (John 5:40). "Let him who wills take the water of life freely" (Rev. 22:17). How I desire that you would just come to God with a believing heart, praying, "O God, I am a sinner who deserves perdition, but I believe that your Son has died for me. Forgive all my previous sins so that from now on I will be saved."</P><H1 CLASS=MSG>MESSAGE FIVE</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>WHY GOOD MEN GO TO HELL</H1><H2 CLASS=HEAD4>Issue No. 9</H2><H1 CLASS=SCRIPTURE>Scripture Reading: Luke 18:9-14</H1><P>This portion of the Bible is a parable told by the Lord Jesus Christ Himself. He said that two men went up into the temple to pray; one was a Pharisee, one of the best of persons, and the other was a tax collector, one of the worst of persons. The Lord Jesus said that as a result of their prayers, the wicked tax collector was justified and the good Pharisee was not justified. What does "to be justified" mean? To be justified is to be declared innocent in a law court. To not be justified is to be declared guilty and to receive punishment. "Justified" is what believers usually mean by "saved." Making it more plain, "to be justified" is to go to heaven. To not be justified is to perish and go to hell. The Lord Jesus said that a good person goes to hell and a wicked person goes to heaven. A good man goes to hell! And a wicked man goes to heaven! Yes, this is what the Lord Jesus said.</P><P>We all think that the good person should go to heaven and the wicked to hell, but the Lord Jesus said that the good person would go to hell and the wicked person to heaven. Do not be surprised and think that this is new or strange. If any person is going to heaven, he must be a sinner. In heaven you cannot find a good person. In heaven everyone is a sinner! What about hell? There are plenty of good people in hell! Do not think that you will not go to hell because you are good. Let me say that there are plenty of people in hell just like you! Some are even better than you! By themselves, those who are both wicked and good should go to hell. By believing in the Lord Jesus, however, good men can go to heaven and wicked men also can go to heaven. In this parable, our Lord Jesus Christ told a story of a good man going to hell and a wicked man going to heaven. Those who label themselves as a righteous person and think of themselves as an excellent man among men, please listen to the Lord Jesus' words: good men may go to hell! Those who humble themselves and confess that they are sinners, judging themselves not worthy to be saved, should not be discouraged because wicked men may go to heaven!</P><P>We need to consider the good man, whom the Lord talked about, who was perishing. We want to see how good he was, and if he was a good man, why he would still go to hell.</P><P>Verse 10 says that he was a Pharisee. Very often we think that Pharisees were hypocrites, the worst people. But this was not always true; they had many good qualities. Pharisees zealously kept the law (Phil. 3:5). They were not like the modernists, the Sadducees, who did not believe this or that. They believed in God's Word and kept God's law and dared not doubt one word. Even so, the Lord Jesus said this Pharisee perished!</P><P>Christians, when coming to revival conferences and walking on the street, often feel shameful when they are seen carrying a big heavy Bible. We would rather leave it at home and come to the meeting without a Bible or with a small New Testament to avoid men's eyes. We are afraid that people will call us superstitious. We are afraid of being ridiculed. But it was not so with the Pharisees: they wrote Scripture on the fringes of their garments, they were not afraid of being ridiculed, and they were bold to confess to everyone that they believed in God.</P><P>I know of many Christians who dare not pray and give thanks for the meal before men when they go to an unbeliever's home or an unbelieving friend comes to their home for a meal! Since their consciences bother them if they do not give thanks, they pray to God in their heart with open eyes! How shy they are! How timid! They dare not admit that they are Christians before others. This was not the situation with the Pharisees. They would pray at the crosswalk. Let us not mention what kind of motive they may have had; their outward performance alone was much higher than that of ordinary Christians. However, the Lord Jesus said that this Pharisee was fallen and would go to hell. Pharisees were high class people in the society of those days. They were a very gentle, noble, and cultured people. But God does not care for social status. He is righteous; He will not regret sending you to hell if you deserve it. Do not say in your heart, "Is it possible for people like me-so fine, so gentle, so smart with a Ph.D. degree, and so rich-to go to hell?" Let me say that there are plenty of people just like you in hell, even some wiser, prettier, richer, and gentler than you! A person is never too good to go to hell! The Lord Jesus said that this Pharisee would perish. Although he was one of the high class, he would perish. So please do not depend on your social status. When this gentle Pharisee came to pray at the temple, he prayed, "God!" (Luke 18:11). Please listen to this word, "God." He was neither an atheist nor a fool, since he did not say that there was no God; neither was he a wicked person doing evil and abominable deeds (Psa. 14:1). He believed that there was a God. Even though he could not see Him, he knew that God is clearly seen since the creation of the world (Rom. 1:19-20). He was not an unreligious person; he believed that there was a God. In spite of this, he still was not saved. He could not avoid going to hell and perishing. He was a very pious and religious man; he came to God's presence and prayed. He was a good man. Nevertheless, the Lord said that this pious, good man was going to hell. Please remember that a good man, who even believes that there is a God, can go to hell! What will happen to those who do not believe!</P><P>The Pharisee prayed, "God, I thank You that I am not like the rest of men," and then he named many types of sinners. He told the Lord that he was not evil like the rest of men, that he had not committed as many sins as others and that he was among the best of men, unlike others. Indeed, this Pharisee was a good man! He was rare among men! Yet the Lord said that this unusually good man would go to hell and perish forever. You may think, "Perhaps this Pharisee was going to hell because he was a hypocrite. If he was genuinely good, he would surely go to heaven." But there is no indication that he was a hypocrite. I can tell you that he was indeed rare among men, yet there are other people who are also moral. He was truly a morally perfect man. He prayed saying that he did not sin as others and had many good points. The Lord did not deny this; He did not say that the Pharisee's words were false. For this reason we know that he must have been a good person. Furthermore, in verse 9 the Lord indicated that he was "righteous." This proves that he was an ideally good man. But good men go to hell, and good men should go to hell!</P><P>We should remember that he said to God, "I am not like the rest of men." Many times when I preach the gospel, I ask, "Do you know that you are a sinner and that you need a Savior as a substitute to redeem you?" Many have replied, "I have never killed anyone and burned down buildings. In what way have I sinned? I do everything according to my conscience. I am much better than my friends and neighbors. I am better than all." An unbeliever might add, "I am even better than many Christians! I am better than they without even believing in Jesus." Yes, maybe you can say this to me, but can you say to the Lord, "God, I thank You that I do not sin like the rest of men. I am better than all others"? I am afraid you can only utter self-justifying words to me but not to God. You dare to boast before men of your virtues. But you would not dare to say before God that you are better than all others. You may deceive men but not God. You may boast to me. You may deceive parents, husband, wife, children, relatives, friends, and the world. But you cannot deceive God. What you dare to say before men, you dare not say before God because God examines your inward parts. The Pharisee acted according to his conscience. He not only boasted to men that he was a perfect and righteous man, unlike others who had committed sins, he dared to say even to God, "God, I thank You that I am not like the rest of men-extortioners, unjust, adulterers." His conscience did not even slightly condemn him; he could boldly declare his righteous acts before God. Truly, he was better than others, better than you and I. But the Lord said that this good man, who was rare among men, would go to hell. If such a good man will go to hell, then what will happen to those who are not as good as he, who do not come up to his standard, and who have sinned as the rest of the world? Should they go to hell and receive more punishment? "If they do these things with the tree full of sap, what will happen with the one that is dry?" (Luke 23:31) If an extremely good person goes to hell, what will happen to us sinners? Do not be so self-confident. Although you are good, you cannot escape the fire of hell. Oh, you who are self-righteous, please do not be at peace. Your own righteousness cannot save you.</P><P>He was not an extortioner. Extortion is taking what should not be taken by force or by power. This Pharisee did not extort others, even though he had the power. I wonder how many of you reading this message have extorted someone's riches by your own power. You know it; God also knows it. What a common thing it is to dominate others by means of your power! But this Pharisee did not do this; he did not extort. Yet the Lord said that he could not be spared from going to hell. Good men go to hell. If a good man like this Pharisee was going to hell, then what about extortioners?</P><P>Furthermore, he was not unjust. Whatever is not fair is unjust. Being unjust is the most common sin today. Not only is there much unjust conduct, but there are many unjust objects. In your home, bedroom, classroom, living room, and office is there anything that is not yours, but has become yours? Please search your bedroom, living room, closet, pocket to see if there are items that were obtained in an unjust way. Please check your own heart, and ask yourself if there is anything that you have gained in an unjust way. It is still unjust, even if it is only one dress or one penny. To put it politely, we acquired these things in an unjust way; putting it frankly, these things were stolen from others! To be unjust is to steal! Did you ever steal any money from others? Did you ever steal any article? Did you borrow from others and never return the borrowed thing? All this is unjust!</P><P>Once I held a meeting at Changchow. A young student who had stolen five dollars from her teacher was there. After she attended the meeting, she realized that what she had done was a sin. The Spirit urged her, and she confessed to her mother and returned the money to her teacher. Another young girl student who had stolen two loquats from her supervisor was also there. Her supervisor was a very strict person; the students were afraid to talk to her. After this young student received the Lord's grace, she realized that she should clear up this unjust matter; she went to her supervisor and boldly confessed her sin.</P><P>Two weeks later I went to the Kulangsu Bible Association. The manager told me that he had received a letter and dictionary from Changchow. In the letter the writer stated, "I took this book from the Association without paying for it. I now know that this is unjust so I am returning it." Oh! Brothers and sisters, I do not know if there is any injustice among you; I hope that there is none among you, but I am afraid that there are some unjust ones among us, and I am also afraid that there are some unjust things among you! This Pharisee was not unjust. He dared to say to the Lord that he was not unjust. But the Lord said that even though he was a good man and not unjust, he was not justified and could not be saved! A good man can go to hell! If a just man can perish, how much more will unjust ones perish and go to hell? Needless to say, you and I should go to hell.</P><P>He did not commit adultery. I do not know how many reading this message have committed adultery. You know and God knows. The sin of adultery is filthy! But many have defiled their beds through their flesh! If we agree that lusting in the heart is committing a sin, then there will be very few perfect people in the world! The Lord said, "That every one who looks at a woman in order to lust after her has already committed adultery with her in his heart" (Matt. 5:28). Today few keep their bodies clean; even fewer keep their minds clean. God surely will punish those who commit this kind of sin. He has to punish sin. This Pharisee was a moral person; he did not do anything unclean. He never committed adultery. But the Lord said that the good Pharisee, who did not commit adultery, would perish and go to hell. The destination of a good man is hell! If such a good person is going to hell, then what about evil ones and adulterers? Will not adulterers, all the more, go to hell?</P><P>The Pharisee not only abstained from many evil things on the negative side, but did many commendable things on the positive side. He "fast[ed] twice a week" (v. 12). I am afraid that many people have never fasted once since they became a Christian! They may not even know what it means to fast! But this Pharisee was very strict; he mastered his body and did not give in to the passion of his lust. He was a self-disciplined person. He served God in a godly and dedicated way. The law did not require a man to fast twice a week. He had even fulfilled what the law did not require of him. Despite all this, the Lord said that he would perish and go to hell. Surely those who are worse than he will receive a more severe punishment. If this is the case, how can one hope to be saved?</P><P>He gave tithes of all that he had acquired. He was not a miser; he was a very generous person. His principle was to tithe. Very few Christians today give even one percent, much less ten percent. When offering time comes, many think that a silver dollar is too big and a silver dime too small. But a copper coin is neither too big nor too small, so they offer it! This was not the case with the Pharisee. He was full of thoughts about accumulating wealth in heaven. Yet the Lord said that he would go to hell. A person who gives his labor and money still can suffer perdition! If a good man can go to hell, what kind of punishment will miserly ones receive?</P><P>From these points we can see that the Pharisee was a good and perfect man. Not only was he good in men's eyes, but he was also perfect and without blemish in his own eyes. We cannot say that he was a saint, but he was a very rare and good man in this world. Nevertheless, the Lord declared that he was not justified, that he was not saved, and that he was going to perish! If we think that we can be saved by doing good or that we are saved because we are good, we should realize that even if we are as good as this Pharisee, we still cannot be saved. How can we be saved by doing good? How could the Pharisee possibly have been saved just by being a good man? Therefore, good people should not be complacent! We should not think that we can be saved because we are good. We have to realize, according to the Lord's judgment, that we still belong to hell! Sinners, do not think that we should improve ourselves gradually and then be saved after we have been good. Let me tell you that this is Satan's gospel. Not only are we incapable of doing good, even if we could do as well as this Pharisee, we would still go to hell! What use is it to do good? The Lord purposely chose this ideal and good person and said that he was still going to perish in order to disappoint those who rely on their self-righteousness and let them know that their self-righteousness cannot save them. The way of salvation has nothing to do with ourselves (Eph. 2:8-9). If anyone wishes to be saved, they should not look to the way of self-improvement. In order to be saved, one has to believe on the Lord Jesus (Acts 16:31).</P><P>Since this Pharisee was such a good man, why did he end up going to hell? What are the reasons? Now we will see the reasons why this good man would go to hell.</P><P>First, he was one like those who "trusted in themselves that they were righteous" (Luke 18:9). He was an outstanding person according to moral standards. He was very content and thought that he could be saved. It seemed that no one else could go to heaven if he could not go. To "trust" means to depend upon. He depended upon his own righteous works and thought his righteous works could justify or save him. He did not realize that "all of us became like him who is unclean, / And all our righteousnesses are like a soiled garment" (Isa. 64:6). None of these things can cover our shame and shelter us from God's condemnation. He did not know that in God's eyes, "there is none righteous, not even one" (Rom. 3:10). He thought that he was "not like the rest of men," that he was the one and only righteous man on earth! He thought that he conducted himself according to the law and even did more than what the law required. Therefore, he thought he would surely be justified. He is just like many others who think that they can be saved by good works. But the Bible says, "Out of the works of the law no flesh shall be justified before Him" (Rom. 3:20). It also says, "For we [the apostles] account that a man is justified...apart from the works of the law" (Rom. 3:28). "A man is not justified out of works of law...we might be justified...not out of the works of law, because out of the works of law no flesh will be justified" (Gal. 2:16). "By law no one is justified before God" (3:11). "Not out of works in righteousness which we did...He saved us" (Titus 3:5). "The works of law" mean good works. Not being justified by the works of the law means that one cannot be saved by doing good works. This has been repeatedly made clear in the Bible. Although the Pharisee had righteous works, he did not realize that his righteous works could not save him. He was one of those who "trusted in themselves that they were righteous." He wanted to go to heaven, but eventually he ended up in hell. How pitiful! He thought his own righteousness was sufficient and did not seek the righteousness which was prepared by God in Christ Jesus. As a result, he fell into perdition. Man's righteousness does not satisfy God; He will not save anyone unless He sees His own righteousness. Because this Pharisee was "ignorant of God's righteousness and sought to establish [his] own righteousness, [he was] not subject to the righteousness of God" (Rom. 10:3). To not be subject is to rebel. This man was a rebel in the face of God. How could he have any hope of being saved?</P><P>Oh, how numerous are the descendants of this Pharisee today! Many still think that they are a good man, that they are therefore saved. Many think that they should do good in order to be saved. But the Lord said that good men go to hell. If you are this type of person, please turn back quickly and believe in the Lord Jesus because your good works cannot save you. Nothing in this world is less dependable than your own righteousness. The righteous Pharisee who depended upon his own righteousness has already gone to hell and has become a pattern to those who want to be saved through doing good works. Why should you suffer by following in the same footsteps?</P><P>He not only was one who "trusted in themselves that they were righteous" but also "exalt[ed] himself" (v. 14). Self- exalting ones go to hell. As a preacher, I have never seen a proud person become saved. If a man wants to be saved, he must admit that he is a helpless and hopeless sinner, unable to save himself and unable to trust himself. He must admit that he deserves hell. He needs to prostrate himself before the cross to beg for grace and believe in Jesus of Nazareth who was crucified in a shameful way to be his vicarious Savior. How humbling this is! Without humbling ourselves, who can do this? There is nothing under heaven more humbling than to believe in the Lord Jesus as the Savior! Worldly people are very unwilling to confess that they cannot do good! Self-exalting ones are not willing to come to the despised cross to seek grace. A self-exalting man cannot be saved. He likes to say that he can do good and can patch up all his wrong doings with his own good works. Even if he cannot, he will try to bear his own responsibility. It is hard for him to confess that he is a sinner and that Jesus Christ is his Savior! Oh, proud one, please do not be so proud anymore. Humble yourself before God. Otherwise, your pride will cause you to go to hell!</P><P>Moreover, the Pharisee did not ask God for grace. He thought that a person as qualified as he was did not need to ask God for grace. If a righteous man like the Pharisee is sufficiently qualified to be saved, why ask God for grace? Since he already has done good works, why is there a need for him to lose face by asking for grace? Although he went up to the temple to pray, the Lord said that he "prayed these things to himself." Please read verses 11 and 12 again and see whether or not he prayed. He did not come to the temple of God saying, "God, I have this and that shortage. Please fill me." He did not say, "God, I cannot save myself. Please save me." Rather, he said, "God, I thank You, because I can be good without Your help. I never did this or that evil thing. On the contrary, I have done many good things." He did not pray! He did not beseech God! He thought that he was the top person and that he was good to the uttermost. He did not come to pray; he came to give a report! He came before God just to give Him a report and to let Him know all his merits. He seemed to be saying, "God, I thank You, I did not do many sinful things; instead, I did many good things. I am afraid that You do not know about it, so I came to give You a report." He did not ask God for grace. He was truly a good man, according to his own estimate and others' evaluation. But he was an outsider to God's holiness. He had never seen God; he did not know God. So he dared to boast before the God of all holiness and all goodness! If the eyes of his heart had not been completely blinded, he would not have been so foolish. Even though he and all the others thought he was a good person, in God's eyes he was still a sinner. He was not justified, and he needed to be saved. If he would not be saved, he would perish and go to hell. In the same way that a great sinner needs a Savior to redeem him and suffer the penalty of sin for him, this so-called righteous person needs the same in God's eyes. But he was blind to this need. He never knew God or God's grace. Therefore, he did not know that he was also a sinner before God. He also needed a Savior. He was too self-content and too proud! He thought that he was capable and able! When he arrived in hell, he surely was shocked and thought he had gone to the wrong place! Little did he realize that this very place was his real home!</P><P>The Pharisee had already perished. We need to take this case as a warning. He made two great mistakes regarding salvation: (1) he thought that in order to be saved he should do good, and (2) since he was good, he was surely saved. He did not know that these thoughts were absurd. When we read Ephesians 2:8-9, we can see that we are not saved by our good works but by believing in the grace of the Lord Jesus. "He who believes into Him is not condemned; but he who does not believe has been condemned already" (John 3:18). Whether a person will be saved or will perish depends on whether or not he believes and receives the salvation that has been accomplished by the Lord Jesus on the cross. It does not depend on our own goodness or badness. Since we are not saved by doing good, someone who is just good cannot be saved. Dear readers, do not think that you can be saved by accumulating good works little by little. I know and God knows that you are unable to do good. Even if you are able, the God of all goodness does not consider your goodness as good. Good works can never save you. You cannot buy God's salvation by doing good. You should first be saved, then do good works. Do not change the order, thinking that first you should do good works, and then you will be saved. Please come now and receive the Lord Jesus as your Savior and be saved.</P><P>Now we are going to see the wicked person who was saved, and find out how wicked he was and why he could go to heaven. He was a tax collector (Luke 18:10). According to the situation in Jewish society at the time, a tax collector was the most despised among all classes of people. The Chinese consider a robber to be the worst man and a harlot to be the worst woman. We have a saying, "a man-robber and a woman-harlot." For the Jews, the lowest, most ignoble, wicked, and dirty profession for a man was to be a tax collector! For a male to be a tax collector and a female to be a harlot is the most despicable thing! But the Lord Jesus said that even though he was despised by men, he was justified by God; he was saved and could go to heaven!</P><P>In those days the Jews were under the dictatorship of the Roman government, and the Romans taxed the Jews by the system of collecting tribute money. The government would set the amount of tax in a certain place and then hire people to collect it. These tax collectors collected tribute for the Roman government. When they took the job of collecting tribute, they would extort a tribute of their own choosing, so that the excess tax would be theirs. As a group, they helped evildoers do evil and cared for even the smallest, trifling amounts. They only cared for their own gain; therefore, they were considered by society as the most low and despised of men. This was the tax collector in the eyes of the world. If you asked a Jew which kind of person was the worst, he would certainly answer, "a tax collector." But the Lord Jesus said that the tax collector would go to heaven. Wicked men can go to heaven! If the sinful and wicked, such as this tax collector, can be saved, what is possible for those who are less sinful!</P><P>He was a sinner (v. 13). His own conscience accused him. Everything he did was against God's laws. He could not keep God's commandments. His thoughts were filthy. His eyes beheld things that should not be seen. His mouth spoke things that should not be spoken. His hands did evil and his feet walked in wickedness. He was totally filled with lusts and all things of ungodliness. He only knew how to take advantage of others. He was a miser; he only cared to fill his own bag. He did not care for anything, much less righteousness or morality. He turned his ear away from the cries of orphans and widows. As long as he accumulated thousands and tens of thousands for his wealth, he did not care whether others were sinking in the mire. He did not worship God. His deeds, behavior, and motives were all against God. In brief, he was a sinner. But the Lord Jesus said that this tax collector was justified and that sinners can go to heaven.</P><P>O sinners of this world, you know that you are a sinner. You think that you are incurable and not worthy to be saved. When you examine your own thoughts and behavior, your conscience condemns your sins and convinces you that you deserve to perish. Dear sinners, let me say that you do not have to be disappointed or worry. The Lord Jesus said that the wicked can go to heaven. Oh, distressed ones, you do not have to be discouraged. Here is the gospel. Even though you are a sinner, sinners can obtain eternal life. You cannot save yourself, but you can be saved. The way of salvation is in the Lord Jesus. Come and receive His salvation! The Pharisee said he was "not like the rest of men-extortioners, unjust, adulterers, or even like this tax collector" (v. 11). From this statement, we can deduce that this tax collector was an extortioner, an unjust person, an adulterer, and one with all kinds of sins. This tax collector usurped power to oppress and extort people. Everything he did was full of injustice. In his house there were articles which he owned illegally; he had used crafty methods to obtain them. He committed adultery, sinning against his own body. He got involved in all kinds of unclean things and committed all kinds of sins. Nevertheless, the Lord Jesus judged and said that this tax collector could go to heaven.</P><P>From a worldly point of view, this type of sinner deserves more than perdition. According to worldly judgment, nice people should go to heaven and evil ones to hell. If we made the decision, only good people would be saved and wicked people would perish. If we made the decision, the Pharisee would certainly receive eternal life, and the tax collector would be sentenced to condemnation. Fortunately, there is no room for men to say anything regarding salvation and perdition. Fortunately, it is our Lord Jesus Christ who set the rule by saying that good people should go to hell. Since the evil ones can go to heaven, we have a chance to be saved. There are very few good people in the world; all are sinners (Rom. 3). If only good people can be saved, then how many will be saved? Will not all perish? Fortunately, the Lord Jesus made the rule that sinners can go to heaven. Therefore, we sinners have the hope of being saved. Praise the Lord!</P><P>Once I took the Lien Shien Steamer from Shanghai back to Fukien. I shared the gospel with a well-known businessman from Fukien. I told him the gospel of the Lord Jesus' vicarious death and His redemption. He answered by saying, "What Confucius said was the best: `One who sins against heaven shall not be forgiven.' " I asked him, "Sir, according to what you have heard and seen, how many people have not sinned against heaven?" He was silent for a while and answered, "I am afraid that there is not one!" I asked, "Very well then, since all have sinned against heaven, can anyone be forgiven? If this is so, what else can be said? We are all here waiting to be sentenced." He could say nothing. Yes, we all are sinners and should perish. But God is full of grace; He has the gospel. Although everyone thinks that they have sinned against heaven and cannot be forgiven, God has bestowed grace upon everyone who has sinned against heaven. He has prepared a Savior to die for them to redeem them so all sinners can have a chance to be saved and go to heaven. Therefore, sinners, come quickly and receive God's salvation. The evil can go to heaven; this is the gospel.</P><P>This tax collector was a most wicked person. Yet he was saved. Does this mean that we should commit sins and become evildoers in order to be saved? Does this mean that we can sin as we please in order to obtain salvation? No, absolutely not! The Lord Jesus said that sinners can be saved. He did not say that sinners would be saved because they commit sins. By himself, a sinner will perish. If he relies on a third party, he can be saved. Now we want to see the reason why this tax collector, who had committed such sins, could actually be saved. In this way we, who are sinners like him, can learn from him and obtain salvation, so that evildoers like us can also go to heaven.</P><P>Although he was sold to sin, he was not proud before God and did not presume that he had anything. The Lord Jesus said that he humbled himself before God. The Scriptures say that "God resists the proud but gives grace to the humble" (James 4:6). He knew his own deeds. He knew he had nothing to boast about. He saw his many defects. He knew he deserved to be condemned. So he humbled himself before God. When he came to the temple of God, he stood "at a distance, [and] would not even lift up his eyes to heaven." He knew that God is most holy and most righteous and that a person like him was unworthy of coming close to God or looking to Him. He had no good works to report to God. He knew he could not save himself, so he came to God for grace.</P><P>"God...gives grace to the humble." If you are proud, thinking you have everything and are short of nothing, may the Spirit open the eyes of your heart so that you will see all your shortcomings and come to God for grace. If you know your shortcomings, I hope you will not be proud and deceive yourself and end up perishing. Pride has misled many to not believe in the Savior, and therefore, they perished. I hope that pride will not mislead you! He prayed before God, "God, be propitiated to me, the sinner!" (v. 13). He was not like the Pharisee who despised "the rest," speaking about the sins of others. He confessed that he himself was a sinner: "me, the sinner!" How hard it is for men to utter these words! Men are willing to admit that "all have sinned" (Rom. 3:23), but are not willing to say "I have sinned." Men are willing to admit and say that all are sinners (Rom. 3:10-12), but they are not willing to say "me, the sinner!" Saying this is very shameful! This tax collector put himself in the position of a sinner. This is the position that everyone who wants to go to heaven should and must put himself. Let me say, if there is a saved person in this world, that person must be a sinner. No one who is not a sinner can go to heaven. If you go to heaven and ask those who are already there about their past qualifications, they will unanimously answer and say that they all were sinners in the past. Everyone who is in heaven is a saved sinner who has received grace. They have nothing special. Heaven is specifically prepared for sinners. If one does not confess himself that he is a sinner, he has no qualification to enter into heaven! Heaven only welcomes tax collectors and harlots. All the sinners who believe in the Lord Jesus may come!</P><P>The Lord Jesus said, "For I did not come to call the righteous, but sinners" (Matt. 9:13). He also said, "For the Son of Man has come to seek and to save that which is lost" (Luke 19:10). If you are a righteous man, His coming is not to call, seek out, and save you. But He will save you if you admit that you are a sinner and are lost. Putting yourself in the position of a sinner is the first step in salvation. Although this tax collector was a sinner, who should have perished, he was saved because he did not pretend to be a person without sin. He admitted that he was a sinner.</P><P>The renowned British preacher Spurgeon had a dream one night. In the dream he saw himself standing outside the gate of heaven, and a group of bright and glowing saints were standing in a line holding banners of victory, singing and marching through the gate of heaven. As soon as they entered through the gate, Spurgeon heard many joyful voices and praises welcoming them. Then he asked one angel, "Who are these ones who are so welcomed by heaven?" The angel answered, "They are the ancient prophets." Spurgeon said, "Alas, I am not a prophet, I am not worthy to enter in with them." Later, another group also marched through the gate and received a great welcome. He asked the angel again, "Who are they?" The angel answered, "They are the ancient saints." Spurgeon knew that he was not one of the ancient saints and felt unworthy to enter through the gate with them. A little later, another group came; they were the ancient martyrs. Spurgeon dared not join in with them either. Finally, another group with a multitude much greater than the first three came. Among this group Spurgeon recognized two people. One was the woman who anointed the Lord with ointment; the other one was the robber who was crucified with the Lord. Spurgeon thought that when this group entered into heaven it would be quiet, but to his great surprise, the welcome and applause was seven times greater than the welcome for the first three groups. Spurgeon asked, "Who are they?" The angel answered, "They are ones who were dead in sin and were made alive by the Lord Jesus." Then Spurgeon rejoiced and said, "Praise be unto the Lord Jesus forever! The people in this last group are my companions." Then he woke up. Although this was a dream, it was real! The Lord of heaven welcomes sinners.</P><P>The first step the Holy Spirit takes in the heart of a man is to make him realize his sin. The first step God takes in saving a sinner is to send His Spirit to work in his heart and convict him of his sins. I once held a meeting in a certain place, and some grade-school girls were deeply moved by the Holy Spirit. They deeply realized that they were sinners. After the meeting they waited for me to fellowship with them. I saw that none of their eyes were dry. Every one of them was sorrowful for her sins. They told me that they were very sorry. They knew that they were sinners but they did not know whether they could be saved. I told them that knowing that they were sinners was proof of the Holy Spirit's working in their hearts. I then read John 3:16 and 5:24 and other promises to them and helped them realize that since they knew they were sinners, they could receive eternal life and be saved if they believed and received the Lord Jesus as their Savior. The Holy Spirit opened their eyes and they experienced the salvation of the cross and the enjoyment of salvation. They are still joyful and rejoicing in the Lord every day. Therefore, if this very hour the Holy Spirit shows you your sins, it is because He wants to save you, not because He wants to condemn your sins.</P><P>This tax collector not only put himself in the position of a sinner; he was also genuinely grieved because of his sins. He "beat his breast." He hated himself. When he considered how he committed sins in the past, sorrow uncontrollably rose up within him. He was in anguish and beat his breast. Certainly those who overlook their sins and do not feel sorrowful for them will easily commit sins again. "For sorrow according to God works repentance unto salvation, which is without regret" (2 Cor. 7:10). The Bible says that God dwells "with the contrite and lowly of spirit, / To revive the spirit of the lowly / And to revive the heart of the contrite" (Isa. 57:15). "The sacrifices of God are a broken spirit: / a broken and a contrite heart, O God, / thou wilt not despise" (Psa. 51:17). Therefore, dear sinners, it does not matter how great your sins are; what matters is that you do not want to admit that you are a sinner and feel sorrowful for your sins. If you overlook your sins and refuse to put yourself in the position of a sinner, you will surely not seek after the Savior. Even if the Savior is sent to the door of your heart, you will not receive Him. Actually, humbling yourself is not worth anything. Neither is putting yourself in the position of a sinner or being sorrowful for your sins worth anything. However, unless a man humbles himself, unless he sees himself as a sinner, and unless he feels sorrowful for his sins, he surely will not seek after the Savior of sinners, the Lord Jesus Christ. This tax collector's humbling of himself, acknowledging himself as a sinner, and sorrow for his sins could not save him; it could not give him eternal life. These steps only prepared his heart to receive salvation.</P><P>The one and only reason this sinner was saved was because he believed the vicarious salvation of the cross. Even though he humbled himself, the humbling could not save him. Even though he was sorrowful, the sorrow could not save him. Even though he confessed himself to be a sinner, the confession could not save him. Even though all these prepared him to receive salvation, these could not save him. Although without these you will perish, these things alone will not save you. A sinner is saved only through the salvation that the Lord Jesus accomplished on the cross and not through anything else.</P><P>He prayed, "God, be propitiated to me, the sinner!" Other ways to translate this phrase in the Greek text include: "God, make propitiation for me, a sinner!" or "God, allow me, a sinner, to be propitiated." This is the cross. No one can be saved without the cross. Perhaps when the tax collector was standing in the temple praying, the Holy Spirit moved his heart to convict him of his sins. Perhaps he saw from far off the priest in the outer court offering sacrifices. He saw the sacrifices slain on behalf of the sinners. Therefore, he asked God, "Make propitiation for me, a sinner." He knew he was a sinner. He knew that there was a punishment for sins. A sinner could never be justified or go to heaven. He also knew that if there was not a redeeming Savior for his sins, he would perish. His heart looked to the Savior; his heart looked to the sin offering. He cried out to God and was saved. Surely heaven was his.</P><P>He came to God not to ask God to help him change himself when he went home because he knew that he could not change. He could not improve or correct himself. He knew he had sin. He would perish because he had sins and did not have the One who could substitute for the punishment for sins. He looked to the substitutionary Savior; therefore, he was saved. Dear readers, we all are sinners and cannot save ourselves. Therefore, the Lord Jesus came specifically to save us. He did not come to be our model or to be our pattern, He came to die for us. He came to die for you and me. You and I have sins and deserve to die. The Lord Jesus came to die for your sins and mine. Therefore, you and I do not have to die. "Who Himself bore up our sins in His body on the tree" (1 Pet. 2:24). "For Christ also has suffered once for sins, the Righteous on behalf of the unrighteous" (3:18). "And He Himself is the propitiation for our sins" (1 John 2:2). This matter is most important. Since the Lord Jesus died and propitiated for us, now we do not have to perish but can be saved. If the Lord Jesus did not die and propitiate for us, we would have to bear our own sins and die, that is, perish. It is true that the tax collector was a sinner. But he depended on the Savior who died for him and who propitiated for him. Therefore, he had no sins and did not have to die or go to hell. The tax collector was able to go to heaven not because of his own merit but because of the merit of a third party, the merit of the Savior's saving work. Likewise, all those who go to heaven are justified not because of their own righteous deeds, but because they rely on the work of the cross of the Lord Jesus.</P><P>The tax collector came before God for the propitiation of sins. "For whoever calls upon the name of the Lord shall be saved. How then shall they call upon Him into whom they have not believed?" (Rom. 10:13-14). The tax collector cried to God because he first believed in God. He was saved because he believed God would propitiate for his sins. Justification is by faith and salvation is also by faith. He knew well the truth concerning salvation: "For by grace you have been saved through faith" (Eph. 2:8). He knew he lacked something. He also knew that except for God's mercy, nothing else could make up for his lack. He asked God to have mercy on him. He knew that salvation was by grace and "not out of works in righteousness which we did but according to His mercy He saved us" (Titus 3:5). He knew God gives grace through the Savior and that he needed a Savior to die for him to propitiate for his sins. He prayed for God's grace and beseeched for God's redemption. He asked by faith, and He believed in his heart. Therefore, he obtained it.</P><P>The tax collector went to heaven because he obtained God's mercy and received the Savior's propitiation for him, not because he was remarkable and outstanding. For a sinner to go to heaven, there is no need to pay a price because the Lord Jesus has already paid the full price on the cross on our behalf. The Pharisee perished because he did not have a Savior. The tax collector was saved because he had a Savior. Salvation and perdition have nothing to do with you or your behavior. A man as good as the Pharisee could not avoid going to hell, while a man as wicked as the tax collector could go to heaven. One went to hell not because he was wicked, and the other went to heaven not because he was good. The difference between them was whether or not they believed in the Lord Jesus who died for us on the cross. That was all! "He who believes into the Son has eternal life; but he who disobeys the Son shall not see life, but the wrath of God abides upon him" (John 3:36). The decision between eternal life and eternal death depends solely upon whether or not one believes. Today I beg and beseech you to quickly believe in the Lord Jesus' vicarious death, and you will be saved.</P><P>The good man went to hell and the wicked man went to heaven. The good man did not go to hell because of his goodness, but because he did not believe in the Lord Jesus as his Savior. The wicked man did not go to heaven because of his wickedness, but because he believed in the Lord Jesus as his Savior. Therefore, if you want salvation, you must realize that salvation is not merchandise. You do not have to gradually behave yourself better and earn your salvation as a reward. Salvation is God's free grace, freely given to all sinners who believe. God does not care how wicked you are. If you are willing to receive the Lord Jesus as your Savior and if you believe that His death was for you, you will be saved. The Lord Jesus has already borne all the punishment for your sins; no sin will be able to stand up to accuse you in the day of judgment. You are completely and absolutely saved. God does not care how good you are. If you do not receive the Lord Jesus to be your Savior and if you do not believe that His death was for you, you will surely perish. Your goodness cannot cover your wickedness and cannot redeem your wickedness; you will still perish. God has ordained that those who believe in the Lord Jesus will be saved and that those who do not believe will perish. Good unbelievers will go to hell, but wicked believers will go to heaven.</P><P>Therefore, good man, please do not be proud, because your goodness will not save you! Therefore, wicked man, do not be discouraged, because your sins will not condemn you. Thank and praise God! How wonderful is His salvation! The people of the world are like this tax collector, helpless and hopeless sinners, and we all deserve eternal punishment in the future. Yet God caused the Lord Jesus to die for us on the cross, so that when we believe in Him and receive Him as our Savior, we will be saved. How great is this grace! So sinner, please follow the tax collector! Humble yourself before God. Confess your sins. Come before God with faith, asking God, "God, be merciful to me, a sinner. Save me by the Lord Jesus' substitutionary death on the cross!" God will surely save you. Thank God that He has such a salvation.</P><H1 CLASS=MSG>MESSAGE SIX</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>THE ROBBER SAVED</H1><H2 CLASS=HEAD4>Issue No. 11</H2><P>We will first read two sections of the Bible. Mark 15:27-32 tells about the Lord Jesus being crucified on the cross. "And with Him they [those who nailed the Lord Jesus] crucified two robbers, one on His right and one on His left....And those who were passing by blasphemed Him, wagging their heads and saying, Aha! You who destroy the temple and build it in three days, Save Yourself and come down from the cross! Likewise also the chief priests with the scribes mocked Him with one another and said, He saved others; Himself He cannot save. Let the Christ, the King of Israel, come down now from the cross that we may see and believe. Those who were crucified with Him also reproached Him."</P><P>"And one of the criminals who were hanged there blasphemed Him, saying, Are You not the Christ? Save Yourself and us! But the other, answering, rebuked him and said, Do you not even fear God, since you are in the same judgment? And we justly, for we are receiving what we deserve for what we did, but this Man has done nothing amiss. And he said, Jesus, remember me when You come into Your kingdom. And He said to him, Truly I say to you, Today you shall be with Me in Paradise" (Luke 23:39-43).</P><P>These two sections of the Bible tell us the story of a robber who was saved shortly before his death. This is a strange story! A robber was saved! We think that the robber should be punished, that the death-defying prisoner should descend to the deepest part of hell to receive the gravest punishment, and that salvation should belong to the good people in the world. Can robbers be saved? Yes, robbers can be saved because in these verses a robber was saved. This robber was saved before his death! We often think that if a man does good all his life, he will gradually obtain salvation. We often think that salvation can be accomplished by our efforts through months and years of accumulated hard work. Is it possible that someone who committed robbery all his life, someone who had criminal offenses, was suddenly saved in the moment just before his death? Very much so. Someone who has done evil all his life, who has never done anything good, can be saved immediately upon believing in the Lord Jesus. Man can be saved in a brief moment, within the shortest time, when he believes in the Lord Jesus. What an amazing story! What a wonderful salvation!</P><P>The Lord Jesus said to the robber, "Today you shall be with Me in Paradise." Where the Lord would be, he would be also. He was saved, no more to perish. Now we would like to see what type of person this saved man was.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>I. THE CONDUCT OF THIS SAVED PERSON</H2><P>He was a robber. For someone to become a robber, his character must be completely bankrupt. No position for man can be lower than that of a robber. As a robber, he had fallen to the lowest state that a man can ever sink to. A robber is lawless, without any regard for the law in his eyes, lazy, unwilling to work to feed himself; greedy, coveting other people's possessions; cruel, usurping others' possessions and killing, causing havoc to human lives. How reckless and unrestrained is he! He steals other people's belongings and loots other people's possessions. From man's viewpoint, it is absolutely hopeless to save this type of person.</P><P>As a robber, he trespassed against the law and was captured by the Roman government. He went through the judicial procedure of the Roman court. Being condemned as a criminal of gross sin, he was given the most severe punishment-crucifixion. Compared with man's law, God's law is stricter and more refined. In many instances man's law does not or cannot condemn certain things as sin, but God's law shuts them all up in the realm of sin so that man can have nothing more to say. Man's law condemns the conduct of man. It cannot touch the intent of the heart. If a manifested conduct is condemned by man's law, how much more is it condemned before the stricter and more refined law of God? He was a robber. Under Roman law he was declared guilty and sentenced to death. Can such a person obtain God's grace? If he was condemned by men, who can only see outward conduct without seeing the heart, God, who searches man's inward parts and examines man's conduct, should condemn him much more. Does not the soul of such a man deserve to perish?</P><P>He was not only branded as a robber by man and sentenced to death by the Roman government, he even deserved unpardoned death in his own eyes. He told the other robber who was nailed with him, "And we justly, for we are receiving what we deserve for what we did" (Luke 23:41). At this juncture between life and death, he had forgotten how the government had condemned him and how the people had mocked him. As he recalled his lifelong behavior, he could not help but confess that he deserved his death sentence because his deeds befitted the punishment of the cross. At this moment the sorrow and pain of his conscience was far more unbearable than the pain he suffered in his flesh. Having been enlightened by God, he knew his own sin; therefore, he could confess it as sin. In man's view and according to man's decision, can a man convicted by his conscience have the hope of salvation? It seemed that he deserved more than perdition!</P><P>When the Lord Jesus was on the cross, according to the verses in Mark, there were three groups of people who mocked Him: (1) those who passed by, (2) the chief priest and the scribes, and (3) the thieves who were nailed next to him. On the cross, the two saw and heard many people mocking the Lord Jesus, so they also joined with the others to mock Him. This robber was a man with no backbone. He saw how other people wronged Christ and opposed Christ; and without even knowing the reason for it, he just turned with the tide. Seeing everyone mocking in this way, he also joined in with the crowd. He should not have had any deep hatred or enmity towards Christ. However, when he saw the majority of the people doing wrong to Christ, he also joined the crowd, following blindly to blaspheme Him. Those who do wrong to Christ ought to perish; many have thought this.</P><P>Yet, one robber was saved. A robber was saved! A criminal was saved! A thief was saved! One condemned to die was saved! One who wronged Christ was saved! One who committed sin to the uttermost so that even he could not deny his guilt was saved! Therefore, who cannot be saved? Who is not qualified to be saved? O sinners of the world, this is the gospel! This is grace! He who can be viewed as having no possibility of being saved, God, in His mighty grace, saves, giving him eternal life that he may enjoy the bliss of Paradise. You may be a great sinner; you may think that you do not deserve to be saved but rather should perish, but God has decided to grant you grace and give you salvation. Do not be mistaken by thinking that salvation is reserved only for deserving ones and that you are not deserving of it. According to fact, no one in the world deserves salvation. But no one in the world is unqualified for salvation according to God's mercy. If God does not bestow grace and He deals with us according to our sins, even the most noble sages in the world will perish. Who is not a sinner before God? But if He bestows grace, who will not be saved? If a robber can be saved, you too can be saved. If a man will humble himself and will wait on God's grace, God will give grace to him, because God gives grace to the humble.</P><P>The wonderful thing about the gospel is that God sent His Son to save sinners-not the righteous. "Faithful is the word and worthy of all acceptance, that Christ Jesus came into the world to save sinners" (1 Tim. 1:15). This is contrary to the mind of the world. Nevertheless, this is a glorious fact. No matter how much you have sinned, Christ can save you. He saved the robber; He also saved the harlot. He saves sinners. He does not forsake you because of your sins, but rather, He came to save you because of your sins. No matter what kind of person you are, if only you are willing to come to Him, He is willing to save you. I remember a story. Once a man came to see Mr. Moody, and he said, "You don't have to persuade me to be a Christian or persuade me to believe in the Lord Jesus." Moody asked him, "Why is this?" He answered, "You don't know how hard my heart is!" Moody said with a smile, "Aha! So that's why. Don't worry; Christ did not say only the soft-hearted ones may come and that the hard-hearted ones need not come. Rather, He said that one can come whatever his heart is like. So it does not matter whether your heart is hard or soft, black or white. Every kind of heart can come." Indeed, Christ receives sinners; He comforts them and saves them. Since He was willing to save this robber, He is also willing to save you and me. In the eyes of the robber himself, he was a sinner. According to the world's classification, he was a sinner. According to the judgment of the Roman government, he was a sinner. Nevertheless, Christ saves sinners. What grace this is! What is this? This is salvation. This is Christ saving sinners in grace.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>II. THE CAUSE OF THE ROBBER'S REPENTANCE</H2><P>We do not know why this robber, who joined the other robber and with the same heart and same voice mocked the Lord Jesus in the beginning, suddenly changed and believed in Christ. I think it was mainly because the words of Christ's prayer in Luke 23:34 touched his heart. "Father, forgive them, for they do not know what they are doing." Such mercy, such lovingkindness, such tenderness, and such bountiful grace moved the heart of the robber. It took away his prejudice, melted his evil heart, and caused him to realize that the One nailed beside him was indeed Christ, the Son of God. The cross of the Romans had hardened his heart to mock Christ, but the cross of the Lord Jesus caused him to repent and believe in the Savior. The law and punishment cannot save man; only grace and love can bring a sinner to tears and weeping to come before God in self-condemnation, asking for His grace and mercy.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>III. THE EXPRESSION OF FAITH</H2><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>A. Rebuking His Companion</H2><P>In any case it was a definite fact that this robber believed in the Lord Jesus on the cross. His faith was shown in his words, in his attitude, and in his prayer. First, he expressed his faith because he rebuked the other robber. When the other robber mocked Christ and attacked Him with his words once again, he might have thought that his companion, who joined his mocking with the same heart and same voice the last time, would join him again after he got started. Little did he expect that before he had finished his reviling, the other one would immediately rebuke him. The robber rebuked him saying, "Do you not even fear God, since you are in the same judgment?" (Luke 23:40). The punishment which they all suffered was the crucifixion of the cross. What this robber meant was, "Even though you and I are nailed on the cross, do you still not fear God? You are on the cross, and your life is almost over. Do you still not fear God? In a few hours you are going to die. Do you still not fear God? Eternity is already set before you. Hell and heaven are both eternal. Do you still not fear God? Eternal life or eternal death, salvation or perdition-within these few short hours they will be determined. Do you still not fear God? At this juncture of life and death, everything depends on how you use this fading time. Do you still not fear God? Once these few short moments are past, once your breath departs from your body, eternal life or eternal perdition will be forever sealed, and nothing will change. Do you still not fear God? Since you have received such punishment from men, are you not afraid of punishment from God? If man's punishment is hard to bear, what about God's punishment? Do you still not fear God? If today's punishment is unbearable enough, what about eternity's? Do you still not fear God? If man's punishment and man's law end our life, should we not be afraid of the eternal death in the future? You have suffered the world's punishment. Do you still want to suffer God's punishment? Does not such grave punishment, such painful and severe punishment, make your heart fear hell? Eternal life or eternal death will be determined within the shortest time. I think this is the hour for you to fear God and His punishment. You have never feared anything in your entire life. Should you not fear God now?"</P><P>Gentlemen, time is passing by minute after minute, hour after hour, and day after day; in a wink of the eye, a month and a year passes by us. Oh! How short is our lifetime! Age will not wait for us! In a short time eternity will be before our eyes! Who can know how long they will live? Are our lives not like a breath of air, which soon disappears? Are our lives not like the wild flowers, which blossom in the morning and wither at dusk? Oh! How uncertain is life! Why are we still so infatuated with the world, sin, and lust? Is not the future of your spirit very important? Therefore, how can you, for the sake of a temporary moment in time, despise the eternal future? Ah! Life is fleeting and uncertain. Life and death can change place in us at any time. At any time our spirit can depart from our body. If you have never thought about the question of eternity, and have never paid attention to the question of the future, is it not time to fear God? If we do not pay attention to the question of our spirit now, we will never have another chance in the future. If you do not have salvation now, you will never have it in eternity. You must believe in the Lord Jesus quickly and receive His salvation while you still have your life. Death is already operating in our body! Sickness, pain, troubles, weakness, and worry are all the forerunners of death! The seed of death is within our body! We do not know when it will grow and bear fruit. Young people, you cannot be forever young. Old people, your hour is almost here. If you do not accept the Lord now, how much longer will you wait? Your destination will soon be determined; are you not afraid of God?</P><P>Perhaps God's punishing hand is upon you; you have suffered, lost your loved ones, or met with defeat, sickness, disability, or disasters. You are already suffering punishment. Will you not turn back? Will you still not fear God? All the sufferings that God has inflicted upon your flesh have come because of His love. You have gone too far away from Him! You do not believe in Him any longer! Aside from this material world and its lust and glory, you no longer realize that there is a God! You also do not want the Savior, the Lord Jesus, whom He has established! You have gone too far away from Him! He has no choice but to chastise you and to call you back. You have been punished. Do you still not fear God?</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>B. Confessing His Sins</H2><P>We have seen how this robber rebuked his companion, expressing his own faith. Now we want to also see that he not only expressed his faith by rebuking his companion, but in his confession he declared that he had believed in the Lord Jesus. Let us read verse 41. "And we justly, for we are receiving what we deserve for what we did." What do these words mean? "And we justly" means they deserved a brutal death for their punishment. The punishment that they received, the punishment of the cross, befitted what they had done. They were robbers. They had sinned, murdered, and committed arson. Moreover, there were sins in their hearts. Nothing of what they did, thought, or said was good. Being put to death in this way was most just and reasonable. The law did not mistreat them because before God, before man, and even before their own eyes, they were truly sinners!</P><P>The robber acknowledged that he deserved the punishment he had received. It was his own sins, his own conduct, that brought him this just penalty. He confessed that he was a sinner. He did not use any words to cover up his own sins. He also did not use any reasons to hide the guilt of his sin. He did not say, "I was a robber, but I did it according to my conscience. If I had not been a robber, my stomach would have gone hungry and my body would have gotten cold. I was forced to extort for lack of clothing and food. Life as a robber is a kind of business! Why can't this be?" Yet he did not talk in this way. He was moved by the Holy Spirit to confess that he was a sinner. He confessed this before his companion; he confessed this before the Lord Jesus; he also confessed this before those who were watching his execution. He did not forgive himself in any way; he confessed that he was a sinner. Normally it is very hard for robbers to confess their sins because their hearts are so perverse. "Swift are their feet to shed blood, destruction and misery are in their ways" (Rom. 3:15-16). But as soon as the Holy Spirit worked, this robber acted contrary to his normal behavior and confessed that he was a sinner. He wanted a Savior because he was a sinner. He wanted a Savior so he believed, asked for, and received one.</P><P>I am a gospel preacher. The first thing that I do is to lead people to know that they are sinners. This is a very hard thing to do. Some people answer me, saying, "I have not murdered anyone, and I have not committed any arson. What sin do I have?" And others would say, "Whatever I do, I do according to my conscience. What sin do I have?" Whenever I try to prove their sins to people, they always have many excuses. Even when people sometimes admit that they are sinners, they say, "Everyone in the world is a sinner, so what does it matter if I am just one of them?" They are willing to admit that everyone in the world is a sinner, but they will not admit in a simple way that they themselves are sinners. They do not realize that besides murder and arson there are many more sins! Pride in the heart, jealousy, unclean thoughts, lies of the mouth, sudden temper, all these are sins. Have you not committed these? Saying that you have no sin because you act according to your conscience is not altogether true, because I do not know what kind of conscience you have. If it has been darkened and deadened, it will not have a high standard to direct you. I remember once when I was going from Shanghai to Tientsin, I met someone from my hometown in the boat. His bed was opposite mine, so we soon began to talk. He was a dentist in Shanghai. He was a very good-looking young man. He did not know that I was a preacher. He told me of his experience in Shanghai. According to him, scores of young women had been seduced by him. He was very proud of himself when he said this. After he had finished speaking, I began to preach the gospel to him. I also had my story to tell. I told him how I had believed in the Lord Jesus and was saved. I said to him, "You are a sinner, and if you sin like that, you will perish in the future." He replied, "All my life I have done things according to my conscience." He would not accept my gospel. Gentlemen! Please listen to his reply. He ruined the chastity of scores of women, but he still said that he acted according to his conscience. Oh! What sort of conscience is this? Just think for yourselves. What sort of conscience is this? Is it reliable?</P><P>The first step the Holy Spirit does in a man's heart is to cause him to reprove his sins. This causes him to realize that he is a sinner and needs a Savior. It will lead him to trust in the Lord Jesus. If you will not allow the Holy Spirit to prove to you by the Scripture that you are a sinner, and if you resist God's evaluation concerning you and do not acknowledge that you are a sinner, it will be impossible for you to receive God's salvation. If you are not a sinner, why should you be saved? If you are not a sinner, why should the Lord Jesus die for you and save you? Confessing that you are a sinner is the prerequisite for being saved. I urge you to be humble and not be proud; do not be afraid of losing face; confess that you are a sinner! I often feel that the more a person is a sinner, the harder it is for him to confess that he is a sinner. He is too proud! If you tell him to confess his sins, he will lose face too much! For this reason he will not do it. The greater the sinner, the more he will say that he is good. He will even say that he is better than other people. This is because he is ignorant of himself. The more one knows himself, the more he will cry aloud, "There is nothing good in me, but only evil." The more one knows God's holiness, the more he will acknowledge that he is sinful and evil to the uttermost. I urge you at this time to be honest with yourself; let the Holy Spirit move in your heart to convict you of your own sins.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>C. Confessing the Lord</H2><P>The robber not only rebuked the other robber and confessed that he himself was a sinner, but he also confessed that the Lord Jesus had no sin. Please read the last part of verse 41. "But this Man [meaning the Lord Jesus] has done nothing amiss." He seemed to be saying, "The three of us are being punished together. Two of us are robbers, and this manner of execution is indeed just; but this Man, Jesus Christ, did not commit sin. None of the things He did was bad; everything was proper and most holy. But He is being punished together with us sinners. What does this mean? Robbers should be nailed to the cross. But should this One who is not a robber also be nailed to the cross? We are condemned because of our evil conduct, but should this One, whose conduct is the best, be condemned also? We sinners deserve death. There is no argument about that. But this Man, the most holy and most perfect One, why does He deserve death? The guilty ones should die. This is reasonable. But what is the reason for this guiltless One to die? Sinners should perish. This is most justifiable. But what does it mean for the sinless One to suffer the pain of perdition? We robbers have nothing to say about our dying; but why does He, the Christ of God, have to go through the same fate as we?" This really is an amazing question! Truly, no one in the world could answer it! We must see what the Bible says. "For while we were yet weak, in due time Christ died for the ungodly" (Rom. 5:6). "While we were yet sinners, Christ died for us" (v. 8). "Who Himself bore up our sins in His body on the tree" (1 Pet. 2:24). "For Christ also has suffered once for sins, the Righteous on behalf of the unrighteous" (1 Pet. 3:18). These verses in the Bible tell us why Christ died. He died on behalf of sinners. He died in substitution for your sins and my sins. "Substitution!" "Substitution!" Please take note of this word. There is no other word more important than this. Without substitution, there would be no gospel. Without the substitution, there would be no salvation. Without the substitution, there would be no need for preaching. If Christ had not died in substitution for sinners, I would not believe in Christ, and I would also urge you not to believe in Him. If He had not died on our behalf, we would still have to bear our own sins, and we would still have to perish. What use would it be for us to believe in Him? But thanks and praise be to God! Although His Son has no sin, God gladly gave Him up for us sinners. On our behalf Christ bore all the punishment of our sins and died upon the cross so that whenever we believe in Him, we will have eternal life and not perish.</P><P>It is very meaningful to see this robber speaking about the Lord Jesus' guiltless punishment. He saw the Lord's death; he also acknowledged that the Lord is sinless. But why must a sinless person die? He implicitly acknowledged that Christ's death was on his behalf. He believed in the salvation of the cross. He believed in the Lord Jesus' substitutionary death. For this reason he was saved. My dear sinners, there is only one way to be saved: believe in the crucified Lord Jesus Christ. If you believe that He has died for you on the cross, you will immediately have eternal life. You have sinned; you should perish. Sin and the consequence of sin are two things that cannot be separated. Once you sin, there is a consequence of sin, a punishment: hell and perdition. If you have not sinned, there is nothing to say. If you are altogether righteous and holy, who can punish you? If you have sinned, the punishment of sin will surely fall upon you. Do you want to perish? If you want to perish, then I have nothing to say; but if you do not want to perish, then salvation is here. The sinless Lord Jesus Christ has died in your place upon the cross, bearing all the consequences that you should have received for your sin. Are you willing to believe in Him right now? "He who believes has eternal life" (John 6:47).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>D. Prayer</H2><P>The robber not only believed the substitutionary death of the Lord Jesus, but he also prayed out from his faith a most sincere prayer. He prayed, "Jesus, remember me when You come into Your kingdom" (Luke 23:42). Let us look at another verse from the Bible, Romans 10:13. "For whoever calls upon the name of the Lord shall be saved." He called on the Lord; therefore, he was saved. Let us look at the next verse, verse 14. "How then shall they call upon Him into whom they have not believed?" After seeing this, we know that faith comes before calling. Without faith, there would be no prayer. Prayer issues from faith. Prayer is the ultimate expression of faith. Faith is the cause; prayer is the effect. We need to pay attention to one thing: although the robber rebuked his companion, he was not saved because of his rebuking. Although this robber confessed that he was a sinner, he was not saved because of such a confession. Although this robber prayed and asked the Lord Jesus to save him, his salvation was not due to his prayer. You must remember that repentance cannot save a sinner; confession cannot save a sinner; praying cannot save a sinner. A sinner is saved because of one thing only: believing in the Lord Jesus Christ's substitutionary death, that is, believing that the Lord Jesus has died for him on the cross. Before this robber prayed, he had the faith; he had accepted the Lord Jesus as his Savior. His prayer was just a spontaneous calling that issued from his faith. One who believes in the Lord's substitutionary death spontaneously cries out to the Lord for salvation. His salvation is not due to calling but due to his believing. Dear sinners, do not trust in your works. Your works cannot save you. Even good works such as repentance, confession, and prayer will not save you. If you want to be saved, please accept with faith the Lord Jesus as your personal Savior, believing that He has borne all of your sins' punishment on the cross. Once you believe, you are saved. Once you believe, you have eternal life. Will you believe?</P><P>The robber thought that being saved is something in the future; therefore, he begged Jesus to remember him when He came into His kingdom (Luke 23:42). This is the salvation of the Old Testament. He realized that he had nothing good to be proud of, nor any righteousness to brag about; he could not ask the Lord to save him according to his own merit. He said to the Lord, "Remember me." He meant that he considered himself unworthy and unqualified, seemingly with not much hope for salvation. If the Lord Jesus would remember him, there was no need of anything else. Just to remember him once would be good enough. He knew all those who were remembered by God would receive exceedingly great grace. So he begged in such a way. Although what he asked for was not perfect, the Lord Jesus Christ did listen to him. The Lord promised him something that he had not asked for, something beyond his expectation. Oh sinners, the Lord is very willing to treat you this way. Do you want Him to treat you this way? There is not much time left! Eternal life or eternal death will soon be decided! Are you willing to take advantage of this crucial five minutes to believe in this Savior who has died for you? At this moment are you willing to call on His name with a believing heart and ask Him to save you? Alas! How great are our sins! How deep is our agony! How long is the final judgment! How terrible it will be! How dangerous is our present position! What confusion! If you do not call on Him now, when will you do so? If you do not come before God with tears and sorrow now and seek His salvation now, how long are you going to wait? I hope that you will quickly turn and be awakened right now. Please take a few minutes in silence now, bow your head, and pray to God. Ask Him to save you for the sake of His Son, the Lord Jesus Christ.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>IV. THE NATURE OF HIS FAITH</H2><P>Through his rebuke, his confession of sin, his acknowledgment of the Lord, and his prayer, the robber expressed his faith. We may say that it was the most difficult time for him to believe in the Lord. According to historical records, during that day in Jerusalem there were more than a million people. All of them were crying out together, "Crucify Him!" "Crucify Him!" "Away with Him!" "Away with Him!" At that time almost all of the Lord's disciples were scattered. His enemies were many and His friends were few. And yet, on the hill of Golgotha, there was one nailed beside Him, who, despite the opinion of the multitude, singly opposed their view and confessed that this One who was crucified with him was the Savior! Even more, he believed in Him as his personal Savior! What kind of faith is this? This is a faith that is opposed to the whole world. The One whom the world crucified, he believed was the Savior. The One whom the world condemned, he acknowledged as the sinless One. Although the world criticizes Christ, he still believed in Him. Although the world persecutes Christ and tries to crucify Him, yet I believe. Although the world cries, "Away with Him!" "Away with Him!" "There should not be a religion like this in the world!", still I believe. Although the world opposed the Lord Jesus and His disciples with intense pressure, inflicting much suffering on them, I still believe. Dear friends, if you do not believe in Jesus Christ, I beg you and I urge you today to believe in Him immediately. This is beneficial to you; it will give you eternal life if you are willing to believe in Him. The Holy Spirit and those who preach the gospel all desire that you will, like the robber, not fear the crowd and come forward to believe in the Lord Jesus. You should not be cowards, hiding yourselves, fearing to believe in Him just because the world opposes, persecutes, mocks, and despises Him. If it is proper to believe in Him and you are an intelligent person, you should not shrink back because of the opposition of others. Committing sin is a truly shameful thing; believing in the Savior is something most glorious. This robber did not lose his dignity because of the crowd. He was not a yes-man; he did not say what others were saying. He would not say, "Crucify Him!", just because the multitude said, "Crucify Him!" He had been that type of person before, but he awoke. Even though the Savior was crucified on the same kind of cross that he was nailed to, and even though they both went through the same experience, he believed in Him. If we consider Christ to be believable and the gospel of His cross to be credible, we should not blindly follow other people because of their criticisms. Do not think that you will lose your dignity when you trust in Christ. In fact, it takes dignity to believe in Christ.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>V. WHAT HE BELIEVED</H2><P>The robber believed that Christ could save him. He was not like some people who regard Christ simply as a human example for people to imitate. He was not like others who regard Christ merely as a great teacher, teaching people and preaching doctrines of equality, love, freedom, and so forth. He was not like still others who regard Christ merely as a social worker, a reformer, coming to serve and reform the Jewish society. All these beliefs seem to be significant. In reality they are insignificant. They seem real yet they are empty. These beliefs could not help him. He was dying! Although the Lord Jesus was perhaps the best example, could just an example help him? He was fast approaching death! The most urgent problem in his heart was the problem of the salvation of his spirit. "Where will I go when I die?" Could Christ teach him anything as a great teacher at this moment? To those who were living, Christ's reforming of and service to society may have had some contribution; but to the low-class, sinful robber, a criminal whose breath was waning and whose death was imminent, what help could He render? The Lord Jesus whom he believed in was not the Lord Jesus cheered by the crowd, written about, and discussed in the papers. He was the Lord Jesus who could comfort his heart before death, forgive his sins, save his spirit and soul, and give him eternal life. This Lord Jesus can remember him and can save him.</P><P>Men and women, please be careful as to what you believe in. Remember that Christ came to be the redeeming Savior and not anything else. Whoever believes that He died on his behalf shall be saved.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>VI. THE LORD'S ANSWER-<br>HAVING ETERNAL LIFE "TODAY"</H2><P>Now let us see how the Lord Jesus answered the robber. Please read Luke 23:43. "And He said to him, Truly I say to you, Today you shall be with Me in Paradise." Paradise is where those who believe in the Lord Jesus dwell after they have died. It is a very joyful place. In other words, Paradise is heaven (Rev. 2:7). Therefore, the Lord Jesus Christ promised, "You are saved today; you already have eternal life; heaven is assured for you." Please remember that salvation is immediate; you do not have to wait until the future. The Bible said, "He who believes has eternal life" (John 6:47). Whenever you believe, you have eternal life. You do not have to wait until the future to find out. If you believe today, you will be saved today; you do not have to wait until you die and stand before God to find out. The word in John 5:24 says it most clearly. "Truly, truly, I say to you, He who hears My word and believes Him who sent Me has eternal life, and does not come into judgment but has passed out of death into life." Here it tells us that he who hears the gospel of the Lord and believes on the heavenly Father (1) has eternal life, (2) shall not come into judgment, and (3) has passed out of death into life. The Lord Jesus said that he who believes has eternal life. We have believed. Do we have eternal life? The Lord Jesus said that he who believes shall not come into judgment. We have believed. Will we be judged? The Lord Jesus said that he who believes has passed out of death into life. We have already believed. Have we passed out of death into life? The Lord will never lie. Whatever He says is true. His promise will never change; even now, it has not lost its effectiveness. We must not doubt God's Word and His promise. If we doubt, that sin will be great! Since the Lord Jesus promised, certainly it must be true. We who have believed in Him have eternal life now; we are not in condemnation now; we have passed out of death into life now. The question for us is whether or not we have believed in Him. If not, how perilous it is for us! If so, what have we to fear? God has already given us eternal life; God has already justified us. Who can condemn us? "He who believes into Him is not condemned" (John 3:18).</P><P>Therefore, we should know that having salvation and eternal life is not something that one finds out about in the future, nor is it something that one receives in the future. We can know now, and we can receive today. Are you one who has believed in the Lord Jesus? I often ask Christians, "Are you saved?" Let me also ask you this same question, "Are you saved?" There are many people who answer, "Mr. Nee, I dare not say so. But I do hope to be saved." And some people say, "I do not know now. I must wait until I die, and after God judges me, I will know." But please listen to what the Lord Jesus said to this robber, "Today you shall be with Me in Paradise." Today! Today! Not tomorrow. Salvation is a matter for today, not for the future. The Lord Jesus seemed to be saying to the robber, "You do not have to wait until I come again to remember you; today you will be saved." The Lord Jesus is still saying to every sinner who believes in Him, "You do not have to wait until I come again to judge, before you can have eternal life; you have been saved now." Therefore, do not doubt. If He has said that you have eternal life, do you not have eternal life? Once there was a doctor who went to see a young woman who was sick in bed. Her sickness was very grave, and she was at the brink of death. The doctor came from out of town and was not allowed to render any physical help to the patient at the local hospital. The doctor asked the young woman, "Do you have the peace within?" She said, "No." The doctor asked her, "Have you believed on Jesus Christ as your Savior?" She answered, "Yes, I have." "Then why do you still not have peace?" he asked. She responded, "I am afraid of perishing." The doctor then read a verse in the Bible to her. The verse was John 6:47. "He who believes has eternal life." The doctor asked her, "This verse says he who believes has what?" She said, "This verse said, he who believes has eternal life." "Do you believe?" She said, "I do." "Then do you have eternal life?" he asked. She said, "I do not feel it. I'm afraid I do not have it." The doctor said to her again, "What does this verse say about he who believes?" She answered, "He has eternal life." "Do you believe?" She said, "Yes." The doctor then said, "Now, what does this verse say that you have?" The woman replied, "I say that I do not have eternal life, but this verse says that I have eternal life." Please listen! "I say that I do not have eternal life, but the Bible says that I have eternal life." The doctor then asked her, "Are you more reliable? Or is the Bible more reliable?" She said, "Of course, the Bible is more reliable." "Very well," said the doctor, "Do you have eternal life now?" The woman then answered joyfully, "God says that I have it. I already have eternal life." I am afraid many people are like this young woman. They believe in the Lord Jesus, but they doubt the Word of God and His promise. They think that salvation cannot be so fast, and that one cannot have eternal life immediately after believing. If you ask, "Do you believe in the Lord?", they will answer, "Yes, we believe." But if you ask them, "Do you have eternal life?", they will not dare to say yes. How many people, after hearing this gospel, have said, "I thought I did not have eternal life, but the Bible says I have eternal life!" Please do not worry about what you think or feel. God's Word says that you are saved, and the Lord Jesus says that you have eternal life; what else is there to doubt? Now is the time for us to praise the Lord, not the time to doubt. Hallelujah! Thank and praise the Lord, for He has granted us grace so freely and has saved us.</P><P>Look at the robber. He believed on the word of the Lord Jesus. He did not doubt at all. He heard the Lord say to him, "Today you shall be with Me in Paradise," and he believed that he had already obtained the blessing of his soul. He did not say to the Lord, "Lord, am I to be saved just like that?" He did not come to beg the Lord again, saying, "Lord, please do not forget to save me today!" Neither did he ask the Lord, "What shall I do in order to be saved?" After he heard the Lord saying that he would be saved that same day, he simply believed. He just rested in the Lord's word and did not raise any more questions. The word of the Lord is the guarantee of our salvation. If He says we are saved, then we are saved. If He says we are lost, then we are lost. When the Lord Jesus said, "He who believes into Him is not condemned" (John 3:18), then he who believes into Him will surely not be condemned. The Lord Jesus also said, "He who does not believe has been condemned already" (John 3:18). Surely those who do not believe in Him, their sins have been judged already. Therefore, let me ask you some questions right now: "Do you have eternal life? Are you saved?" If you have believed in Him, you can boldly answer, "Thank God for His grace. I have eternal life!"</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>VII. NOT A QUESTION OF BEHAVIOR</H2><P>The robber was not saved because of his good behavior. He could not do good, nor had he ever done any good. His salvation was completely based upon the accomplishment of Christ's death on his behalf. Please notice this. The qualification of a sinner for salvation is wholly related to Christ; it has nothing to do with the self. The robber was qualified to enter into Paradise not through any merit of his own. On the contrary, he had no merit at all. He was saved solely through the merit of Christ. If he had remained in the world, he should have grown in his spiritual life. This would have been the natural result of the new life he had received. However, he did not remain in the world; he did not have any works. The redemption of Christ alone was sufficient for him to go to heaven. After a man believes in the Lord, he should, of course, progress to good works which spontaneously come with the new life. However, good works do not make a believer more qualified to be saved. If he does not remain long in the world, he will naturally have no works. He need only depend on the merit of Christ to go to heaven. After someone believes in the Lord, he may perform many good works; but these good works do not help him as far as salvation is concerned. These good deeds will not add any merit to him or make him more qualified for salvation. Whether a believer dies immediately after believing or whether he continues in the world for decades, his qualification for salvation depends entirely on the merit of Christ's shed blood which was for the redemption of sins. If he does not die, he should grow, because the life he received when he believed in the Lord must grow. Yet this growth will not help him become more qualified to receive eternal life. If he dies immediately, Christ's merit is sufficient to allow him to enter into Paradise.</P><P>At Golgotha there were three crosses. In the middle was the cross of the Savior. On one side, there was the cross of the robber who was saved; on the other side, there was the cross of the robber who perished. The lives of the robber who was saved and robber who perished were separated by the cross of the Savior! These three crosses represent all the crosses in the world. These three crosses solve all the problems of sins in the world. The cross in the middle bore sins without hiding them. The cross on one side hid sins without bearing them, while the cross on the other side bore and hid sins. The robber who was saved was a sinner. He had sin in his heart and he hid his sin. But the Lord Jesus died for him and bore his sins. Therefore, although he hid his sins, he did not have to bear them. The Lord Jesus Christ has no sin. His death bore the sinners' sins on their behalf. As such He did not hide the sins. He only bore the sins, the sins of others. He is the only person in the world who could do this. The robber who perished was a robber, so he too hid his sins in his heart. He did not believe that the Lord Jesus died for him; therefore, he did not receive the merit of the Lord Jesus' bearing of his sins. For this reason, he had to bear his own sins. Hence, he both hid his sins and bore his sins. These two robbers typify all the sinners of the world. The difference between salvation and perdition is to believe or not believe in the substitutionary death of the cross. In the case of the robber who was saved, he hid his sins. But he trusted in the Lord Jesus Christ, therefore, he did not bear his sins. He had sins, but One died in his place. So he did not have to bear his own sins. The robber who perished was the same as the robber who was saved-both were sinners. However, he had to bear his sins himself and perish forever because he did not believe in the Lord Jesus' death for him. The cross of the Lord Jesus separates all the sinners in the world into two big categories: the perishing and the saved. Those who believe in the cross are saved. Those who do not believe in the cross perish. On which side do you belong?</P><P>The robber who was saved was not saved through his goodness; he was a robber and had no goodness. The robber who perished did not perish through his own evil, because his saved companion was also a robber just like him. It was not a case of the better one saved and the worse one lost. The conducts of the two were no different. Their only difference was faith. Therefore, you need to see clearly that salvation has nothing to do with being good or bad. These two were both robbers; however, one was saved and one perished. The occupation of these two was the same-both were robbers. They were very much one in heart-they robbed together as partners. They murdered together and committed arson together. They were like a left and right hand. They cooperated with each other and helped each other. Even their destiny was the same-they were both taken by the Roman government. They were judged together and sentenced together. They even received the same punishment-they were both crucified on a cross. On the cross they mocked Christ in unison (Mark 15:32). I suppose it would be difficult in this world to find another pair of people like these two who lived together, died together, and were together in so many things. In their lifetime they traveled on the same path and received the same end in their physical bodies. However, their conditions in eternity are completely different and completely opposite from each other. After their death there was the difference of heaven and hell between them! One entered into Paradise, being called a son of God, and received eternal blessing. One was thrown into Hades to live with the devil and received eternal sufferings. At what point did this difference commence? It began during their last five minutes. One believed the Lord Jesus, so he had eternal life. One did not believe the Lord Jesus, so he was condemned. Please listen! The difference between salvation and perdition is not determined by your poverty, riches, foolishness, wisdom, tallness, shortness, honorableness, lowliness, goodness, or evil. Salvation or perdition is determined by whether or not you believe in the Lord Jesus' substitutionary death.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>VIII. ETERNAL SEPARATION</H2><P>Although in life the two robbers were very close, even inseparable, now they are separated forever! You and your wife may be very close to each other. If she has already believed in the Lord and if you do not believe, you will be forever separated! Do you have a saved mother? You may truly love her very much. However, if you do not believe in the Lord Jesus, I am afraid you will be forever separated from her! Do you have a deceased father who was saved? If you do not believe in the Lord Jesus, you will never see him again! Do you have a little child whom you love? He is so young and innocent that he cannot yet believe. As such, he cannot now bear his own responsibility. The merit of the Lord Jesus' substitutionary death has come upon him, and he is saved. For older ones, who can bear their own responsibilities, if you do not believe in the Lord Jesus, I am afraid that father and son, and mother and son will be separated and never be together again! Parents, please come quickly! Do you have relatives on the earth? If you want to be happily united forever, you must believe in the Lord Jesus. I am afraid that tonight, among those sitting here, many of you will be separated forever! Many loving couples will be separated forever! Many intimate friends will be separated forever! Many fathers and sons, mothers and daughters, brothers and sisters will be separated forever! Alas! What a heartbreaking separation! What a sorrowful separation! There is no need to have such a separation! You must quickly believe in the Lord Jesus for your soul's sake. You must quickly believe in the Lord Jesus for your loved one's sake. You must quickly believe in the Lord Jesus for the sake of the dreadfulness of hell. You must quickly believe in the Lord Jesus for the sake of our heavenly Father's mercy and love and Christ's grace.</P><P>The matter of salvation should be decided before our breath expires. The robber was about to die. But he was not yet dead. He had the opportunity to be saved. Once he died, there would be no more opportunity. The Lord Jesus can save sinners. If He can save the robber, who can He not save? Therefore, do not fear that your sins are too great. You must believe in the Lord Jesus while you are still alive. You must confess Him as your Savior and Lord before the world. I urge you to make a decision right now. May the Holy Spirit help you make the right decision.</P><P>"Lord, right now I want to accept You as my Savior. Save me! Be merciful to a sinner like me so that I may not be condemned but may have eternal life."</P><H1 CLASS=MSG>MESSAGE SEVEN</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>THE PATHS TO HELL<br>(1)</H1><H2 CLASS=HEAD4>Issue Nos. 13, 14</H2><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>FIVE WAYS TO GO TO HELL</H2><P>Let us first read a verse. This verse is the word of Jesus Christ Himself. "Wide is the gate and broad is the way that leads to destruction, and many are those who enter through it" (Matt. 7:13). Here, this seems to show us a place called "destruction." There is a wide gate to enter this place. Beyond the gate, there is a broad way. On the way, countless people are running toward that place. They behave as though they are on an express train. Since the way is broad, it is easy to walk on it. Since the gate is wide, everything can be brought through it. But this way and gate lead to the place of destruction!</P><P>The meaning of destruction is perdition. The place of destruction is the place of perdition. The place of perdition is hell. The Lord Jesus states that the gate of hell is wide and the way to hell is broad, and many are those who go down to hell. It is possible that you are one of them! Listen! Do not think that hell has no gate. There is a gate to hell. Do not think that there is no way to hell. The way to hell is broader than any highway or street in the world. There are many ways to hell; there is not just one way. If a man wants to go to hell, there are many ways that he can take. Although there are many ways, there is only one destination. Although the starting point may be different, the destination of each way is the same. Although the ways may come from different directions, they all merge in one direction. Although the people taking a way may be different, their end, hell, is the same. Although the way you take may be different from that of another, the place you and the others are going to is the same! No matter which way you take, it is dangerous if the way leads toward hell.</P><P>Today there are at least a thousand people sitting here. [Editor's note: This message was a sermon given at a gospel meeting.] I do not know what you are thinking about. I could never guess the thoughts in your minds. But in observing your daily walk and your attitude towards the Lord Jesus Christ, I reckon that all of you want to go to hell, want to perish, and want to go into perdition. You want to go into eternal pain and darkness, with the gnashing of teeth and with Satan in the lake of fire. If this were not true, your conduct would not be so unseemly, and you would not be so cold toward the Lord Jesus and toward His grace. This is why I believe you want to go to hell! Perhaps you have already made up your mind to go to hell! Do you realize that the Bible mentions quite a number of ways to go to hell? Today I will tell you about five ways to go to hell. Those who want to go to hell can practice accordingly. I can guarantee them that they will surely end up in hell! This will serve to tell those who do not want to go to hell about the way to escape. Oh, how I wish that you would not have to go to hell. But if you really do want to go to hell, who can change you?</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>The First Way to Hell:<br>Suicide</H2><P>Suicide is a quick way to hell. There is no way to hell faster than suicide. Let us read a verse: "Judas turned aside to go to his own place" (Acts 1:25). Judas never believed in Jesus Christ. Although he pretended to be the Lord's disciple outwardly, he was in fact a son of perdition; he had never received salvation. When he died, he went to his own place. What is his own place? It is the place of perdition and destruction, hell. When Judas died, he went to hell. In what way did he go to hell? He committed suicide. He hung himself.</P><P>If you want to go to hell, suicide is a convenient way. A razor blade, a rope, or a glass of poison can send your soul to the place of eternal suffering quickly! Hell should be far away from you. You may have to spend a few years or decades before you can go to hell. Yet if you commit suicide, you will shorten your life on earth and hasten your approach to the place of eternal perdition. Once an unbelieving master asked a believing chauffeur what was the fastest way to go to hell. At that time the car was cruising along the highway. The chauffeur opened the door of the car and told his master, "If you jump out now, you will be there right away." If you have not believed in the Lord, your fall and death will bring you right to hell! Indeed, the easiest way for a man to go to hell is to kill himself. If you want to go to hell in a few hours, just buy a big dose of opium and swallow it, and you will surely arrive at your destination. If you want to go to hell in a few minutes, just take a dose of arsenic, and you will arrive at your destination also. If you think that this is too slow, and you want to go to hell in one minute, you can take a pistol and shoot yourself in the head. You will surely go to hell this way. There are other ways. You can starve yourself to death. You can jump into the ocean. You can lie on the railroad tracks and let a train cut you in half. Those who commit suicide will go to hell. Therefore, those who want to go to hell can commit suicide.</P><P>Suicide terminates any hope of salvation for a person. Consequently, such a person will surely go to hell. As long as this person is still alive on the earth, he may still be able to hear the gospel of the Lord Jesus' substitutional death; he may still believe and be saved. But if he kills himself, he will destroy, cut off, and annul all chances to hear the gospel and be saved. Listen, salvation and perdition are determined in this life. When it is time for you to die, if you do not believe in the Lord Jesus, you will not have another chance to hear the gospel and be saved. When one commits suicide, his life is terminated; when life is terminated, there is no other chance for him to be saved. Therefore, those who commit suicide will perish. The blood of the one who commits suicide is the seal on his entrance ticket to hell!</P><P>Once I was conducting a meeting in Changchow. I was speaking on the same subject as I am today. That evening there were over fourteen hundred people, including quite a number of male and female high school students. When I came to this point, I thought, "It is useless for me to say this word to them, because I am afraid that none of them have ever had the thought of committing suicide." But the Spirit of the Lord was working in me, and I could not help but speak. I told them very frankly, "If you want to go to hell, you should kill yourselves, and if you kill yourselves, you will surely go to hell." After I finished my speaking that night, a teacher came to me. He had graduated from a university and was an intelligent, educated man. He told me that he thought man's life was very meaningless and that man's living was monotonous. Many times he had thought of killing himself. He was afraid to do so only because of the darkness before him! He said that he now knew that if he killed himself, he would lose all hope of being saved. So he would not dare to do it anymore. After a few days, another high school student came to see me. He told me about his pessimism toward human life. Many times he thought about killing himself but he did not have an opportunity to do so. After he heard the message that day, he dared not harbor that thought any longer.</P><P>Another time while I was conducting a meeting in Amoy, I spoke on the same subject. I said again that if a man commits suicide, he will go to hell. Later on, a woman doctor told me that she had a nurse who was always trying to kill herself. The doctor tried every time to stop her. That evening, after hearing my message, the nurse dared not to have such a thought anymore. Now these people have all believed in the Lord Jesus Christ as their Savior. They have received Christ; they are saved; Christ has comforted their hearts and changed their lives, so that now they not only dare not, but need not commit suicide. I do not know how many sitting here today have this kind of motive. Christ will also satisfy your heart. Why try to kill yourself? Why perish and go to hell?</P><P>Once I was working for a few days at a certain college in Nanking. On the last evening during the after-meeting counseling, a college student who was from my native town came and talked with me. He had no difficulty with his tuition. He came from a good family. In class he was in no danger of receiving poor grades on his examinations. But he was very pessimistic toward the human life. Where did man come from? Where was man going? From the time he was in high school, he had lost interest in human life and was very disenchanted. He felt that there was nothing in the world that could satisfy his heart. He felt that there was a need, a craving, and a lack in his heart that nothing in the world could satisfy or console. He was very negative. He was negative toward everything. Life to him was a heavy burden, and it was absolutely meaningless to live on earth. The more he lived, the more he suffered. There was no other attraction to human life except  monotony and pain. He was always lonely, self-contemplative, and melancholy. The more he contemplated, the more he became confused and disillusioned. While he was groping in darkness, he could not see any ray of light. To him, it was better to terminate his burdensome life as soon as possible! He did not want to bear the vexation anymore. He planned to throw his body into the ocean when he returned home to Ninpo by boat during winter vacation. In this way he would part with the world forever and free himself of this troubled life. But after hearing the gospel for a few days, he learned that Jesus Christ has died for all and is living to be our Friend. There was no need for him to die. While we were talking, he received the Lord Jesus as his Savior. After he had made up his mind to receive the Lord, I invited him to tell all these things to God. I then prayed with him. After prayer, he asked me what was the first thing he should do in the morning. I told him that he should find a chance to read the Bible by meditation and prayer, and nourish his spiritual life. I then left him. After a few days, I asked his friend how he was doing. The friend told me that he was different, that he was now a happy person. After another few days, I met his friend again, and I asked about him again. I received the same answer. This man had received the Lord Jesus. He did not want to commit suicide anymore.</P><P>Friends, why do you seek death? I know that you are not satisfied with human life. I know that you are always lonely and bored. I know that your life is monotonous. I know that you sigh all the time. You feel that human life is painful, and tears always fill your eyes. Although you may possess many things of the world, none of them can satisfy your heart. You feel that there is a need and craving in the deepest part of your heart; you want to grasp hold of something that you do not even know to fill up your lack. Indeed, our life is filled with sorrow and pain. There is no taste to anything. This is why many want to kill themselves. But is suicide necessary? Jesus Christ came to save those who are in sorrow. He has comforted the hearts of many people. He has satisfied the cravings of many. He has changed the lives of many people and has wiped away the tears of many. He will help you in the same way, changing your life of sorrow to a life of joy. He is the sun amidst our dark days. He is the song in the midst of the dark night. With Him, your heart can be comforted and cheered. Why should you die? Why do you have to commit suicide and go to hell? O sorrowful and suffering ones, hear the gospel today: the Lord Jesus can and will save you. Receive Him as your Savior and Lord, and all the problems of your human life will be solved.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>The Second Way to Hell:<br>Refusing to Remove One's Sins</H2><P>Now let us read a few verses. "And if your hand stumbles you, cut it off; it is better for you to enter into life maimed than to have two hands and go away into Gehenna, into unquenchable fire. And if your foot stumbles you, cut it off; it is better for you to enter into life lame than to have two feet and be thrown into Gehenna. And if your eye stumbles you, cast it out; it is better for you to enter into the kingdom of God with one eye than to have two eyes and be thrown into Gehenna, where their worm does not die and the fire is not quenched" (Mark 9:43-48).</P><P>The Lord Jesus clearly tells us another way for us to go to hell. For the hand to stumble us means for the hand to sin. Cutting off the hand does not mean that we physically cut off the hand, it means to remove the sins and lusts of our hand which is in a way like removing our hands. It is painful to cut off one's hand; it is surely something that we do not want to do and are unwilling to do. In the same way, it is also very painful to remove the lusts and sins of the hands; to do so requires us to act contrary to our natural inclination. In spite of this, we will face great woes if we have pity on our hand, that is, pity on the lusts and the sins represented by our hand. Not only do our hands sin, but our feet also sin. Even our eyes and our whole body sin. The hands, the feet, and the eyes are but a few parts representing our whole body.</P><P>How often our hands sin! We have done many things that we ought not to have done. We have neglected many things that we ought to have done. Everyone please raise up your right hand now. Now put your right hand before you. Look at your hand! Please look! Fix your eyes upon it! While you are looking at your hand, ask yourself and consider quietly what your hand has done. How many sins has this hand of yours committed? How many things has it done that were contrary to God? How many damaging things has your hand done to others? How many things has it done to offend yourself? Please look at your hand! Please consider all the things that your hand has done. At this time I hope you will lament and weep for your own sins. You should not be jubilant or careless. You should lament and weep for all the sins that your hand has committed, so that you will be willing to remove them and be saved by believing in the Lord Jesus.</P><P>At this time please also consider the way that your feet have walked! How many times have your feet led you to places that you should not have gone? How many sins have your feet committed? Are your feet standing on the way to destruction and toward the gate of destruction? Are you going downhill all the time? Are you going to wait until there is no more hope for you to turn back? Sinners, turn back! Why perish? Why take the way of sin? This is not the way of peace. It is very painful for you to walk on this way. Why not remove your sins today and come to Jesus? I implore you to turn back and to take the other way, the way of life.</P><P>What about our eyes? The eyes are our inner world. They are the most important organ in contacting the outside world. Through the eyes we transmit everything that is outside into our heart. What things are our eyes sending into us? Our eyes have sinned. Our eyes cause us to sin. With the eyes we have seen many magazines and pictures that we should not have seen. What we call a love for literature is in fact a craving for novels. What we call an appreciation of art is in fact a love for obscene drawings. How our eyes love to see many lust-arousing scenes! Alas, the sins of the eyes are beyond our imagination! Eve saw the loveliness of the forbidden fruit and committed the sin of disobedience. David saw Bathsheba bathing and committed the sin of adultery. Have your eyes sinned? You know and God knows!</P><P>It is a difficult thing to remove the sins of the hand. But the difficulty does not lie in our inability to remove them, because the Lord Jesus has prepared a salvation. The difficulty lies in our unwillingness to remove them. It hurts our heart to have them removed. How we love our feet of sin! How natural it is for our feet to walk on the way of sin! How comfortable it is! How depressing it would be if we were not able to walk according to the old way! There would be nothing to entertain us anymore! The heart is unwilling to turn its eyes from filthy things! One look or one glance satisfies the lust and makes the heart feel good! You say that it is hard to remove the sins of the hands, the feet, and the eyes. Actually, you are unwilling to do it. All right, no one will force you and no one can coerce you to remove your sins. But God's verdict is set. He says that those who are not born again cannot enter into the kingdom of God. Those who are not regenerated cannot enter into God's kingdom. You can treasure the sins of your hands, your feet, and your eyes; you can treasure all your sins. You can choose not to remove them. You can embrace your sins in your bosom. But one thing is certain: a sinner cannot enter the kingdom of God! A sinner cannot inherit eternal life!</P><P>Either you suffer the temporary pain of cutting off your sins to receive eternal life and enter God's kingdom, or you will keep your sins, being at ease and happy in this world, but headed toward hell to be eaten by the worms and burned by the fire in the future. Either remove your sins and be saved or go to perdition with your sins. You have to remove your sins to go on in the way of life. You do not have to plan to go to hell. You can continue to sin, enjoying the pleasure of sins and continuing in the comfort of sins. There is no sin in heaven. Those who want to go in cannot bring sin along with them. Sins are either left on the mount of Golgotha, or taken to hell. Heaven only allows saved sinners to enter in. Sinners, never think that you can go in and bring your sins along as well. Either you leave the sins outside and go in by yourself, or both you and your sins will be barred from entering in! The gate of hell is wide, and its security is loose. If you want to go to hell, you can bring any kind of sins along! Pride, jealousy, rivalry, adultery, filth, and thousands of untold sins can easily go in with you. Hell is not afraid of having too many sins; it only complains about not having enough sins! If you want to go to hell, you can sin. Hell will not drive you away because you have sinned too much. Hell is specialized in receiving great and evil sinners. It has never closed its gate to those who want to go in! It welcomes anyone who wants to go in. If you want to go there to suffer an eternal suffering and receive the punishment of God's wrath, I can tell you that you can sin at will; you can do whatever pleases your heart. Otherwise, you must remove your sins and trust in the Lord Jesus. You should remove the sins of your hands, the sins of your feet, and the sins of your eyes. O evil ones, are you willing to stop your sin today? Perhaps some of you who are sitting here this hour are preparing yourselves for the sin you plan to commit when you leave the meeting hall in the next hour. Let me warn you. Be careful! Be careful! If you are not careful, you will go to hell! If a sinner departs from the way of sins to return to Jehovah, Jehovah will receive him.</P><P>Once a house was on fire. The house was well-built, and the columns were made from long, large pieces of stone. When the house caught on fire, one person inside found out too late. He did not try to run downstairs to escape until after the fire had become very large. Then he ran downstairs. While he was running across the hall, a stone column fell as a result of the fire. The stone column knocked the man to the floor and trapped one of his hands. The man tried to get up, but the stone was too heavy. One of his hands was trapped beneath; he could not turn and could not pull himself out! He tried to call for help, but no one came to help him. Eventually the fire came! What should he do? If he did not escape, he would be burned to death, and there would never be another chance to escape. He tried very hard to remove the stone, but the weighty stone was too heavy for him to move. He tried to pull his hand out by force, but the heavy stone made it impossible for him to do this. Then the fire came! If he did not run, there would be no chance! What should he do? He saw some scattered splinters of rock that had fallen off from the column next to him. With his free hand he picked out a particularly sharp piece of rock and first cut off the sleeve around the hand that was trapped. Then he began to cut his flesh. He was bleeding, and he felt much pain! But he had to save his life. He had to do this! Life was more important. What is a hand compared with life? If he did not suffer pain for a moment, he would lose the whole body because of one limb. In the end he even cut the bone of his hand with the stone. With his unhurt hand, he embraced the cut limb and ran out. Once he was outside, he fainted and fell on the ground. Then others sent him to the hospital. After a few months, his limb healed. One trapped hand took away his freedom. When he cut off the trapped hand, he was able to run for his life. He lost one hand, but he saved his life.</P><P>The fire of hell is approaching! You are now in a desperate situation. Your hands are trapped by sins. Even though only one member has sinned and your whole body has not sinned, the sins that this member committed are enough to take away the freedom of your whole body; it is enough to take away your whole life and burn you to death in the fire. The fire of hell is approaching! We are at the last five minutes. This is a once-in-a-thousand-years opportunity. In the blink of an eye, the opportunity will be gone. You should immediately run for life. Otherwise, you will perish. Why do you let your whole body go to hell just because of your sins, the sins of one member? For the sake of your whole body, you should suffer a temporary pain to remove your sins and trust in the Lord Jesus. You will then enter into life. Otherwise, I will have to speak an honest word to you: you can keep your two hands, but your whole body will be burned to death. O men destined for hell, you can spare yourselves the pain of cutting your hand. But your whole body will have to enter into hell!</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>The Third Way to Hell:<br>Pride</H2><P>Let us now read a few verses of the Scripture. In Luke 18:14, the Lord Jesus tells us about the end of a Pharisee and a tax collector. The Pharisee was a very moral man; he was very zealous for religion. The tax collector was a very immoral person and had no desire for the things of God. In this chapter of the Scripture, the Lord Jesus says that both went up to the temple to pray. The good Pharisee was not willing to humble himself and confess that he was a sinner; he was not willing to ask for God's grace. The evil tax collector knew that he had no righteousness to merit God's favor. He, therefore, confessed his sins, humbled himself before God, and prayed for God to propitiate his sins. In this verse the Lord Jesus tells us the different endings of the two men. "I tell you, This man [the tax collector] went down to his house justified rather than that one [the Pharisee]; for everyone who exalts himself shall be humbled, but he who humbles himself shall be exalted." The Lord Jesus tells us that the very moral Pharisee was not justified, while the very unlawful tax collector was justified. The meaning of justification is not only forgiveness. Forgiveness implies having sins but that such sins are forgiven. Justification, however, means that one is declared sinless. Therefore, we see a man who thought that he had no sins but who was, nevertheless, condemned by God; and we also see a man who thought that he did have sins who was declared sinless by God. Why was such a moral Pharisee condemned? And why was such an immoral tax collector justified? There is no other reason than that "everyone who exalts himself shall be humbled, but he who humbles himself shall be exalted." If we make it more plain, the meaning of justification is to go to heaven and the meaning of not being justified is to go to hell. Therefore, we see a proud person going to hell. Those who are proud will go to hell! They will certainly go to hell! Therefore, O proud ones, be careful. We have three more verses that we have to read. "The Lord will destroy the house of the proud" (Prov. 15:25). "Every one that is proud in heart is an abomination to the Lord /...he shall not be unpunished" (Prov. 16:5). "Jehovah of hosts will have a day / Over everything proud and lofty, / And over everything lifted up that it may be abased" (Isa. 2:12). These few verses tell us clearly that the proud will be judged; they will be judged on the day God judges men, and they will go to hell and suffer an eternal suffering. The Bible mentions repeatedly that the proud will go to hell. Therefore, if you want to go to hell, please be proud. By being proud, you will have a way to reach your desired destination: hell!</P><P>What is pride? The meaning of pride is to uplift yourself and put yourself in a position that you have not attained. Pride is to claim that you are more than you really are. The Lord Jesus pointed this out clearly in Luke 18. The Lord Jesus said that the Pharisee was self-exalting and proud. How was he self-exalting and proud? His morals were indeed exemplary. But he would not admit that he was a sinner before God and in His light. He was reporting his merits to God. He did not mention his weaknesses, failures, falls, and sins. He would not admit that he was a sinner. He tried to vindicate his righteousness before God. This then was his pride. He was proud because he was not willing to confess that he was a sinner, even though before God he was a sinner and not righteous. On the contrary, he hastily claimed that he was a righteous man before God. God did not interfere with his pride! He allowed the Pharisee to justify himself! God allowed him to become satisfied with himself; He did not argue with him! But God did not justify him. Rather, He let him perish and suffer in hell!</P><P>Therefore, the real meaning of pride is to be unwilling to humble yourself before God, to confess that you are a sinner, and to receive the merit of the substitutional death and the shedding of the blood of the Lord Jesus for salvation. Proud people perish, not because they are proud, but because their pride hinders them from being saved. Pride is but one sin. The Lord Jesus has died for all the sins of men. He has borne all the punishment for our sins. Pride is but one of our sins. This sin has been judged on the cross. However, if we do not remove pride, we will not believe in the Lord Jesus' death for us, and we will not receive eternal life. Proud people perish because their pride hinders them from being saved.</P><P>Unless a man confesses that he has sinned and stands on the position of a sinner, he will not receive the Lord Jesus as his Savior. I am a preacher of the gospel. Until today, I have not seen a man who will not confess his own sins but who will believe in the substitutional death of the Lord, and who is saved. In order to be saved, one has to be humble and confess that he is a sinner. I remember one time I was preaching at a place. I was preaching privately to a high school teacher one night. He asked me many questions concerning Christianity and other religions. We had a discussion for a long time. But his questions kept coming. I then told him that none of his questions were the basic question. It is not necessary to solve many problems before a man can believe in the Lord Jesus as his Savior. I told him that one thing is the most crucial of all. It is the first qualification for believing in Christ. It is confessing that one is a sinner. If you do not confess that you are a sinner, no matter how many answers you have received to difficult questions, you will not be helped to believe in Christ. If you confess that you are a sinner and feel that you are in sin, bound by sin, and fear the punishment of sin, you will surely seek a Savior. But this man was very unclear about sin; sometimes he confessed that he had sinned, and sometimes he did not feel that he had sinned. Later I told him, "If you do not know for sure that you are a sinner, you will not be able to understand the crucial doctrine of redemption in the Bible." We talked until almost midnight and there was still no result. In the end I told him one word, "Please consider your own sins some more! If you do, many of your questions will be answered." After a few days, the man indeed realized his sins and believed in the unique sin-substituting Savior, Jesus Christ. Please think more about your own sins now! If you will humble yourself to confess that you are a sinner, you will be saved. If you remain proud and do not confess, your pride will send you to hell. Therefore, if you want to go to hell, you should willfully deceive yourselves; you can be willfully proud and can willfully refuse to admit that you are sinners. You will go down to hell. In hell there is no need of humility!</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>The Fourth Way to Hell:<br>Adultery</H2><P>Let us first read a verse: "How Sodom and Gomorrah and the cities around them, who in like manner with these gave themselves over to fornication and went after different flesh, are set forth as an example, undergoing the penalty of eternal fire" (Jude 7). Here we see a group of people suffering the penalty of eternal fire. They suffered this penalty because of fornication. Those who fornicate will go to hell. This means that the penalty of eternal fire is the penalty of hell because the fire in hell burns eternally. If a man wants to go to hell, he can commit adultery. Hell does not reject adulterers for being too lewd and shameful. Hell welcomes adulterers. If you do not want to go to hell, you have to remove adultery.</P><P>How common is the sin of adultery? Today the worldly trend slides ever downward. "Moral obligations," values of honor and shame, and chastity found in bygone moral standards have gradually been broken down. One can turn to the newspaper and write down with a pen the incidents of adultery that occur within a day. Look at the public notice board in the courthouse and count how many cases of adultery there are in a month. Pornographic pictures and magazines, once banished and publicly forbidden, are now published and sold in broad daylight without interference. I do not know how many here have committed adultery. I do not know how many unmarried men and women here are still virgins. You can answer this yourselves. You know the sins that you have committed. God knows them also! Do not think that adultery is a pleasant thing. There is only one end for adulterers: hell. Do not think that this is an inconsequential thing. Let me tell you, adulterers will go to hell. Let me repeat, those who commit adultery will surely go down to hell.</P><P>The men and women who stand in the way between husbands and wives are the most detestable people on earth! Why do you have to rob another's husband and make the wife weep, mourn, and go without comfort at home? Why do you have to rob another's wife and cause her to have a different heart and be unfaithful to her own husband? Adultery has destroyed the peace in too many homes. Too many mothers, husbands, wives, and children have separated, being left with no comfort and with their hearts broken because of adultery! You who are sitting here, have you done any such thing? You should turn back today. If not, you will go to hell.</P><P>If we go on further and judge according to the Lord Jesus' definition of adultery, I am afraid that there will be few in the world who have not committed this sin. "But I say to you that every one who looks at a woman in order to lust after her has already committed adultery with her in his heart" (Matt. 5:28). Numerous people have committed adultery in their mind! Numerous people have committed adultery in their imagination and pictures in their mind! Why do you harbor a thought to sin against a chaste woman? She has nothing to do with you, so why do you have to have such filthy thoughts concerning her? You have indeed sinned against her. If she consents to your sin, nothing can be said. But if she is not an accomplice to your sin, why do you impose such filth on her? Women should not think that only men commit this sin. Why would men have adulterous thoughts when they see you? If they are punished because they have adulterous thoughts when they see you, should you not be punished for giving rise to their adulterous thoughts? If your dress, attire, attitude, and smile stir men up to have adulterous thoughts, and they are punished for their adulterous thoughts, will you, who have initiated their adulterous thoughts, be exempt from punishment?</P><P>The world is full of adultery! But do not think that this place is worse than others. No place on earth can match hell in the number of adulterous men and women! If you go to hell, you will find it full of adulterous men and women. Hell is the collective detention center for all adulterers throughout the centuries! I am a preacher, and I am not afraid of criticism. Let me speak an honest word to you. If you are an adulterous person, your end is hell. But the Lord Jesus has prepared a salvation! He has died for all our sins. All those who are willing to receive Him as the Savior will not perish, but will have eternal life. Adultery will bring you to hell. But you do not go to hell because of adultery itself. Many adulterers are saved and cannot go to hell anymore. Adultery can send you to hell, but you do not go to hell because of adultery itself. What does this mean? The Lord Jesus' death was for sins. He died for all sins, including the sin of adultery. The punishment for adultery has been borne by Him. For this reason, we cannot go to hell for the sin of adultery. In order to be saved, one has to believe in the Lord Jesus. Although He died for us, we will still perish unless we receive Him as our Savior. Although we cannot go to hell for adultery, adultery has the power to stop us from receiving the Lord Jesus as our Savior. Many people are perishing today because their love for sin and their own soul is stronger than their love for heaven, not because of the severity of their sins or the inability of the Lord to save them! They are hindered from coming to the Lord for life. Many women and men love their adulterous lovers. They are not willing to part from each other and are not willing to cut off their lewd passions. As a result they are unwilling to believe in the Lord Jesus and are bound for perdition. Let me speak an honest word. Either you declare a break with your adulterous lover to believe in the Lord and be saved, or you will go down with him or her to hell and live affectionately in hell eternally! Today two things are presented before you to choose: God's salvation or adulterous men and women. Will you choose heaven or will you choose those with whom you commit adultery? Either you cut off your lover or you will be barred from heaven. Those who want heaven must forsake their sin of adultery today. Otherwise, your sin of adultery will stop you from gaining heaven.</P><P>Once I met a very rich man. He was a renowned person in his own place and was very powerful. He was good in many things, but he was a very adulterous person. He had corrupted the chastity of at least a few dozen upper-class women. He was even a deacon in a church! After he heard the gospel and realized the reality of the coming age, he had to make a choice between eternal life and the many adulterous women. Thank God that he made the right choice that day. He cut off all ties with the adulterous women and received eternal life and the eternal blessing of heaven. My friends, I do not know your past history. I do not know what you have done privately in the past or what kind of sins you have committed. But I believe that inevitably some who have committed adultery are here. I would like you to make a choice now: is eternal life better or is adultery better? I beg you not to commit this sin anymore.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>The Fifth Way to Hell:<br>Refusing the Gospel</H2><P>The Bible also tells us of another way to hell. This way to hell is very clean; it is not as filthy as the previous ways. This way is to refuse the gospel of the Lord Jesus. Let us read two verses. "Rendering vengeance to those who do not know God and to those who do not obey the gospel of our Lord Jesus Christ. They will pay the penalty of eternal destruction from the presence of the Lord and from the glory of His strength" (2 Thes. 1:8-9). "Eternal destruction" means the suffering of being eternally in hell. This verse tells us the reason that some go to hell. Those who do not obey the gospel of the Lord Jesus Christ will go to hell!</P><P>What is the gospel of the Lord Jesus Christ? The Bible is very explicit about this. It is not the Lord Jesus coming to serve humanity. It is not His coming to teach or preach lofty ideas such as freedom, equality, and love. Neither is it His coming to be a good pattern and a great example. God tells us through the apostle that "the gospel...I delivered to you, first of all, that which also I received, that Christ died for our sins according to the Scriptures; and that He was buried, and that He has been raised on the third day according to the Scriptures" (1 Cor. 15:3-4). From this we see that the gospel of the Lord Jesus Christ is His death and resurrection. Why did He die? It was not to serve as an example. Nor was it a martyr's act or a sacrifice for His service. Rather, it was "for our sins." This is substitution. This means that even though Christ was without sin, the sinless One became sin on our behalf and stood in the place of the sinner, suffering the punishment of the sinner. All sins are committed by us; Christ has committed no sin. We are the sinners; He is not a sinner. But He, not we, suffered the punishment of the sinner and bore the sins. What is this? This is substitution. The sinless Christ died for the sinful sinner. This is substitution. This is the gospel. The gospel says that a Savior came to save sinners and suffered all the punishment for sinners; therefore, sinners do not have to suffer punishment anymore. The gospel does not exhort men to improve, reform, repent, or change for the better before they can be saved. The gospel tells men that Jesus Christ has accomplished salvation, and that sinners do not have to do anything anymore. There is no need to add any work to His perfect salvation. All that a sinner has to do is to accept the salvation God has prepared. This is all that is needed.</P><P>Jesus Christ did not just die for sinners to forgive man's sins. He also resurrected for sinners to justify sinners. This is why Romans 4:25 says, "Who was delivered for our offenses and was raised for our justification." His death is a negative work, removing the punishment for our sins so that we would no longer be condemned. His resurrection is a positive work, giving us a new position before God, justifying us, and causing God to acknowledge us as a just person. Forgiveness means that sin, although present, is forgiven. Justification means that there is no more sin. This is not just forgiveness; this is to stand on the ground where there is no need for forgiveness. We are completely justified; there is no more sin. This is what Jesus' resurrection has accomplished for us. Everyone in the world is dead; no one is resurrected, for the wages of sin is death. The Lord Jesus has also died, but He has resurrected. This shows that God has accepted His death for us and has acknowledged that He is sinless. Hence, on the one hand, we are forgiven through the death of the Lord Jesus. On the other hand, we are proven to be justified through His resurrection. Justification is based on forgiveness. First there is forgiveness, then justification. Through the death of the Lord Jesus, we are forgiven. Through the resurrection of the Lord Jesus, we receive the proof of our justification. Now everything is accomplished. Every sinner can be immediately forgiven and justified in a second by believing in the Lord Jesus as his Savior.</P><P>This is the gospel. Have you heard this? Jesus Christ has died for your sins and resurrected for you to be the surety of your justification. Have you heard this? God has now charged the whole world to obey His gospel, the gospel of grace, so that every sinner can have the opportunity to be saved. Are you willing to obey this gospel? If you want to go to hell, it is very easy! You do not have to sin, commit adultery, or be proud anymore. I can tell you that you do not have to sin anymore. While you are sitting and listening to my preaching, there is a way for you to go to hell! As long as you do not obey the gospel, you are going to hell already! Why sin anymore? It is enough, fully enough, for you to go to hell if you reject the Lord Jesus' death for you and refuse to accept Him as your Savior. Do not think that you have to commit any more sin before you are qualified to go to hell. You are qualified enough! You need do nothing more. It is enough as long as you do not listen to the gospel.</P><P>Do not think that everyone who goes to hell is laden with sins. Actually there are many religionists, moralists, philanthropists, and social reformers in hell! A man can be very moral, good, kind, and upright and still be in hell. What awaits him is death and judgment. He is there for one reason alone; he has not obeyed the gospel. No morality or religion in this world can save men. Only God's gospel of grace can save men. Rejecting this gospel is rejecting the unique way to salvation. Those who do this will surely go to hell. A man may be good, but he cannot be perfect. It is impossible for him to be without sin for a second in his lifetime. If he has sinned once, or for one second, he has to have a Savior because he will be punished for his sin. If he rejects the Savior preached to him through the gospel, he causes himself to deserve to be judged and go to hell. Do not think that you can escape hell by doing good. The only way would be for you to never sin in acts, words, and thoughts even for a second from the time you were born until you die. No matter how well you do, as long as you sin for just a second and do not obey the gospel, that very fact will qualify you for hell. Even if you have never heard the gospel before, you have at least heard it today. I advise you to accept the Lord Jesus as your Savior this very moment!</P><P>The Lord Jesus' death and resurrection has accomplished salvation. What we are preaching now is this gospel. Why is it the gospel? It is the gospel because it is possible for every sinner in the world to be saved. The Lord Jesus has died for all sinners and all the sins of the sinners have been crucified in Him. Everyone who is willing to accept Him as Savior will be spared the punishment and oppression of sin. Man's way is to work things out gradually, to do the best to improve himself, and to accumulate merit, hoping that he will be saved in the future. But this is not the glad tidings. This is actually a tiding of woe. How many people in the world can improve themselves and save merits for the future? If we are saved through our own good works, our goodness must be perfect, flawless, and spotless before we can be saved. Otherwise, our goodness becomes a sin in itself. Furthermore, if we want to be saved through our own righteousness, our righteousness must be so high that it reaches heaven before God will be satisfied. Even our own conscience would condemn us at night in a self-examination, for it would reveal that the good works were done for the self, our name, and many other improper motives within. Will not God be more displeased with them? If this is the case, how many can be saved by their own righteousness? I am afraid not even one! Can you be so righteous that God will be satisfied, not just yourself or your neighbor? If you cannot do this, it would be a tiding of woe if you are told to be saved through works of righteousness. Thank and praise God. He never asks us to do what is difficult (actually impossible). He knows us. This is why He caused His Son to die for us and to bear the punishment of all our sins. We do not have to try to be good gradually, hoping to be saved. Once we believe in Him and accept Him as our personal Savior, we receive eternal life right away. This does not mean that a person who has believed in the Lord Jesus does not need to do good. It means that we cannot be saved through doing good. Salvation is fully by God's grace (Eph. 2:8). However, after we are saved, the Lord will give us a new life, which will spontaneously do good. First we are saved and then we do good, rather than first doing good and then being saved.</P><P>Is there anyone who is oppressed by sin here? Is there anyone who trembles and fears when he considers his state after death? Does your conscience tell you that you are a sinner? Are you afraid of death and judgment? Heartbroken sinners, salvation is here today! The Lord Jesus is here to save sinners. Come to Him just as you are. He will save you. He said He would not reject any who come to Him. I only fear that you will not come. Do not fear that He will not receive you.</P><P>Now you no longer have the excuse that you have not heard the gospel. You have heard it. The only question is, will you obey it now? The gospel has presented the Savior to you and has told you the way to salvation. All you have to do is receive Him. The question now is whether or not you will. If you perish, it will not be due to the many sins you have committed. Rather, it will be due to your disobedience to the gospel. You are sick and dying. Someone has given you a bottle of medicine. The medicine will guarantee your healing. But you will not take the medicine. If you die, it will not be due to your sickness. It will be due to your refusal to take the healing medicine. It is true that you have sinned. But here is a Savior who specializes in saving sinners. If you perish now, it will be due to your refusal to accept the Savior of sinners. It will not be due to your sins! Today many are perishing and going to hell, not because they sin, but because they reject the Savior of the sinners. Therefore, do not let the Savior say to you, "You are not willing to come to Me that you may have life" (John 5:40).</P><H1 CLASS=MSG>MESSAGE EIGHT</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>THE PATHS TO HELL<br>(2)</H1><H2 CLASS=HEAD4>Issue No. 16</H2><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>FIVE MORE WAYS OF GOING TO HELL</H2><P>Last time I spoke on five ways of going to hell. The first was suicide, the second was refusing to remove sin, the third was pride, the fourth was adultery, and the fifth was disobeying the gospel. Anyone who does any of these five things, no doubt, will go to hell. Therefore, take heed and examine yourself. You should ask yourself, "Am I walking on the way to hell?" One can take any way in the world. But concerning the way that leads to destruction, I advise you to be careful and not to run on it, or you will end up in the place of eternal perdition.</P><P>I am afraid that among those who are sitting here today, there are still some whose deeds and thoughts are leading them toward hell. Therefore, I want to speak about five more ways of going to hell. If you do not want to go to hell, please do not fulfill these five requirements. However, if you wish to go to hell but do not know the way, perhaps I can clearly present a road map to hell before you so that you may follow it and go to your destination. But how dreary and miserable it is for someone to go to hell. My real intention and desire is that you would turn back and not walk on the way of destruction. Even if you intend to go to hell, even if you have decided to perish forever, I still hope that the Holy Spirit will use the word that I am going to say today to make you feel alarmed and unwilling to be a man of destruction, and make you fear the punishment of hell and be willing to turn back and no longer walk on the dangerous way that leads to destruction. I beseech you, at this moment, choose which way you want to go.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>The First Way to Hell:<br>Covetousness</H2><P>I want to read a verse from the Bible to prove that coveting after riches is one way of going to hell. What I am going to say is not something spoken lightly; this teaching is truly in the Bible. If it were just my own words, they would not be as sure and factual; but if it is mentioned in the Bible, then it must be very accurate because it is the Word of God. Now let us read the Bible. First Timothy 6:9 says, "But those who intend to be rich fall into temptation and a snare and many foolish and harmful desires, which plunge men into destruction and ruin." Listen! The end of those who covet riches is destruction and ruin. Why are they destroyed? Why do they perish? They perish not because they are sinful and wicked; but because they covet riches. Covetousness is sufficient to bring people into destruction and ruin. What is destruction and ruin? Destruction and ruin are clearly another name for hell. Therefore, please listen! Covetous men will perish; they will go to hell. This is not my word. If it were my word, then on the day of judgment, when you-if there are covetous men here-meet me, you certainly can say to me, "Mr. Preacher, you said that I would go to hell, but now I am here in heaven." Can covetous men go to heaven? You may say that covetous men can go to heaven, but do you all believe it? The Word of God says that those who covet riches will go to hell.</P><P>Today is the age of money. We often hear people saying that money is all-powerful, and that having no money is the same as having no power. If one has money, we think he can do anything. Is not money very important? Men often think that "money can move the gods." But what they call god is actually the devil. Therefore, they really mean that money can move the devil! This is true because those who covet riches eventually dwell with the devil forever. Money indeed takes one to the devil!</P><P>The Bible teaches us that covetous men will go to hell. Many people are willing, at first, to believe in the Lord Jesus. But covetousness forces them to say, "Believing in the Lord Jesus is good, but I do not have time now; let me wait until the future." Where will you wait? Eventually you will go to hell. You will wait there forever and never have another chance. Are there many sitting here who are in business? I have met many businessmen, and they have a common excuse: "I cannot be a Christian now because I am a businessman. If I avoid deception while doing business, I will not have anything to eat. Therefore, I cannot believe in Christ." Alas! How cheap is your soul! Are you willing to suffer in hell just for the sake of one meal? Very well, if you choose wealth and forsake Christ, you will indeed have food to eat. But after you have eaten, you will go to hell.</P><P>There was a man engaged in a small business. His store only had incense candles and paper money for worshipping idols. After he had heard the gospel, he said, "With a few hundred pennies a day, I can make a living. It is good to believe in the Lord Jesus and be saved, but once I believe in Him, do I need to close my store immediately?" One who believes in the Lord Jesus certainly cannot open a store that sells incense candles and paper money. For the sake of riches-actually, a few hundred pennies a day cannot be considered riches-he would not believe in the Lord. Indeed, eternal life was worth less than a few hundred pennies a day to him. Whenever I walk by the stores, it seems that every store has advertisements posted outside that say, "Great Sale, Great Auctions." What is really on sale? And what is being auctioned away? The soul of the store owner is being auctioned away. One soul has already been auctioned away for a few hundred pennies a day. Was not that soul cheap? Perhaps you would say to me, "That man was really foolish. For just a few hundred pennies a day, he would not believe in Jesus Christ and was willing to go to hell. But my business is worth tens of thousands of dollars a year. Or, my business is worth hundreds of thousands of dollars a year." While your business is bigger than his, is your soul worth only hundreds or thousands of dollars? If this is true, then your soul is also very cheap.</P><P>On November 21, 1916, there were two students in a girls' school in Peking. The last name of one was Yang and the other's was Liao. They stayed in school and cooked for themselves. In order to save money, they bought a big vat of alcohol instead of buying a small quantity. Each time after using it, they would melt wax and seal the opening. Due to their carelessness one day, a spark dropped into the alcohol and their whole house caught on fire. They both ran out of the house. Realizing that their purse was left inside the house, they ran back to get it. Consequently, the fire burned their entire bodies, and eventually they died. All the students in the school who saw their pitiful condition wept bitterly for them. On the day I read the news in the newspaper, I could not help shedding my tears with them. Why did these two die? They died because there were a few dollars in their purse. O money! O money! How many human lives you have taken! The fire of hell is approaching fast. You have the opportunity to be saved today; do not lose your soul for the sake of a little money. Many people take risks, thinking they might gain riches and, at the same time, hold on to their lives. Let me ask you: since you know this is a risk, why take it?</P><P>Once a ship hit a rock and started to sink. The owner of the ship said to the sailors, "Please get the life boat ready. I will go down below the deck to take care of a certain matter and come back right away." Why did he go down into the ship's hold? He had a great deal of money in the safe and did not want to let it sink with the ship into the sea. At that dangerous time, he still took a risk to get the money. The ship sank little by little while he was trying to get the money. The ship sank inch by inch while he was still trying to get the money. The ship sank faster than he was able to get his money, so when the sailors saw that he was not coming, they lowered the lifeboat and fled for their lives. In the end the owner did not come. He tried to leave when the water reached his feet, but it was too late and he drowned. Later, when the ship was recovered from the sea, the owner was holding the key to the safe in one hand and clutching a handful of gold coins in the other. He got the money but he lost his life and perished! Is money or life better? Covetousness sent the owner of that ship to hell; therefore, be careful, lest your covetous heart also sends you to that place of eternal suffering.</P><P>Here is similar story. Once a ship was sinking, and everyone on board the ship fled for their lives, not caring for their belongings. One sailor was reluctant to see their wealth go down in the sea. He was also reluctant to lose his life. Therefore, he put the best lifesaver around his chest and said to himself, "Now my life is safe; I can spend a little time to make an unexpected fortune." He went into the hold and searched for gold and money, and actually found a great deal. Then he took a big piece of cloth, wrapped up the gold coins and bills, tied it around his waist, and ran up to the deck. By this time the ship had almost sunk. He had no more time to lose so he jumped into the sea, hoping that he could float and wait for someone to pick him up. When he jumped into the sea, to his surprise he did not float on the water; rather, he went straight down to the bottom of the sea like a stone. Did his lifesaver lose its function? Why did he sink? He sank because the gold coins were too heavy. The lifesaver was able to save him, but not able to save him and the gold coins. I hope all of the Christians here will be attentive. Nominally speaking, you may be believers in Christ, but I do not know whether or not you have really believed. Believing in Christ and covetousness are mutually exclusive. Do not think, "I want to get rich, but I also want to believe in Christ." It is true that Christ can save you. But Christ cannot save you if you do not get rid of your desire to become rich. Christ can save sinners into heaven, but Christ cannot save sinners who take their sins with them into heaven. Either leave your sin of covetousness outside of heaven, or you and your covetous sin will be left outside of heaven.</P><P>Among those sitting here today, is there anyone who does not believe in Christ because he is hindered by money? It is true that we were covetous in the past. But Christ has died for all our sins; therefore, Christ has also borne our sin of covetousness. Although you have been a very covetous person in the past, you will surely be saved if you are willing to believe in Christ as your Savior. There is no sin in the world that is too grievous or beyond Christ's saving ability. Christ can save us from all sins, regardless of the type of sin. He died for all our sins and bore the punishment we deserve for our sins; therefore, everyone who is willing to believe in Him can be saved.</P><P>Do not be mistaken, however. Although the sin of covetousness is not the direct cause of perishing, a covetous heart is an indirect cause of perishing. What does this mean? Christ has died for us. If we believe in Christ, God cannot cause us to perish for any sin. Therefore, the sin of covetousness means nothing because it has been judged in the Lord Jesus. But what about a covetous heart? It is very powerful. It can prevent you from believing in Christ. It can make you love money more than you love your soul. It can make you seek exclusively for the wealth of the world, so that you have no heart to seek after the heavenly blessing and joy. For the sake of worldly treasure, it can make you lose the taste for spiritual living. Therefore, you will not believe in Christ because of your covetousness. If you believe in Christ, all your sins, not just covetousness, will be forgiven. Believing in Jesus Christ as your personal Savior is the only way for you to be saved. If you do not believe in Christ, regardless of how good you are, your sins will not be forgiven. Therefore, the sin of covetousness cannot cause you to perish because Christ has borne your sins. But a covetous heart can prevent you from believing in Christ and being saved. Such a heart will make you perish.</P><P>I have nothing else to say except to beseech you to ask yourself this question: Are you a covetous person? Have you not believed in Christ because of covetousness? If this is true, please investigate this matter: is money or eternal life better? Unless you are a fool, you will never choose wealth and go to hell. A covetous man will go to hell. Please be careful!</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>The Second Way to Hell:<br>Persecuting Christians</H2><P>Let us read a passage from the Bible that was spoken by the Lord Jesus Christ. "Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! For you build up the graves of the prophets and adorn the tombs of the righteous, and say, If we had been there in the days of our fathers, we would not have been partakers with them in the blood of the prophets. So then you testify against yourselves that you are the sons of those who murdered the prophets. And you, fill up the measure of your fathers! Serpents! Brood of vipers! How shall you escape the judgment of Gehenna? Therefore, behold, I send to you prophets and wise men and scribes. Some of them you will kill and crucify, and some of them you will scourge in your synagogues and persecute from city to city, so that upon you may come all the righteous blood shed on the earth" (Matt. 23:29-35).</P><P>In this portion of the Word, the Lord Jesus tells us clearly that those who persecute Christians cannot avoid the punishment of hell. You, who are Christians listening to this word, should not be happy, thinking that all those who persecute you will go to hell. You need to know what it means to be persecuted. Suffering persecution means suffering people's opposition and oppression because of your faith in the Lord Jesus and your practice of righteousness and preaching of the truth. This is the true meaning of persecution. If you suffer people's opposition because of your misconduct, then you are suffering punishment, not persecution. Please be careful; do not confuse punishment with persecution. Punishment occurs because of your sin. Persecution occurs because of your faith in the Lord Jesus. If you are opposed by people because you believe in the Lord, you have glory. If people oppose you because of a defect in your conduct, then do not consider that you are being persecuted. It is more fitting to say that you are being punished.</P><P>If there are unbelievers here, please be considerate and do not persecute Christians. If you persecute them because of their bad conduct, no one can say anything. But if you persecute or kill them because they believe in the Lord Jesus, and their conduct is not below the normal moral standard, then beware, because their God is the Lord of all who will punish sinners. In this portion of the Scripture, the Lord Jesus tells us clearly that the end for these people is hell.</P><P>Let us think about this. Should those who genuinely believe in the Lord Jesus be persecuted? They read the Bible every day in order to use the Bible to cultivate their spiritual life. They pray every day for those in authority and for all people, hoping that God will save them. They often go out and preach, exhorting people to rid themselves of their sins, thereby removing not only the sins resulting from the violation of the laws of the country, but also the sins resulting from the violation of God's law. They desire that people would know the true God and believe in the Lord Jesus as their Savior and receive eternal life. Should these people be persecuted? Is it reasonable to persecute such people? You may say that Christians are superstitious. But among four hundred million Chinese, are they the only ones who are superstitious? Perhaps they are persecuted because they frequently say that man is sinful and should rid himself of his sins, repent, and believe in the Lord Jesus. But is there any harm in this preaching? Or do you hate them because you are a sinner and they expose your sins? If you are a thoughtful person and know that you have sinned, you should quickly repent and believe in the Lord Jesus as your Savior. This is reasonable. Why do you persecute them because you are angry at your embarrassment? Many Christians often see people dying without Christ, crying out at the time of their departure from this world, in fear of the coming darkness. These people do not want to die because they are not ready to face death. Under these circumstances and according to the Bible, many Christians can tell these dying persons that, if they are willing to receive the Lord as their Savior and depend upon the Lord's merit completely, they can receive eternal life immediately because Jesus Christ has borne their sins. No one knows how many dying sinners have been comforted and saved by this kind of promise and gospel. Let me ask you, should those who help a dying sinner's conscience obtain peace be persecuted?</P><P>Of course, physically speaking, the church has done many outward works. Like yourselves, I am also against this. But there are many genuine Christians who really love the Lord and other people. No one knows how much they have secretly done to help ordinary people. They never sound the trumpet before men to announce their good deeds. Do you think that people who do charitable works without any motive for fame or profit should be persecuted? Concerning the good works of real Christians, we can say much more, but I think that this is enough.</P><P>After all, who has set you up to be a judge so that you can persecute others? Those who persecute others say that Christian morality is degraded and hypocritical; that parochial schools represent a cultural invasion; that some churches' charitable institutions bribe people's hearts; that the strategy of the churches' preaching and spiritual works is to keep people in ignorance. I will not argue with you either about the deeds and motives of Christians or whether or not your statements are true. But let me just ask one question. If you say that the morality of others is degraded, is your morality not degraded? If you say that others are hypocritical, are you without a mask? Are you really better than Christians in all of your deeds and conduct? You have to be qualified before you can persecute Christians. Unless you are better than the Christians, unless you are not guilty of committing the sins that you condemn Christians of having committed, then you are not qualified to persecute Christians. You should persecute yourself first.</P><P>After all, the persecution of Christians did not just begin today, but it started a long time ago. The church is greatly blessed because it has received much help from its opposers. Even Paul, the greatest apostle of the church, was one of the greatest persecutors of Christians. Although you may say that you are my enemy today, I do not believe this word. I really hope that one day you and I will preach the gospel together. Speaking of myself, I also greatly opposed Christianity in the past. But today I am a Christian because I have received the salvation of the Lord Jesus who has forgiven my sins. Now I have immeasurable joy and unspeakable peace. I really hope that you will receive the Savior and serve Him with me. It is very worthwhile to believe in Him and serve Him. You can clearly know that your sins have been forgiven, and then your conscience can no longer accuse you. Presently, you can work to save other people's souls; and in the future you will enjoy the blessings of eternal life. Why should you persecute Christians? Please come to believe in the Lord Jesus and be persecuted by others instead!</P><P>During the age of the church's persecution, ten believers who refused to deny their faith were escorted by a group of soldiers to the top of a high mountain so that they would suffer unbearable cold and be forced to renounce their faith. But the ten believers, who were naked in the severe cold, sang loudly together, "Ten Christian soldiers are willing to suffer for the Lord." Since they could not bear the penetrating cold, their voices became weaker and weaker. Due to the cold, one believer left the place where they were testifying for the Lord and ran to be with the soldiers sitting around a fire and tried to get warm. This was his testimony that he had renounced his faith. But at that moment, one of the soldiers took off all his clothes and gave them to the unfaithful Christian. Then he ran to the nine believers, stood with them, and sang loudly, "Ten Christian soldiers..." until he died. He became a Christian. Please be considerate. You do not know when you may also become a Christian, perhaps in a few months, a few years, or just a few hours. No one can tell. You cannot guarantee that you will not become a Christian. So why should you persecute them today? If you persecute Christians, you persecute Christ because Christ and Christians are united into one Body. When you persecute Christians, you are declaring that you do not believe in Christ as your Savior. If you do not believe in Him as your Savior, then you do not have a Savior. If you do not have a Savior, then you should bear your own sins. In other words, you will perish and go to hell because you do not have a Savior. Why should you go to hell? Please accept the Lord Jesus as your Savior today!</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>The Third Way to Hell:<br>Trampling the Precious Blood</H2><P>The Bible mentions the word "blood" more than four hundred times. Since God mentions the blood so often, we know that the blood is very important. In the Old Testament the blood of cattle and sheep was mentioned often. This blood was shed in the offering of sacrifices. This pointed to the blood of the unique sin offering in the coming New Testament. The Bible stresses the precious blood of the Lord Jesus Christ. This blood signifies the death of the Lord Jesus. When we talk about the blood of the Lord Jesus, we are speaking of the death of the Lord Jesus. The passport to heaven is the precious blood. No one can go to heaven except by the blood of the Lord Jesus. Hebrews 9:22 tells us clearly, "without shedding of blood there is no forgiveness." We have all sinned; we recognize this fact. We have sinned very much! When we search our hearts in the deep of the night, does our conscience not accuse us of being sinners? When we think about our past failures, stumblings, falls, and transgressions, is our heart not sorrowful? How much we wish that we did not have those few dark pages in our history. If we think about the coming judgment for sins, do our hearts not tremble? Sometimes we think that a future hell is just in man's imagination. But when our conscience is clear, does it not tell us that there really is a hell? When we think about this, how can we not be fearful?</P><P>Once you realize this, you will know that you cannot go on without a Savior. Even though our sins must be punished, we are unwilling to be punished. But God must punish sins. So what can we do? In this situation we need the Lord Jesus. Man is sinful, and God in His righteousness must punish our sins. Therefore, God sent His Son to the world to be a man, and in the place of sinners, He suffered the punishment that sinners deserve. Man committed the sins, yet the Lord Jesus bore the punishment of sins. This is substitution. Such a substitutionary death is the gospel. Listen! The gospel is not about persuading people to do good, using their own merit to make up for their wrongdoings in order to redeem themselves. God knows that man does not have any merit because man cannot do good. Therefore, He asked His Son to come and shed His blood for men and redeem them from their sins. Now everyone who is willing to depend upon the merit of His blood can obtain forgiveness freely and be justified.</P><P>Now let us see what the Bible says about the precious blood of the Lord Jesus. Matthew 26:28 says, "For this is My blood of the covenant, which is being poured out for many for the forgiveness of sins." Acts 20:28 says, "The church of God, which He obtained through His own blood." Romans 3:25 says, Christ Jesus "whom God set forth as a propitiation place through faith in His blood...in that in His forbearance God passed over the sins that had previously occurred." Romans 5:9 also says, "Much more then, having now been justified in His blood, we will be saved through Him from the wrath." Ephesians 1:7 says, "In whom we have redemption through His blood, the forgiveness of offenses." Ephesians 2:13 also says, "But now in Christ Jesus you who were once far off have become near in the blood of Christ." Colossians 1:20 says, "Having made peace through the blood of His cross." Hebrews 9:14 says, "How much more will the blood of Christ, who through the eternal Spirit offered Himself without blemish to God, purify our conscience from dead works to serve the living God?" Hebrews 10:19-20 also says, "Having therefore, brothers, boldness for entering the Holy of Holies in the blood of Jesus, which entrance He initiated for us as a new and living way through the veil, that is, His flesh." First Peter 1:18-19 says, "You were redeemed...with precious blood, as of a Lamb without blemish and without spot." First John 1:7 says, "The blood of Jesus His Son cleanses us from every sin." Revelation 1:5 says, "To Him who loves us and has released us from our sins by His blood." Having read these few verses, we know the reason that the Lord Jesus shed His blood; we also know the value of the blood He shed. His blood is for redemption. If there is no sin, there is no need for redemption. If there is sin, there must be redemption. In order for a person to be redeemed, however, a price must be paid. Therefore, the Lord Jesus died. He died and shed His blood. His blood can grant us forgiveness and make it possible for us to go to heaven.</P><P>Now I will talk about another way to hell. This way to hell is nothing less than trampling the precious blood. Please listen to the word of the Bible: "Anyone who has set aside the law of Moses dies without compassion on the testimony of two or three witnesses. By how much do you think he will be thought worthy of worse punishment who has trampled underfoot the Son of God and has considered the blood of the covenant by which he was sanctified a common thing and has insulted the Spirit of grace?...It is a fearful thing to fall into the hands of the living God" (Heb. 10:28-29, 31). These few verses clearly tell us that this kind of people will receive an unspeakable punishment; they will fall into the hands of the living God and be under His wrath. Of course, we know this means going to hell. The Bible tells us that if anyone offends Moses' law, he will die without mercy. Please listen. Whoever sins will die, and God will not have mercy toward them. Many people are kinder than God! They think that God would not punish sinners by sending them to hell. But the Bible says that this kind of person will die without mercy. It continues by saying that anyone who tramples underfoot the Son of God, despises His precious, redemptive blood, considering it insignificant, and rejects the moving of the Holy Spirit, will also go to hell.</P><P>What does it mean to trample underfoot the Son of God, to regard the blood of the covenant by which one was sanctified as a common thing, and to insult the Spirit of grace? It means that the Holy Spirit is gracious to man, prompting and telling him that he is sinful. The Spirit is also clearly presenting to man the salvation accomplished by the Son of God, causing him to know the effectiveness of the precious blood that forgives sins, and exhorting him to immediately accept the blood to wash away all of his sins. But some men are not willing; they reject the demands and prompting of the Holy Spirit. They still love sins and like filthiness and consider the precious blood of the Lord Jesus as something insignificant. He may say, "Listening to the gospel is good enough; but asking me to believe is putting too much emphasis on application. Yes, I have sinned but I will only commit the sins that I committed before. The Son of God loves me and gave His life for me, but why should I care about Him?" If a man says this, he will go to hell because he tramples the precious blood.</P><P>There is only one way in the world that can save man. The Lord Jesus died for sinners, shedding his precious blood to cleanse them from all sins. This blood is a guarantee before God that every sinner who believes in Him will be saved eternally. It is as if this blood speaks to God, saying that although sinners deserve to be punished, they have already been punished. Therefore, God cannot punish them anymore. All the sins committed by a sinner from his birth to his death have been punished in the Lord Jesus. The precious blood is the proof that every sinner's sins have been judged and punished. If this were not so why was the blood shed? Therefore, rejecting this blood will cause a sinner to perish eternally. A sinner's sins must be judged. The most important question is whether or not a sinner wants Christ to die for him. If he does not want this, he will have to bear his own sins. Therefore, trampling the precious blood is rejecting the substitutional death of Christ. Since he does not have Christ's substitutional death, he has to die and receive the judgment for his own sins which he deserves. Friends, you have heard about the function of the Lord Jesus' precious blood. Please do not harden your hearts; do not refuse this unique way of salvation. Do not wait until you go to hell and regretfully say, "How I hate myself that I did not accept the Lord Jesus' precious blood. Now I have to suffer here eternally." If you go to hell in the future, you will not go because of your sins, but rather because you rejected the Savior who died for your sins.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>The Fourth Way to Hell:<br>Negligence</H2><P>We have seen many ways to go to hell. All of these ways are easy because it is easy to go to hell. Here is a way that is even easier than the previous ways. We need to read one verse to see the easiest way to hell. Hebrews 2:3 says, "How shall we escape if we have neglected so great a salvation?" If we cannot escape, we will be condemned. Being condemned is to be punished; and being punished is to go to hell. Neglecting God's salvation is another way to hell. I am doing my best to preach the gospel, but you let it go in one ear and out the other. I am speaking earnestly, but you listen carelessly. You neglect. You despise. You have learned that you are a sinner. Yet still you say, "It's none of your business. There is no big difference to me whether or not I am a sinner." You heard that sinners will be punished and will go to hell, but you say, "Whether I go to hell or not, whether I am punished or not, I don't care. Why should I worry about these things in the future?" You have learned that Jesus Christ is the Savior of sinners. He died in the sinner's place and suffered the punishment reserved for them. But you say, "Who cares about Jesus? Whether He died or not, and whether He died in a sinner's place or not, this is insignificant to me. Why should I care about Him? I came here with a peaceful conscience. Why do you preachers have to speak so much to trouble my heart?" You neglect. You disdain. You do not care for anything. Neither salvation nor perdition is important to you. You live carelessly and waste your time foolishly day after day. Hell cannot frighten you, and heaven cannot inspire you. You are really a descendant of Mr. Worryless! The Bible tells you that you cannot escape if you neglect salvation. You need to take heed.</P><P>People often ask me, "What must I do to be saved?" I tell them, "Believe in the Lord Jesus, and you will be saved." When people ask me, "What must I do to perish?" My answer is, "You do not need to do anything!"</P><P>If you want to be saved, you need to believe in the Lord Jesus. Nothing more and nothing less than believing is required. Believe and you will be saved. If you want to perish, you do not have to do anything! You do not need to commit sins, blaspheme the name of Jesus Christ, curse God, do frightening things, commit fornication, be proud, reject Jesus Christ as your Savior, or disobey the gospel! You do not need to do anything: you are qualified to go to hell just as you are. If you want to go to hell, you do not need to do anything. Just a neglectful and disdainful attitude has made you fully qualified to go to hell. You have heard about so great a salvation and know that the Lord Jesus died for your sins, but you pay no attention, giving no heed to these things. It is as if your soul has traversed to some other place. Heaven and hell, salvation and perdition, eternal life and eternal death, spirit and soul, sins, Jesus Christ, His substitutional death-none of these move your heart. It is as if I am preaching to a wooden or stone statue. You ignore easily what you have heard and are totally indifferent to matters of life and death. While you think that you will not necessarily go to hell, you do not have the assurance that you are going to heaven. You live in a dream world. Since you have despised God's salvation, you cannot escape punishment. Please remember, you do not have to do anything. You do not have to commit any more sins to be qualified for perdition. You are already a man of perdition.</P><P>In Canada there is a waterfall which is the biggest in the world. People often go canoeing in the river upstream from the falls. However, they need to be very cautious in order to keep from drifting over the falls. A plummeting fall will crush both man and boat. Once there was a husky young man who was canoeing alone in the river. At one point he laid the paddle down and started to doze while the canoe drifted down the river. Since he considered himself to be very muscular, he did not anticipate any difficulty in paddling the canoe to a safe place. He assumed that his strength was mightier than the current! Soon, as his canoe had come very close to the edge of the falls, people on the shore noticed the danger that he was in. They began calling to wake him up. When he woke up, he immediately saw the danger. He started paddling with all his strength to bring the boat back to safety. Despite his great strength, however, the current was more powerful, and his canoe drew nearer and nearer to the danger zone. Finally the people on the shore devised a way to save him. They threw a very long rope toward the canoe, hoping that he would grasp the rope so that they could pull both him and the canoe back to shore. Nevertheless, even though he saw the rope, he seemed to be ignorant of the danger and death that faced him. He heedlessly continued to let his boat drift. Two or three times the people on the shore threw the rope near his boat, but he continued to neglect it even though he saw it. Passively he went to meet death. In the end both the man and canoe plunged over the falls to the depths far below, like falling over a tall cliff. Thus this young man lost his life.</P><P>Why did he lose his life? He lost his life because he despised others' deliverance. He neglected their salvation. He was callous to the saving way provided by others. In like manner you need to be careful. Do not live a careless life. Today I have presented God's salvation to you, just as if I had thrown you a rope beside you. I plead that you no longer be foolish and indifferent. For the sake of your soul, receive this salvation promptly and be saved. Why allow yourself to be thrown into hell for eternity? Men are not animals and should not be content to live just for the present age. Why do you so despise the things of the coming age? Please take heed. How can you escape punishment, if you still neglect?</P><P>Those who often hear sermons need to be especially careful. While you are studying in school, you have the opportunity every day to hear God's Word. Or you may be a nominal Christian who has heard sermons for months, years, or even decades. As such a person, you need to pay special attention because I fear that you will go to hell more readily than others. You are used to sermons and have become familiar with the gospel. Nevertheless, you have not believed in the Lord Jesus as your Savior. Since you have heard the gospel repeatedly, you have grown tired of it, saying, "There is not much to it!" Therefore, you despise the message which God has preached to you. You consider the gospel as something trite and hackneyed. You can even utter some words concerning the death of Jesus for man and His salvation for man. Nevertheless, you need to be mindful. Do not neglect God's salvation; otherwise, how will you escape punishment? You may have heard much, but have you been saved? This is a big question. No matter how much you have heard, if you continue to neglect and do not believe, you are in a dangerous position. Please do not fill your head with gospel doctrines so that you can go to hell to tell the people there of your knowledge!</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>The Fifth Way to Hell:<br>Fear of Man</H2><P>I will speak of a final way to go to hell. I know that the Holy Spirit is working among us. Many of us have already perceived the reality of the coming age and realize that we should believe in the Lord Jesus to avoid God's punishment and wrath. But there is another danger which we all need to pay attention to. We have known that we should have our sins purged, forsake the companions of fornication, believe in the death of the Lord Jesus for us, and confess Him as our Savior. But there is another big hindrance keeping us from having our sins purged and confessing Christ as our Savior. What is this hindrance? It is the fear of man. Many of you are standing on the border line of believing in the Lord. Just another step will make you believers in the Lord. However, you dare not believe or confess because you are afraid that other people might scorn you or rise up against you. Therefore, we need to read two verses to help you overcome the fear of man.</P><P>Proverbs 29:25 says, "The fear of man bringeth a snare." Revelation 21:8 says, "But the cowardly...their part will be in the lake which burns with fire and brimstone, which is the second death."</P><P>Those who fear men are those who are cowardly. What will be their destiny? They will fall into the snare of the devil and be bound by him. They dare not believe in the Lord Jesus or confess themselves to be Christians before others. Eventually, they will all be thrown into the lake of fire-hell-together with the devil. The works of the devil give people this fear of man. Through a fearful heart, the devil keeps his prisoners. He puts this fearful heart inside of man so that man will never dare to leave his domain. In this way man becomes his servant forever. The devil cannot reason with man because many times, even if he tried, the reasons would not be convincing. Man often realizes that it is foolish to serve Satan. He realizes that there is no real joy in living in sins. Even if the flesh enjoys temporal pleasure, the conscience is always under prolonged condemnation. He realizes his degradation in humanity and corruption in morality. When he considers his life after death, he senses even more darkness. When pondering his future judgment, he trembles with fear. No matter how much he tries to free himself and rid himself of the bothersome problem of hell, the existence of hell is deeply rooted in man's life. He can neither wash away the thoughts nor drive them out. Sometimes he may be happy because he can successfully argue in theory that hell does not exist. Nevertheless, when he searches his heart at midnight, when he is weak physically, or when he is sick unto death, his conscience still tells him deep within that there probably is a hell and that he cannot escape! Do you think man does not know that serving Satan and committing sins will lead him to the place of eternal punishment? After hearing the gospel of the Lord Jesus' death for man, do you think he does not know that he should receive Christ as his Savior and confess His name before men to escape the future punishment and present oppression of sins? Even Satan knows that he cannot reason with man concerning these matters. When it comes to matters of his own gain or loss, man knows which side is more reasonable. Nevertheless, Satan is very crafty. He knows that he cannot prevail in doctrine so he adopts other means to keep man as his prisoner. Even though he fails in many ways, he is still able to do one thing.</P><P>He speaks to those whose hearts have been touched, saying, "Believing in the Lord Jesus is good, but are you unafraid of men's opposition? You are a wife, and your husband dislikes religion. Are you unafraid of his opposition? He often commits sins. If you do not go along with your husband, will he not scorn you? You will probably be rejected the first time you mention such a matter. Are you unafraid of him?"</P><P>Maybe in your family you are a son, and your parents, grandparents, and other adults such as your uncles, etc., are all adherents of Confucianism. They all greatly oppose Christ. If they learn that you have believed in Christ, they will either be infuriated or persecute you fiercely and greatly affect your future. Or they will scorn you, saying, "Someone like you wants to be religious?" Satan shows you the dark side of your family to make you afraid and to stop you from confessing the Lord Jesus as your Savior.</P><P>Maybe you are a student, and many in your school do not believe in Christ. They always chide, mock, and despise those who believe in Christ. Whenever you think about this, Satan will say to you, "Consider this: if you tell them that you have believed in Christ, they will probably give you the same treatment as they have given to the other Christians. Can you bear this? If you were also a despiser and mocker of believers of Christ, it will be even more embarrassing! You used to mock others and now you too are a Christian! The one who mocked others will now be mocked! How can you bear this?" Satan makes you afraid to receive Christ as your Savior.</P><P>Maybe you have a friend who strongly dislikes people who believe in the Lord Jesus. Maybe you have a fianc&#233; who is strongly against Christ and even very worldly and cold toward Christ. If they hear that you have believed in the Lord Jesus, they will stand against you. Perhaps you may even lose their favor. Satan presents all these pictures to you to make you so afraid of your dear friends that you dare not confess the Lord as your Savior.</P><P>Satan might say to you, "If you have decided to believe in the Lord Jesus as your Savior, I have no way to stop you. However, why do you have to confess the Lord Jesus as your Savior before men? This will cause too much turmoil. Why not just believe stealthily and be a secret Christian? If you do this, you can believe in the Lord Jesus and no one will mock you. Will this not serve both purposes?" But, the Bible says, "For with the heart there is believing unto righteousness, and with the mouth there is confession unto salvation" (Rom. 10:10). If we want to be a Christian, we must confess Christ as our Savior before men. We cannot be a secret Christian.</P><P>Sinning is indeed a shameful thing; but what is the shame for one to believe in Christ and be rid of his sins? It is truly a shame to be a slave of the devil and do the things of darkness. What is the shame to be a child of the heavenly Father and put on the garment of light? If it is right to believe in Christ, then we ought to believe. If it is right to confess Christ, then we ought to confess. How can we not believe in the One we ought to believe in and not confess the One we ought to confess just because of our fear of men? We should not be cowardly. We should not be afraid to testify that Christ is our Savior just because many people, ones both familiar and new to us, are here. If you truly love your household, you should be the pioneer in believing in the Lord Jesus so that they might also have the opportunity to believe in Christ. If you hide yourself and refuse to be an open testimony, how long will they have to wait until another member of your household chooses to be a pioneer and leads them to believe?</P><P>I remember a story of a bookseller who went to the countryside to sell Bibles. When he went into a house, he would speak some of the stories in the Bible to the people in the house. The mother of one family bought a New Testament. She paid for it with money she had earned through her own labors. She took this New Testament and kept it in her house so that she could read whenever she had some spare time. Later her husband came home. He was a foreman. He was often drunk and in poor conduct. When he saw the new book in the house, he asked his wife, "Where did this new book come from?" After hearing the answer from his wife, he was greatly infuriated because he thought his wife had wasted useful money on a useless book. His wife responded, "Not every penny in this household belongs to you. As your wife, at least half should be mine." Her husband then said, "Well, in that case, half of the book is mine." So he tore the book in half and kept it in his pocket. Then he angrily went back to his work. Soon, he was dispatched to work in a remote mountain area, and he was depressed. He remembered the book in his pocket, took it out, and started to read. He had taken the first half of the New Testament. He started to read from Matthew 1 and continued chapter after chapter. Finally he came to Luke 15 and read the story of the prodigal son. He saw how pleasant the prodigal son's original condition had been. Then he saw how the son left home, sinned, suffered, repented, and finally decided to come back home. He read the story with great interest. But just at this place, the book was torn in two. The last sentence in the final page was the first half of verse 20: "And he rose up and came to his own father." There was nothing after this! He wanted to know the end of the story. He did not know whether or not the father accepted the son. He wanted to know how the son's story ended, but he was afraid to ask his wife for the second half of the book. He was afraid that she would scorn him. At the same time his wife was reading this story at home. She knew that there was a father with a loving heart toward his prodigal son. But why did the son leave? What happened to him? Why did he finally come back home? She knew none of the answers. She wanted to ask her husband for the first half of the book but she was afraid that her husband might reject her. Each of them was afraid of the other. He dared not ask her, and she dared not ask him. Daily they saw each other, but neither dared to speak the words within them. Finally her husband could not stand it any longer and he asked his wife, "What is the conclusion of the story about the prodigal son?" Immediately his wife asked him, "How does the story of the prodigal son begin?" After their discussion the Holy Spirit opened their eyes, and they saw that they too were prodigal sons. They had spent all that they had and were afflicted by their sins. Therefore, they needed to quickly come back to the father's house. The couple, with tears in their eyes, then knelt down before God, confessed their sins, and received the salvation which God had prepared in the Lord Jesus.</P><P>Are not many of your fears vain fears? God is working in your heart. How do you know that he is not also working in the hearts of your family? I know of many stories where both the husband and wife decided to believe in the Lord Jesus, but neither one had the courage to speak to the other about their faith in the Lord. Later when they did speak to each other, they found that their spouse had been waiting to approve them. Even if the other side does not approve, the Lord Jesus has died for you. He has suffered immeasurable pain for you and borne your sins so that you might receive eternal life. At the very least, you have a duty to confess Him before men!</P><P>I think all of us have heard the story about an ungrateful daughter. Over ten years ago, there was a family that was quite rich. The family consisted only of a mother and her daughter. One day while the daughter was still a baby, there was a fire in the house. The mother was outside, helplessly watching the house burn down. All her wealth turned to ashes. Suddenly she remembered that her daughter was sleeping upstairs. Because of her love for the daughter, she rushed into the house in spite of the fierce fire and threw her out safely. The daughter was unharmed but the mother's hair was scorched and her whole body seriously burned. She was bedridden for several months because of her injuries. She lost all of her former attractiveness and her wealth. She was forced to do menial work, washing clothes and embroidering, to support herself and her daughter. Eventually, however, she was able to send her daughter to school. Even though she was poor, she adorned her daughter with new clothes. One day when she was going to the place where she washed clothes, she met her daughter walking with her classmates. She called to her daughter and talked to her. Then the daughter and her classmates started to walk away. While the mother was standing there watching her daughter's back with pride, the friends asked her daughter, "Who is that woman you talked to?" Just imagine. How could a dignified student admit that a woman with shabby clothing, a bald head, a scar-filled face, and clothes in her hands to be washed was her mother? Would she be ridiculed by others if she admitted it? She replied, "She is my housemaid." But her mother heard this word! She could no longer continue to wash clothes. She went home, laid down on her bed, and became very sick. Later when her daughter came home, no matter how the daughter tried to comfort her mother, the mother's heart had been broken, and she could not be comforted. Who can comfort a broken heart? She remained sorrowful until she eventually died.</P><P>Do you know that the Lord Jesus died for you? If not for the purpose of saving us, why did He need to be born and to be called illegitimate by others? Why did He experience indescribable sufferings in the world? Why was he accused of being demon-possessed? Why was His sweat like drops of blood? As the Son of God, why was He judged by man? Why was He mocked, struck, and slapped, suffering unspeakable humiliations at the hands of men? If not for sinners like you and me, why did He wear a thorny crown, and why was he nailed to the cross to die? What men now attack and mock is the truth of Christ's redemption by the blood and the truth of His death for us on the cross. If not for the purpose of saving us, why on the one hand was He crucified on the cross and shed His blood, and why on the other hand was He despised and scorned by others? Was He not full of wisdom and able to speak on matters of ethics, philosophy, and principles of morality like no one else? If He had chosen to speak such things He would have been a most welcome person. Why was He unwilling to be welcomed, but willing to suffer and be humiliated to the point of death? If not for the purpose of saving us, He gave up His life in vain. Truly there is no reason, except for the reason of saving you and me. Therefore, He condescended to a lowly state and bore the pain that no one else in the world has ever suffered for the sake of saving you and me.</P><P>Today, regardless of your philosophy, you take pride in declaring it. But if you say that you confess the Lord Jesus as the Savior, you will see that others will despise you. It seems that the name of Jesus is inseparable from humiliation. Confessing the Lord Jesus is not an easy matter. Yet how can we hardheartedly deny the One who died for us in order to temporarily save our face? He humbled Himself to such an extent. How can we hardheartedly refuse to testify of Him as our Benefactor because we want to keep our temporary glory? How hardhearted are we? We detest the ungrateful daughter, but we should not forget ourselves. Yet, human feelings often tell us that it is all right for us to deny Christ.</P><P>The devil sees that he has failed. But in the matter of keeping people in fear, he often triumphs. I do not know how many people just like you have perished. They knew that they should believe in and confess the Lord Jesus as their Savior. However, they did not dare believe and confess because of the fear of men. They have perished and left the world. They went to hell because of their cowardice. Why should you make the same mistake? The dead are dead already, but we should be careful. How contemptible is a timid person who knows that he should do the things of righteousness but does not move because of timidness. Is this not contemptible? We despise cowardly people. When it comes to believing in Jesus, we should not be cowards and eventually find ourselves in perdition. Now is there anyone who would like to believe in the Lord Jesus as your Savior? If there are some, please stand up and be a testimony before all men.</P><H1 CLASS=MSG>MESSAGE NINE</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>THE PATHS TO HELL<br>(3)</H1><H2 CLASS=HEAD4>Issue No. 19</H2><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>ANOTHER FIVE WAYS TO GO TO HELL</H2><P>I have previously mentioned ten ways to go to hell. Now we want to examine in the Bible five more ways to go to hell. My friends, this is indeed a solemn subject. This is a question concerning man's life and death. The salvation or perdition of a sinner is determined by his attitude towards these questions. I do not believe that there is a man on earth who wants to go to hell. People do not want to go to hell. Whenever the subject of hell is discussed, they turn pale and become afraid of what will happen in hell. Nevertheless, many are subconsciously walking on the way of hell. In their hearts they do not want to go to hell. But with their feet they are taking the way of hell. In the end when they arrive at the place where their feet have been walking all their life, they will have much regret. Hence, the most important question for us and the one that we all have to take heed of is how can we not go to hell. But first we must know the ways to go to hell so we can know how to avoid them. I hope that all those sitting here are seekers of the truth, and I hope that no one here is uninterested and unconcerned about the destination of their soul. Even if some are unfortunately indifferent toward the question of eternal life and death in the future and are very careless in your walk, I hope you will be awakened to turn, seek, and receive eternal life through hearing God's gospel.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>The First Way to Hell:<br>Lying</H2><P>I have one verse, and the word here is very solemn. "All the false, their part will be in the lake which burns with fire and brimstone, which is the second death" (Rev. 21:8). The Bible mentions hell many times. If there is no hell, there is no God because if God does not punish the world, then He is not God. Without hell, there would be no need for the Lord Jesus because everyone would be able to go to heaven, and there would be no need for Him to come to be our Savior. Without hell, there would be no need for the gospel because everyone would be saved, and there would be no need for a gospel to save sinners. Without hell, there would be no need for preachers because without the fearful punishment of hell there would be no need to preach. Alas, hell is real, and all the sinful sinners will go there. For this reason sinners should hear the gospel and believe in the gospel. This is why I have to preach the gospel to you today.</P><P>The verse that we just read tells us that in the future there will be a lake of fire and brimstone. This will be the second death. Please notice that what we fear the most is death. But the Bible says that there is not just one death but two. The death of the flesh is not the end. In the future there will be a second death. In the second death our whole being will be cast eternally into the lake of fire and brimstone and will suffer punishment and pain for our sins. Hell in the Bible refers to the lake of fire and brimstone. The Bible mentions the teaching of hell many times, specifically telling us the kind of people who will go to hell.</P><P>This verse says that people who lie will go to hell. Many people consider lying an ordinary sin and one which is not important. I am a native of Foochow. In Foochow we have a busy bridge called "the Great Bridge." Countless numbers of people pass over this bridge everyday. The people of Foochow have a saying: "Three days without lying and the Great Bridge would be without pedestrians." How common is lying! We do not follow the Bible teaching of having our yes be yes and our no, no (James 5:12). Instead we change our words back and forth, gossip, and criticize. We think that it is a very little matter for us to lie. But the Bible says that those who lie will go to hell. Therefore, those who are sitting here should be careful. Please examine yourselves if you have lied. You will go to hell if you have!</P><P>How common is lying! For many people, two or three out of every ten sentences are lies. It seems impossible for them to start off any sentence with the truth. I remember that we had a very honest person in our house. He never lied. Whatever was yes he said yes and whatever was no he said no. He was forthright and honest. Others, however, did not value his honesty; they thought that he was foolish. There is a common saying that being honest is foolish indeed. Yes, in this sinful world, people do not know about honesty. If you want to be honest, others will say that you are a foolish cow. How pitiful that the world considers honesty foolishness! Yet this is the level of their moral standards. What else can we say?</P><P>Many people, in an attempt to earn a reputation for themselves of being clever and smart, use many deceitful words to cheat others. They may indeed earn a name of being clever and smart. But are they really clever and smart? This is only deceitfulness and craftiness. Most of the people in the world who are clever and smart are actually deceitful and crafty. Moreover, the world realizes that the so-called clever and smart ones are actually deceitful and crafty. They know. They may know better than we do. But they still call these ones clever and smart. Why is this? They accept this lie because they are also used to lying. To someone who lies, a deceitful and crafty person is clever and smart. Oh, how the world excels in lying!</P><P>The present world can be said to be a lying world. Everyone lies to each other. How many are honest? In the family, even between parents, brothers, and sisters, there is much lying. Lying is common even between husbands and wives. In the school there is much lying between teachers and students. Lying reaches its peak in government circles. Indeed, one has to lie. Why? Without lying, one may lose his position and even his office.</P><P>Lying is even more commonplace in business circles. Many business people have told me that if they do not lie, they will have no way to make money. If they want to be honest, their only choice is to close their doors and terminate their business. They think that lying is the guiding principle in business and that without lying, their business will close down immediately. I remember a story. A fabric store was once visited by a man from the country. After the man examined many kinds of fabric, he still was not satisfied. In the end the shopkeeper took one of the previously examined rolls back into his shop and wrapped it with high-quality colored paper. He then presented it to the customer, saying, "This is the best fabric we have in this shop. I just took it out from my warehouse." The country man believed his word and bought it. If one does not lie, he cannot run a business. Several days ago I read in the newspaper of two British Christians who refused to put false labels on their goods. They were terminated by their employers. If one will not lie in this world, he will lose his position.</P><P>Perhaps some who are sitting here will say that they are not in business and have not lied in this way before. You may not have not lied in this way, but have you exaggerated and said more than the truth in your conversations? This is lying. Have you made something big out of something small? This is lying. Have you uplifted yourselves with lies because of a love for vainglory? Have you said vague words in an attempt to avoid difficulties and misunderstandings? This is also lying. Many people, when confronted with difficulties, deceive others with untrue words in order to avoid facing sufferings. Alas, we think that we are honest people only because we have not examined ourselves. If you do not believe me, go home and write down all the lies you said throughout the day in a little notebook. Please remember that anything you said other than yes to what should be yes and no to what should be no are lies. You should write down in your notebook everything other than these yes and no statements. Then you will find out how good you are at lying!</P><P>Let me point out the biggest lie in the whole world. Do you know what the biggest lie in the whole world is? Please listen to 1 John 1:8, "If we say that we do not have sin, we are deceiving ourselves." Here we see a very important verse. It points out man's biggest lie. Our lies are meant to deceive others. They are not meant to deceive ourselves. We do not like to deceive ourselves. We think that it is all right to deceive others because they are the ones who are cheated and suffer. We are very unwilling to deceive ourselves because we will suffer. But subconsciously there are many who deceive themselves. This verse tells us how a man can deceive himself.</P><P>All those who say that they are without sin deceive themselves. They are telling the biggest lie. We have said that those who lie will go to hell and perish. The words of the Scripture will not fail. It may be all right for you to have told any kind of lie before. But if you say what is said in this verse, I feel uneasy for you. No lie in the world can compare to this lie. Those who speak other lies may still have the hope of being rid of their sins and being saved. But those who lie by saying that they have not sinned will surely be lost and go to hell; they are beyond hope. When they lie in this way, they reject God's salvation and forbid the coming of the Lord's grace which makes it possible for them to be saved.</P><P>Today many people say that they are without sin. They think that they are moralists, religionists, and the best people on the earth. They think that they do everything according to their conscience. Since they think they are good, they say that they do not have sin. Preachers are the most unwelcomed because every time we open our mouths we show others that they have sinned. This is man's open wound. If you touch it a little, they will feel unbearable pain. Many people say, "What sin do I have? Where are my sins?" This is truly self-deception. Please remember I am not the one who says that you are deceiving yourselves. The Bible says this. All those who say that they do not have sin deceive themselves. How foolish is this! What profit is there for one to deceive himself? If you are saved and spared from hell, you will receive the profit; the one who helps you to be saved receives nothing. Why do you need to deceive yourselves? Why do you have to lie and say that you have no sin, making it impossible for you to be saved and liable to go to hell to suffer eternal torment and loss? Has not your conscience told you even once that you are a sinner? When you examine yourself in the quiet of the night, have you not realized that you have sinned? While you are in torment in the deepest part of your being, are you not aware of the problem of sin and the way to a solution? While you are alone and quiet, have you not thought of the punishment of hell? Have you ever asked where you came from and where you are going? I believe your conscience cannot be fooled to that extent. Man's conscience tells him his real condition. I am afraid that you are deceiving and cheating yourselves with your own lies by saying that you have no sin, that your sins are common sins of no significance, that there may not be a judgment after death, and that when man dies everything is over and there is no more judgment. You comfort yourselves with these words and think that, even though you have sinned, it is all right and you will not perish. Or you may think that you have no sin and will not come under any judgment. Actually, this is not self-consolation, but self-deception.</P><P>Why do liars go to hell? Let me tell you something. No matter what lies someone has told in the past or is telling in the present, he can have the chance to be saved because the Lord Jesus has died for all his sins. The sin of lying has been judged in the Lord Jesus. Anyone can be saved. Those who lie by saying that they have no sin, however, will go into eternal perdition. They will go to hell, and there will be no chance for them to be saved.</P><P>Why is this so? A man who lies that he has no sin is saying that he does not need a Savior for his sins. Since he has no sin, why does he need to trust in the Savior to be saved? If he has no sin, he will not suffer the punishment of sin. If he will not suffer the punishment of sin, he will not need a Savior to assume the punishment of his sin. However, if he has sin, he needs a Savior or he will go into perdition. On the one hand, he thinks that he is without sin and has no need of a Savior. On the other hand, he definitely has sin and needs a Savior. What then will be his end? It will be perdition. There is no other choice besides hell for him. Therefore, whatever lies you have told, you can still be saved through the merit accomplished by the Lord Jesus on the cross. But if you lie saying that you have no sin, there is no other choice for you except hell. All who have not believed in the substitutional death of the Lord Jesus will perish and all those who have believed in the substitutional death of the Lord Jesus will be saved. Those who lie will perish. But if a liar believes in the Lord Jesus, he will be saved. Those who lie saying that they have not sinned will perish. Unless a man first removes the sin of lying about his sinlessness, it will be impossible for him to be saved. Only those who really know that they have sinned will believe in the Lord Jesus, and only those who believe in the Lord Jesus will be saved. Therefore, those who lie and think that they have no sin will never be saved.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>The Second Way to Hell:<br>Making Excuses</H2><P>There are two kinds of excuses, one unintentional and the other intentional. Unintentional excuses are made when someone thinks that something is not important. His heart is not in the matter, and he makes some excuses to shuffle the matter away. Intentional excuses are made when someone knows that a matter is crucial. Yet he makes excuses to get away from it because he is unwilling to face it. Unintentional excuses are the result of ignorance; one excuses himself because he does not know the importance of the matter at hand. Such ignorance can be removed. If someone explains the importance of a matter and he still does not care, taking an indifferent attitude or making excuses, he errs in his mind. Intentional excuses are the result of unwillingness in the heart; one knows that a matter is important, yet he makes excuses and declines to take the proper action because of his unwillingness. This is senseless. How senseless it is when, despite knowing that something ought to be done, one refuses to do it simply because he does not want to do it.</P><P>If there is anyone here who declines to believe in Christ as his Savior, he is either making unintentional or intentional excuses. If you do not know the importance of this matter, you should listen to what I am saying in order to realize its importance. Please do not make excuses. Please seek after the truth with an open attitude. Do not hold onto any prejudice. Do not think that the future is not an important issue and that you can, therefore, reject these words easily. If you know that it is important to believe in the Lord Jesus and be saved, then your excuses are intentional if you reject these words through your unwilling heart, fear of men, or dislike of men's mocking. How unreasonable is such an excuse! Many people come to our preaching with a prejudice in them already. They think that they are just coming to listen and will never believe. When others persuade them to believe, they make many excuses. Let me tell you something: your real difficulty is not your excuses but your prejudice. If you do not have any prejudice, you will see that your excuses are without reason and that you do not have any problem.</P><P>Now we have to read the Bible and consider what the Bible says concerning this matter. Luke 14:15-24 tells a parable. It says that a man set up a feast and invited many guests to come. "And he sent his slave at the dinner hour to say to those who had been invited, Come, for all things are now ready. And they all with one consent began to make excuses. The first said to him, I have bought a piece of land, and I need to go out and see it. I ask you, have me excused. And another said, I have bought five yoke of oxen, and I am going to prove them. I ask you, have me excused. And another said, I have married a wife, and because of this I cannot come" (vv. 17-20). All these made excuses and would not go. This parable was given by the Lord Jesus. It tells us that God has prepared a gospel feast for the world to enjoy. Man does not have to pay any price; he only needs to believe and come. Yet he makes excuses. In Matthew 22:7 the Lord Jesus points out the end of the ones who excused themselves: "And the king became angry...and destroyed those...." Those who do not receive God's grace, refusing with unreasonable excuses, will end in nothing other than perdition and hell. Just imagine: God has prepared grace for man and made it possible for man to be saved. All that man needs to do is believe and receive this grace. Yet man uses many unreasonable excuses to refuse God's grace. Is there any end for them other than perdition?</P><P>Many do know that it is important to believe in the Lord Jesus now. They know that they have sinned and that their own sin will bring them to perdition. They know that the Lord Jesus has died for them and that they will be saved if they will receive with faith the merit of the Lord Jesus' death. But due to an unwillingness of heart, they devise many false excuses to reject the Lord Jesus as their Savior. There may be many reasons for such unwillingness. But in reality it is simply unwillingness. All these excuses are due merely to unwillingness. Oh, how foolish this is! If it is right for one to believe, he ought to believe. If it is not right to believe, he should not believe. How senseless it is to know that you ought to believe and yet refuse to do so because there are other loves in your heart! How foolish it is to know that a medicine will heal you and yet decline it because you dislike the medicine and then die instead!</P><P>When many people hear the gospel, they excuse themselves by saying that they are too busy, that they do not have the time to believe in the Lord Jesus. It is unreasonable to excuse themselves this way. First, even though it takes time to believe in the Lord Jesus, not much time is required. Second, if a matter is important, one should lay down secondary matters to take care of the more important one, even though there is not much time. If you think that the salvation of your soul is important, you should set aside the time to believe even if you do not have the time. There is no reason for making such excuses.</P><P>Some are afraid that they may not succeed. They are afraid that they may become a laughingstock to others and that this is much worse than not doing anything at all. But why do you ignore God's promise? God told us, "He who has begun in you a good work will complete it until the day of Christ Jesus" (Phil. 1:6). If God has helped you and enabled you to believe and if it is God who has begun in you this good work, He will surely complete it. What else do you have to fear?</P><P>Some excuse themselves by saying that they do not understand this doctrine. But the Bible tells us that first we believe, then we understand. Since some do not understand many teachings in Christianity, they wonder how they can believe in the Lord Jesus as their Savior. This excuse is also without a good reason. I only need to ask you one thing: do you know that you are a sinner? Do you know that your sins deserve punishment and that the Lord Jesus has borne this punishment for you? If you know this, you should believe in the Lord Jesus; there is no reason for you to excuse yourselves. You may not understand other doctrines. But if you are unwilling to enter the door, how can you see the scene within the house? There are many mysterious things in the Bible. Although they cannot be explained by words, the Lord will help a man to experience them and will remove any doubt about them after he has believed in the Lord. Take the illustration of an elementary school student going to school. He tells his parents that he has never learned anything in the school and therefore does not want to go to school. Knowledgeable parents will tell him that they are sending him to the school precisely because he does not know. If he knows already, there is no need to send him to school. You have to believe in the Lord Jesus because you do not understand. If you understood, why would you have to believe? Those who do not read a book do not understand the book. In the same way, if you do not believe in the Lord Jesus, you will not understand the mysteries in the Bible.</P><P>Some have excused themselves by saying that there are many bad people in the church whose behavior is worse than their own, even though they are unbelievers. Why then, they ask, do they have to believe in the Lord Jesus? I admit that in the so-called church today there are many whose conduct is indeed bad. But we should not give up eating just because our throat feels uncomfortable. These people come to the church because of tradition. Many others come with other motives. These should not be considered as believers in the Lord Jesus. They have merely "joined a religion." When a student learns calligraphy by copying some writing and does not copy well, we cannot blame it on the original writing. Even though some who have learned of the Lord Jesus have failures, we cannot say that the Lord Jesus is not worthy of our belief. If you say this, let me advise you: if you do not choose to believe in the Lord Jesus, I have nothing more to say, but if you choose to believe in Him, do not be the kind of Christian mentioned above; otherwise, you will stumble others!</P><P>Strictly speaking, all excuses are unreasonable. I can mention many kinds of excuses; but one thing is sure: there is no reason for any excuse. Why? Since it is called an "excuse," it is surely without a reason. Since it is called an "excuse," you know that even though something is required, you are using an excuse to keep from doing it. Some say that their excuses are good. No matter how good the excuse appears to be, as long as it is used as an excuse it is an excuse, and as long as it is an excuse, there are untruth, falsehood, and other motives behind it. There is no reason for any excuse. Therefore, please do not make any excuses.</P><P>Many times gospel preachers persuade others to believe in the cross of the Lord Jesus for their salvation. But some people still do not want to believe. As I am standing here today, I think of the people to whom I have preached the gospel and who have declined me. Where are they now? Some have died and entered eternity. They are now suffering in Hades. They regret the fact that they rejected so lightly and refused to accept the Lord Jesus as their Savior. Now they are suffering the punishment of their rejection. Many others are still alive. What are they doing now? Not only are they short of the standard of God's holiness and glory, they cannot even come up to the standard of the worldly morality. They are fallen; their humanity is now in ruin. Would they have degraded to such a state if they had received the Lord Jesus as their Savior? Those who make excuses will go to hell because the Lord Jesus has no way to save those who make excuses. Let me speak an honest word to you. Suppose you make an excuse now and do not accept Christ as your Savior; you may not have any regrets even while you are alive, and you may not have any regrets when you are about to die, but you will have regrets after you die and enter eternity. Why wait until later to regret? Is it not far better to believe in the Lord Jesus today?</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>The Third Way to Hell:<br>Being Nominal</H2><P>Many who are sitting here are Christians. Many are even preachers and pastors. We have to be careful not to think that only people outside the church will go to hell. I am afraid that there are many in the church who will go to hell! The people inside Sodom and Gomorrah were burned by brimstone and fire. Yet outside the city, Lot's wife also lost her life on the plain. It is most pitiful that many who have come into the church are only nominal. They have not genuinely believed in the substitutional death of the Lord Jesus; they are not yet saved and do not have eternal life. They are only church members nominally and are not real Christians.</P><P>We can read a few verses now. These words are spoken by the Lord Jesus Himself. "Not every one who says to Me, Lord, Lord, will enter into the kingdom of the heavens, but he who does the will of My Father who is in the heavens. Many will say to Me in that day, Lord, Lord, was it not in Your name that we prophesied, and in Your name cast out demons, and in Your name did many works of power? And then I will declare to them: I never knew you. Depart from Me, you workers of lawlessness" (Matt. 7:21-23). In this passage of the Scripture, our Lord Jesus describes the situation at the time of the coming judgment. There will be many Christians-not only Christians, but many preachers and miracle workers-who will be driven away by the Lord. They will marvel and wonder why people like them will not be able to go into the kingdom of the heavens. But the Lord Jesus will tell them, "I never knew you." For this reason, my Christian friends, be careful. Do not have the thought that because you are a Christian, however nominally, that your portion will be different from that of the heathens. Let me tell you: this thought is something in your imagination only. It is not in the Bible.</P><P>Many Christians sing hymns along with others, saying, "Lord, Lord." They think that singing this way will secure the question of their salvation. But the Lord said that those who say, "Lord, Lord," with their mouth only will not enter the kingdom of the heavens.</P><P>Many may think they can pray. After everyone prays, they will say, "Amen." They even say, "Lord, Lord," and call on the Lord. They may think that they are saved. But the Lord said that not everyone who says, "Lord, Lord," will enter into the kingdom of the heavens.</P><P>Many people preach the Word and call themselves servants of the Lord. They preach to others once a week and labor in many works. When they preach, they speak concerning the Lord. We may think that such people are more advanced than ordinary believers and are probably saved. But the Lord said that some who call Him "Lord, Lord" will not enter the kingdom of the heavens.</P><P>Some people are not just nominal church members. Sometimes they may possess supernatural powers that enable them to cast out demons and perform miracles. They may think that they will surely enter the kingdom of the heavens. Little do they realize that they may say, "Lord, Lord," with their mouths, cast out demons, and perform miracles in His name, but still not enter the kingdom of the heavens.</P><P>Therefore my friends, ladies and gentlemen, those who are sitting here, please be careful. Do not think that you are saved just because you are a member of a church, can pray and sing, always come to the services, always offer money, and even occasionally exhort others to join the church. Please do not be so assured! Not every one who behaves as a Christian outwardly will be saved. Many in the church will end up in the same hell as the pleasure-seeking men and women in the prostitution houses, cinemas, and amusement places!</P><P>According to the Lord's word, what kind of people will enter into the kingdom of the heavens? He said it will be "he who does the will of My Father who is in the heavens." What is God's will? Listen to this verse: "Who desires all men to be saved and come to the full knowledge of the truth" (1 Tim. 2:4). The initial will of God is for one to be saved. The way to be saved is not by singing, praying, preaching, or giving. Please note that I am not saying that you should not sing, pray, preach, or give. Every Christian should at least do this. However, these things will not save you. Please note that salvation does not come from singing, praying, preaching, or giving. How then can one be saved? "Believe on the Lord Jesus, and you shall be saved" (Acts 16:31). Salvation is nothing other than believing in the Lord Jesus. There is no other way to salvation than by believing in the Lord Jesus. If you believe in His death, you will be saved. If you do not act according to God's will for your salvation, you will surely go to hell. You may know many religious formalities and church ordinances. But if you do not trust in the Lord Jesus as your Savior and are not saved according to God's will, whatever you do and whatever denomination you belong to cannot grant you the possibility of salvation.</P><P>Please pay attention to the great scriptural principle mentioned by the Lord in this passage. When the day of judgment comes and these types of people come to the Lord, they will only talk about themselves: "We...! We...! We...!" When they go before the Lord, they do not talk about what the Lord Jesus Christ has done. Instead, they talk about themselves. They do not mention that the Lord Jesus died for them or that they were saved through trusting in the merit gained by His blood. Rather, they say, "We prophesied, and in Your name cast out demons, and in Your name did many works of power." There is no better work than prophesying, casting out demons, and doing works of power. Yet this did not save them. The Lord said to them, "I never knew you. Depart from Me, you workers of lawlessness." "Workers of lawlessness"! What does this mean? Were they not prophesying, casting out demons, and performing works of power? Can these things be lawless? But the Lord said that even though these may be the best of works, they cannot save a man. Salvation does not depend on how many good works one has before God; it depends on the accomplished works of the Lord Jesus before God. Salvation is not what you have done for the Lord. It is what the Lord Jesus has done for you. Salvation is not the wage you earn from your labor; it is the gift bestowed upon you through the accomplishment of the Lord Jesus' labor.</P><P>These ones err. They think that they can exchange their own works for God's salvation. They think that salvation is merchandise and that they can buy eternal life through their works. Little do they realize that unless God first accepts us through the Lord Jesus, He will not accept the works which come from ourselves. Unless we are accepted first, our works will not be worth anything before God. We must first be saved, and then there is the possibility that our works will be accepted. Even if our works are the best and we nominally bear the name of God's children, we will not please Him. Dear friends, have you accepted the Lord Jesus as your Savior? Did you become a Christian because you were afraid of the coming wrath and were trying to flee the eternal death? If you want to go to hell, I have nothing more to say, you can go on in your present nominal way. You do not have to change and believe with sincerity in the Lord Jesus as your Savior. Please do not mistakenly think that everyone going to hell is weighed down with sin and evil. This is a mistake. You can try your best to do good, be zealous, attend services, sing, pray, preach, and give. But if you do not act according to God's will and believe in the Lord Jesus as your Savior, you will surely go to hell.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>The Fourth Way to Hell:<br>Not Believing in the Lord Jesus</H2><P>John 3:18 says, "He who believes into Him is not condemned; but he who does not believe has been condemned already, because he has not believed into the name of the only begotten Son of God." Verse 36 says, "He who disobeys the Son shall not see life, but the wrath of God abides upon him." Being condemned is to perish and perishing is to go to hell. Not seeing life and having the wrath of God abide on one is also to perish and suffer God's punishment, which is also to go to hell. These two verses tell us another reason for people to go to hell.</P><P>Who will go to hell? Those who do not believe will go to hell! What do they not believe in? They do not believe in the name of the only begotten Son of God. Many people think that man goes to hell by committing different kinds of sins. But the Bible does not teach this. It does not matter whether you are a moralist, religionist, or philosopher; it does not matter how much good you have done, how virtuous, righteous, loving, and kind you are. If you do not believe in the Son of God, the death and judgment waiting for you will be no different from that of the publicans and sinners. Please listen carefully. You do not have to commit any more sins. You do not have to tell one more lie. You do not have to reject Christ, persecute the saints, fornicate, or trespass God's law to go to hell. You can even try your best to reform, improve, serve, sacrifice, love, show kindness, perform charity and relief work, and do many other kinds of good works. But as long as you do not believe in the Lord Jesus, that is good enough for you to perish and go to hell. The words in these two verses are clear and plain. He who does not believe will be condemned. He who does not believe will not have eternal life, and the wrath of God is upon him all the time. "He who does not believe." Besides not believing, there is no other reason for the condemnation. It is not because a person has sinned or does not have good morals. Rather, it is because he does not believe. Besides unbelief, there is no reason for one to perish.</P><P>What does an unbelieving person receive? He who does not believe has been condemned already! Many people are more loving than God is. They think that God will surely not judge man's sin. But in these two verses the Lord Jesus Himself said that God will judge man and punish sinners with His wrath. God has His wrath. Do not think that God is an easy-going and foolishly good person with no righteousness at all. Many people think that God is kind and full of mercy, too kind to punish sinners. I say this in a most reverent way: if God were like this, He would not be kind but foolish. Although our God is kind, He is also righteous. He shows His love toward the sinners in the world. But He will show righteous judgment to those sinners who reject His love. Consequently, the Bible says that he who does not believe in the Son will not have eternal life and God's wrath will abide upon him. God has His wrath and His wrath abides upon unbelieving ones. Hell is real; the righteousness of God and the sin of the world require a hell!</P><P>What do these ones not believe in? They do not believe in the name of the only begotten Son of God. What is the name of the only begotten Son of God? His name is "Jesus." Why is the name of the only begotten Son of God called "Jesus"? The Bible says, "For it is He who will save His people from their sins" (Matt. 1:21). The word "Jesus" means "Jehovah the Savior." Therefore, whoever does not believe in the name of the only begotten Son of God does not believe in Jesus. Not believing in Jesus is not believing in Him as the Savior who saves one from sin. All those who do not believe in Jesus as their Savior will perish and go to hell. This is what the Word of God says.</P><P>How did the Lord Jesus become man's Savior? The Bible says clearly that He is not a Savior of our flesh or of society, but a Savior from sin. He came to save the sinners from their sins. Please listen carefully, and do not be deceived or cheated to think that the Lord Jesus was a great teacher, example, and pattern who promoted love, peace, equality, and freedom for everyone. The Bible does not say that He was such a person. It says clearly that the goal of all His works was to "save His people from their sins." He came to be the Savior from sin.</P><P>How could He become the Savior from sin? Please listen to His own words: "For this is My blood of the covenant, which is being poured out for many for the forgiveness of sins" (Matt. 26:28). In this verse the Lord Jesus explained the way He saves sinners. He saves not by reforming and improving sinners but by dying on behalf of sinners and shedding His blood so that their sins may be forgiven. The way He saves sinners is by the shedding of blood. This is His cross. He saves sinners by the merit of the blood which He shed on the cross. His work did not exhort sinners to do good, educate them, teach them, or slowly develop goodness in their heart. He did not come to serve the sinners' physical body, reform society, or give sinners a more comfortable living in the sinful world. He saved sinners through the shedding of His blood. All the work of the Lord Jesus during His life on earth could not save one sinner. The source of a sinner's salvation is His death.</P><P>How did the Lord Jesus save sinners through His death? Why did He say, "This is My blood of the covenant, which is being poured out for many for the forgiveness of sins"? Was shedding His own blood the only way to forgive man's sin? Indeed, there was no other way. The forgiveness of sin presupposes the existence of sin. Because there is sin, there has to be the forgiveness of sin. In what way, however, can sin be forgiven? It can be by the shedding of the Lord Jesus' blood. But why is there a need for the shedding of blood? There is a need because sinners have sinned and sin must be punished. The Bible says, "The wages of sin is death" (Rom. 6:23). Since the wages of sin is death, then a sinner who has sinned must die. The flesh and soul must suffer eternally in hell. Since a sinner has sinned, he should perish. In order to save sinners, the Lord Jesus died and shed His blood for them. Romans 5:6 and 8 say, "For while we were yet weak, in due time Christ died for the ungodly";  "while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us." Listen! The death of Christ was not a martyr's act. Neither was it an example for us to follow. His death was a death for sinners. In other words, He died in place of sinners. Sinners should die and perish themselves. But the Lord Jesus died for sinners and suffered the punishment of sin on behalf of sinners. The punishment which sinners should have suffered was upon the Lord Jesus. The Lord Jesus substituted for sinners, stood in place of sinners, and received from the hand of a righteous God the punishment of sinners. Since He died, sinners do not have to die. This is the gospel! This is salvation!</P><P>The Lord Jesus Christ, the Son of God, through His offering up of Himself on the cross, has borne the sin of sinners and accomplished eternal salvation. There is no salvation other than this salvation. There is one other way for man to be saved before God-he must commit absolutely no sin from the day of his birth to the day of his death, including every minute and second of his time, in all of his thoughts, words, conduct, and attitude. No matter how good, moral, godly, and no matter how much he is sheltered by religion, if he has sinned just once in thought, word, conduct, or attitude, that is sufficient for him to go to hell. Since this is the case, can man still be saved by himself? Of course, no one can be saved. This is why the Lord Jesus came to bear sinners' sins. He shed His blood for sinners, so that sinners could be saved through Him, even though they could not save themselves.</P><P>Not believing in the name of the only begotten Son of God is not believing in Jesus; not believing in Jesus is refusing the salvation accomplished by the blood of Jesus shed on the cross. If one does not believe this, he is already condemned. If there is a person on earth who is perfect in goodness and has never sinned in his life, whose conduct is as good as the Lord Jesus', then he does not need to believe in the Lord Jesus. If such a person does not exist, then everyone has sinned and should receive punishment for their sins. If you do not accept the Lord Jesus as your Savior and do not believe that He has died for you, you will bear your own sins and perish forever. Therefore, the sinners who are sitting here should ask themselves if they have sinned. If you have not sinned, there is nothing more to say. But if you have sinned, you must believe in the Lord Jesus. If you do not believe, you will go to hell and bear your own sins. Alas, you will perish because you refused salvation, not because salvation was not offered to you!</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>The Fifth Way to Hell:<br>Delaying and Waiting</H2><P>The Holy Spirit is now working among us and causing us to realize that we must believe in the Lord Jesus before we can be saved. But there is a danger. Many people want to wait. They realize that it is good to believe in the Lord Jesus and they know they will be saved by believing in the Lord Jesus. But they say that believing is inconvenient for them and they should wait. In the near future, when an opportunity comes, they will believe in the Lord Jesus. Dear friends, please be careful! Consider! Do not be deceived by the devil. The matter of believing in the Lord Jesus is the most important thing on earth. Think carefully if you can afford to wait and delay.</P><P>Listen to these two verses of the Scripture. Ecclesiastes 9:10 says, "Whatsoever thy hand findeth to do, do it with thy might; for there is no work, nor device, nor knowledge, nor wisdom, in the grave, whither thou goest." Proverbs 29:1 says, "He, that being often reproved hardeneth his neck, / shall suddenly be destroyed, and that without remedy."</P><P>Who can say how long he will live? Who can know his own life span? You may say that you will wait until some future day. But how much time do you have in the future? No one sitting here can guarantee how long he will live. Since you cannot guarantee, why risk your soul? It is either now or never. You have to be careful.</P><P>I remember a story. Once a young Scottish girl came to a certain Dr. T. The doctor preached to her and persuaded her to accept Christ as her Savior. She said, "Doctor, I need to wait a while. I do not want to accept Christ now." The doctor replied, "How long will you wait? Are you going to wait for a year? Are you willing to say that no matter what circumstances befall you and what opportunities you have during this year that you will not accept Christ, and that you must wait for another year before you will accept Him?" She said, "No, doctor. I cannot say this, for I may die in less than a year." The doctor said, "That's right. So are you going to wait for another month? Are you willing to say that during this month, no matter what opportunity there is and whatever may happen that you will not accept Christ, and that you must wait for another month?" She pondered a little and then replied, "Doctor, I cannot say that I must wait for a month and that whatever opportunity or event may happen during this time that I will not accept Christ, because I may die within a month." The doctor again said, "That's right. Are you then going to wait for a week, and no matter what happens within this week you will not accept Jesus Christ?" She hesitated and then said, "No, I cannot say that. I cannot say that I must wait for a week and no matter what circumstance I encounter and whatever may occur this week that I will not take any opportunity to accept Jesus Christ because I may die in a week." The doctor then said, "That's right. Then are you going to wait for one day? Are you going to wait for another twenty-four hours and within these twenty-four hours, whatever may happen, you will not accept Jesus Christ?" She said again, "No doctor. I cannot even say that, because I may be dead in twenty-four hours." The doctor said, "That's right. Now consider, is it not far better for you to accept Christ as your Savior now?" In the end she could not refuse and said, "I will accept Him." Today I put the same question before you. What are you waiting for? Are you going to wait for a year? Who can say that within this year, he will not encounter an accident and that he will live through the year? Perhaps a year is too long. You dare not guarantee anything. But who can say that he will live for another month? Are you going to wait for another month before you believe in Christ? Are you willing to say that you will not believe in Christ within this month no matter what opportunity is afforded to you and that you will wait until next month to believe? Who among us can say that he will not die during this month, that he will still be around next month, and that he will believe in the Lord Jesus next month? Who can say that he will live another week? If you cannot say that you will live another week, why do you have to wait for another week? Why do you have to wait for one more week to go by before you seek an opportunity to believe in Christ? I believe no one with a sound mind would dare to say before men or in his heart that he will live for another week.</P><P>I have a friend whose cousin did not believe in the truth. He made excuses and put off the matter all the time. Once my friend preached and persuaded him to believe in the Lord. But he said that he would wait for a few days. My friend told him, "Very well, I will come back in a few days to preach to you." But during those few days, his cousin took his wife to see his in-laws in the villages and was beaten to death by bandits while he was there. Can anyone say that they will not die in a few days?</P><P>Can anyone here say that he will not die in the next twenty-four hours? If you cannot say it, why do you wait when you know that you should believe in Christ as your Savior and that by believing you will be saved from hell? If you cannot guarantee your own life for the next twenty-four hours, how can you say that you will wait for the future? Therefore, at this time, you should hear what the Scripture says, "Whatsoever thy hand findeth to do, do it with thy might" (Eccl. 9:10). Why such haste? Because of "the grave, whither thou goest." Man must die and go into the grave. In the grave, "there is no work, nor device, nor knowledge, nor wisdom." Therefore, you should not hope to believe in Christ after you die. No! You should believe today; otherwise, you will not find the opportunity in the future. Why not make the decision now? Why wait for another day? We do not know what we will face tomorrow, and we do not know how many sitting here will be gone tomorrow. Who wants to die? Who can say that they will not die? Therefore, we have to believe in Christ right away.</P><P>Once in Philadelphia, a big city in America, a seven-story building was on fire. This building was rented out to many big corporations. On the sixth floor there was a newspaper office containing much telecommunication equipment through which the company communicated with the world and sent out reports. Unfortunately, this floor caught on fire that day. The fire started on the first floor. Everyone on the seven floors began to move things out of the building and were running for their lives. One telecommunications operator remained on the sixth floor. He liked doing novel things so he did not leave the burning building right away. He began to telegraph to the whole nation: "Our newspaper office is now on fire. The fire is on the first floor. I am on the sixth floor." After a while he sent out another telegram: "The fire is now on the second floor, but I am still on the sixth floor." After fifteen minutes he sent out another telegram: "The fire has come up to the third floor, but I am still on the sixth floor." After a little while he sent out a telegram again: "The fire has come to the fourth floor, and I am still on the sixth floor." Finally he sent another telegram: "The fire has come to the fifth floor, and I am still on the sixth floor." He thought that sending out telegrams this way would cause a sensation in the whole nation. How exciting that the fire was on the fifth floor and a man was still on the sixth floor! However, his life was also important. He paused for a while and went out to see the fire. What he saw shocked him. The fire was not on the fifth floor. It had been wrong to say that the fire was on the fifth floor and that he was on the sixth floor. He should have said, "The fire is on the sixth floor, and I am also on the sixth floor." The fire had reached him. He thought that there was time for him to escape. He opened the door and wanted to run down the stairs. But once the door opened, billows of smoke and fire poured in. He was forced to close the door. The stairs were burning. Every floor of the building was on fire. How could he escape? In the end he opened a window and saw a power line hanging across the street. He thought that here was the way. He jumped out of the window and caught the line and began to cross over with his hands. But streets in America are very wide and he stopped in the middle of the street. There were many people watching him from down below. Every eye was set on him. In everyone's heart there was the question, "Can this man be saved? Will he have enough strength to get to the other side?" After a while one of the man's hands slipped. After a little while the man fell and was dashed to the ground in the middle of the street!</P><P>Dear ones, if you know that your life is precious, if you know that your soul is important, and if you know that Christ will save sinners, why do you still wait? The fire of hell has started to burn. Why are you not running for your life? Alas, the fire of hell is burning before your eyes! What are you waiting for? Watch out! Do not think that the fire is on the fifth floor and that you are on the sixth floor! The fire of hell is already before your eyes. There is hell fire right where you are. Why are you still waiting?</P><P>Now is the time to accept Christ as your Savior. If you miss the chance, it will be difficult to say if another will come. Satan cannot stop you now from believing in Christ. He knows that man fears sin and is afraid of the punishment of hell. He also knows that it is very reasonable for one to believe in Christ and be forgiven. He has only one method: to make you wait and delay until the time is past and the opportunity is gone. Although you know that you should be saved, you will perish eternally. What are you waiting for now? Are you going to wait until you are sick before you believe? Are you going to wait until you face some peril before you believe? Are you going to wait until you die before you believe? Please do not wait any longer. Wait no more. Please come to the Lord Jesus this minute and accept Him with faith as your Savior. Pray to Him: "Lord, I am a sinner who should go to hell. I ask You to save me now." The Lord will hear your prayer.</P><h1 class="series">SPIRITUAL TEACHINGS</h1><H1 CLASS=MSG>MESSAGE ONE</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>ASSURANCE OF SALVATION</H1><H2 CLASS=HEAD4>(Talks to Young Christians)</H2><H2 CLASS=HEAD4>Issue No. 1</H2><P>Every time I go to a place to preach God's gospel of grace, I always ask the local Christians one question. I believe all those who can answer me with a clear "yes" are joyfully enjoying the grace of God. The question is, "Are you already saved?" In other words, do you really know that you are saved? Among a thousand people, one can only find two or three who know that they are saved. Sometimes, among a whole congregation, one cannot find one person who knows that he is saved. Then I ask these ones, "You have received the Lord Jesus and have accepted Him as your personal Savior. You have trusted in the blood of His cross to wash away your sins. Why do you still not know that you are saved? If a man falls into the water, and another man pulls him out, after the first man comes to his senses, he will surely know whether he is still in the water or safe on the shore. You should know whether you are a perishing man or a saved man who has obtained God's grace." Many people would not respond clearly with words, but their answer always seems to be, "I do not know if I have been saved. How can I say that I am saved while I am still living on earth?"</P><P>I think many of the readers of this message would answer this way! This is exactly where our mistake lies. Our belief in the Lord Jesus is not like gambling, winning when we are lucky and losing when we are not lucky. The salvation that comes through believing in the cross of the Lord Jesus is fully guaranteed. We do not have to wait until we die before we can know if we are saved or not. We can know this now. This is the clear teaching of the Bible. Please read a few verses:</P><P>"Therefore let it be known to you, men, brothers, that through this One forgiveness of sins is announced to you; and from all the things from which you were not able to be justified by the law of Moses, in this One everyone who believes is justified" (Acts 13:38-39).</P><P>We cannot obtain justification by God through our own work. We have many sins, which make our heart sad whenever we think about them and cause us to think that we are not saved. But although we can fail, the Lord Jesus is still trustworthy. If we believe in Him, our sins will be forgiven. All those who believe in Him will be justified. How great is the Lord's salvation! God's Word says, "Let it be known to you." We should know what? We should know that once we have believed in the Lord Jesus, our sins are forgiven, and we are justified. You are saved! When God says, "Let it be known to you," we can know if we are saved or not. We should not refuse Him. We should commit our sins to the Savior and believe in His accomplished salvation for us. We will then be saved.</P><P>"This is the testimony of God that He has testified concerning His Son. He who believes into the Son of God has the testimony in himself; he who does not believe God has made Him a liar because he has not believed in the testimony which God has testified concerning His Son. And this is the testimony, that God gave to us eternal life and this life is in His Son. He who has the Son has the life; he who does not have the Son of God does not have the life. I have written these things to you that you may know that you have eternal life, to you who believe into the name of the Son of God" (1 John 5:9-13).</P><P>He who has the Lord Jesus has life. He who does not have Him does not have life. Have you accepted the Lord Jesus as your Savior? If you have, you have life already, and you are saved. The Lord Jesus said Himself: "He who believes has eternal life" (John 6:47). God has testified for His Son that He has given to us eternal life. This passage of the Scripture says that if we do not believe in the testimony that we have eternal life, then we are making God a liar. God says all those who have trusted and accepted the Lord Jesus have eternal life. Would God lie? We should believe that we who have been washed by His blood are saved already. God said, through the apostle John, that He wrote these words that we may know that we are saved.</P><P>The testimony of the Bible is that we can know if we are saved. This is not something that happens only after we die; we do not have to wait until the coming age before we know. While we are living on earth today, we should know if we are saved or not. If we are not, we should make haste to believe in Jesus Christ and come to God through trusting in His saving accomplishment for us. If we are saved, we should give much thanks to God's grace and should live on earth like saved persons. "Behold, now is the well-acceptable time; behold, now is the day of salvation" (2 Cor. 6:2). God accepts us now and saves us now, rather than after we die.</P><P>Sometimes, when I ask a person if he is saved, he answers, "I am only trying my best to do good and to serve God, hoping that I can eventually be saved." Alas, this is also wrong. This means that he does not understand the way of salvation. Do you think that you can be saved in the future by trying your best to do good and to serve God? We have to know that none of our merits and works are acceptable before God. "All our righteousnesses are like a soiled garment" (Isa. 64:6). Do you think that merit and work will save you? No, ten thousand times no! The Bible clearly says, "You have been saved...not of yourselves; it is the gift of God; not of works that no one should boast" (Eph. 2:8-9). Salvation comes through trusting in the Lord Jesus, "who Himself bore up our sins in His body on the tree" (1 Pet. 2:24), "the Righteous on behalf of the unrighteous, that He might bring you to God" (3:18). He has accomplished the work of salvation. All you have to do is to believe and obey Him. "Believe on the Lord Jesus, and you shall be saved" (Acts 16:31). Do not try to be saved by your own work. No matter how good your works are, they cannot save you, for "you have been saved...not of works" (Eph. 2:8-9). If you trust in the accomplishment of the substitutional death of the Lord Jesus on the cross, you will be saved. If you do not accept the Lord Jesus as the Savior, there will be no hope for your salvation because you cannot save yourself. If you accept the Lord Jesus as the sin offering, you do not have to hope to be saved because you have eternal life already.</P><P>We only hope for things that we have not yet obtained. If we have them already, we do not need to hope for them anymore. When a child's father leaves his home, the child hopes very much to see the father. But when the father returns home, the child is extremely glad. If the mother asks the child, "Do you still hope to see your father?", the child will answer, "I have seen my father already. Why do I still have to hope to see him?" Indeed, if we have obtained something already, we do not need to hope for it anymore. Either the world believes in Jesus and is saved and has eternal life, or it is not saved and is perishing. There is no middle ground between the two things. "Every one who believes into Him...[has] eternal life...he who does not believe has been condemned already" (John 3:16-18). The Bible divides humanity into two classes: those who are saved and those who are perishing. There is not a third class of those who hope to be saved. If you have indeed believed in Jesus Christ as your Savior and have believed in His death on the cross where He bore your sins for you, you are saved already. You do not have to hope to be saved anymore. If some would ask a man who has been rescued out of the water, "What do you want?", would he say, "I hope to get on shore"? Is such an answer sensible? Brothers, if you have believed in the Lord Jesus, you have eternal life already. Why are you still doubting? You have received it already. Why still hope for it? Simply praise the Lord instead!</P><P>There are others, when I ask about the question of salvation, that answer, "While I live on earth today, I indeed trust in the accomplished work of the redemption of the Lord Jesus. But I dare not say whether I am saved or not. I have to wait until I die and go before the Father to be judged as either a goat or a sheep. If He says that I am a sheep, then I will be saved and be most happy. If He says that I am a goat, then I will perish and go to hell in misery."</P><P>Alas, is this future not a pitiful one? Speaking truthfully, if I did not know that I was saved, I would be afraid that I would be unable to take my meal today; and I would not be able to sleep tonight. Thank the Father, for He has accepted us and has given us the eternal life! Do you really believe in the merit of the Lord Jesus' redemption? If we have believed in Him, do we have to wait until we die before we know whether we are saved or perishing? Please look at the word of the Bible. The Lord's own words are the most trustworthy of all.</P><P>"For God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son, that every one who believes into Him would not perish, but would have eternal life" (John 3:16). Is not this verse very clear? "For God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son." This is what God has done. He has loved and He has given. He has given the Lord Jesus to the world, to die for the world and accomplish salvation on the cross, so that everyone who believes in the Lord Jesus would have eternal life and not perish. If you have believed in the Lord Jesus, you have eternal life already and will no longer perish. John 3:16 is the most recited verse. But unfortunately, many people are not familiar with John 3:16 after all. John 3:16 clearly says that as soon as you believe in the Lord Jesus, you do not perish, but have eternal life. But many believers change John 3:16! If they have believed in the Lord as their Savior but consider that they are not yet saved, they change John 3:16! They change it without knowing about it! They change John 3:16 to something like this:</P><P>"For God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son, that every one who believes into Him will perhaps not perish, and perhaps have eternal life after a month, two months, a year, ten years, a few decades, or after they die."</P><P>Thank God that the Bible is not written this way. The Bible has not put those words there. The Bible links "every one who believes into Him" with "would not perish, but would have eternal life." Whenever we believe in the Lord Jesus and have our sins washed by the blood; at that moment, we do not perish, but have eternal life. "Every one who believes into Him...would have eternal life" (John 3:16), without waiting until they die to have it.</P><P>The parable of the goats and the sheep has been misinterpreted by the church throughout the centuries. It has been applied to the believers. The word "nations" in Matthew 25:32 refers to the Gentiles. God has divided the world into Jews, Greeks, and the church of God (1 Cor. 10:32). The church has nothing to do with the Gentiles anymore. The judgment of the goats and the sheep refers to the judgment of the Gentile nations at the coming of the Lord Jesus with His saints. We the believers will not be judged there.</P><P>Those who have believed in the Lord Jesus will not be judged with respect to salvation and perdition. The Lord Jesus' crucifixion on the cross has borne the judgment of their sins for them. He has taken the punishment of their sins. He has solved the problem of sin for them. Those who have believed in Him have accepted Him as their substitute. He has been judged and has died for them. Of course, they do not need to be judged or to die anymore. "There is now then no condemnation to those who are in Christ Jesus" (Rom. 8:1). Please read again the words of John 5:24. "Truly, truly, I say to you, he who hears My word and believes Him who sent Me has eternal life, and does not come into judgment but has passed out of death into life."</P><P>How sweet are the Lord's words! No one can speak like Him! These clear words are like music to a sinner's ears. Since He said "truly, truly," can they be untrue? Surely they cannot be. The Lord Jesus says that the one who hears and believes "has eternal life." This is a "truly, truly" saying. He says that such a one "does not come into judgment." This, of course, must be "truly, truly" also. He also says that such a one "has passed out of death into life." This also must be "truly, truly." When He says that such a one "has passed," it surely means that it "has passed." When do we use the words "has passed" in our daily life? Does not "has passed" mean that something has already been accomplished and is over? The Lord says that a person who has believed in Him "has passed out of death into life." Why do we say that we have to wait until we die before we can know that we are saved? Brothers, those who have believed in Him have already passed from death into life even in this age. This is truly the gospel! Truly, truly I say unto you, a person who has believed "has passed out of death into life." He who does not believe "has been condemned already" (John 3:18). Both times that the word "has" is used in John 5:24 and 3:18, it refers to something that is decided now.</P><P>Perhaps when you read up to this point, you will think like many other believers, "Would it not be too proud of me to say that I am already saved? I am not better in any way in my conduct than others. How can I say this?"</P><P>Dear readers, for us to know that we are saved is not to be proud. The words "to be saved" are in the passive voice; they show that we are being acted upon. What is there for us to be proud of? To say that we do not need to be saved or that we have no need of salvation is indeed proud; it is indeed to consider ourselves better than others. But to say that we are saved indicates that we were sinners and were to perish, but that we are now saved by Him through trusting in Him. This shows how deep the Lord's grace is to us and how great is the saving work of the Lord. It shows how great the Lord's power is. It is not an exaltation of ourselves. If we know that we have received grace and are saved, of course, we will all the more praise the Lord. To sing of the Lord Jesus in our songs all the time is an exaltation of the Lord; it is not a self-boasting. The more we see the depth of our sins and the immensity of the Lord's forgiveness, the more we will love the Lord. We should say as Paul said: "By the grace of God I am what I am" (1 Cor. 15:10).</P><P>God says that we have eternal life already-that we are saved. Therefore, for me to say that I am saved is not boasting; it is to believe and to acknowledge that God is right. God is pleased when we believe in His Word. We must believe in God's Word.</P><P>It is true that our works are no better than others. But we are not saved because of our good works. The Lord Jesus did not come to save the righteous but the sinners. "For the Son of Man has come to seek and to save that which is lost" (Luke 19:10). "Christ Jesus came into the world to save sinners" (1 Tim. 1:15). Paul said that he was the foremost of all sinners, but that he had obtained mercy. If it is up to us, we will not be able to say that we are saved. Even the world cannot find one who can say that he is saved. If salvation is due to our merits and excellence, there will be no possibility for us to be saved. Those who trust in their works are shaky all the time. Sometimes their conduct is better, and they will hope that they can be saved. Sometimes their conduct is not as good, and they think that they will perish. These ones have never fully trusted in Christ. Dear readers, we are not saved because of our good works. We are saved because Christ has saved us. How great is His grace!</P><P>Many say: "I know that if one trusts in the accomplishment of the Lord Jesus on the cross, he is saved. But I do not feel anything. Am I saved just like this?"</P><P>Brothers! The Bible does not say: "I give these happy feelings to you that you may know that you have eternal life, to you who believe in the name of the Son of God." If the Bible were written in this way, one would not be saved if he did not feel anything. But the Bible says, "I have written these things to you that you may know that you have eternal life" (1 John 5:13).</P><P>"These things." What are these things? They are the words of the Bible, the Word of the Father. We know that we have eternal life and are saved, not by the way we feel, but by what the Word of God says. The Bible says that we who have believed in the Lord are saved. We are, therefore, saved. When God says that we are saved, surely we are saved, whether we feel that we are saved or not. We have believed in the Lord Jesus and have been washed of our sins by His blood. Therefore, we are saved because God's Word says so.</P><P>For example, a poor man may be very poor and cannot make ends meet; he may be living in extreme sufferings. He decides to write a letter to one of his friends, who is quite well off, to ask for help. After a few days, he does not receive any reply. He may think that his friend despises him and is not willing to help him, and his heart is in distress. The more he thinks about it, the more it seems unlikely that his friend will help him. He decides then to tell this matter to his neighbors. Some say that a friend should always help one in financial difficulties and has no reason to refuse to help. Others say that this may not necessarily be true because it is a compassionless age. When the man hears the hopeful words, he rejoices, and when he hears the discouraging words, he is in distress. The next day his friend sends someone to give him a reply. When he opens the letter, his heart jumps within him; he does not know if a promise is within. After he opens the letter, he shouts to his family, "The matter is now settled. He has written a letter to me saying that, from now on, he will take up all my expenses. All right. The matter is decided. I do not care if others think that it is hopeful or hopeless any longer. He has said himself that he will bear all the responsibilities. I can live now in peace."</P><P>Are not many believers like this poor man? What a pity that many children of God listen to others' talk and to their own feeling; they are drifting back and forth. The poor man was assured once he had a word from his friend. The children of God are likewise assured when they have the Word of God. God says that if we believe in Jesus Christ, we shall be saved. He has said it Himself, and everything is settled. What more is there to worry about? What are our feelings worth? What are man's ideas worth? If God says that we are saved, it is enough. His Word is the final verdict. Since God has graciously declared His faithfulness, we should accept His Word without doubt.</P><P>Some may say, "What was said may be true. But I am afraid that my faith is not perfect, and therefore, I cannot be saved."</P><P>The Bible only makes a distinction between "believing" and "not believing." The Bible does not know what an incomplete faith means. We should know that there is no merit in our believing in the Lord Jesus. God does not save us because we have attained the merit of believing. This cannot be farther from the truth! To believe is to receive (John 1:12). John 3:16 says that God "gave" us His Son. When we "receive" Him, everything is done. One gives and the other receives. There is no merit of the sinner involved. Salvation is fully accomplished by the Lord Jesus.</P><P>Who among us is not a sinner? We were dead in trespasses and sins. How pitiful we were! The Holy Spirit came and caused us to realize our sins. How terrible is the punishment for sin! One cannot help but tremble at the thought of the future. It is all the more pitiful when we realize that there is no way for us to save ourselves. We were wallowing in the mud and yet had no way to rescue ourselves! What an unspeakable deprivation! Thank and praise the slaughtered Lamb! He came and died for us on the cross. He stood on the ground of us the sinners. He loved us and gave Himself for us. While we were yet sinners, He died for us. He accomplished the salvation. When He died, He proclaimed, "It is finished!" (John 19:30). How precious is this word! O Lord! I can never thank You enough for Your great grace! To believe in the Lord Jesus means nothing other than a willingness on the part of us, the helpless and destitute sinners, to be saved by Him. He came to save, and when we are willing to be saved, the matter is settled. There is no question of complete or incomplete faith.</P><P>He says Himself, "Him who comes to Me I shall by no means cast out" (John 6:37). Since we have come, there is now only one question: "Has He cast me out?" Praise God, for Christ is faithful and trustworthy. There is no guile found in His mouth! He will never cast out those who come to Him. He will save all those who realize their sins and who will accept Him as their Savior. "Come to Me all who toil and are burdened, and I will give you rest" (Matt. 11:28). "If anyone thirsts, let him come to Me and drink" (John 7:37). This is the Lord's invitation.</P><P>Brothers, it is not just our faith that is saving us. Rather, it is His grace and faithfulness. God desires to save us. He will bestow grace on us. Will we not believe? What else is there to doubt? The Lord's love should fill our hearts and should drive out all drifting thoughts!</P><P>After some have understood this teaching, they may have a doubt in them: "If a man already knows that he is saved and has eternal life and is guaranteed heaven, will he not then sin at will? Will he not think that he is saved anyway and that he can, therefore, unbridle his lusts and sin at will? Will he not think that he is saved now, and that it does not matter anymore if he sins again?"</P><P>This is only a hypothesis. Many people think that if they know that they are saved, they will still want to sin. But this is only a hypothesis. In reality, something exactly opposite happens. If a man knows that he is saved, he will not want to sin anymore, and he will also bear heavenly characteristics in his thought and conduct. I can give you an illustration here. Today in China we are sending a few hundred people to study abroad every year. Most of them go to the United States. Suppose there is a father who wants to send his son to America. How should the son be dressed? Should he pay attention to the Chinese gowns and consider the latest fashion? Does he need to study Chinese etiquette and manners? Does he need to know all the things associated with the Chinese culture? Surely he does not. He is about to go to America. He does not need to know more about China, but he needs to learn the customs and fashions of the other country. He should learn to eat with a fork and knife, to shake hands, and to doff his hat. He should study in detail the tastes, likes and dislikes, and individual habits of the Americans. He should study the mind and characteristics of the Americans. When he speaks in English, he should have an American accent with it. When he walks, he should walk like the Americans walk. He should pursue after American fashion in his dress and attire. In other words, all those who are about to go to America have a natural tendency to act and move like an American. If a believer realizes that he has eternal life already, and is a citizen of heaven, he will surely learn the heavenly pattern in everything, in word, conduct, and walk. Those who do not know that they are saved will imitate the world and try to be conformed to it. Brothers, there is no danger of sinning carelessly for those who know that they are saved. On the contrary, those who know this will set their minds daily on the things which are above. This can be fully confirmed by the spiritual experiences of the believers. Just like those who are going to America try to be Americans, those who are going heavenward will surely learn to be heavenly persons.</P><P>Dear brothers! You have believed in the Lord Jesus Christ already. This is the most important thing on earth. This is also the greatest blessing in eternity for man! You should know that the Lord has saved you. What a comfort and joy it is for us to know that we are persons with eternal life in us. "Rejoice that your names are recorded in the heavens" (Luke 10:20). What a precious message! This is indeed the glad tidings. We can know that we are saved in this age! Formerly we were the sinners. Now we have received grace. Should we not rejoice? What gratitude and affection we have to realize that the Lord has saved us from perdition and has given us eternal life. If we know this, we will praise God all the more. We know that we cannot save ourselves. As a result, all the authority, riches, wisdom, power, honor, glory, and praise be unto the slain Lamb for now and evermore!</P><P>Now you can see how much God loves us! Since He has loved us and saved us, we should love Him out of a sense of gratitude and should live as saved persons on earth. Since He has begun the good work in our heart, He will surely complete this work until the day of Christ Jesus (Phil. 1:6). We cannot please Him by ourselves, because "those who are in the flesh cannot please God" (Rom. 8:8). We can only allow His Spirit to work in us to effect a holy living. Although sometimes we may unfortunately fail, this does not mean that we will perish again. What the Lord has given us is an eternal life. When we fail, we should not be discouraged. We should rise up and ask for the Lord's forgiveness. He will surely lead us on.</P><P>Once I was preaching in a place. After a brother there understood this truth, he said to me, "I did not know before that I was saved. As a result, I lived carelessly in the world. I was afraid that if I gave up everything in this life for the Lord, and then the Lord apportioned me perdition at the time of the judgment, I would as the saying goes, `lose one's case before both the magistrate and the mandarin.' I was afraid that I would have neither the joy of this world, nor the blessing of heaven! But now that I know this truth, heaven is guaranteed. Since I am a citizen of heaven already, I do not want to live foolishly in this world anymore." Indeed, if we know that our life is hid with Christ in God, we will surely set our mind on the things above. How wonderful this is! We have a wonderful Savior, and we have received a wonderful salvation. Is this not a cause for joy? Let us sing Hallelujah!</P><H1 CLASS=MSG>MESSAGE TWO</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>THE TIME OF THE CROSS-<br>THE TIMELESSNESS OF THE CROSS</H1><H2 CLASS=HEAD4>Issue No. 3</H2><P>Every time we consider the cross, it invokes wonder in us! Every time we remember the redemption of the Lord Jesus, our hearts are filled both with sorrow and with joy. To us the Lord's cross is not just a wooden cross, but a symbol of His full redemptive work and of the full salvation accomplished through this redemptive work.</P><P>When I first received the Lord, I often wondered how the men in the Old Testament, who came before the time of the Lord's crucifixion, could be saved. At that time I was a babe in the Lord and was quite perplexed by this question.</P><P>In recent years I have not seen much of the fresh power of the cross manifested in the believers. It seems that to them the Lord's death is something that happened long ago, over nineteen centuries earlier. As such, it does not seem to have any power.</P><P>I thank the Father that He has recently shown me the timelessness of the cross. Because of the above-mentioned two concepts, I consider it necessary that God's saints be acquainted with the teaching of the "timelessness" of the cross. If we realize that the cross is still extremely fresh, how much we will be touched by it!</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE LORD'S DEATH IN RELATION TO<br>THE OLD AND THE NEW COVENANTS</H2><P>We should first read Hebrews 9:15-17: "And because of this He is the Mediator of a new covenant, so that, death having taken place for redemption of the transgressions under the first covenant, those who have been called might receive the promise of the eternal inheritance. For where there is a testament [the same word as covenant in the original], the death of him who made the testament must of necessity be established. For a testament [covenant] is confirmed in the case of the dead, since it never has force when he who made the testament is living." These few verses show us the relationship between the death of Christ on the cross and the old and new covenants. Under the old covenant men sinned the same way that they now do. Since there was sin, there was the need for the Savior. If a man has sinned and has not received God's forgiveness, he will have to bear his own judgment of sin. God cannot forgive man's sin simply by His mercy. To do so would put Him in unrighteousness. For this reason, in God's way of redemption He established the way of substitution. Under the old covenant He used many sacrifices and offerings to make atonement for man's sins. Since many animals died on man's behalf, man received God's righteous forgiveness. The word "atonement" in Hebrew means to "cover up." Under the old covenant the atonement was but a covering up of man's sins with animals' blood, because the Bible clearly says, "It is impossible for the blood of bulls and goats to take away sins" (Heb. 10:4). For this reason, at the fullness of time God sent His Son into the world to die for men. Through His one offering up of Himself, the eternal salvation of redemption was accomplished. The sins which were not removed by the blood of bulls and goats in the Old Testament are now removed through His death, for He is "the Lamb of God, who takes away the sin of the world" (John 1:29). The death of Christ marked a great change in history. His death divided the old testament age from the new testament age. Before His death, it was the Old Testament age; after His death, it is the New Testament age. The above-mentioned Scripture readings cover this point.</P><P>These three verses speak of two kinds of relationships the Lord's death has with the old and the new covenants. Hebrews 9:15 shows how He is the Mediator. Verses 16 and 17 show how He became the One who made the testament.</P><P>We have seen that everyone in the first covenant was a sinner. Although they offered to God animals as atonement for their sins, their sins were only covered; their sins were not removed. At that time God did forgive their sins because through the blood of many sacrifices God saw from a distance the blood of His Son and its effectiveness. However, unless the Lord Jesus were to die, God still could not put an end to the problem of sin in the first covenant. Sin must be removed. When Christ died, the sin under the first covenant was removed. We can see the relationship between the Lord's death and the first covenant from another angle. Every covenant has its conditions. The old covenant also had its demands. When man came short of these requirements, he sinned. The punishment of sin is death. This is why the Lord Jesus had to die on behalf of those in the first covenant and redeem them from their sins. He fulfilled all the requirements of the first covenant, terminated it, and initiated the new covenant.</P><P>Through His death He redeemed man from the sins he committed in the first covenant and became the Mediator of the new covenant. His being the Mediator of the new covenant is based on His redemption of the sins of those in the first covenant. Originally, man was to receive the promise of the eternal inheritance. However, because of his sin, man was kept from inheriting it. Now the Lord Jesus has died. Man is redeemed from sin, and the called ones are qualified to receive the eternal inheritance. Hence, the Lord Jesus became the Mediator through the death on the cross. On the one hand, He brought an end to the sins of the old covenant. On the other hand, He brought in the blessing of the new covenant. All these matters are related to His being the Mediator.</P><P>Next we should consider Him as the One who made the testament. The word "testament" is "covenant" in the original language. In the above discussion, we had the law of the covenant. All those who transgressed the law died. Christ died in order to redeem us from sin. After this we may consider the testament of the covenant. A testament means an arrangement made by a testator for the passing of his possessions to his heir at the testator's death. The Lord Jesus is the Testator, the One who made the testament. All the blessings of this age and the next belong to Him. Since He was willing to bear the sins of those in the first covenant, He is also willing to pass on all that is promised in this covenant (testament). In order to redeem man from his sins, He had to die. In order for man to inherit the testament, He also had to die. If a man is alive, the testament he makes will not come into effect. He must die before the heir can inherit the inheritance. Here we see the profound relationship between Christ's death and the old and new covenants. In short, without His death there would not be the old and the new covenants. Without His death, the Old Testament could not be complete, for the requirement of its law would not have been met. Without His death there could not be the New Testament, because there would be no way for the blessing of its testament to be passed on to the called ones. But the Lord has died. He has terminated the first covenant and has enacted the second covenant. Indeed, the New Testament was enacted by His blood.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>HOW WERE MEN SAVED IN THE OLD TESTAMENT?</H2><P>If the blood of bulls and goats was not able to remove sin, as we mentioned earlier, how then were those in the Old Testament saved? It was by the cross. Man had sinned. Hence, only a man could accomplish the redemption of sin. Although the animals were innocent, and although they were without blemish, they could not redeem man from his sins. Why then did God promise in Leviticus 17 that the blood of creatures was able to redeem one from sin? There must be some very profound meaning here. The things of the law "are a shadow of the things to come, but the body is of Christ" (Col. 2:17). Hence, the sacrifices and the offerings in the Old Testament all refer to Christ. Although Christ had not yet died at the time of the first covenant, God intended that all the sacrifices offered at that time be a type of Christ. Their death was taken as the death of Christ. Through the blood of many animals, God saw the blood of His beloved Son. Through many bulls and goats, He saw "the Lamb of God." Through the many sacrifices, He saw the substitutional death of Christ. When He accepted those offerings, it was as if He was accepting the merit of the death of His Son. Because of this, man was redeemed from his sins. God reckoned the innocent bulls and goats as His dear Son. Hence, He could forgive the sinners based upon the sacrifices they offered. Every time the offerings were slaughtered, they spoke of the coming sacrifice of the Son of God as the sin offering on Golgotha and of His accomplishment of the eternal work of salvation. Because the Lord is a man, He is able to redeem man from sin. Because He is God, He is able to redeem all men, past and present, from their sins.</P><P>Those who offered the sacrifices in the Old Testament, consciously or unconsciously, believed in a coming crucified Savior. All their sacrifices were to turn them to the coming Savior. Although the Lord Jesus was not yet born at that time, faith did not look at what could be seen. Rather, it looked at what could not be seen. Faith saw a vicarious Savior from afar and trusted in Him. When the time came, the Son of God came and died for men. What had only been a matter of faith then became a fact.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>HOW ARE MEN SAVED IN THE NEW TESTAMENT?</H2><P>We know that we are in the New Testament age. How are we saved in this age? Christ has died and salvation is accomplished. If we believe in the Lord Jesus, which means that by faith we receive Him as the Savior, we will be saved. Some have a hard time understanding how Christ could have died for them before they were even born. Indeed this presents a problem to the physical senses. Yet to faith, this is a glorious truth.</P><P>First, we must realize that time cannot restrict God. To us mortals, a few decades is a long time. But our God is an eternal God. To Him, even a thousand years do not mean much. Although time can restrict us, it cannot restrict Him. Hence, even though we believe in a Lord who died once for us many years ago, we are saved.</P><P>The Bible says that the Lord Jesus offered up Himself once and accomplished the work of redemption (Heb. 7:27). He is God. This is why He can transcend time to redeem those who were thousands of years before Him as well as those who are thousands of years after Him. Not only can He redeem those thousands of years after Him; if, unfortunately, the world goes on for millions of years more, His redemption will still be effective. Once He finished His work, it was accomplished forever. If a sinner desires to be saved now, the Lord does not need to die for him again. This one only needs to accept the merit of the Lord's one offering, and he will be saved. Our faith is not restricted by time either. Faith can lead one into the reality of eternity. As men in the Old Testament looked to a coming Savior and were saved, in the same way we look to a past Savior and are saved. The fact that the matter is past does not mean that it is over. Rather, it means that it is done. The men in the Old Testament looked forward. We at the present time look backward. Faith caused those in the Old Testament to accept a coming Savior. Will not our faith cause us to accept a past Savior?</P><P>In reading Hebrews 9:12-15 it would be very meaningful if we link together the three "eternals" in these verses. The Lord accomplished an eternal redemption. By offering up Himself to God through the eternal Spirit, we have obtained an eternal inheritance. Hence, whenever men believe in Him, they receive this redemption. We ought to realize that the worth of the cross is not determined by man. Rather, it is determined by God. God considers the redemption of the cross as eternal. Therefore, we sinners who have no righteousness of our own should acknowledge God's word as true and should act according to His word and believe in the cross of His Son and be saved.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE TIMELESSNESS OF THE CROSS</H2><P>This is the most crucial point. Although the Bible says that the Lord Jesus offered up the sacrifice for sins once, it points out that "having offered one sacrifice for sins, [He] sat down forever..." (Heb. 10:12). The word "one" means that the Lord's sacrifice for sins was perfect; He only needed to redeem man from sins once. However, this sacrifice for sins is forever. It is an eternal sacrifice for sins! This means that not only is the effect of this sacrifice for sins eternal, but the sacrifice itself is eternal. Although Christ has resurrected and is living forever, it seems that His cross continues to exist! May we realize the timelessness of the cross! It is not a past event of nineteen hundred years ago. It remains fresh today.</P><P>Revelation 13:8 says, "The Lamb who was slain from the foundation of the world." Our Lord is the slain Lamb from the foundation of the world until now and forever. To Him, the cross is not merely an event of a certain time, on a certain date of a certain month of a certain year. Rather, it is something that has existed since the foundation of the world until now. When He created man, He foreknew the price of the coming redemption. He created man with His power. In the same way He redeemed man with His blood. It is as if He was crucified from the beginning when He created man. For thousands of years He suffered the prolonged suffering of the cross. The one death on Golgotha merely signified the grief God's Spirit had borne for a long time. What grace this is! What wonder this is! We have no words to express the meaning of this verse. Before the Lord Jesus left heaven, and while He was still in glory, He knew the suffering of the cross already. He knew during the thousands of years before He came. He knew this at the time of creation. Since eternity past, the cross has been in God's heart. When we consider how in eternity past God knew that He was to create man and that man would become fallen, we realize how His heart, humanly speaking, must have grieved over it. Because He so loved men, He ordained before the foundation of the world that Christ would die on our behalf (1 Pet. 1:20). Although Christ only appeared once in the last times for our sins, through His love for the world He has been grieving and aching since the foundation of the world, as if He has been crucified a thousand times already! What a pity that many people are now still grieving Him, as if crucifying Him afresh. When we realize such love of His, we cannot help but marvel and stand in awe before Him! This is God's heart! If we realize this, will we not love God all the more? Hence, humanly speaking, those in the Old Testament believed in a coming cross, while those in the New Testament believe in a past cross. Actually, there is no distinction of time and period. The cross of the Old Testament is a present one, and the cross of the New Testament is also a present one. May the Lord open our eyes to see that the cross is timeless.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE ETERNAL FRESHNESS OF THE CROSS</H2><P>Those in the Old Testament have died. We shall, therefore, pay attention only to those in the present time. Many people push the cross back nineteen hundred years and consider it as old, outdated, and obsolete. Although it is true that world history considers Christ's Golgotha a historical event, in the believers' spiritual experience the cross of Christ is still a fresh event. It is not old, outdated, or obsolete. We can consider a few verses.</P><P>Hebrews 10:19 and 20 say, "Having therefore, brothers, boldness for entering the Holy of Holies in the blood of Jesus, which entrance He initiated for us as a new and living way through the veil, that is, His flesh." In order to understand these two verses, we have to understand the things mentioned in the Old Testament. In the ancient times, the tabernacle was divided into two sections. The first section was called the Holy Place, and the second section was called the Holy of Holies. The two sections were divided by a veil. Those entering the Holy of Holies had to pass through the veil. God's glory was manifested within the Holy of Holies. No ordinary person could enter the Holy of Holies. Only the high priest could enter it once a year. Before he entered it, he had to first offer sacrifices and make atonement for himself and the people and had to go in with the blood of bulls and goats. For us now, we enter the Holy of Holies through the blood of the Lord Jesus. This signifies the cross. Formerly the high priest entered the Holy of Holies only once a year. Now, through the cross of the Lord Jesus we can enter the Holy of Holies any time. What is the meaning of entering the Holy of Holies? It means that we can come to God to confess our sins, fellowship with Him, and be in His presence.</P><P>Those entering the Holy of Holies had to pass through the veil. The veil signifies the body of the Lord Jesus. When He was crucified, the veil of the temple was rent in half from top to bottom. If the veil had not been rent, men could not have passed through it. If the Lord Jesus had not died and His body not been broken, men could not pass through Him and could not enter the Holy of Holies. At the present time, we come to God through the death of the Lord Jesus. This also signifies the cross.</P><P>Our Bible tells us that this way through the veil was opened up for us by the Lord Jesus. Truly, He willingly gave up His life to redeem us.</P><P>We need to pay attention to the fact that this way is "new and living." The word "new" in the original language refers to something freshly offered or freshly sacrificed. Here we see the eternal freshness of the cross! The high priest could not rely on the offerings or sacrifices of the previous years. He had to have fresh offerings and fresh sacrifices. He only dared to enter and was able to enter the Holy of Holies through the blood of these animals. What about us now? We come to God by the blood of the Lord and through His body. Every time we come before God, we do not have to offer up sacrifices afresh. Our Sacrifice is forever fresh! The Lord Jesus' cross does not turn old with the years. Its freshness is the same today and forever as it was at the time of crucifixion. Every time we come before God, we can sense the freshness of the Lord's cross. In the ancient times, unless the high priest had fresh blood of newly offered sacrifices, he would die before the Lord. The sacrifice of previous years could not redeem him from his current year's sins. If God did not consider the Lord's redemptive sacrifice as eternally fresh, we would have perished long ago. Thank the Lord that the cross is forever fresh before the Lord. The Lord considers the crucifixion as something freshly accomplished.</P><P>This way is also "living." This word can also be translated as "forever living." This way is a way that is "freshly offered." It is also a way that is "forever living." Christ has died and has resurrected; He has accomplished salvation for us and has led us to God. We should know that Christ has resurrected and that His resurrection remains until today. We should also know that Christ has died and that His substitutional death continues until today. The greatest events in the earthly life of Christ were His death and resurrection. Both are not past, obsolete events. They are still fresh today. Since we have such a fresh, redeeming Savior, we should receive Him and come to God through Him to receive forgiveness and blessing.</P><P>Revelation 5 records how John saw the Lord Jesus Christ in heaven. He said, "And I saw in the midst of the throne and of the four living creatures and in the midst of the elders a Lamb standing as having just been slain" (v. 6). This is a picture of the future. When John saw the Lord in heaven, it was many years after Golgotha. Yet the Lord was like One who had just been slain. The words "having just been slain" can also be translated as "having been freshly slain." In heaven at the time of the ushering in of eternity, the Lord will still be the One who is freshly slain! Oh, the eternal freshness of the cross! Truly the cross passes through all ages and remains fresh! If the cross will be fresh in heaven in that day, how can we consider it as being old today? In the future when the heavenly glory breaks forth, the glory of the cross will prove unfading! When God's redeemed ascend to heaven, they will find the redemption of the cross still as fresh as before!</P><P>One point deserves our attention. In the Old Testament Christ is twice called the Lamb (Isa. 53:7; Jer. 11:19). In the Gospels and Acts He is mentioned as the Lamb three times (John 1:29, 36; Acts 8:32). In the Epistles He is mentioned as the Lamb once (1 Pet. 1:19). However, in Revelation He is mentioned as the Lamb twenty-eight times! The glory of the Lord's cross will outshine all ages! God purposely called His Son the Lamb in this book of eternity. The Lamb here is seen as having been freshly slain. The wound is still there! The eternal wound guarantees eternal salvation. The crucifixion of the Lamb becomes our eternal memorial. God can never forget this. The angels can never forget this, and those ascended and saved ones can never forget the redemption of the cross. Who will receive this eternal salvation? The cross is the only unshakable place. All those who have sinned should come.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE MEMORIAL OF THE CROSS</H2><P>God Himself knows the eternal worth of His Son's cross. He has manifested to all the eternal freshness of the cross of His Son. Now He desires to gain the redeemed ones so that they would know this fact also. The realization of the eternal freshness of the cross brings power. The realization of the eternal freshness of the cross brings love. The realization of the eternal freshness of the cross brings victory. The realization of the eternal freshness of the cross brings longsuffering. If we truly know the freshness of the cross, what inspiration we will receive from it! What motivation we will derive from it! If the cross is not old in our heart, we will surely have an intimate fellowship with our Lord. If a believer has forgotten the cross, it means that he has forgotten the Lord.</P><P>The Lord intends that His cross be forever fresh in our spirit and our mind. This is why He told us, "This do, as often as you drink it, unto the remembrance of Me" (1 Cor. 11:25). The words "as often as" imply "frequently." The reason the Lord established His supper is for His saints to remember Him always in His death. He foreknew that many would consider His cross as obsolete. This was why He charged His disciples to always remember His death at the Lord's supper. He knew that worldly affairs, distractions, and temptations would come and would secretly rob the freshness of the cross from us. This is why He charged us to take the supper often and to remember Him. How fresh was the cross to us when we first believed! But after many days, the cross seems to have become hazy. When we first realized the victory of the cross, how fresh it was to us! But through frequent mention of its glory, the cross seems to have become common. However, the Lord does not want to see us losing the freshness of the cross. He desires that we remember the cross often and always have the death of the Lord before us.</P><P>It is a pity that we have lost the inspiration of the cross of the Lord Jesus. The crucifixion of the Lord Jesus should be openly portrayed before our eyes all the time (Gal. 3:1). We must never consider the Lord's cross as a mere historical monument.</P><P>The book of Galatians is an epistle on the cross. When the cross was openly portrayed before the Galatians, how free they were! When they tried to receive the Holy Spirit through the keeping of the law or be perfected through the work of the flesh, they lost the freshness of the cross. One can tell the spiritual condition of a saint just by his attitude toward the cross. If he considers the cross as something old, it shows that he is cut off from the source of his power.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE CROSS AND SPIRITUALITY</H2><P>What are the benefits of knowing the freshness of the cross? The benefits are innumerable. We know that anything new easily touches men. If something happened long ago, it does not have the power to stir men up. If we have the Lord's cross openly portrayed before us every day, how much we will be moved by it! Joseph in the ancient times was only willing to be Christ's disciple in secret. Nicodemus only dared come to see the Lord in the night. But when both saw the crucifixion of the Lord, they were greatly moved. As a result, they risked offending the crowd and asked for the body of the Lord for burial. The cross can make the most fearful men the most courageous ones. When they beheld Jesus on the cross and the way He suffered and was rebuked by men, the love of the cross inspired them and moved them. Hence, if we have the death of Christ before us all the time, we will be moved in the same way that they were moved. The cross will then become our strength.</P><P>"Should we continue in sin that grace may abound?" (Rom. 6:1). We should be able to answer this question. If we truly see the Lord's cross all the time, if we truly see how He suffered there, if we see the wounds on His hands and feet and the crown of thorns on His head, if we see how His love and blood mingled, and if we see His sufferings and sorrow, will we not be deeply moved, and will we not cease from doing things that do not please Him or cause Him sorrow? It is because we lack the eternal fresh revelation of the cross before us that we despise the love of the Lord.</P><P>If the cross on which the Lord died for us is forever fresh, our crucifixion with Him will also become unchanging. If we have a fresh revelation of the cross day by day, we will add to ourselves many fresh experiences of faith in our dying together with Him. It is because we do not see a daily cross that we have many experiences of sin resurrecting in us. If we see the eternal freshness of the cross and its ever unchanging nature, our death to sin will also be unchanging. Many children of God fail because they do not realize that the death of the cross is not just something that happened a long time ago, but something that is with us continually all the time.</P><P>We know that many times we fall unconsciously. Thank God the Father, who does not reject us because of this. The Bible says that "the blood of Jesus His Son cleanses us from every sin" (1 John 1:7). He did not cleanse us just once. The blood of His Son is still continually cleansing us. The word "cleanses" in the original has the sense of a continual action. This is the perpetual work of the cross. How wonderful it is that God has prepared for us such a salvation! If we stumble by accident, and we come to Him and confess our sins, He will forgive us, and the blood of His Son will cleanse us from all sin. What eternal freshness there is in the cross!</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>ETERNAL SALVATION</H2><P>If we realize this, we will break forth in loud praises to God the Father. Unfortunately, many people do not know that they are saved forever. We are either not saved or saved forever. If we have once truly accepted the Lord's sacrifice for sin, and if we have once truly trusted in the merit of His cross, His cross will forever speak for us. "This is the law of the burnt offering: the burnt offering itself shall be upon the hearth on the altar all night until the morning, and the fire of the altar shall be kept burning on it" (Lev. 6:9). The burnt offering is a type of Christ, and the altar is a type of the cross. The night is a type of the present Christless age. It is the same night as the one in Romans 13:12. Since the Sun of righteousness (the Lord Jesus) departed from this world, this world has become the night. It will remain the night until He comes again. The burnt offering shall be burning until daybreak! In the present age, the merit of the Lord's redemption is continually pleading for us! In the night, the Israelites may have been in the camp still murmuring, but the burnt offering on the altar continually interceded for them! We should realize that in the same way the blood is interceding for us. Once we have accepted the cross, it speaks for us forever! This is the eternal salvation.</P><P>In the future, when we see the cross in heaven, it will not have become old through the ages. For this reason, the salvation we have received will not become a mere monument through time. Eternity will not be a monotonous and tasteless life. Eternity may be long, but it will not take away the glory of the cross. In eternity we will see God unfolding the glory of the cross for us bit by bit. Lord, teach us the eternal freshness of the cross!</P><P>For what reason do the heavenly hosts praise the Lord? "Worthy is the Lamb who has been slain to receive the power and riches and wisdom and strength and honor and glory and blessing" (Rev. 5:12). At that time we will also praise the Lord forever because of His cross. The cross is the subject of the Bible on earth today. It will be the cause of praise in glory in the future.</P><P>Brothers, how fresh is the cross! The cross does not know what time is. The cross does not know what oldness is. May we be constantly moved by it! Oh, may we be lost in the cross all the days of our life! Oh, may the cross not lose its power on us for a day! Oh, may we allow the cross to do a deeper work in us every day! May the Father open our eyes to see the mystery hidden in the cross of His Son. "But far be it from me to boast except in the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ" (Gal. 6:14).</P><H1 CLASS=MSG>MESSAGE THREE</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>THE TWO NATURES-<br>A TALK WITH YOUNG BELIEVERS</H1><H2 CLASS=HEAD4>Issue No. 5</H2><P>A great number of people who have believed in the Lord Jesus as their Savior have discovered a new experience soon after they have believed: in their hearts it seems that there are two natures. These two natures are incompatible with each other. Of the two natures, one is evil and the other is good. Sometimes, when the good nature gains the upper hand, a person becomes very loving, patient, good, and meek. Sometimes, when the evil nature prevails, the person becomes very jealous, ill-tempered, wicked, and stubborn. Those believers who are under this kind of condition experience sudden ups and downs in their life. Sometimes, their spiritual condition seems to be on the mountaintop; at other times, it seems to be in the deep valley. This kind of spiritual life is also like the waves of the sea, at times high and at times low. Believers under this kind of condition are bewildered! Why is there the joy? Why is there the sorrow? Why do we sometimes love a certain person that much and have the ability to tolerate so much of others' ridicule? Why at other times are we so void of love and so impatient? When such a person is at his spiritual peak, he experiences unspeakable joy and peace. When he is spiritually low, he is filled with sorrow and depression. Before such a person believed in the Lord, he did not have much feeling even when he sinned. But now it is very different. He may speak a wrong word or commit a wrong act by accident. Formerly, these things would have been considered trivial, and the conscience would not have been bothered at all. But now, he falls into much self-condemnation. Although no one condemns him, he rebukes himself for doing these things.</P><P>Such self-condemnation is quite unbearable. It causes the believer to feel ashamed and embarrassed, to feel guilty and condemned. Only after he finds out that the Lord has fully forgiven his sins and he has recovered his spiritual joy can he feel happy again. However, this kind of happiness does not last long. Those believers who remain on this level of life soon find themselves caused to stumble again and their previous joy once more lost! Soon after, they find themselves committing the same sin they committed before! It seems so natural to fall into sin. It is as if a power from within has overpowered them in an instant; they are led uncontrollably to speak the wrong words and do the wrong things. Under such a condition, the believers invariably become penitent. They invariably make many vows and resolutions before the Lord. They set up for themselves many ordinances to bind themselves, in the hope that they will not commit the same error again. At the same time, they ask for the cleansing of the Lord's blood afresh and seek for another filling of the Holy Spirit by the Lord. After this, they seem quite satisfied and think that their last sin is behind them, that from now on they are on their way to holiness. However, the fact always turns out contrary to their wish. Soon, perhaps a few days later, they fail again! Once more they fall into deep remorse, bemoaning their own failure and feeling sorrowful at heart; their hopes for holiness have been dashed. All their resolutions and regulations cannot help them. Although they may receive the Lord's forgiveness after this, it becomes difficult for them to believe that they can keep themselves from sinning again. Although they still pray that the Lord would keep them, their heart is full of doubts. They begin to wonder if the Lord can really keep them from sin.</P><P>Young believers frequently fall into this kind of experience. Almost daily they come under self-condemnation and sorrow. Sometimes they may condemn themselves several times a day or even several dozen times a day. Such a life of wandering in the wilderness causes them to doubt even their own regeneration. Does not the Scripture say, "He cannot sin, because he has been begotten of God" (1 John 3:9)? They think that if they always sin, it probably means that they are not yet regenerated! The despondency and disappointment at such times are difficult to express even with their tears.</P><P>Since these ones have experienced much failure, they make up their mind to be on the alert, to resolve to fight the last battle against the indwelling sin. They remind themselves to watch out for their former weaknesses. They try purposely to improve themselves in areas where they constantly failed before. They resolve as best they can to put off "the sin which so easily entangles us" (Heb. 12:1). This of course affords them much help in their outward conduct. Yet the inward activities of sin continue as before; there is no quelling of its energy. In the end, they fail again. Consider the example of the temper. After a believer realizes that his besetting sin is his quick temper, he will try to control himself in everything. This may work with lesser irritations; it may work in one or two temptations. However, though he may hold back his temper temporarily, further irritations from others will cause his temper to break loose. He may succeed a few times, but as soon as he becomes a little careless, he loses his temper again. At the time of the temptation, he may experience much conflict in his heart. On the one hand, he thinks that he should not lose his temper and should be gentle. On the other hand, he considers the unreasonableness and offense of the other party, and he feels it necessary to vindicate himself by punishing such behavior. This kind of conflict is found commonly among believers. Unfortunately, the result is often failure rather than victory. Once they exhaust their patience, they fail again. A genuinely regenerated person often goes through this kind of experience at the beginning of his Christian life. We do not know how many tears are shed because of defeat in this conflict!</P><P>My dear brothers, do you have the experiences we have mentioned? Do you want to know the reason for them? Do you want to overcome? May the Lord bless what we are discussing today so that we will learn to grow in His grace.</P><P>Before we speak of our present condition, we should first understand the kind of person we were before we believed in the Lord. After that, we will speak of our condition after we believed in the Lord. We know that we are persons made up of three parts-the spirit, the soul, and the body. The spirit is the organ with which we fellowship with God. Animals have no spirit. Hence, they can never worship God. The soul is the seat of our personality. Our will, mind, emotion, and sentiments are all functions of the soul. The body is our outward shell. Although man has become fallen, he still possesses these three parts. After man is regenerated, he still has the same three parts. When God created man, He created him with a self-consciousness; man was a living creature with consciousness. He had a spirit. Hence, he was different from other lower kinds of creatures. He had a soul. Hence, he was different from the angels of light, who are purely spirits. The center of man was his spirit; it controlled his whole being. It controlled his soul and his body. Man was living totally for God; the emotions of his soul and the demands of his body were all headed up by his spirit, and they were for glorifying God and worshipping God.</P><P>But alas, man fell! This fall did not annul any of the three elements in man. However, the order of these three elements has been upset. The condition in the garden of Eden shows us clearly that mankind rebelled against God; his love for God ceased, and he declared his independence from God. Genesis 3:6 says, "And when the woman saw that the tree was good for food [this was the lust of the body, which comes first] and that it was pleasant to the eyes, and a tree to be desired [this was the love of the emotion in the soul, which comes next] to make one wise [this was Satan's suggestion, `And ye shall be as gods, knowing' (3:5); this was the spirit rejecting God, and man satisfying the cravings of the soul and the body; this comes last]." In this way, man fell, and his spirit, soul, and body were all affected. The spirit became subject to the soul, and the soul was controlled by its many senses. The body developed many abnormal cravings and lusts, which enticed the soul. Originally the spirit took the lead. Now the body takes the lead to satisfy its lusts. In the Bible, this lust of the body is called the flesh. From this time on, man became flesh (Gen. 6:3). This flesh is now man's nature after he sinned; it is now his natural constitution. Our nature is the life principle or constitution that directs our whole being. Since the time of Adam, everyone born of woman bears this sinful nature; all of them are of the flesh. After understanding the origin of the flesh and how the flesh is just our sinful nature, we can now consider the character of this flesh. We cannot expect this flesh to improve. Human nature is hard to change. In fact, it will not change. The Lord Jesus said, "That which is born of the flesh is flesh." We should focus on the word "is." That which is born of the flesh is flesh. No matter how much a person reforms, improves, and cultivates himself, the flesh is still the flesh. No matter how much a person tries to perform charitable, benevolent acts, send relief aid, love others, or serve, he is still the flesh. Even if he can do all these things, he is still the flesh. "That which is born of the flesh is flesh." Since it is the flesh that is born, it will be the flesh that will result. No man on earth can change his flesh. Neither can God in heaven change man's flesh, that is, man's nature.</P><P>Since God saw that it was impossible to mend, improve, or change man's sinful nature, He brought in the present wonderful way of redemption. We know that the Lord Jesus died for us on the cross at Golgotha. We also know that when we believe in Him and receive Him as our Savior, we are saved. But why does God deliver us from death to life once we believe in His Son's name? If this believing does not involve an exchange in our life, which is different from a mere change, will not God be delivering a man who is still full of sin into heaven? There must surely be a profound message here.</P><P>After we have believed in the Lord Jesus, God does not leave us to walk according to the old sinful nature, that is, the flesh. He sentenced the Lord Jesus to death because He intended, on the one hand, that the Lord become sin for us, and on the other hand, that the old Adamic creation be crucified with Him, so that He could give us a new life. When we believed in the Lord Jesus as our Savior, God gave us this new life with its new nature. "Through these you might become partakers of the divine nature, having escaped the corruption which is in the world by lust" (2 Pet. 1:4). At the time we believed, He dispensed into us His own life, the life of God, with the nature of God. This nature is entirely new; it is totally different from our old sinful nature. This nature does not come from an improvement of our old nature. This mysterious transaction took place at the instant we believed in the Lord Jesus as our Savior. This is regeneration, which is to be born from above and to receive God's life and nature. This regeneration is not something that man feels. Rather, it is the work of God's Holy Spirit in our spirit, recovering our spirit's lost position and installing God's life in our spirit. "The wind blows where it wills, and you hear the sound of it, but you do not know where it comes from and where it goes; so is everyone who is born of the Spirit" (John 3:8). All those who have genuinely believed in the Lord Jesus have the Holy Spirit working in them in this way. Those who believe only with their mouth or their head are not regenerated. All those who have believed with their heart are saved (Rom. 10:9) and are surely regenerated.</P><P>Now, two natures emerge in a believer. One is the sinful nature, the flesh, which is the nature of old Adam. The other is the spiritual life, the "new spirit," which bears God's nature. Brothers, you have believed in the Lord Jesus, and you know that you are saved. For this reason, you are regenerated already. You should now know that there are two natures within you. These two natures are the cause of your numerous conflicts. The reason you fluctuate up and down and alternate between victory and defeat is that two natures are exercising their influence over you. These two natures are the key to the riddle of your life of struggling.</P><P>For a young believer to have such experiences of inward conflict and condemnation proves that he is regenerated. An unregenerated person is still dead in sin. Although he may at times be condemned in his conscience, such feeling is very ill-defined. Without the new nature, it is obvious that a person will not experience the conflict between the new nature and the old.</P><P>The Bible clearly describes this conflict between the new nature and the old. In Romans 7, Paul vividly portrayed this kind of life of conflict through his own experience. He said, "For what I work out, I do not acknowledge; for what I will, this I do not practice; but what I hate, this I do" (v. 15). This is the conflict of the new and the old natures. The description here is that of the experience of a newborn believer. At such times, he is still a babe in Christ. He is in the infancy of his spiritual life, and he is still childish and powerless. The "I" in the "what I will" and "what I hate" refers to the new nature. Although the new nature desires God's will and hates sin, the other nature, the old nature, is too strong. This, together with the weakness of a person's will, compels that one to sin. However, the new nature does not sin. "Now then it is no longer I that work it out, but sin that dwells in me" (v. 17). The first "I" is the "I" of the new nature. "Sin" is another name for the sinful nature. Therefore, this verse means that the one who sins is not the new "I," but the sinful nature. Of course, this does not remove man's responsibility. Paul went on to describe the positive contradiction between the old and the new natures, that is, the contradiction between the sinful nature and the spiritual life.</P><P>"For I know that in me, that is, in my flesh, nothing good dwells; for to will is present with me, but to work out the good is not. For I do not do the good which I will; but the evil which I do not will, this I practice...I find then the law with me who wills to do the good, that is, the evil is present with me. For I delight in the law of God according to the inner man, but I see a different law in my members, warring against the law of my mind and making me a captive to the law of sin which is in my members" (Rom. 7:18-23). This is indeed the common experience of all believers: to will to do good, yet be unable to do it, and to will to oppose evil, yet be unable to reject it. When temptation comes, a power (the "law") suppresses our desire for holiness. As a result, we speak what we ought not speak and do what we ought not do. Despite many resolutions and vows, we are unable to stop this power from working.</P><P>In Galatians Paul described again the conflict between these two natures. "For the flesh lusts against the Spirit, and the Spirit against the flesh; for these oppose each other that you would not do the things that you desire" (5:17). The old nature and the new nature are enemies of each other. Both strive to gain absolute supremacy over us. The old nature has its desires and its power, and the new nature has its also. The two natures exist in us simultaneously. Hence, there is the constant conflict. They are like Esau and Jacob in the womb of Rebekah; the two were diametrically opposed to each other, and at times they fought with each other in the womb. When the Son of God was on earth, all the powers on earth plotted to kill Him. In the same way, while the Son of God lives in our heart as our new life, all the lusts in our flesh strive to remove Him.</P><P>Before we go on, we should first understand the characteristics of the two natures. The old nature was born of our flesh. In it, "nothing good dwells" (Rom. 7:18). The new nature is from God. It "cannot sin" (1 John 3:9). The new and the old natures are completely different. Not only do they come from different sources; even their functions are different. However, both exist in the believers. The old nature is the flesh. "And those who are in the flesh cannot please God" (Rom. 8:8). The new nature is the new spirit. "God is Spirit, and those who worship Him must worship in spirit and reality." Without comparison with the new nature, the old nature, humanly speaking, is not too bad, despite some self-excusing inclinations and lusts. Yet, when a person is regenerated, the new nature comes in with the new life. When both the new and the old natures are put side by side, the true characteristics of the old nature are exposed.</P><P>With the new nature as a contrast, the old nature is exposed to be evil, worldly, and devilish. The new nature is holy, heavenly, and divine. Because the old nature, with the passing of time, has become so deeply intertwined with the person himself, it takes quite a period of time to remove this old nature in experience. The new nature has just come into being. Since man's flesh and sinful nature have become too strong, the growth and function of the new nature are suppressed. Of course, we are only speaking from man's point of view. This is like the thorns choking the growth of the seed of the word. Because the two natures are opposite one to another, when temptation comes, a person experiences fierce conflicts. Since the old nature is strong and the new nature weak, a person often ends up doing what he does not desire to do and not doing what he does desire to do. Since the new nature is holy, when a person fails, he feels repentant and condemns himself, and he pleads for the sin-cleansing blood. Brothers, by now, you should understand the reason for your conflicting experiences. This kind of conflict shows most assuredly that you are regenerated.</P><P>The most crucial question now is: how can we overcome? In other words, how can we reject the power and work of the old nature, and walk according to the aspirations of the new nature, and thus please the Lord? Let us read three verses:</P><P>"But they who are of Christ Jesus have crucified the flesh with its passions and its lusts" (Gal. 5:24).</P><P>"If we live by the Spirit, let us also walk by the Spirit"; "But I say, Walk by the Spirit and you shall by no means fulfill the lust of the flesh" (vv. 25, 16).</P><P>These three verses tell us two ways to overcome the flesh, that is, the sinful nature, the old nature, and the old Adamic nature. Actually, the two ways are merely two aspects, or two phases, of one way. The cross and the Holy Spirit are the unique way to overcome the sinful nature. Other than this way, any human resolutions, determinations, or vows to charity are destined for failure.</P><P>We have seen that all our failures are caused by the tenaciousness of the sinful nature; we sink to such a low condition because of it. Hence, whether or not we will overcome depends on whether or not we are able to deal with this sinful nature, which is the flesh. Thank God that though we are helpless, He has the way. He has prepared a way for us on the cross. When the Lord Jesus was crucified on the cross, not only did He die for us, but He crucified our flesh with Him on the cross. Hence, all those who belong to Christ Jesus and are regenerated have their flesh crucified. When He died on the cross, our flesh was crucified there as well. Both the substitutional death and the identifying death have been accomplished by the Lord Jesus. Both are fully accomplished. Formerly, we believed in His substitutional death and were regenerated. Now, in the same way, we believe that our flesh is crucified with Him, and we are brought into the experience of the death of the flesh.</P><P>We know that the flesh is always the flesh. This is why God gave us a new life and a new nature. But what shall we do with the flesh? Since God considered it hopeless and impossible, He decided to terminate it, that is, to put it to death. There is no better way than to cause the flesh to die. Hence, "they who are of Christ Jesus have crucified the flesh with its passions and its lusts." This puts the flesh to death. This is what the Lord Jesus has accomplished; He has accomplished it already. By crucifying our flesh with Him, it becomes possible now for us to put to death the sinful nature. This has been accomplished without any effort of our own.</P><P>How can this co-crucifixion become our experience? We have said that the way is by faith. Romans 6:11 says, "So also you, reckon yourselves to be dead to sin." Sin here refers to the sinful nature which is the flesh. By ourselves, we cannot cause the flesh to die. The only way is by reckoning. Reckoning is an exercise of our will and our faith. This means that in our daily life, we should adopt the attitude that we are dead to the flesh, that we believe in God's word, and that we consider all God's words to be true. God says that our flesh has been crucified with the Lord Jesus; I believe that my flesh is indeed crucified. On the one hand, we believe that we are dead. On the other hand, we adopt the attitude that we are truly dead. If we do this, we will have the genuine experience of dying to sin.</P><P>If we reckon this way, we will see the cross freeing us, and the flesh will become powerless. It is true that once we reckon ourselves dead, we will experience instant victory. However, many people experience a gradual deliverance from the power of the flesh. This is either due to their own foolishness or to the lingering of evil spirits. If we persist in faith and if we take the proper attitude in our will, we will eventually overcome. However, this does not mean that henceforth there is no more sinful nature in us and that only the new nature remains. If we say this, we fall into heresy. Not only does this obscure the teaching of the Bible, but it betrays the experience of the saints. Until we are delivered from this body of sin, we will never be free from the "flesh"-the sinful nature-which comes from the body of sin. Even though we have accepted the work of the cross, the fact that the flesh still exists means that we must continually "walk by the Spirit." Only by doing this, will we "by no means fulfill the lust of the flesh."</P><P>The cross is the instrument by which we crucify the flesh. The Holy Spirit is the power by which we keep the flesh from resurrecting. On the negative side, we should believe in the co-crucifixion of the cross for the elimination of a life in the flesh. On the positive side, we should walk according to the Spirit so that the flesh will have no chance to be rekindled. Many believers experience the resurrection of their flesh because they fail in this one point. Every time we walk contrary to the Holy Spirit, we give opportunity to the flesh to reign. If in everything we walk according to the Spirit, the flesh will not have any opportunity.</P><P>A person can read about this way of overcoming the flesh, the sinful nature, from the Bible; he can hear about it from others. But only when he encounters it in his experience will he realize that it is real. I often tell others that they can experience such a matter the minute they believe. Yet for myself, it took me a long time before I experienced it! What does this mean? Many times we merely strive. Although we say that we trust in the cross, thirty percent of the time we trust in ourselves and in our own "reckoning." Many times God allows us to be defeated so that in the end we would realize that nothing is trustworthy in our experience. Even our own "reckoning" with which we "reckon" ourselves dead is of no merit. This is why it is true to say that as soon as we truly reckon, we have the experience of victory, and it is equally true to say that we enter such experience only through a gradual understanding.</P><P>Brothers, by now you can understand our two natures and the way to overcome the flesh. While you are reading, you can exercise your faith to reckon yourself dead to sin, and you can pray that the Holy Spirit of the Lord will apply the cross of the Lord Jesus deeply in you, so that you can overcome sin in your experience. After this, you should resolve to walk by the Holy Spirit. Previously, you have failed in your resolution. Now, you should ask the Holy Spirit to strengthen your will, so that it will be able to incline itself to the new nature. The will is like a rudder; it can turn the whole ship. However, a rudder that does not work is useless. After the Holy Spirit has strengthened you, you should exercise this will to walk according to the Holy Spirit. Remember that the flesh never disappears; it is always there. If you walk by the Holy Spirit, you will be able to crucify the flesh on the cross continually. Otherwise, the flesh will cause suffering to you. The meaning of walking by the Spirit is to trust in the Holy Spirit in a calm way in everything, so that you will bear the nine-in-one fruit of the Holy Spirit. The Lord will lead you experientially step by step into the mystery of this matter. However, on your part, you should be faithful.</P><H1 CLASS=MSG>MESSAGE FOUR</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>THE MESSENGER OF THE CROSS</H1><H2 CLASS=HEAD4>Issue No. 7</H2><P CLASS=INDENT1>(The following article which appeared in Issue No. 7 of The Christian "Spiritual Teachings" is an excerpt from "The Messenger of the Cross" in Volume Two, Chapter Two of The Collected Works of Watchman Nee.)</P><P>At the present time, we should pay attention to the word which we preach. We do not have to mention those who preach the wrong gospel. Their belief is in error anyway. What we preach is the crucifixion of the Lord Jesus Christ and how it saves sinners from the condemnation of sin and the power of sin. When we preach, we pay much attention to the outline, the logic, and the thought. We do our best to make our doctrines clear. In this way, even the most unlearned person may understand. We also pay attention to man's psyche. We try as hard as we can in our homiletics to match man's psychology. What we preach is truthful and scriptural-our topic is the cross of the Lord Jesus. We know that the Lord Jesus died for sinners on the cross so that all who believe in Him can be saved apart from any work. We also know that the crucifixion of the Lord Jesus is not only for substitution but also for the crucifixion of the sinner and his sin together with Him. We know the way to be saved. We know how to die with the Lord, how to apply the death of the Lord by faith, and how to die with Him to deal with sin and self. We are also clear about other related doctrines in the Bible. Our preaching is presented in a nice and clear way so that anyone in the audience can understand. The audience pays much attention to us when we preach the cross of the Lord; they like it and are touched by it. We may even be gifted in our eloquence and be able to present the truth in a persuasive way which causes us to think that our work is very effective. We may think that our work is very effective! Under such circumstances, we ought to see many people receiving life and many believers gaining the more abundant life. However, the results are the opposite of what we expect. Although the audience may be touched at the meeting hall, they do not gain anything that we hope to see them gain after they leave the meeting hall, even though the speech is still fresh in their minds. They do not have any change in their lives. They understand what we preach, but it does not have any influence on their daily living. They only store the word preached in their brains. They do not apply it in their hearts.</P><P>In recent years, the Lord has told me to be careful about this kind of preaching. We do not want to be popular orators (our Lord is a Life-giver); we want to be channels of life, directing life into people's hearts. When we preach the cross, we should have the life of the cross flowing into others' lives. The saddest thing to me is that so many people are preaching the cross today, but men have not gained God's life. Men seem to agree with and gladly receive our words, but they have not received God's life. Many times as we preach the substitutional death of the cross, men seem to understand the meaning and reason for substitution, and they seem to be touched at the time. However, we cannot see the grace of God working in the audience to the point where they truly obtain the regenerated life. We also preach the co-crucifixion of the cross. We explain it in a very clear, moving way. At the time when people hear it, they may pray and may make up their minds to die together with the Lord and to gain the experiences of overcoming sin and self. But after the whole thing is over, we do not see them gaining the more abundant life of God. Such results sadden me very much. It humbles me before the Lord to seek His light. If you have the same experience as I have, I hope that you will grieve before the Lord as I do and will regret our failures. What we indeed lack now are men and women who will preach the cross, but what we need more than this are preachers who will preach the cross in the power of the Holy Spirit.</P><P>Let us now read the Word of God. Paul said, "And I, when I came to you, brothers, came not according to excellence of speech or of wisdom, announcing to you the mystery of God. For I did not determine to know anything among you except Jesus Christ, and this One crucified. And I was with you in weakness and in fear and in much trembling; and my speech and my proclamation were not in persuasive words of wisdom but in demonstration of the Spirit and of power" (1 Cor. 2:1-4). In these verses we see three things: (1) the message that Paul preached, (2) the person of Paul himself, and (3) the way Paul preached his message.</P><P>The message Paul preached was the Lord Jesus Christ and Him crucified. The subject of his preaching was the cross of Christ and the crucified Christ. He did not know anything except this. If we forget the cross and do not make the cross and Christ our unique subject, how much will we and our audience miss! I believe that we are surely not those who do not preach the cross.</P><P>Our message and our subject may be good. However, do we not have the experience of having a good message yet being unable to dispense life to others? Let me point out that inasmuch as the message we preach is important, if it cannot give life to others, our work is mostly in vain. We should remember that the goal of our work is to give life to people. We preach the substitutional death of the cross in order that God can give His life to those who believe. If others are stirred up or excited or even repent and agree with what we preach, but do not have God's life in them, what good will this do? They may show their sympathy outwardly, but they are not saved. Therefore, our goal is neither to make people repent by themselves nor to influence them in their mind, but to dispense God's life into them so that they can have life and be saved. Even when we preach the deeper truths or try to help others to understand the truth of co-crucifixion, the same principle holds true. It is easy to make people know and understand what we preach. It is also not hard to make others accept our teachings in their mind. Any believer with a little knowledge can understand if you explain matters to him clearly enough. However, if you want him to gain life and power and to experience what you preach, there is no other way except for God to dispense through you the richer life into him. We should know that our only work is to be the channels of God's life, conveying life into others' spirits. Therefore, even if the subject or the message we preach is good, we still need to find out whether or not we are the suitable channels for God to convey life into others.</P><P>The message Paul preached was the cross of the Lord Jesus Christ. The message he preached was not in vain because he was a living channel of life. He begot many people through the gospel of the cross. What he preached was the word of the cross. Concerning himself, he said that he was "in weakness and in fear and in much trembling." He was a crucified man! Only a crucified man can preach the crucified word. He had no confidence in himself. He did not rely on himself. Weakness, fear, trembling, being void of self-confidence, considering oneself as totally -these are the characteristics of a crucified man. He said, "I am crucified with Christ" (Gal. 2:20) and "I die daily" (1 Cor. 15:31). Only a dead Paul could preach a word on crucifixion. If he had not died in a genuine way, the life of the Lord's death could not have flowed out from him. It is easy to preach the cross, but it is not easy to preach it as a crucified man. Unless one is a crucified person, he cannot preach the word of the cross and cannot give to others the life of the cross. Strictly speaking, unless one knows the cross experientially, he is not worthy to preach the cross.</P><P>Paul's message was crucifixion. He himself was a crucified man, and he preached the cross by way of the cross. It was a man of the cross preaching the message of the cross with the spirit of the cross. Many times what we preach is the cross, but our attitude, our words, and our feeling do not seem like we are preaching the cross! Many preachings of the cross are not done in the spirit of the cross! Paul said, "I...came not according to excellence of speech or of wisdom, announcing to you the mystery of God." Here the mystery of God refers to the word of the cross. Paul did not preach the cross with excellence of speech or wisdom. "And my speech and my proclamation were not in persuasive words of wisdom but in demonstration of the Spirit and of power." This is the spirit of the cross. The cross is wisdom to God but foolishness to man (1 Cor. 1:23-24). When we preach the word of this foolishness, we should have the form of "foolishness," the attitude of "foolishness," and the speech of "foolishness." Paul gained the victory because he was a truly crucified man. He preached the cross with the spirit of the cross and the attitude of the cross. Those who have not experienced crucifixion will not be filled with the spirit of crucifixion, and they are not worthy to preach the word of the cross.</P><P>After seeing the experience of Paul, does it not tell us the reason for our failures? The message we preach may be good, but we should examine ourselves in the light of the Lord-are we truly crucified men? With what kind of spirit, word, and attitude do we preach the cross? May we humble ourselves before these questions so that God can have mercy upon us.</P><P>We are not talking about those who preach a "different gospel." We are talking only about those who preach "the gospel of God's grace." The word is not wrong, our message is not bad, but why do others not gain life? This must be due to the failure of the preacher! It is the person who is wrong, not the word that has lost its power. It is the man who has hindered God's life from flowing, not the Word of God that has lost its effect. When the man who preaches the cross does not himself have the experience of the cross nor the spirit of the cross, he cannot dispense to others the life of the cross. We cannot give others what we ourselves do not have. If the cross does not become our life, we cannot give the life of the cross to others. The failure of our work comes because we love to give the cross to others before we know whether or not we have the cross in ourselves. Those who are good at preaching to others must be good at preaching to themselves first. Otherwise, the Spirit will not co-work with them.</P><P>Although the message we preach is important, we must not stress the message too much and forget ourselves. We can gain some knowledge from books about the word of the cross which we preach. We can use our mind to look for many meanings in the Bible. However, all these are borrowed; they do not belong to us. Those who have clever minds are more dangerous than others. A preacher is in more danger than others, because all the studying, reading, researching, and listening may be done for others and not for himself. He may labor for others only to find himself starved spiritually! We can hear deep words about various aspects of the cross or read from books about the meanings of substitution and co-crucifixion. If we have a clever mind, we can even add a proper order to these teachings, so that when we speak, we can develop the things we have heard and thought in a very clear and sincere way, having everything well-organized and all the points clearly presented and the arguments neatly divided up. We may cause our audience to think that they have understood everything. Yet, despite the fact that they have understood everything, there is not an urging power to make the audience pursue what they have understood. They seem to think that to understand the doctrines of the cross is enough. They stop at the things they understand and do not pursue what the cross promises to give them. Even if the speaker understands the audience's mind, has a loud, sincere voice, and urges them not to understand the doctrine only but to pursue after the experience, his audience can only be stirred up at that moment. They still have not received life. They still have the theory only, not the experience. We must never be self-satisfied and think that our silvery tongue can maneuver the audience. They may be affected at that one moment, but have we only given them thoughts and doctrines, or do we need to give life to them? Without giving life to man, we contribute nothing to his spirituality. What use is it to give man only thoughts or doctrines? May this thought be planted deeply into our being so that we would repent of the vanity of our previous work!</P><P>The reasons why no one gains life through our preaching of the cross are: (1) we ourselves do not have the experience of the cross, and (2) we do not use the spirit of the cross to preach the word of the cross.</P><P>Those who are not crucified cannot be and are not worthy to preach the message of the cross. The cross which we preach should crucify us first. The message we preach should burn in our life first so that our life and our message can be mingled together. In this way our life will become our living message. The cross we preach should not merely be a message. We should daily live out the cross in our life. What we preach should not be merely a message but a life which we daily live. When we preach, we dispense this life to others. The Lord Jesus said that His flesh is meat and His blood is drink (John 6:55). When we partake of the cross of the Lord Jesus by faith, it is like eating His flesh and drinking His blood. But to eat and to drink are not just empty words. After we eat and drink, we digest what we eat and drink so that it can become part of us-become our life. Our failure lies in the fact that many times we study the Word of God with our own wisdom and prepare our notes with our own thoughts. We often take the knowledge we gain from books and the doctrines we hear from our teachers and friends and make them our sermons. Although we have many good thoughts and ideas, and although the audience listens to us with much attention and interest, all the work ends right there. We cannot dispense the life of God to others. Although we preach the word of the cross, we cannot dispense the life of the cross to others. We can only give thoughts and ideas to people. However, what people lack is not good thoughts but life!</P><P>We cannot give to others what we do not have. If we have life, we can give life to others. If what we have is only thoughts, we can only give thoughts to others. If we do not have the experience of crucifixion in our life, if we do not have the experience of dying together with the Lord in overcoming sin and self, if we do not have the experience of bearing the cross and following the Lord to suffer for Him, and if we only know the word of the cross from others' speaking and writings but have no experience of it ourselves, we surely cannot give life to others. We can only give the theories of the life of the cross to others. Only when we are transformed by the cross and when we receive the life and the spirit of the cross can we dispense the cross to others. The cross should daily do a deeper work in our life so that we can have solid experiences of the suffering and the victory of the cross. Then when we preach, our life will spontaneously flow out through our words, and the Spirit will pour His life through our life to nourish the dried up ones-the audience. Ideas can only reach man's brain; they only result in more thoughts for man's brain. Only life can reach man's spirit, the result being that man's spirit either receives a regenerated life or a more abundant life.</P><P>Man's thought, words, utterance, and theories can only move and reach man's soul, because they can only move man's provocation, emotion, mind, and will. Only life can reach man's spirit. All the work of the Holy Spirit is in our spirit (Rom. 8:16; Eph. 3:16). Only when we are in the experience of the spirit, flowing out the life of our spirit, will the Holy Spirit pour out His life to others' spirits through us. Therefore, it is a most vain thing to save the sinners and edify the saints by man's own mind, utterance, and theory. Although what one speaks may be very persuasive outwardly, we have to know that the Holy Spirit is not co-working with him. The Holy Spirit is not behind his words and is not working with him through His authority and power. The audience only listens to his words; there is no change at all in their lives. Although they sometimes make vows and resolutions, these are only excitements in their soul. There is no life behind his words. As a result, there is no power for them to gain what they have not yet gained. Where there is life, there is power. In spiritual matters, there is no power if there is no life. Therefore, if you do not let the Holy Spirit pour out His life through your life to others' spirits, others will not have the life of the Holy Spirit and will not have the power to practice what you preach. What we desire is not eloquence but the power of the Holy Spirit. May the Spirit of God make us realize that thoughts can only reach man's soul, and only life can flow to man's spirit.</P><P>The life we are speaking of here refers to the experience of the word of God in our lives and the experience of the message we preach. The life of the cross is the life of the Lord Jesus. We should first test our message through our experience. The doctrine we understand is only a doctrine. We should let the doctrine work in us first so that the doctrine we understand becomes part of our life and part of the vital elements of our daily living and no longer just a doctrine, but the life of our life. It is like the food we eat becoming the flesh of our flesh and the bone of our bones. Thus, we become a living doctrine. In this way, the word we preach is no longer just a theory we know but our own true life. This is what the Bible means by "doers of the word" (James 1:22). Often we misunderstand the word "doer." We think "doers" are those who try their best to follow the word they hear and understand. But this is not the "doing" in the Bible. It is true that we should resolve to practice what we hear, but the "doing" in the Bible is not a "doing" with one's own strength. Rather, it is to allow the Holy Spirit to live out from one's life the word he knows. This is a kind of living, not a kind of work. If there is the living, there will spontaneously be the work. To have some sporadic works is not the "doing" described in the Bible. We should cooperate with the Holy Spirit in our life through our will so that we can experientially live out what we know. In this way we will be able to dispense life to others.</P><H1 CLASS=MSG>MESSAGE FIVE</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>HONESTY, DECEPTION,<br>AND SPIRITUAL KNOWLEDGE</H1><H2 CLASS=HEAD4>Issue No. 11</H2><P>Spiritual knowledge is always helpful. It gives us a clearer direction to spiritual progress. Ignorance always leads to mistakes.</P><P>Saints go astray because they do not have spiritual knowledge. Satan mainly utilizes the foolishness of the saints to mislead them. The Holy Spirit is not afraid of man having knowledge, spiritual knowledge. The more knowledge a man has, the easier it is for the Spirit to lead him. The devil is the authority of darkness; he utilizes darkness, loves darkness, and wants to keep man in darkness. The less knowledge a man has, the easier it is for Satan to deceive him.</P><P>There is a misconception among Christians that as long as they are honest they will not be deceived. They think, "My intention is very honest; therefore, I will not be deceived." Little do they realize that mainly honest people are deceived. The saints who are deceived by Satan usually think that they are seeking the truth with a very honest heart. They pray, read the Scriptures, fast, and pursue spiritual experiences. Nevertheless, they are still susceptible to deception. They do not realize that Satan can very easily inject an erroneous thought into their minds. They also do not realize that Satan can very easily put a stubborn will in their hearts so that they will become obstinate in their thinking and consider their thoughts as the truth, besides which there is no other truth. They think that since they seek God's gift with an honest heart, God will surely keep them from deception. Little do they realize that God has certain conditions for keeping man from deception. If a saint does not cooperate with God by persisting in his opposition to Satan, if he does not ask the Lord for light to discern the real condition of the situation, or if he will not submit to God's words, then God cannot keep him. God did not promise to keep us unconditionally. On the contrary, we should work together with God. Only then will He keep us.</P><P>First Satan deceives the saints by saying, "You will not be deceived." Those who believe that they will never be deceived will be deceived more frequently and seriously than others. Due to pride, Satan became Satan; he works by causing people to become proud. However, some pride is obvious and some is concealed. (Alas! Sometimes this pride is concealed to such an extent that a person thinks that he can never be deceived and secretly pities others for not having his unusual experiences!) Those who are proud and think that they cannot be deceived should be careful or they will eventually be deceived.</P><P>If we are humble and not self-assuming or stubborn, if we admit that we can easily be deceived, if we single-heartedly seek the Lord so that He would reveal the real condition and true significance behind every matter, and if we wholeheartedly resist the works and wiles of the enemy, we will know if our spiritual experience is from God or from Satan.</P><P>We should know that Satan can transform himself into an angel of light and his evil spirits can transform themselves into ministers of righteousness. The unusual experiences we have gained may be very good and may help us to go on. They may put a flame in our hearts and give us great joy. We may even speak in tongues, receive healings, dream dreams, hear spiritual sounds, constantly have third-heaven experiences, and know the most mysterious things. Sometimes, we may be affected by a spirit outside of us that makes us feel that Jesus is most precious. In our prayer we may feel that the Lord is in the room and there is no need to pray to God in heaven, and instead we only need to pray to the Lord in the room. However, we must never think that these experiences are from God. It is possible that we may be deceived. Do not think that just because we seek with a very sincere heart, we can never be deceived. An honest heart is not a condition that prevents one from being deceived. There are hundreds of thousands of honest believers who have been deceived. It is difficult to say that we will not also be deceived. For this reason, we should have spiritual knowledge.</P><P>We should know the spiritual law. God works according to definite principles. If believers do not know and walk according to the law of God's work, God cannot keep us. The most crucial question for us is: are we willing to reject all of our wonderful, unusual experiences if they are not from God?</P><P>Do not think that we are always willing to reject these experiences. Actually we find too much unwillingness within our hearts. I am afraid that our hearts love our wonderful experiences too much! Until this matter is resolved, we cannot obtain any knowledge to go on spiritually. After the first step is resolved, we can then look at the second step. Our present attitude should be: if my experience is not from God, I will resist and oppose it. I resist and oppose everything that is from Satan. Before God, I unceasingly ask Him to reveal the real condition behind every matter to me. If we do this, God will direct us and enlighten us in His own time. Concerning supernatural experiences, unless we have actually tested the source of our experience, we should not lightly believe in it. Speculation and deduction are totally unreliable in dealing with things in the spiritual realm. If God has not revealed the real condition behind a particular matter to us in our spirit and we have not actually tested whether it is from God, we must not assume that it has been given by God. Unless God gives us the knowledge, we have nothing to believe. Our honest heart cannot keep us from being deceived. If we do not want to be deceived, God must give us the knowledge so that we can understand the real condition behind every matter.</P><H1 CLASS=MSG>MESSAGE SIX</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>CALMNESS OF MIND</H1><H2 CLASS=HEAD4>Issue No. 11</H2><P>It is very easy for the heart to become cold; it is also extremely difficult for the head to remain calm. We do not have to plan or endeavor. In the twinkling of an eye, when we are just slightly unwatchful, our loving heart toward God and man spontaneously cools down. But it is not so with our head. Many times, the more we think, the more confused we become, and also the more we think, the hotter we become. We lose our calmness because we are agitated. The heart should be hot and the head should be cool. Being calm in our head is to keep from being agitated in our thoughts. Saints who seek for the fullness of life must pay attention to their head. Although a man's thoughts cannot control his life, they do affect his life. If a man is not calm in his head, he will not be calm in his attitude and life. Once a man's head is hot, he cannot control himself. Self-control is the ninth item of the wonderful fruit of the Holy Spirit. Losing self-control is to lose the fragrance of the Holy Spirit which runs through our life. Once our head is agitated, we unconsciously change from the way we normally behave. Under these circumstances, we are tossed to and fro like waves, floating in the air, and unable to control ourselves. Our words, deeds, and conduct are subconsciously affected by the mental agitation in our head; so we begin to act abnormally. Notwithstanding, believers who have suffered this do not realize their loss.</P><P>When we are calm, it is easy to discern the agitation of others. But when we are agitated, we may not see our own problem. When we observe the actions, words, and attitude of an agitated person, we may condemn him, saying, "So-and-so is bound by his flesh." Nevertheless, when we are agitated and behave the same way, we may not see our own problem. This is the difference between being calm and being agitated. If we are calm in our mind, we will have a very clear understanding and accurate evaluation concerning everything; otherwise, we will confuse right with wrong and lose all standards of good and evil.</P><P>Not only can we observe this behavior in others; we can see it in ourselves. After we are agitated and changed in our behavior, which results in abnormal conduct and abnormal speech, our anger begins to subside and our head begins to calm down. If we would quietly reflect upon the way we conducted ourselves during our agitation, we would secretly laugh at our previous mistakes. Either we will deeply condemn ourselves or be ashamed of our former conduct and secretly blush. When our head is calm, we will not repeat the same things that we did when our head was hot. If we maintain our calmness, we will not approve of agitated conduct. Nevertheless, we have become agitated many times. When we are agitated, our conduct becomes either sinful or loose. The more we consider, the angrier we become. We burn with fury within and become agitated by the flesh. As a result, we fall into sin. When we are agitated, we often sneer unnaturally, jest, or speak words which contradict our inward feelings. The tide of our thoughts roars, rising and falling. Sometimes we can neither sleep at night nor eat during the day. Sometimes we are joyful; sometimes we are sorrowful. Sometimes we fiercely plod on and labor, or we purposely hold back and drag our feet. None of these phenomena portray our true intention. When everything is over and we sit before the Lord to reflect and examine ourselves under His light, we would often laugh at ourselves and wonder that we have been so soulish!</P><P>We all know that the way we behave during times of agitation is wrong. Nevertheless, when we are agitated, we have no power to control ourselves. Since this is the case, we should guard ourselves from agitating things. We should maintain a calmness in our head. If we know that we have been agitated, we should say to ourselves, "I have been agitated. I better not do anything now or I will have another failure." We should resist Satan and stop him from taking advantage of these agitating situations. Learn to be a master over yourself at such times. Learn to manage the agitation and subject it to yourself. The first victory will increase your capacity to have the second victory. If we do not know whether we are agitated, we should ask ourselves, "Am I speaking, thinking, and behaving this way because I am agitated?" If so we should ask the Holy Spirit to strengthen us so that we can control ourselves. We should control the agitation rather than being controlled by the agitation.</P><P>Agitation is often the instrument that Satan utilizes to cause saints, first, to commit sin (especially anger) and, second, to stray from God's will. If by any chance we become careless in this matter, we bring shame to the Lord's name. Whenever your thoughts are shaken and your emotions confused, do not forget this. Calmness of head is the condition for maintaining one's peace. The loss of peace occurs mainly because your head becomes agitated. Agitation usually results in the loss of peace. However, it is possible for one to keep his peace even after he is agitated. When the cross, manifested by God's word, works deeply within us, causing our spirit and soul to be divided in experience, we will have the full power to take charge of the agitation. Even though the environment and things surrounding the heart may be confused and uncertain, the heart will not be moved, and an inward, calm serenity will prevail. Though things done in agitation may sometimes be good, none of them are perfect. Having a calm head is a necessary condition for the Holy Spirit to lead us to walk according to God's will. When we are agitated, Satan will have the opportunity to manipulate us and will lead us off the right track. A calm head will give the Holy Spirit an opportunity to lead us. The Holy Spirit cannot utilize our confusion; rather, when we are in a calm spirit, He will shine calm light into our mind so that we may know His will. Even the most spiritual saint cannot completely avoid agitation; unless he is on the alert all the time, he is not free from this danger. Those who follow the Lord soberly must pay attention to this matter.</P><H1 CLASS=MSG>MESSAGE SEVEN</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>BORROWED SPIRITUAL EXPERIENCE</H1><H2 CLASS=HEAD4>Issue No. 11</H2><P>Experience should be something personal. What you have not experienced cannot be called experience. If scriptural teachings and doctrines are not experienced personally by us, they have nothing to do with us. The teaching remains a teaching and the doctrine remains a doctrine. Experience is a matter of life; it is not an idea. Mental thoughts can provide man with many beautiful notions. However, only experience can provide man with a well-developed human life.</P><P>It is very unfortunate that the believers' mental life is more advanced than their experiential life. In regard to our real spiritual condition as Christians, we do not possess what we think but only what we have experienced. Some Christians have no deep experience in the Lord themselves. They do not have novel ideals or an ideal human life; nevertheless, they are very good imitators. One cannot say that they have no heart for spiritual teachings; on the contrary, they are full of interest in spiritual teachings and are very attentive to them. Their heart very much admires the experience of others in the Lord. Although they do not have much fellowship with the Lord, they appreciate the fellowship that others have with the Lord. Although they do not have a burning love or intimate affection for the Lord, they delight in the expression and words of love by others to the Lord. Although they do not have a strong faith in the Lord that would cause them to pray unceasingly to Him and receive numerous miraculous and wonderful answers to their prayers from God, they wholeheartedly praise and admire this kind of spiritual experience. They end up with many pretensions because their hearts are so drawn to these things.</P><P>Before these Christians believed in the Lord and were regenerated, they must have been outgoing, fond of fame, emotional, and greedy for vainglory. After being regenerated and saved, these Christians greatly desire to rapidly advance in their spiritual progress in order that they may be known as spiritual giants and obtain a great name and glory. We cannot say that their whole intention is to gain vainglory and reputation. As a matter of fact, they are not behind others in their spiritual pursuit. However, in the hidden part of their heart, to a greater or lesser extent, there secretly remains the motivation of self-glory. This motive, for the most part, is responsible for their seeking heart and strength. However, few of them fulfill their aspiration.</P><P>Spiritual progress is made one step at a time. It is like taking a journey. Those who progress spiritually simply serve the Lord faithfully; they do not take the wrong way; they do not turn back; they are not obstinate, and they obey fully. Therefore, they are able to finish the long journey in the shortest period of time. Those who want to rapidly advance try to double the speed of their progress by their own strength and methods, without realizing that there is no short cut in spiritual progress! As a matter of fact, these believers have more difficulty advancing than believers who are apparently slow. The slow believers apparently miss something, and the hasty ones apparently gain something. Actually, neither kind have gained anything. A slow believer realizes the activity of his sinful nature and his many failures. When these failures repeatedly occur, he loses heart and thinks that he will never attain to maturity in spiritual life and that he can never overcome. This is not entirely correct. It is comparatively easy for God to deal with a slow believer and cause him to go on. However, hasty believers are most difficult for God to deal with. In reality they are as troubled by their flesh as slow believers. Many times they are even more troubled. They fail often, yet their nature makes it hard for them to admit their mistakes and failures before men. Their vain hearts are fervent, yet their daily failures make it hard for them to be boastful. When they fail, they grieve over the glory they have lost before man more than the sin they have committed. Although their "outward hearts" will not admit that they are greedy for vainglory, their "inward hearts" are constantly clinging to vainglory. Because they are vainglorious, they devote their attention to outward appearance, and because they devote their attention to outward appearance, they fall into hypocrisy.</P><P>Their flesh and sinful nature often rebel against them and constantly cause them to fall. But this does not make them humble (except when their failures are known by men). Since they have no real spiritual experience and their motive is not pure and right, they borrow the spiritual experiences of others and take them as their own. They secretly acquaint themselves with other people's spiritual messages and, at an opportune time, take one or two statements from them in order to gain a reputation for eloquence and spiritual depth. Little do they realize that what they say does not appear to originate from their manner of life! Their words and their living are not compatible with each other! They imitate the intimate talk others have with the Lord and adopt it as their own. Little do they realize that their spirit and expression, while they are talking, do not match their words. They also have a wide collection of quotations from famous saints with observations about the world and seemingly everything. When an opportunity comes, they apply these quotations one by one. Little do they care that their heart inwardly accuses them of their hypocrisy! These believers often hear of many experiences of answered prayer, and they try to manufacture the same kind of experience in order to be admired by others! Little do they realize that their own hearts are doubting if God will answer their prayer. They hear others praise and thank God in their suffering, and they imitate the praises to God by lifting up their voice when in similar suffering. Yet they only have a praising mouth without a praising heart. This is not acceptable to God. Even more frequently, they adopt spiritual words that they hear in the prayers of others, loving thoughts expressed to the Lord from the hearts of others, and the burning enthusiasm for saving souls poured out from the hearts of others. Their failure lies in the fact that even though they pray such words, their hearts do not respond (except for occasional emotional sentiments), and they have no desire for such things.</P><P>Sometimes we hear others minister the deep teachings of spiritual life. Because of a preacher's thorough elucidation, we clearly understand in our mind what has been said. At such times there is a great danger that we may think that what we understand is also our experience. Little do we realize that at critical moments, we may still be found unfaithful in following the preacher's teaching and in working together with the Lord. Everything that we have not experienced is not ours. What we understand only belongs to others. We still have nothing!</P><P>Borrowed spiritual experience leads to self-pride and haughtiness. It leads us to think that we have reached the very highest realm. We are greedy for vainglory which only corrupts us spiritually. Borrowed spiritual experience cannot help us to advance spiritually; on the contrary, it will be an absolute hindrance to our spiritual advance. Pride and vainglory are sufficient to cause a fatal blow to the saints. It is not worth it to bring loss upon ourselves. On that day when we are before the judgment seat of Christ, all "borrowed things" will be made manifest. Not one false thing will remain covered before the judgment seat. May we be willing to be instructed. May we be more humble and not assume that we already know. Rather, may we be faithful before the Lord to ask ourselves, "Have I attained to this stage yet?"</P><H1 CLASS=MSG>MESSAGE EIGHT</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>HOW TO BE WITHOUT WANT</H1><H2 CLASS=HEAD4>Issue Nos. 13, 14</H2><P>In these days we see many believers who are in poverty. They are all looking for help. We also see many brothers and sisters who trust in God for their living. Although they are never starved, they are often in danger of having an empty balance in their account. In addition, there are brothers who desire to live by faith. However, the absence of proper means discourages them from living this kind of life. Does the Word of God tell us of any way in which God's children can free themselves from want? The answer is "yes."</P><P>The reason believers are in want is that many times they have too much in excess and forget to give to others. As a result, no one gives to them. The greatest reason, though I dare not say the unique reason, for want among the believers is their refusal to give. The principle taught in the Bible is, "Give, and it will be given to you" (Luke 6:38). It is not only to receive, but to first give and then receive. When we are in want, we hope to receive from man or God. But God's command is to "give." We should not only give when we are rich or when we have a surplus, but at the very time when we need others to give to us. The more we are in want, the more we should give. The more we hope to receive help from others, the more we should render help to others. If we truly walk according to the promise of this verse, we will truly see God's promise fulfilled in us. During the past few years while I have been serving the Lord, He constantly reminded me of this verse. "Give" to others, and it will be given to me. This is my principle of financial planning. This is my theory of economics. When I had the most need and could not make ends meet, I remembered the teaching in this verse. I came before the Lord and asked what I should give to others. As soon as He gave the word, I obeyed. Soon I found Him meeting my needs through men's hands. Today, in retrospect, I can truly say that this verse can be fully trusted. The strange thing is that the time I offered the most was actually the time when I was most in want. Yet God always returned to me tenfold and a hundredfold what I put out. Every time I put out something, I would reckon at the end of the month what God gave to me. The marvelous thing was that He always gave and gave to my abundance. I can testify that whenever I practiced Luke 6:38, God never once wronged me.</P><P>Some wonder how I could have so much money to give to others. They wonder if the Lord has special grace for me. They do not realize that the times when I gave the most away were actually the times when I was the most in want. Some may think that I am very rich. Actually I am poorer than most people; but the Lord's power is great. Although some think this way, this has not hindered God from supplying my need. I have a friend who also experienced this. Once she spent her last dollar for the Lord. In a few days, she needed a hundred dollars to pay the wages of her workers. She sat quietly before the Lord and began to praise Him. She wrote a hymn in English (being an English woman). The message of the hymn is one verse in Psalm 23 which says that the Lord's cup of blessing runs over. She believed that everything, including silver and gold, would run over for her. But while she wrote this, she was actually penniless! When her friend in England saw the hymn, she wrote back and said, "Thank the Lord that He has been so rich to you!" It was true that she was not poor. When the time came to make her payments, the Lord prompted her former pastor in England to wire her a hundred dollars.</P><P>The secret to receiving is giving. The more you will not give, the more you will not have. Many times, we consider that our source is becoming dry and that it will dry up sooner if we give to others. But God says, "Give, and it will be given to you." You can exercise your faith. You can pray. But you will not receive if you do not give. God's eyes are on the little that you have left. You may say to God, "Father, all I have is this little." God would say, "Do you still have that much?" Since you have so little, you have a goal to save the little that you have to sustain your living. But God cannot give you anything because of the remainder that you still have. He says, "Give, and it will be given to you."</P><P>The little handful of meal and oil that the Zarephath woman had was only enough for her to make a cake. It was only enough to satisfy her hunger for an hour or two. But she needed to give. She needed to give the cake first to Elijah the prophet. Afterwards, God sustained her and her child for three and a half years. If God has not led you to do anything, nothing more can be said. But if He has led you to give, you have to give. However, do not be afraid of God's leading.</P><P>God's principle is for you to give first, and then it will be given to you. Our principle is to ask God to give first, then when we have a surplus we will give to others. Mr. Muller who supported the China Inland Mission was a person greatly used by the Lord. He gave his life to the Lord's work. He fully understood the principle of first giving and then being given to. He seldom stored up food at home. Once his wife told him that the food they had would only last until Sunday. They had no money, and it was not right for believers to borrow money. What should they do? He told his wife that there must be an overabundance of something in the house which was not distributed to others that had caused God to stop the supply. The couple began to search through the household items, the children's closets, and everything in the house to see if there were any excessive items. They found none. Everything seemed to be exactly what they needed. Suddenly they remembered that someone had sent them a big case of butter a few days before which they had not touched at all and which was too much for them. The couple then diligently cut the butter into a few hundred pieces and wrapped them up in white papers to be ready to give to others. The next day was Sunday. Mr Muller calmly sent all the butter to the church. He preached as usual, and after his message he asked the poor believers to stay behind and gave them each a packet of butter. The people wondered how their pastor had such a fortune to buy so much butter to give to others! They did not realize that their pastor was suffering from a famine in his own house! One of the poor believers had a sick wife at home. Every day there was only bread and water. Many times the sick wife said, "How good it would be if we could have a little butter on our bread." When the husband came home from the church and showed the butter to the wife, they were very grateful. The child of God then knelt in her bed and prayed in tears, "O Lord, please bless our pastor! He has supplied our needs. Now please supply his needs." God heard her prayer, and the next day someone suddenly sent the pastor some money. "Give, and it will be given to you."</P><P>There are many other passages in the Bible which speak of the principle of "give, and it will be given to you." One verse that many Christians treasure very much is Philippians 4:19. This verse teaches the same thing. Paul said, "And my God will fill your every need according to His riches, in glory, in Christ Jesus." This verse is truly a great promise. But we must never forget the condition laid out in this verse. From verses 15 to 18 Paul spoke of how the Philippians supplied his needs. Then in verse 19, he said that God would fill all their needs. Please notice that it was not your God who would supply all their needs, but my God who would supply all their needs. It was the God of Paul, the God of the one who received the supply, who would supply all their needs. Furthermore, it was to supply every need of "yours," the supplying ones. First you give and then God gives to you.</P><P>Elijah's offering on Mount Carmel is another good example (see 1 Kings 18). An elderly sister in the Lord once said, "If Elijah had not offered up the water, the water from heaven would not have come." At that time, a drought had been going on for three and a half years. There was no water in the whole nation. Even the king had to personally seek out grass for his mules. One can see the seriousness of the drought at that time. How precious was water! They needed water. But when Elijah offered the sacrifice, he poured out water again and again, twelve barrels full, onto the sacrifice. The Bible says that "the water ran round about the altar; and he filled the trench also with water" (v. 35). Soon after, "the heaven was black with clouds and wind, and there was a great rain" (v. 45). If no water had been offered up, no water would have come down! About five years ago, I remember that I had such an experience for the first time. I had to go to a certain place to conduct meetings. The traveling expense was about twenty dollars. I only had twelve dollars with me. I prayed for the traveling expenses and the meetings for about a week. Originally I intended to leave on a Sunday evening. On Friday I mentioned to God the matter of the traveling expenses again. There were only two days until the date of my departure. It seemed that I was urging God, but He told me that a co-worker of mine was in need and that I should give him three dollars. This was quite difficult for me to do. How could I give to others when I did not have enough for myself ? But God's commandment never gives room for negotiation. In the end, I put three dollars into an envelope and sent it to my co-worker. Although three dollars was not much, when I did it, there were tears in my eyes. I thought that the Lord would surely take care of my traveling needs then. But to my surprise, on Sunday night no specially designated money came. However, I knew that I was walking in God's will and I left home in peace. The first part of my journey was a ride on a steamer for a night and a day. After that I needed to hire a boat and travel for another week. The cost of the steamer journey was a dollar, and I was able to pay for it. But the boat could not be hired for less than twenty dollars. I prayed that the Lord would provide me the necessary funds while traveling on the steamer. When the steamer approached the pier, I still did not have the money. At that time, the Holy Spirit taught me how to pray. Instead of praying for money, I prayed for a boat with a cheaper fare. I prayed this way, and when I reached the pier, I found a small boat that was able to take me to my destination for seventy cents. I was left with more than I needed. After the meetings, I wondered about my return fare. The Lord heard my prayer. When I came back home, I still had some dollars left over. As soon as I reached home, I went to see my co-worker. He was not at home, and I only managed to see his wife. She asked me why I had given her husband three dollars. I told her that I was merely following the Lord's leading and that it was not something I had initiated. Then she told me that when the money came to them, they had used up their last penny. The Lord used the three dollars to sustain them for a week before directing other channels to glorify His name. If I had failed the Lord that day, would the Lord also have failed His servant on that day? Actually, I did not have to use the three dollars anyway. When I returned home, I could not help but to praise the Lord in tears.</P><P>God is most wise. He knows what things will harm us. The matter of giving is not a business transaction where one can only work with capital. If we do not give, our God is seemingly frustrated from His work. God loves to see us trusting in Him single-heartedly. He does not want to see us holding anything back, trusting in our savings rather than in Him. God also loves to see us loving His children and His creation. He does not like to see us saving our wealth for ourselves. God wants to work with us to supply others. He can send manna from heaven directly, but it pleases Him to share a part of His glory with His children and work with them. Therefore, He wants us to give to others.</P><P>There is also a question of measure. "For with what measure you measure, it shall be measured to you in return" (Luke 6:38). The degree to which we obey this verse of promise will be the degree to which we receive blessings from the Lord. Blessed are those who are willing to give in full measure to others. They will see a God of full measure working for them in full measure. "He who sows sparingly shall also sparingly reap; and he who sows with blessings shall also with blessings reap" (2 Cor. 9:6). Many consider this word to be about the future; if one sows in this age, then he will reap in the next. While this is quite true, it is also true that if one sows in this age, he will also reap in this age. All of our offerings are not being wastefully thrown away; they are sowings that will have real reapings. If one sows, the harvest will come when the old supply is used up. If we give our money away, God will send what we need in our time of need. The harvest is always more abundant than the sowing. What is given to us will always be more than what we gave. Just as farming in this world promises a definite reaping, our giving promises no less sure results.</P><P>Only those who are rich in this world give to others out of their excess. But the Lord desires to see us giving like the rich ones without having the reserve of the rich. We rejoice when we can give more than the rich give. The more we give, the more the Lord will give to us. The more the Lord gives to us, the more we will be able to give. Wealth can never be lost; it merely circulates. It is a pity that the houses of many rich believers are full, but their hands are not because they have not given anything for the Lord. All of our dormant and idle money will condemn us at the judgment seat. But now we are not speaking to the rich; we are speaking to the poor brothers. We should give. We should ask the Lord to make us more generous in giving than the average rich person.</P><P>Giving is a condition. We have to give to the Lord before He will give to us. I believe all of us know the name Colgate. He is the most famous manufacturer in the world of soap, toothpaste, and perfume. When he was leaving England for America as a young man, he went to see his pastor and asked for a word before his departure. The pastor put his hand on Mr. Colgate's head and said, "Take God as your Head in everything, and He will bless you." When he arrived in America, he only had a little more than ten dollars. With that money he made some soap and sold it. Although he was poor, he offered a dollar to God for every ten dollars he made. When God increased his production, he offered two dollars for every ten dollars he made. In the end he offered five dollars for every ten dollars he made. Today his toothpaste is the most famous toothpaste in the world. He gave, and God gave back to him. Please prove the reality of God's promise in this verse.</P><H1 CLASS=MSG>MESSAGE NINE</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>THE SOURCE OF FAITH</H1><H2 CLASS=HEAD4>Issue Nos. 13, 14</H2><P>Faith has a source. This source is not in the saints but in God. If the source of faith were in the saints, faith would be fragile. Who could have faith? Many children of God sadly sigh over their lack of great faith. Some lack not only great faith but even small faith. We often acknowledge that we have no faith. We wish for greater faith so that we can trust God and He can perform daily miracles for us. We wish for practical faith so that we can commit everything into the hand of God with ease and calmness. "If only we could have greater faith, everything would be fine." This is our wish. "If only we could have faith like So-and-so, then everything would be all right." This is our word of admiration. How often have we asked the Lord to increase our faith? But why do we still lack faith? Does faith only belong to a certain privileged class of saints? Is there truly no way for us to obtain greater faith? There is a way in the Lord. But only those who want faith can obtain it.</P><P>The cry of the saints today is for greater faith. But where does greater faith come from? The saints aspire to have greater faith in themselves. Is this a mistake? Yes, the mistake of saints is that they want to have greater faith in themselves. They seek faith from the wrong source. No wonder they never get it!</P><P>We all ask ourselves, "Do I have faith?" "Can I trust God regarding this matter?" "Is my faith sufficient?" The answers to these questions are always "No" and "I cannot"! What a great grief it is! We should not ask these questions. We are not the source of faith, so we cannot expect ourselves to have greater faith. The more we ask ourselves and search, seek, and look within ourselves, the more we feel we have no faith or very little faith! What is the reason for this? The reason is that we are not the source of faith. Since the source of faith is not within us, we cannot obtain faith if we turn within ourselves to search for it. Therefore, we must learn a lesson: we are not the source of faith. When we examine ourselves, we cannot see or feel that we have faith.</P><P>The Word of God tells us what the source of faith really is: "Faith...not of yourselves; it is the gift of God" (Eph. 2:8). This verse of the Bible is more than clear; faith is given to us by God. A similar word is found in Acts 3:16: "The faith which is through Him." Therefore, we know that the source of faith is in God, not in us. This may seem very common, ordinary, and familiar to us. But there are not many who really understand the importance of the source of our faith. If we really understood that God is the source of our faith, we would never ask ourselves, "Do I have enough faith? Do I have faith?" These questions indicate that we still do not understand that God is the source of our faith, because if we did, we would not ask these questions.</P><P>God is the Giver of faith; God is the source of faith. Nevertheless, the fact that God is the source of faith does not mean merely that He gives faith to us. It means that men have faith or increase in faith through God because God is the source of their faith. In other words, men have faith or increase in faith because God possesses a nature that makes it easy for men to trust in Him.</P><P>What does this mean? It means that we do not have to ask, "Do we have faith? Is our faith sufficient?" These are not the most important questions. These questions will keep us in darkness and discouragement. We should ask, "Is God reliable? Is God honest? Is God trustworthy? Will God break His promises? Are God's power and love real?" Because we always pay attention to ourselves, the more we search, the more we are unable to find our faith. If we pay attention to God, we will find that faith comes spontaneously. Faith does not originate in ourselves. No wonder faith cannot be found when we examine ourselves! Faith originates with God. The more we look at God, look to God, and meditate on God, the more we will have faith.</P><P>An illustration may help us understand this teaching. Once a few brothers came to talk with me about the issue of faith. They felt that they had too little faith. But I told them that it was not their faith that was too little, but their God. If they wanted to have greater faith, they needed to have a greater God. That day I told them that faith means committing ourselves and our things to someone else. Believing in God means committing ourselves and our things to God and trusting in Him to accomplish these things for us. I asked, "When you commit your things to somebody else, do you ask, `Do I have the faith to trust this person? Is my faith sufficient to trust him?'" You never ask these kinds of questions. Rather, you ask, "Can I trust him?" You do not ask, "Do I have faith in him?" Suppose you are an owner of a store, and you hire a manager and commit your business entirely to him. When you hired him, you did not ask, "Do I have faith in him? Is my faith too little? Do I have to increase my faith in him?" Instead, you asked yourself, "Can I trust him? Is he honest? Is he faithful? Is he reliable?" Since he was honest, trustworthy, and reliable, you spontaneously committed your entire business into his hand. You did not have to ask yourself if you had faith or if your faith was great or sufficient.</P><P>Similarly you should trust in God. You do not have to ask, "Do I have faith? Is my faith great and sufficient? How much more should my faith be increased?" All you have to ask is, "Is God honest? Is God faithful? Is God reliable? Will God regret His promise and break His word?" If God is honest, faithful, and reliable, and if He promises and will not repent, then you do not have to search and examine yourselves to see if you have faith. You will spontaneously commit yourselves and your things to the hand of God. This is faith. Faith is not something produced from within. It is a trust that arises out of the fact that the other party is honest, stable, trustworthy, and reliable. Therefore, what is lacking is not greater faith but a greater God.</P><P>Most of the time, we do not dare commit ourselves and our things to God under the pretext that our faith is too small. Actually, the reason we do not dare commit ourselves to God is neither the absence of our faith nor the smallness of our faith. Rather, we think that God is not reliable. If God is faithful, why do we not rely on Him? If God is trustworthy, why do we not put our trust in Him? If God is reliable, why do we not depend on Him? If God will not break His word, why do we not rely on Him according to His promise? We are afraid that our God is muddle-headed, unreliable, dishonest, and always breaking His promises. This is the reason we do not have faith. Now is the time for us to confess our sins. We know a bank is honest and reliable. This is why we deposit our money in it. We ask if the bank is trustworthy; we do not ask if we have faith in the bank. When a baby is in danger, his fear ceases and he is at peace when he just touches his father's hand or mother's face. He will not trust anyone else because they are not trustworthy to him. He trusts in his parents because they are trustworthy.</P><P>Faith is natural! It comes spontaneously and without reluctance because we put our trust only in those that we consider trustworthy. We do not need greater faith, we need to know the faithfulness and trustworthiness of God. If we realized that God was the source of our faith, we would no longer seek faith in ourselves. Instead, we would lift up our eyes to God and seek to know Him. When we realize that God is reliable, our faith will spontaneously grow. If we know that God is reliable, we will trust Him. If we consider God to be unreliable, we will not trust Him.</P><P>Our faith has a basis because it rests in God. We do not believe in ourselves but in God Himself. We must make a distinction: what we believe in is not our faith but God. The mistake of some believers is that they believe in their feelings of faith more than they believe in God. If they feel they have no faith, they do not trust in God or commit their things into God's hand. If they feel they have faith, they boldly entrust their things to God. What is this? This is not believing in God. This is believing in their own faith! We should not pay much attention to this faith. We should not ask or search to see if we have faith, and we should not trust in God only when we have faith. We should ask whether or not God is reliable. If He is --and of course He is --then why do we not trust in Him? If we think, "I am not afraid now because I have faith," then we are trusting in our own faith and not trusting in God. Likewise, if we say, "I cannot commit these things to God because I have no faith," it does not mean that we do not believe in God. This only indicates that we doubt our own faith. We fail to trust in God not because He is untrustworthy but because we do not have faith. The problem is not with God. The problem is with man. It may be true that you do not have faith, but is God unreliable? If God is reliable, why do you not trust in Him? You only have to be concerned about God, not yourself. If God is trustworthy, then spontaneously you will trust in Him. Otherwise, even if you have faith, it is futile. Do not trust in your own faith; your faith is not trustworthy. Instead, trust in God. "For I know whom I have believed"; therefore, "I am persuaded that He is able to guard my deposit" (2 Tim. 1:12).</P><P>The Bible not only tells us that God is the source of our faith; it also tells us that the word of God is the source of our faith: "So faith comes out of hearing, and hearing through the word of Christ" (Rom. 10:17). Why do I first say that God is the source of our faith and then say that the word of God is the source of our faith? Here we see the wonder of God's word. How do we know God? We know Him by the word He speaks. The word He speaks represents His heart's desire. When we understand His word, we will realize what God has promised for us and what He does and does not want to do. Only through the Word of God --the Bible --can we know God's promise. When we know His promise, we will trust in Him according to His promise and beseech Him through prayers. If we do not have the word of God, we will have nothing at all. "How then shall they call upon Him into whom they have not believed? And how shall they believe into Him of whom they have not heard?" (Rom. 10:14). If we do not have the promise of God, but mindlessly believe in Him, we will fall into a kind of superstition. Faith must be based on something. Mindlessly believing, without a basis, is superstition, and no one will receive anything from this kind of faith. If my father promises me something, I believe he will give it to me. This believing is solid because my faith is based on the promise of my father. If my father has not promised me anything, but I force myself to believe that he will give me something, then I am not believing but dreaming because I believe in something that is not factual but my own imagination. From this example, we can see the important relationship between faith and promise.</P><P>God's promises are only recorded in God's Word, the Bible. To know the promises of God, one must know the Word of God. Without the promises of God, our faith is not real faith. The promises are in the Word of God. "So faith comes...through the word of Christ" (Rom. 10:17). We have said that we need to believe in God's faithfulness, trustworthiness, and reliability. We have also said that if we know God, we will spontaneously have faith. This is related to God's promises, that is, to His words. If God has not promised anything, how can we know that He is faithful? He must promise something before we can talk about His faithfulness.</P><P>What is faith? Faith is holding on to what God has said and praying for God's work to be realized. Faith is believing that God will do what He has said. Faith is believing that God is faithful and that He will work out what He has said. Whether our faith is great or small is not the issue. The issue is: if God has promised something, will He lie and change? The only question we should ask is whether or not we believe that God is honest. This has nothing to do with our faith being great or small.</P><P>We know that God loves us. Therefore, we should have no doubt that He is for us. The Bible shows us at least two aspects concerning His promises: "What He [has] promised He [is] able also to do" (Rom. 4:21). God is powerful and His power fulfills His promises. Our God is not a weak and powerless God who cannot do what He says He will do. If this were so, what good would His promises be? All of His promises would be empty words. But God is not only powerful in promising something, He is also powerful in carrying out His promise. Whatever He has promised, He is able to carry it out. "He is able" --this is what the Bible tells us about His person. "For the Lord is able to make him stand" (Rom. 14:4). "God is able to make all grace abound unto you" (2 Cor. 9:8). "He is able to guard..." (2 Tim. 1:12). Abraham offered up Isaac because he knew that "God was able to raise men even from the dead..." (Heb. 11:19).</P><P>God is not only able to do what He has promised to do; He is also intent on doing it. Even if someone has the ability to carry them out but does not keep his words, the promises are vain. God is not only able; He is intent on carrying out His promises. "For He who has promised is faithful" (Heb. 10:23). "If we are faithless, He remains faithful, for He cannot deny Himself" (2 Tim. 2:13). God intends that all of His promises, every word and every sentence, be fulfilled in His children. Whatever He says, He will keep. Whatever He has promised, He will fulfill. Otherwise, His deity would be threatened. Since He cannot deny Himself, He must remain trustworthy whatever the circumstances. If His promises are vain words, we cannot entrust all things and ourselves to God. How can we still doubt if He has promised something, since He is faithful and will not break His words?</P><P>Therefore, brothers, please learn this lesson today. You are not the basis of faith. Never ask yourselves, "Do I have faith? Is my faith sufficient?" It is useless to ask such questions. The more you ask, the less faith you will have. Please ask God. What is God's promise concerning this matter? Has His love towards you changed? Will He break His word of promise? Is He able to carry out His promises? Is He trustworthy? Is He reliable? When you consider more about God, you will not have to manufacture faith. Faith will come spontaneously. Remember, you are not trustworthy, and your faith is also not trustworthy. Only God is trustworthy.</P><H1 CLASS=MSG>MESSAGE TEN</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>FAITH IN PRACTICE</H1><H2 CLASS=HEAD4>Issue No. 19</H2><P>There are many promises in the Bible. All of these promises are real and can be enjoyed by every saint.</P><P>Our God is very powerful and rich. In the stories in the Bible, we see how God worked for His children and stretched forth His mighty arm to save, protect, and guide.</P><P>God never changes, and the words of His promises never change. Both God and His promises stand forever. After considering all the work that God has done in the past, we realize that all of His promises in the present are faithful. All the promises in the Bible rest on God's power, love, and faithfulness. If God can change, His promises in the Bible can cease. But if God does not change (thank and praise Him that He never changes), the promises in the Bible will stand forever.</P><P>The present error of the saints is that not many of them expect God to do something for them. Many people think that the age of miracles is over. But the Bible is a book for this age. Since it is for this age, the miracles recorded in the Bible are not merely past events. Many young believers, influenced by the unbelieving environment around them, consider that miracles were only possible and only occurred during biblical times; consequently, they no longer expect to see miracles today. The only reason we think this way is because of a lack of faith. We have to realize that all the miracles in the Bible can be repeated today. The most important issue, however, is the believers' faith.</P><P>Many people are not inattentive to the question of faith. They talk about faith very much and say with their mouth that they believe. But the most important question is how they believe.</P><P>Faith is something that can be put into practice. The reality of faith can only be proved by practice. Faith is not something obscure, but something practical. We should not merely talk about faith with our mouth. We should put our faith into practice. Faith is not merely a spiritual term. It is "the substantiation of things hoped for, the conviction of things not seen" (Heb. 11:1). Faith is a substantiation. It is a conviction. Faith is truly a practical expression of the Christian life.</P><P>We speak about faith and say that man ought to have faith in God. But how should one have faith? We have faith in God through the daily things around us. What is faith? Faith is a heart that believes in God through ordinary circumstances. Faith is not abstract; it can be practical.</P><P>If we have faith in God, we should not just believe in Him when we encounter extraordinary events and face impossible tasks or absolute perils. This is the way the Gentiles take. It is not the way God's children should take. Not only should we know God as our sovereign Lord, but we should know Him like children know their father. We are constantly under His care and protection. The powers of the heavens are behind us and backing us up so that in all things we can overcome through the divine power.</P><P>Faith needs to be put into practice. But where should it be put into practice? Surely it should be practiced in difficult and perilous circumstances. However, even during ordinary times, we should put faith into practice. If God's children cannot commit their bodies to God when they are sick, who will believe that they have faith? If believers cannot trust in God for their material riches, can their faith be found? If believers cannot trust in God's arrangement concerning their occupations, can their professed faith help them? If believers cannot trust in God for problems arising in their families, what use is their faith to them? If believers cannot trust in God in their work to save the sinners, but instead exercise their own strength and other worldly methods, what kind of faith do they have? Faith is something that has to be practiced. Faith can be applied. We can apply all of God's promises to us through faith and make the promises manifest in us.</P><P>God promises that He is Jehovah-Ropheka (Heb.); He is our Healer (Exo. 15:26). If this is so, why are the believers' medical bills not reduced? Many people say that they are not trusting in their doctors and that they are really trusting in God to heal their sicknesses through medicine. But this is a question of the heart. In our heart, who do we trust? The best test is to ask: if we really have faith, would we be willing to trust solely in God without medicine? If we cannot, I am afraid it is not realistic for us to say that we trust in God in spite of the medicine. If we cannot trust in God without medicine, we cannot trust in Him with medicine. Many times in our sicknesses, we have not thought about God and sought healing apart from God. Even if medicine is not harmful in itself, it is harmful to man in this respect. If we cannot trust in God in our sicknesses, when will we trust in God?</P><P>Many people do not dare give up their present position for the Lord's sake. They are afraid that if they give up their position, they will not be able to secure another position. Is the hand of Jehovah so short and the Most High God not able to plan for you? Many faithful children of God have tried God in this matter and realized that He is trustworthy.</P><P>Money is another big issue. The biblical teaching is that believers should not be in debt (Rom. 13:8). But how many times have men put themselves under debt at perilous times? If we have faith in God, practical faith, how can we do something that is contrary to scriptural teaching? Why are we unable to wait quietly for God to open up a way for us? If God is the God who feeds the sparrow and cares for the lilies, can He not take care of our food and clothing? If He cared for millions of Israelites in the wilderness and provided warmth and food for them in desperate circumstances, can He not care for us? Are there no more manna and quails today? In reality, God's ravens are flying everywhere. The real problem is that the saints are either in their fat years or their lean years and have not looked to God. Therefore, they do not see God's work. We should either not mention faith at all or put into practice the faith that we mention.</P><P>A family encounters numerous problems and difficulties! Yet how many saints trust in God for their family affairs? If, as Job said, "When he giveth quietness, who then can make trouble?" (Job 34:29), why would we not trust in God? How many times has a saint come to God by faith through prayer to commit his family affairs to Him?</P><P>If we truly believe in God, why are we so fearful and lost in difficult and dangerous situations? Is not our Lord the Lord of all things? If the universe operates according to His command, will He not have a way to deliver us?</P><P>If we examine our daily lives, we will find out how much faith we have! Empty professions of faith will not help us at all. Faith is manifested in the small things in our daily lives.</P><P>The Bible is full of promises. For every matter, there are promises in the Bible which guarantee that God will work for us. As long as we have faith, God will work for us.</P><H1 CLASS=MSG>MESSAGE ELEVEN</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>ESSENTIALS AND NONESSENTIALS</H1><H2 CLASS=HEAD4>Issue No. 19</H2><P>How do we differentiate between essentials and nonessentials? We often hear God's children say that such and such a teaching in the Bible is essential, and such and such a teaching is nonessential. How do we differentiate between the two? What are essential teachings, and what are nonessential teachings?</P><P>If we exercise careful observation, we will find many who consider that questions related to their own salvation are essential teachings and questions unrelated to their salvation are nonessential teachings. This is why we often hear people say, "Do I have to obey the Lord in this matter? I do not think this matter is essential because it is not related to my salvation." Even more foolish Christians will ask, "Does this matter have to do with my salvation? If it has to do with my salvation, I will obey it. If not, what difference will it make if I do not obey it? I am saved already!"</P><P>Let me ask once more: what is essential and what is nonessential? Some may answer, "The essentials are teachings that have to do with the salvation of the saints, and the nonessentials are teachings concerning God's commandments and His glory! The commandments and glory of God are nonessential because they have nothing to do with the saints' going to heaven and receiving eternal life!" The fact that something is merely a commandment of God and merely related to God's glory is not enough to motivate the saints to obey.</P><P>It is a pity that this is the condition of many people today. The saints will only obey and submit if they consider that keeping all of the commandments and obeying all of God's will is necessary in order to be saved. God has said that those who believe in the Lord Jesus have eternal life; therefore, since they have believed and received eternal life, believers think that there is no further need to be concerned with God's other commandments and will. Other than the questions of heaven and hell, nothing moves the saints' hearts anymore. Even God's own glory is something minor to the saints. Unless God makes all of His commandments as conditions for salvation, He cannot expect some saints to obey them. This is because all they hope and plan for is receiving eternal life and going to heaven. Pleasing God and submitting to His will are peripheral issues. How pitiful is this situation!</P><P>The saints today are most selfish. Nothing can attract their attention except those things that have to do with their salvation. Is this the standard that God requires? He wants us to obey Him willingly and not by force. He loves to bestow grace to us and give us eternal life once we believe in His Son. Unlike the time of the law, He has not made His commandments as conditions for our salvation. Unfortunately, believers are not willing to be obedient children and walk according to the Father's will. On the contrary, they ask, "Is this something essential, or is it something nonessential?"</P><P>We admit that with biblical teachings, some are more important, while others are less important. But we do not agree that there are essential and nonessential biblical teachings. Would God be so uneconomical as to put meaningless and nonessential teachings, commandments, and doctrines into the Bible? He should know better than we do! The present question is not whether or not a biblical teaching is essential. If it is included in the Bible, it surely is essential. The question is whether or not the saints will honor God's glory and His will. If we consider the Lord Jesus' conduct on earth, our mouths will be shut. He was the Son of God. There was no need for Him to consider the question of His own salvation! Then according to the principle of men today, nothing about Him would have been essential because He did not need to be saved. But how He obeyed God! Even in the smallest matter, He fulfilled all righteousness. He was not like men today who scrupulously bargain with God in questions beyond their salvation.</P><P>There is yet another distinction between essential and nonessential. It is a personal distinction. The things that a saint obeys, he considers as essential; the things that he has not followed, but rather disobeyed God in, he considers as nonessential. The difference between essential and nonessential does not lie in the fact that the Bible has said it, but rather in one's own view. Because one has obeyed in a certain matter, he considers the teaching he has obeyed as essential and draws back from other teachings which he has not obeyed.</P><P>Alas, now is the time for God's children to be revived. Now is the time for us to be revived to obey God's commandments. May we pay close attention to God's glory and truly care for His will in the same way that Paul declared "all the counsel of God." May we not separate God's Bible into essential and nonessential parts according to our own will. We have to realize that obeying in big matters is indeed obedience. But obeying in small matters is also obedience. Disobeying in big matters is disobedience. Is disobedience in small matters not also disobedience? May we walk according to the teaching of the Bible and take God's glory as our goal in everything that we do in our lives, whether great or small.</P><P>One cannot say that eating of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil was a great matter. But since God forbade man to do it, eating of the tree became the source of sin. One little sin drove Adam from the garden of Eden. Was Achan's sin a great one? What he stole was probably not worth that much. But since he disobeyed God, he was punished. Why did Saul lose his kingdom? He did not commit a terrifying sin; he only disobeyed God in a little thing. Did Moses commit a great sin when he was barred from entering Canaan? The Bible says that he was the most humble person on earth. Why did he suffer such punishment from God? It was only because of a small thing. God told him to command the rock to flow out water, yet he hit the rock twice. Humanly speaking, what kind of sin can this be considered? In men's eyes today, such a matter would be considered nonessential. But God never considers any of His commandments to be nonessential. May we henceforth obey God more and more!</P><H1 CLASS=MSG>MESSAGE TWELVE</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>TALKS ON FAITH</H1><H2 CLASS=HEAD4>Issue No. 22</H2><P>Works without faith are dead. In the same way, faith without works is dead. This is true in the case of the salvation of sinners. It is also true in the case of the believers' living. Our attention today is focused on the Christians' works of faith. The unique place where faith is expressed is in their works. What we do expresses what we believe. If our faith and works do not agree with each other, there must be something wrong with our faith. Many believers do not know how to believe and express their faith. Actually, the matter is quite simple. Faith is expressed through works. "Faith worked together with his works, and by these works faith was perfected" (James 2:22). Suppose a believer merely professes with his mouth. "What is the profit...if anyone says he has faith but does not have works? Can that faith save him?" (v. 14). According to the biblical teaching here, if we believe God in a certain matter, we should have a work of faith in that matter. Otherwise, our faith will not help us receive God's deliverance in that matter.</P><P>Two meanings are implied: (1) our work proves our faith, and (2) our work perfects or completes our faith.</P><P>If there is faith, there must be works that correspond with the faith. If a man believes that a house is on fire, he will surely not sit still in the house. If he sits still there, he does not believe that the house is on fire. If we commit a matter to the Lord and believe that God will work for us, our attitude toward the matter will surely see a great change. If a man says that he believes that God will work for him, yet busily makes plans himself, being worried and distressed, his faith must be false. "For we who have believed enter into the rest" (Heb. 4:3). Faith and rest cannot be separated from one another. Whenever we truly believe, our heart will be at rest. If our hearts are restless and uneasy, if we are afraid of this and that, and if we are fearful and feeling lost, struggling with all our effort to scheme, plan, resolve, plead, ask for help, and maneuver, then this shows that we have not yet believed. When one believes, he is at rest. Therefore, when a person believes, he will no longer worry or busily plan. Instead, he will be like a weaned child resting in his mother's bosom. There must be works to our faith, and the first step of our work of faith is to stop our own works and rest in God's love, wisdom, and power.</P><P>This kind of rest is very real, genuine, and natural. It is not a pretentious calm, unnatural self-restraint, or acting as if nothing has happened. Faith brings in restfulness because of the knowledge that God is for us. "If God is for us, who can be against us?" (Rom. 8:31). Therefore, there is the rest. In addition, we know our own emptiness and that nothing can be accomplished through our designs and laborious schemes. Faith does not rest in itself. God is the place where faith rests. Only those who have such rest have faith. Those who do not have such rest do not have faith. Anything that comes by force is not faith. Faith is something that comes spontaneously. When we see a person, we know he is there. Do we have to contrive to think he is there? Do we have to force ourselves to believe he is there? Do we have to reason and research before we can acknowledge the reality of this fact? Within a second we believe spontaneously. There is no need for us to struggle to believe. This is the way with all kinds of faith. The origin of faith comes from God; it causes our spiritual eyes to discern the reality of a matter. As a result we believe. When we see and know certain things, spontaneously we believe in them. Faith results in rest, and rest comes not from prediction but from foreknowledge. We exercise faith in restfulness and we rest in faith. Faith is something very spontaneous. Anything that is not spontaneous is not faith.</P><P>Of course, there are counterfeits for everything. There is the possibility of a counterfeit for every spiritual experience of the believers. If believers are not careful, they will be deceived. There is no exception to this in the matter of faith. Many times Satan will deceive the believers, causing them to have false peace and believe in themselves, which is where the problem really lies. They can be convinced that God is going to do certain works. When God does not work, their doubts multiply and they stumble. The believers must realize that true faith is given by God and is for the accomplishment of God's will. Every time God gives us faith, He gives evidence for the faith. It is not a matter of what we think or how we feel, but a matter of what God has said. Sometimes He speaks to us through the holy Word, reveals His view concerning a certain matter, and gives a promise. Faith comes from such a promise. Sometimes He works in our spirit, reveals His will, and gives us His promises in our spirit. Spontaneously, we receive the faith that He has given. The faith that God gives cannot be separated from His promises. However, this does not refer to all the promises of the Bible. It is a matter of whether or not God has given you a particular promise. Nor does this refer to all the sensations in your spirit. Rather, it refers to the promises in which the revelation in our spirit does not contradict the teaching of the Bible. Only the biblical promises that God speaks to us in our spiritual sensations are real. Only the faith that comes out of these promises is reliable. All true faith depends not on what we think, but on what God has said.</P><P>We said all of this to show that our works should prove our faith. Now we will consider the meaning of our works completing our faith.</P><P>When we believe in God, spontaneously we will not worry and strive. We will not do these things; this is the negative works of faith. The negative works of faith are important and necessary, but they are not complete. After one has faith, he still needs the positive works of faith. We have previously mentioned that there are things that we should not do. Now, through the power of God, there are things that we should do. Our positive works must match our faith. Furthermore, these works complete our faith, and we receive the promised blessings of God much sooner. This is not a matter of hastiness in the flesh, but an expression of the strength of the power in the spirit. God would like to give us what we need immediately. But, if the death of our natural life is not substantial and deep enough, an immediate answer would strengthen our soul-life. Until our own life has lost all possibility of being active again, God has to delay what He has long promised. Positive works are a death-blow to our self-life and an expression of the vigor of spiritual strength. Therefore, they will accelerate the accomplishment of God's promises. What are the positive works of faith? They are to walk and act as if we have received God's promises. In other words, we believe that something is already accomplished and behave as if it is already accomplished. Let us consider a few matters.</P><P>Suppose you are sick. God may give you a personal promise that you will be healed. On the negative side, you should rest in God's work and not disturb His work by any human means. Rather, you should commit yourself to the hand of the Almighty without worry or concern. On the positive side, there are important steps that you should take. You should walk as if you are a healed person. You do not have to wait until you are really healed before you can consider yourself healed. When God gives you the faith to believe that you are healed, at that moment you are healed. If you are healed, you should act like you are healed. Therefore, when you receive faith, you should ask, "How should I act if I am a healed person who has been restored by God? Should I lie on my bed for a long time, or should I stand up to walk?" You should walk as if you are a healed person. However, this must be done after you have received a promise from God and must be carried out in complete reliance on God. Otherwise, the result will be a failure.</P><P>The same is true in regards to trusting in God for our living. Although sometimes we may be in great want, what we look toward is a fountain and not a bucket. We should not worry or be tempted to borrow (Rom. 13:8). In the God-ordained principle of giving, we should still be very generous. If we trust in God when we are in trials, we should not tell others, hint at help from others, or resort to other methods. We should live as if nothing has happened. Other matters such as peace within the family, occupations, livelihoods, sufferings, dangers, and other similar matters should follow the same principle. We have to know that God is not only interested in our spiritual affairs; He is equally concerned with the many matters related to our physical being. This is the characteristic of faith: faith does not wait until something is done before believing, because then there is no need to believe anymore. Faith is exercised before something is accomplished and believes, based on God's promises, that it has already been accomplished. The Lord Jesus' teaching concerning faith is, "Believe that you have received them, and you will have them" (Mark 11:24). Faith is not believing after receiving. Rather, it is believing, before ever receiving, that one has received. This is the most profound aspect of the law of faith. Nevertheless, we have mentioned that faith must be expressed through works. Therefore, when one believes that he has received, he should act as if he has received.</P><P>Such work is very spontaneous. The eyes of faith do not see dark clouds in the sky. Rather, they see an unchanging sun above the dark clouds. Physical eyes can only see the present darkness, but the eyes of faith can see the light. They do not imagine; they actually see. Is not the light they see more real than the darkness the world sees? Faith despises all dangers, sufferings, and trials, for it knows what the end will be. The work of faith is not a risk but a sure and practical act. It sees what others do not. Although others may consider such acts dangerous, these "dangers" have been well thought through, prayed about, promised by God, and taught by the Scriptures. If a person has not received the teaching of the Scriptures or the promise of the Holy Spirit in his spirit, forcing himself to do such acts is indeed a risk. But for a believer who has truly received God's revelation and has faith, these acts are spontaneous and unpretentious because they are the most natural result of his faith. Although many believers have never heard these teachings yet, God has been leading them this way already. If the work of our faith is something conscious, artificial, and pretentious, we have not yet learned the lesson of faith. Although all the works of faith are beyond human reason, they are carried out according to the principle of one's living. This one has received God's promise and knows what is going to happen. Therefore, he acts ahead of others. The works of faith are often the works that glorify God.</P><H1 CLASS=MSG>MESSAGE THIRTEEN</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>BRIBING THE CONSCIENCE</H1><H2 CLASS=HEAD4>Issue No. 24</H2><P>The conscience is God's voice of righteousness within man. It is a part of the spirit, and its function is to rebuke everything that is not of God and against righteousness. It is a prosecutor, and it restrains man from doing anything that falls under its jurisdiction.</P><P>Believers are often fearful of their conscience! Those whose hearts are right obey the correction and guidance of the conscience; those whose hearts are not right try to bribe their conscience and silence its accusations. But can the conscience be bribed? The conscience cannot be bribed. After believers have tried their bribe, they think that they no longer need to heed the voice of their conscience. Actually, the voice of their conscience is only confused and drowned out by other voices.</P><P>Many times, our conscience tells us clearly through intuition what is God's will, where it lies, and what it requires of us. But we are reluctant in submitting to it! The one thing that the flesh fears the most is the will of God. One can say that the flesh fears nothing other than God's will. Since the mind of the flesh does not like God's decisions, it is naturally unwilling to obey them, and the conscience has to urge a person on. When the urging becomes ineffective, the rebukes of the conscience follow. This feels terrible! If one allows his conscience to work, his heart will become uneasy, and he will feel terrible! This is truly unbearable. In order to avoid the condemnation of the conscience and, at the same time, continue to disobey God's will, one has to bribe the conscience.</P><P>In this lies all the mistakes of a believer. He does not seek a solution that will deliver him from the condemnation of the conscience. Rather, he tries to confuse and mix up its voice with other voices in order to minimize its pricking power. But the best way to be free from the condemnation of the conscience is to remove what the conscience condemns and obey God's will in all things. Anything else will cause the believer to offend the Lord even more.</P><P>How numerous are the excuses! When believers do not obey God's will, their conscience condemns them. What then can they do? The only thing they can do is to explain, argue, and give reasons and causes for their present disobedience. This is a bribing of the conscience. Believers behave this way because they think that if they can explain the reason for their actions to others and themselves, their disobedience to God's will, in turn, will become His will. Little do they realize that this can never happen. Nevertheless, realizing that the condemnation of their conscience is difficult to bear, they try every means to stop it. If they cannot obey God's will, they appease themselves by giving reasons for their disobedience to God, hoping to blunt the cutting edge of the knife and minimize their own hurt. On the one hand, the conscience condemns. On the other hand, the flesh is unwilling to obey. Consequently, the only solution is to use many reasons and explanations to quell the conscience, telling it that the way they have taken is the right way and that there is no reason for it to continue the condemnation.</P><P>There are other ways to bribe the conscience. One of the ways is through labor. If one is unwilling to obey God, he will try to substitute God's will with greater and more numerous works, as if the increased labor can take the place of God's will. Many believers try to suppress the condemnation of the conscience through busy activities. They are afraid to think and afraid to quietly listen to what their conscience is saying. If they listen, they feel uneasy. They are willing to suffer, work, and labor in their mind and bodies apart from God's revealed will. By working in this way, they have no time and are able to ignore the corrections of their conscience with peace. Even if the conscience is able to slip in some unpleasant remarks, they are able to answer on the basis of their work and bribe it into silence. "Are not these works equally important? Are they not equally good? Are they not important? Do they not bear fruit?" When the conscience is repeatedly drowned out by these sounds, it becomes difficult to hear its voice anymore. From this point on, the believers build up a defense and are free to disobey God.</P><P>It is very serious to bribe one's conscience. But one bribes his conscience in many of the small things that occur in his daily life. The most common example is the reading of the Bible in the morning. The conscience condemns going to work in the morning without first reading the Bible. However, many believers fail in this matter. If they do not read the Bible, they feel uneasy. But they are unwilling and not interested in reading it. For this reason, they mindlessly open the Bible and read one or two verses, counting that as their reading of the Bible. This silences the voice of their conscience. This bribes the conscience with one or two verses and stops its condemnation.</P><P>Are not many prayers offered up in the same way? This is especially true in the case of making supplications for others. If one does not pray for others, he feels condemned in his conscience. Reluctantly, he makes supplications for others by calling their names one by one, like taking roll in a school. This type of reading the Bible and praying for others is not for the purpose of reading and supplication, but for the purpose of silencing the accusation of the conscience. If the conscience did not speak, this type of reading and prayer would have stopped long ago. But since the conscience is diligent, one realizes that he cannot let down at all and instead has to bribe his conscience with half-hearted works.</P><P>The same is true of the gospel work among many workers. When some feel emotionally low and physically weak, they become lazy in preaching the gospel. But many times, sinners are placed before them and need to be saved immediately. If these workers remain silent for a long time, the conscience will voice its usual accusation. Under such circumstances, they reluctantly speak a few words about salvation to others in order to bribe their conscience. They think that by speaking, they have fulfilled their duty and that nothing more can be said against them. Whether or not the conscience still accuses them is a secondary question. The serious matter is that believers would even consider answering the interrogation of their conscience with such half-hearted acts. Once they engage in such careless acts, they become self-satisfied and feel that they have not neglected their duties. Alas, how many self- proclaimed "not guilty" verdicts are in fact deceptive! How can these works expect God's blessing? How can teachings that do not touch oneself touch sinners? Those who do not sow in tears will surely not reap in joy.</P><P>Shall I mention one more thing? In the matter of material giving, there are more bribes of the believers' conscience. They may be loath to offer, even though they will be accused by their conscience if they do not offer to the Lord. The best way to take care of this dilemma is to offer just a little to bribe the conscience so that the conscience will know that some money has been offered. Since what should be done has been done, there is no more reason for the conscience to nag. Many times, an offering of a few dollars to the poor is not done out of a love for the poor, but to silence and bribe the conscience. Actually, unless an offering results in a painful touch of the heart, a pain of joy to the extent that his flesh feels some kind of pain, the offering cannot be considered as a real offering.</P><P>We have mentioned but a few examples. In a believer's daily life, he bribes his conscience in many other things. He either reasons and argues with the conscience or uses other means to substitute for the demand of the conscience. Such acts are too frequent! This explains the fallen and shallow nature of a believer's spiritual life. Brothers, do not think that our knowledge of the Bible is too small and that we do not know God's will in many matters. I will readily admit that this is true. But if our knowledge of the Bible is shallow, this is all the more reason to obey the "inner voice." Undoubtedly, we are still not clear about God's will in many things. But why will we not act on what we already know? Bribing the conscience is proof that we know what we ought to do and that we know God's will, but we are unwilling to do it. This is why we bribe the conscience.</P><P>Brothers, it is important that we obey God's will faithfully. Before we do this, we must have a sincere willingness to do God's will. Everything else is futile. We are not after success, the world's recommendations, or even peace in our conscience. If our goal is only to secure the peace of our conscience and we fully abide by God's will, we are still bribing our conscience. We must see the greatness and solemnity of God's will. We must obey God's will for the sake of God's will. The voice of the conscience merely shows us where we have left the track of God's will. If, while we live in this world, we do not live for God's will, we are indeed selfish! Are we afraid of the accusation of our conscience more than of our disloyalty to God Himself? We should be afraid of acting contrary to the will of God. Regrettably, we live in this world for our own pleasure. Even when we obey God's will, it is for the purpose of making ourselves feel comfortable! Because disobedience to the will of God results in the accusation of our conscience, the loss of peace and joy, and suffering to our heart, we reluctantly go along with the leading of our conscience, hoping that this will recover our joy. Oh, how selfish this is! This bribes the conscience.</P><P>We have to have a fresh evaluation of God's will. We have to exercise a deeper rejection of our self and have a more severe dealing with and deeper hatred for self-deception. If we would give up our act of bribing the conscience and live in God's will day by day, we would find ourselves living in a new realm.</P><H1 CLASS=MSG>MESSAGE FOURTEEN</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>THE CONDESCENSION OF THE LORD JESUS</H1><H2 CLASS=HEAD4>Issue No. 24</H2><P>Only the One who is the highest can condescend to be the lowest. The whole life of our Lord shows us that He condescended in this way. When we read the four Gospels, we see a condescending life unfold before us. This is one of the reasons that we admire and worship Him. There are many aspects to His condescension, but the most beautiful one is His co-working with His creatures and employing them to be the instruments for His work.</P><P>He is the Creator. He creates things out of nothing. As soon as He says something, it is done. His words are absolute and infinite. Behind His words is His mighty power which accomplishes what He says. He does not need any helper or raw material. His authority is sufficient to accomplish everything. The Creator does not need co-workers or instruments.</P><P>Yet, how amazing are His acts on the earth! He used the seven loaves and a few fish that the disciples offered Him to feed four thousand. If He could feed four thousand with seven loaves and a few fish, He could have fed them without any loaf or fish by creating the loaves and the fish instead. For Him both ways are equally easy. He could perform miracles, any kind of miracles. For Him, creating something out of nothing and increasing something out of a little is equally easy. But He condescended. He was happy to share His glory and work with His disciples. He wanted to bring His people into the work that He was doing. He did not want to be alone. He did not want to do everything by Himself. He wanted to work together with His people. He desired to see His people participating in His work. He was happy to lead the creatures into the work of the Creator. He wanted them to know that when they consecrated themselves, obeyed Him, and trusted in His work, He would use them and what they had to manifest His glory. Oh what glory this is! He always desired that His people would join themselves to Him.</P><P>When He had to go to Jerusalem, He could have created a colt with His creative power in the same way that He created many animals when He furnished the earth. Yet He was happy to have the disciples go and fetch it for Him. He even said that "the Lord has need of them" (Matt. 21:3), which can be translated as "the Lord lacks them" or "the Lord is in need of them." Did the Creator really have any lack? Did He really have any need? But He said this Himself. He knew beforehand that there was a donkey with a colt tied beside her in the next village. He also knew that no man had ever sat on the colt. And He knew that the owner would question the disciples when they unloosened the colt and what they should say in order for the owner to release it to them. This was a miracle. But His condescension lies in the fact that He was happy to perform this type of miracle rather than set aside the existing colt or the disciples' errands by performing a miracle of creating a colt. He could have created a colt a hundred times better than any other colt with one word. Yet, and I say this most reverently, He was pleased to be helped by men. He was happy to see other men making contributions to His earthly journey. He was happy to have men as His companions. He was willing to receive something from His loved ones to help Him in His work. He could go on alone with no need of men. Yet He did not want to do this. He wanted to condescend a little and receive men's consecration. He wanted to elevate men and give them a part in God's work.</P><P>He said, "I have need of them," "I lack them." It seems that He was saying that His lack would not have been met if the owner of the colt had refused to give it to Him. He had a need, and He desired to see men fulfill this need. He would rather receive what He needed from the hands of His people than through His own miracle. If His people would be faithful to give, He would ride on their colt and enter Jerusalem to receive men's Hosannas. If the believers were lazy or held back, He would rather wait and allow His need to go unanswered. He was not willing to exercise His divine power to work alone. He was not in haste. This is His will; He wants to do things this way. We do not know why, but we know that this is what He wants to do. All those who understand the Lord's heart should find their own responsibility in this matter.</P><P>On the one hand, the Lord condescends. On the other hand, He elevates us. Are we worthy of such elevation? If the creatures are not elevated through the opportunity to take care of the Creator's need, what else could this be? When we consider this, we should murmur less when the Holy Spirit prompts us to consecrate. It is an absolute mistake to think that when we offer ourselves and what we have to God that we are doing God a favor or earning credits from God. Our consecration and God's acceptance of our consecration is God's elevating and bestowing His glory on us. He is the Most High God. All the angels in heaven are His servants. All the cattle and goats on the hills are His. He owns all the gold and silver on earth and thousands of worlds are His. Does He have any lack? Does He need the power and material supply of humble and poor people? Is He really helpless and seeking our help? Or is He elevating and uplifting us through these needs and making us realize that humble, lowly, poor, and destitute men such as ourselves can be counted worthy of supplying God's needs and becoming His help? This is indeed too wonderful!</P><P>Is it not a wonder that God wants our strength and material supply? Is it not a wonder that a king would want the possessions of a beggar? Is there no one who can supply Him other than beggars? Or does He have other intentions in mind? Should a beggar who is given the privilege of helping his king feel flattered or self-accomplished? Offering to our King is our extraordinary privilege.</P><P>The believers should consider what sacrifice there can be for little creatures such as we to offer anything to God. It is our privilege and special right to be able to do this. His willingness to accept our offering is sufficient honor for us. His asking of us is a far higher honor. Because our hearts are too dull and ignorant of the honor of consecration, we boast of our suffering, sacrifice, and consecration to the Lord as if we have earned some credit from Him! Oh, how believers are unappreciative of their elevation! If the present workers of the Lord realized this fact, they would not be so timid and careful. They would not save up treasures for themselves and would not consider their offering of a little money as a favor to the Lord.</P><P>The words of Mordecai are very fitting. He told queen Esther, "For if thou altogether holdest thy peace at this time, then shall there enlargement and deliverance arise to the Jews from another place...and who knoweth whether thou art come to the kingdom for such a time as this?" (Esth. 4:14). Dear brothers and sisters, today God's people have many needs. God considers these needs as His needs. He will fill these needs. However, He does not want to deliver His people by performing miracles by Himself. He wants to use you. Are you willing? He could send messengers from heaven to sound the call and revive His people. He could perform many works of wonders and strange signs to wake up sinners. He could once again send manna from heaven to feed His servants and maids who live by Him. But if He did these things, you would lose your glory and your share in God's work. He can perform miracles and grant deliverance, but He wants to do them through you. He does not want to do them by Himself. The question is whether or not we are worthy of His elevation.</P><P>He is willing that He Himself should condescend and is happy to elevate us. He is happy for us to have a share in all His works. He is humble enough to say that He has needs so that a door will be open for us to help Him and gain His glory. If this is the case, why would we not consecrate ourselves to the Lord? Why would we not offer our riches? All those who fail to grasp the present opportunities are foolish.</P><P>In summary, God needs man in His work of saving the world. If you will not help, God will raise up others to take your place. The work of helping other believers go on needs man. If you draw back, God will raise up others to take your place. God has given you money so that you will supply the need of His work. If you fail, God will raise up others. God's needs must be met, but who will meet them? Who will step forward to preach His word, and who will fill up God's glory? If you do not step forward, do not think that God will be short of help. He will raise up others. But it will be a pity that you will not be able to share in the glory. "For if thou altogether holdest thy peace at this time, then shall there enlargement and deliverance arise to the Jews from another place" (Esth. 4:14). Therefore brothers, let "no one take your crown" (Rev. 3:11).</P><P>God's need today is greater than at any other time. He is bestowing special glory to believers of this age. He is still willing to condescend. But are there believers who are willing to marvel with gratitude for such grace from God and fulfill God's need without feeling self-satisfied because of their awareness of such a high honor?</P></body></html>
