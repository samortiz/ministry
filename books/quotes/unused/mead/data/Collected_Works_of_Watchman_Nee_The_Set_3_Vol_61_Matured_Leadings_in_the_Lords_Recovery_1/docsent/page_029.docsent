   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE LOSS AND RECOVERY OF THE TRUTH</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>CONCERNING "HANDING OVER" The Degradation in Catholicism</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>and the Loss of the Truth</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Roman Catholicism reached its zenith during the Middle Ages.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>During that time the truth expounded by the church became distorted; it became very different from the teaching found in the four Gospels and in Acts.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In the four Gospels, while the Lord Jesus was on earth, He not only emphasized deliverance from sin but also emphasized deliverance from money cf.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Luke 16:19-24; 19:16-26 .</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The Acts of the Apostles is a book on the teachings of the apostles.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>These teachings exhort men to flee from money, on the one hand, and from sin, on the other hand.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The Christian foundation is built upon deliverance from these two things.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>If a man continues to live under the bondage of sin as a sinner, he cannot be a proper Christian.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>In the same way, if he continues to live under the bondage of money, he cannot be a proper Christian.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>In order to serve the Lord, a man must first be delivered from sin and money on the negative side.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>In the fourth century the world was brought into the church.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>It was no longer poor; it became very rich.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Within the church, there was a gradual turning away from the teachings taught by the Lord Jesus and the apostles at the beginning.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The early church followed the teachings of the apostles and exhorted men to flee from both sin and money.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>It is ugly for a Christian to tolerate sin, but it is equally ugly for a Christian to tolerate money and the world.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Yet after the first apostles passed away, the church gradually became relaxed in the matter of money.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>It still taught that Christians should not sin, but it allowed believers to keep their money.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>There was no end to the degradation.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>From that time onward, the trend has been ever downward.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>This went on until the Middle Ages.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Since the sixth century, when the church developed into the system of Catholicism, there has been a toleration not only of money but of sin as well.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Men began to accumulate wealth, yet spiritually they became extremely poor.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Later the Catholic Church even came up with the teaching of purgatory.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>As long as a man had money, he could absolve himself from his sins by buying indulgences.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>To help finance the building of St. Peter's Cathedral, the pope greatly promoted the practice of selling indulgences, especially when he found out that little was coming in from the general offering.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>For example, those who had committed adultery could be absolved of their sin with four indulgences.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Those who had murdered could be absolved of their sin with twelve, and those who had lied could be absolved of their sin with two.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>In this way society became corrupted, and there was much confusion.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>God's Recovery Work</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>At man's darkest moment God began His recovery work.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>It began with Martin Luther, but this does not mean that only Luther made progress towards recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Among his contemporaries, there were others who saw the same thing.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Luther was a representative of God's recovery work in that age.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Nine hundred years after the degradation of the church, we see a new beginning in Protestantism.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>For the first time Christians were again expected to turn from sin.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Since Luther's time God has been recovering His truths one by one.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>First, the church saw the need of turning away from sin.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>All the spiritual giants in church history, such as Moody, Spurgeon, and Finney, paid attention to turning men away from sin.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>They said that in order to receive salvation and become a Christian, one had to be sincere.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>He should not lie, debauch, or commit adultery.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>But the church has never been bold enough to proclaim, as the Lord Jesus proclaimed, that one should forsake everything to follow the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>I am not saying that there have been no real followers of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Thank the Lord, there has never been an interruption in the line of true Christians.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>First, we have St. Francis of Assisi.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>He was the son of a rich man, but he sold all of his possessions and gave to the poor.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>He began to practice a life of voluntary poverty.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Later in Moravia God raised up Count Zinzendorf.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>He was a nobleman, but he opened up his estate to receive saints from everywhere.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>The result was the establishment of the Moravian Brethren.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>After this there was Sister Eva, a German, who also took the way of voluntary poverty.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>In the last century the Brethren were raised up by God.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Among them many truths were recovered.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Many leading brothers among them, such as Darby and Kelly, practiced voluntary poverty.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>They forsook everything to follow the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>This is the reason the Lord could have a way through them.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>In 1922 when I was just saved, I saw this truth and I began to practice forsaking everything to follow the Lord.</S>
