No other verses in the entire Bible reveal coordination in such a definite and practical way as these four verses. These verses tell us that the four living creatures are joined together by using two of their wings. They use two of their wings for moving, and this moving is in coordination. By two of their wings they are joined one to another, and by two of their wings they are coordinated. We have already seen that they use the other two wings to cover themselves. We have also seen that the eagle's wings in the Old Testament symbolize the divine strength, the divine power, and the divine supply. This means that the coordination of the four living creatures is not in themselves. In themselves they do not have the ability to be coordinated. Their coordination is in the divine power, the divine strength, and the divine supply, because the eagle's wings are the means for them to be coordinated with one another. Thus, their coordination does not depend upon themselves. It is not a matter of what they are or of what they can do, but a matter of the eagle's wings. The eagle's wings are the means by which they are coordinated as one. It is by the divine power and strength that they are coordinated.</P><P>By themselves the living creatures are individuals, but with the eagle's wings they are coordinated into one body. This means that the coordination among us Christians is not something of ourselves. What we have in ourselves does not coordinate, but rather divides. In ourselves we are always dividing and separating, never coordinating. Coordination in our human strength will not last very long. But we have the eagle's wings. With the eagle's wings we can be coordinated.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>TO EXPRESS AND MANIFEST CHRIST</H2><P>We must be coordinated as the four living creatures in order that Christ may be expressed and manifested. We also must be coordinated for the move of the Lord. The Lord moves in the center of the coordination of the living creatures. The coordination is also for God's divine administration and government, because the throne is in the clear sky above such a coordination. The throne is for God's government and administration. Thus, the coordination of the living creatures is for manifesting Christ, for the Lord's move, and for God's divine government.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE TABERNACLE JOINED TOGETHER BY THE GOLD</H2><P>The same principle can be seen in the tabernacle in the wilderness (Exo. 26:29-30). The tabernacle was built of forty-eight boards coordinated into one entity. Those boards were coordinated into one building not by themselves, but by the overlaying gold. All the boards were overlaid with gold. Then upon the overlaying gold were the golden rings. Through the golden rings were the golden bars. The gold coordinated all forty-eight boards into one entity. The overlaying gold signifies the divine nature and indicates that God Himself was the coordinating factor that caused all the boards to be one tabernacle.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE WAY OF COORDINATION</H2><P>Now we need to see how the four living creatures are coordinated. Each of the four living creatures faces one direction. One of the living creatures faces the north; another living creature faces the south; another living creature faces the east; and the last living creature faces the west. As they face these four directions, two of their wings spread out and touch the adjacent creatures' wings, forming a square. Each of the living creatures uses two of his wings to join with the other living creatures.</P><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_016.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_018.html">Next</a> </body></html>
