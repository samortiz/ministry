<h1 class="title">EXPERIENCING AND ENJOYING CHRIST<br />
IN THE EPISTLES</h1>
<h1 class="title">(12)</h1>
<p>First Corinthians is a book full of the riches of Christ. The essential and underlying thought of this book is that we should enjoy Christ (10:3-4).</p>
<h2 class="head3">21. The Sanctifier and<br />
the Portion of All the Saints</h2>
<p>In 1 Corinthians 1:2 Paul says, &ldquo;To the church of God which is in Corinth, to those who have been sanctified in Christ Jesus, the called saints, with all those who call upon the name of our Lord Jesus Christ in every place, who is theirs and ours.&rdquo; This verse presents Christ as the Sanctifier and the portion of all the saints. First, Christ came to sanctify us; then He, the Sanctifier, became our eternal portion for our enjoyment.</p>
<h2 class="head4">a. All the Believers Having Been Sanctified in Him<br />
to Be the Called Saints</h2>
<h2 class="head5">(1) All the Believers Having Been Sanctified in Him</h2>
<p>In 1 Corinthians 1:2 Paul speaks of those who have been &ldquo;sanctified in Christ Jesus.&rdquo; To be sanctified in Christ Jesus is to be sanctified in the element and sphere of Christ. Christ is the element and sphere that separated us, made us holy, unto God when we believed into Him, that is, when we were brought into an organic union with Him through our faith in Him.</p>
<p>To be sanctified in Christ means that first we are put into Christ. Christ is a holy sphere, a sphere of holiness. Not only is Christ holy&mdash;Christ Himself is holiness. Holiness is actually God Himself, and God is embodied in Christ. Therefore, Christ is our holiness. Because God has put us into Christ (v. 30), we have been put into the sphere of holiness. Now that we are in Christ as the sphere of holiness, we are sanctified. Furthermore, since to be sanctified is to be made holy, to be sanctified in Christ Jesus is to be made holy in Him.</p>
<p>As the Sanctifier, Christ sanctifies us in two aspects, positionally and dispositionally. The former is objective, whereas the latter is subjective. Christ has sanctified us positionally through His own blood (Heb. 13:12). We were once fallen sinners who belonged to the world and to many things other than God. Then Christ redeemed us with His blood; simultaneously, His redeeming blood sanctified us, separated us, and set us apart unto God, making us holy positionally. Consequently, we now belong to God. In other words, our original position was worldly and not at all for God, but when we were separated unto God through Christ&rsquo;s redeeming blood, our position was changed, and as a result, we became holy. Through His redeeming blood, Christ has sanctified us, setting us apart unto God for the fulfillment of His purpose. This is the objective aspect of Christ&rsquo;s sanctification.</p>
<p>While sanctification is a positional matter and thereby involves separation from a worldly position to a position for God, sanctification is also a dispositional matter (1 Cor. 6:11). This means that sanctification is not only a change of position but also a change of disposition. It is through dispositional sanctification that the believers are being transformed from a natural disposition to a spiritual one. Although the blood of Christ separates us unto God positionally, it cannot accomplish anything in us with respect to the inner life. Hence, it can sanctify us only positionally but not dispositionally. The dispositional sanctification comes out of Christ as the eternal life within us. Christ has the divine life, and He is the divine life imparted to us. Within the divine life, there is the element, the essence, of holiness. This essence of holiness sanctifies us subjectively, that is, dispositionally; it transforms us, changing our disposition and our nature. This process is not sanctification of our position, but that of our disposition&mdash;sanctification that transforms our inner being. If we see this, we will realize that we must experience Christ as the Sanctifier both positionally and dispositionally.</p><h2 class="head5">(2) To Be the Called Saints</h2>
<p>In 1 Corinthians 1:2 Paul equates, by the use of an appositive, &ldquo;those who have been sanctified in Christ Jesus&rdquo; with &ldquo;called saints.&rdquo; In this verse the Greek words <em>hagiazo</em> (translated &ldquo;sanctified&rdquo;) and <em>hagios</em> (translated &ldquo;saints&rdquo;) are of the same root, which fundamentally means &ldquo;separated, set apart.&rdquo; To be holy is to be separated, set apart to God. The saints are the separated ones, the ones set apart to God, and sanctification to God is the practical effect, the character in activity, and the consummate state produced by being sanctified. We, the believers, have been sanctified; hence, we are called saints. The saints are simply sanctified ones, holy ones, those who have been set apart to God. Moreover, we need to note that the believers in Christ are called saints, not called <em>to be</em> saints. This is a positional matter, a sanctification in position with a view to sanctification in disposition. Verse 2 reveals the matter of our being in Christ positionally. We should never despise our position in Christ.</p>
<p>We should have the boldness to say that we are holy, and we should praise the Lord for the fact that we are saints. Concerning this we should not look at ourselves. Paul does not say that the Corinthians were sanctified in themselves; he declares that they had been sanctified in Christ Jesus. We need to forget ourselves and see that it is in Christ that we are sanctified.</p>
<p>God does not look at us as we are in ourselves; rather, He looks at us in Christ. Paul knew about the evil things in the church in Corinth. Nevertheless, in his opening word of 1 Corinthians he addressed them as those who are sanctified <em>in Christ Jesus,</em> and he called them saints. In themselves they were Corinthians, but in Christ they were saints. If we turn away from ourselves and look at Christ, we will be able to declare that we are saints. We will realize that a saint is simply a called one.</p>
<p>To be called by God is to be separated unto Him. Just as those who have been called into military service have been separated from civilian life and drafted into the service, when we were called by God, we were &ldquo;drafted,&rdquo; separated, by Him. As a result, we have been sanctified; that is, we have been separated unto His purpose. Therefore, we are the called saints.</p>
<h2 class="head4">b. His Being Every Believer&rsquo;s Portion</h2>
<p>In verse 2 immediately after revealing Christ as the Sanctifier, Paul unveils that our Lord Jesus Christ, the Sanctifier, is our portion: &ldquo;Those who have been sanctified in Christ Jesus, the called saints, with all those who call upon the name of our Lord Jesus Christ in every place, who is theirs and ours.&rdquo; The phrase <em>theirs and ours</em> indicates that He is the portion of both the saints in Corinth and the saints who &ldquo;call upon the name of our Lord Jesus Christ in every place.&rdquo; No matter where we may be when we call on the name of the Lord Jesus, Christ is both our portion and also the portion of all the saints. In every place, Christ is theirs and ours. If we say that a certain thing is ours, we indicate that it is our possession. In the same way, the phrase <em>theirs and ours</em> means that Christ is the portion possessed by all the saints. In other words, all the saints have Him as their unique portion. Therefore, verse 2 reveals that Christ as the all-inclusive One belongs to all believers and that all the believers jointly participate in Him.</p>
<p>Christ is our allotted portion given to us by God. Colossians 1:12 says, &ldquo;Giving thanks to the Father, who has qualified you for a share of the allotted portion of the saints in the light.&rdquo; This verse shows that Christ, the Son of God, is our portion. All Christians know that God has redeemed us, but not many realize that He has also qualified us to partake of Christ as the portion of the saints. The word <em>portion</em> in Colossians 1:12 indicates enjoyment. Christ is the unique enjoyment for all the saints. Nothing should be allowed to replace Him as our portion. Only the living person of Christ, not any doctrine or practice, is our portion.</p>
<p>The apostle added the special phrase <em>theirs and ours</em> at the end of 1 Corinthians 1:2 to stress the crucial fact that Christ is the unique center of all believers in any place or situation. In this Epistle the apostle&rsquo;s intention was to solve the problems among the saints in Corinth. For all the problems, especially the matter of division, the only solution is the all-inclusive Christ. We have all been called into the fellowship of this Christ (1 Cor. 1:9). All believers should be focused on Him, not being distracted by any gifted person, any overstressed doctrine, or any particular practice.</p>
<p>Based on His economy, God has given Christ to us to be our portion. We may enjoy Christ our unique portion simply by calling on His name. When we call on the name of the Lord Jesus, we get His person, and then this person becomes our portion.</p><h2 class="head4">c. God Having Called All the Believers<br />
into the Participation in Him</h2>
<p>Verse 9 says, &ldquo;God is faithful, through whom you were called into the fellowship of His Son, Jesus Christ our Lord.&rdquo; To be called into the fellowship of God&rsquo;s Son is to partake of the fellowship of the union with God&rsquo;s Son, Jesus Christ, and to participate in Him. God has called us into such a fellowship that we may enjoy Christ as our God-given portion. The phrase <em>into the fellowship of His Son,</em> like the word in verse 2 concerning Christ&rsquo;s being theirs and ours, stresses again the crucial fact that Christ is the unique center of the believers for the solving of the problems among them, especially the problem of division.</p>
<p>The faithful God has called us into the fellowship of, and the participation in, His Son, Jesus Christ. That is, God has given His Son to us as our portion that we would always enjoy Him. The entire book of 1 Corinthians presents the details of our enjoyment of Christ. This book unveils to us that the Christ, into whom we have all been called, is all-inclusive. He is the portion given to us by God (1:2). He is God&rsquo;s power and God&rsquo;s wisdom as righteousness, sanctification, and redemption to us (vv. 24, 30). He is the Lord of glory (2:8) for our glorification (v. 7; Rom. 8:30). He is the depths (deep things) of God (1 Cor. 2:10). He is the unique foundation of God&rsquo;s building (3:11). He is our Passover (5:7), the unleavened bread (v. 8), the spiritual food, the spiritual drink, and the spiritual rock (10:3-4). He is the Head (11:3) and the Body (12:12). He is the firstfruits (15:20, 23), the second man (v. 47), and the last Adam (v. 45); as such, He became the life-giving Spirit (v. 45) that we may receive Him into us as our everything. This all-inclusive One, with the riches of at least twenty items, God has given to us as our portion for our enjoyment. We should concentrate on Him, not on any persons, things, or matters other than Him. We should focus on Him as our unique center appointed by God so that all the problems among the believers may be solved. It is into the fellowship of such a One that we have been called by God. This fellowship of God&rsquo;s Son became the fellowship that the apostles shared with the believers (Acts 2:42; 1 John 1:3) in His Body, the church, and should be the fellowship that we enjoy in partaking of His blood and His body at His table (1 Cor. 10:16, 21). Such a fellowship, which is carried out by the Spirit (2 Cor. 13:14), must be unique because He is unique; it forbids any division among the members of His unique Body.</p>
<p>This word <em>fellowship</em> is profound and exceedingly deep. It means that we and Christ have become one, that we enjoy Christ and all He is and that He enjoys us and all we are (Phil. 1:18; 2:17-18, 28; 3:1; 4:4, 10). As a result, there is not only a mutual communication but a mutuality in every way: all that Christ is becomes ours, and all that we are becomes His. We have all been called by God into such a mutuality between us and the Son of God, a mutuality in which we enjoy what the Son of God is, and He enjoys what we are, and in which we are one with Him, and He is one with us. We have been called into such a oneness, in which we enjoy what Christ is, and He enjoys what we are.</p>
<p>In keeping with this, Paul says in 1 Corinthians 6:17, &ldquo;He who is joined to the Lord is one spirit.&rdquo; The word <em>joined</em> in this verse is a synonym for <em>fellowship</em> in 1:9; the joining is actually the fellowship. The fellowship into which we have been called is Christ as the life-giving Spirit. To experience this fellowship we must be one spirit with Him. In our spirit we are one with the life-giving Spirit.</p>
<p>The fellowship of Christ is actually carried out by the Spirit; thus, in our experience, the fellowship of the Son is the fellowship of the Spirit (2 Cor. 13:14; cf. Phil. 2:1). The way to enjoy the Lord experientially is through Him as the Spirit in our spirit. Today Christ is the life-giving Spirit, and we have a regenerated human spirit. When we are joined to Him, we become one spirit with Him. Whenever we are one spirit with the Lord, we are in the fellowship of Christ, and we experience Him as the all-inclusive One.</p>
<p>This fellowship involves not only the oneness between us and the Triune God but also the oneness among all the believers (John 17:21-23; Eph. 4:3). Fellowship implies a mutual flowing among the believers (1 John 1:3). In the New Testament, fellowship describes the flowing both between us and the Lord and between us and one another (Phil. 2:1). The flow, the current, that we have in our spiritual fellowship involves both oneness and life. Our fellowship is a flow in oneness; it is an intercommunication of life among us as believers in Christ. This fellowship is the reality of the church life (1 Cor. 1:9, 2).</p>
<p>Because we have been called into such a fellowship, we should not say that we are of Paul, of Cephas, of Apollos, or of any other person (v. 12). Neither should we say that we are of a certain doctrine or of a particular practice. God has not called us into the fellowship of any person, doctrine, denomination, or practice. We have not been called into our preference, either in persons or denominations. Rather, we have been called uniquely into the fellowship of God&rsquo;s Son. We have all been called into Christ, called into the fellowship, enjoyment, and participation in Him. This means that Christ alone must be our fellowship. God is pleased only with Christ; in God&rsquo;s economy there is room only for Christ. God has only one center&mdash;Jesus Christ&mdash;and He has called us not into the denomination of our choice but into the fellowship of His Son. No individual or group must be our preference. Our only preference must be Christ as the unique center, the Christ who is theirs and ours, the Christ into whose fellowship we have been called by God. The all-inclusive Christ must be our unique choice, preference, portion, taste, and enjoyment (vv. 24, 30; 2:2). We should all be able to say that our only preference is the all-inclusive and all-extensive Christ.</p>
<p>In summary, Paul in 1 Corinthians 1:1-9 impresses us with the fact that in God&rsquo;s economy, Christ is the unique center. God&rsquo;s intention is to make Christ His Son the center of His economy and also to make Him everything to all the believers. For this reason Paul tells us that Christ is both theirs and ours and that we have been called into the fellowship of the Son, Jesus Christ our Lord. In His economy God&rsquo;s intention is to make Christ everything, to give Christ to us as our portion, and to work Christ into us.</p><h1 class="series">THE CONCLUSION<br />
OF THE NEW TESTAMENT</h1>

<h1 class="title">(13)</h1>
<h2 class="head3">22. God&rsquo;s Power and God&rsquo;s Wisdom</h2>
<p>In the previous message we saw that according to 1 Corinthians 1:9, God has called the believers into the fellowship of His Son, that is, into the participation in Him, and that to be called into the fellowship of Christ means to be called into the co-enjoyment of Christ as our unique portion. Now we must go on to see various aspects of this portion for our enjoyment. In particular, verses 23, 24, and 30 reveal that we may enjoy Christ as God&rsquo;s wisdom and God&rsquo;s power.</p>
<h2 class="head4">a. Being the Crucified Christ</h2>
<p>Before mentioning Christ as the power of God and the wisdom of God in verse 24, Paul in the previous verse declares, &ldquo;We preach Christ crucified, to Jews a stumbling block, and to Gentiles foolishness &rdquo; (v. 23). This indicates that the Christ who is the power of God and the wisdom of God for the carrying out of God&rsquo;s economy is the crucified Christ, a Christ who did not do anything to save Himself. In man&rsquo;s eyes, if a person is crucified, he is deemed powerless, because a powerful person would not allow himself to be crucified, yet the Christ who is the power of God was crucified. Furthermore, from man&rsquo;s perspective, a wise person would find ways to avoid crucifixion, yet the Christ who is the wisdom of God was crucified.</p>
<p>The crucified Christ is the power of God. In the cross of Christ we see God&rsquo;s power. It takes the power of God to defeat Satan, the world, sin, fallen man, the flesh, the natural life, the old creation, and the ordinances. What other power is greater than Christ crucified as God&rsquo;s power? What other power can destroy Satan or overcome the world? Only God has the power to accomplish these things. This power is not that of doing things by speaking, such as the power God exercised in creation. Rather, it is the power of crucifixion, the power of the wonderful death of Christ. This means that the crucifixion has become the power of God. The death of Christ has become God&rsquo;s power to destroy Satan, to solve the problem of the world, to eliminate sin, and to terminate fallen man, the flesh, the natural life, and the old creation (Heb. 2:14; Gal. 6:14; John 1:29; Heb. 9:26; Rom. 6:6; 1 Cor. 15:45a; Col. 1:14; Matt. 27:50-51). By this power God is able to solve the problem of the ordinances (Eph. 2:14-16). By one death, the death of Christ, all the problems in the universe have been cleared. Thus, Christ crucified is God&rsquo;s power to abolish all negative things and carry out His plan.</p>
<p>This crucified Christ is the wisdom of God. In order to accomplish anything, we need both power and wisdom. Wisdom is for planning and purposing, whereas power is for carrying out and accomplishing what is planned and purposed. In God&rsquo;s economy, Christ crucified is both God&rsquo;s power and His wisdom. It is possible for us to have power or strength without having wisdom or the way. If we have power without wisdom, we may use our strength in a foolish way. Therefore, we need Christ as both power and wisdom.</p>
<p>When we experience the crucified Christ, He becomes to us not only the power of God but also the wisdom of God. The crucified Christ as God&rsquo;s wisdom is related to God&rsquo;s deep and profound plan according to His good pleasure and also according to God&rsquo;s way to fulfill His will (1:9, 11; 3:11). Since we have the crucified Christ as God&rsquo;s wisdom, there is no need for us to seek a way to carry out God&rsquo;s will. Simply by experiencing the crucified Christ, we spontaneously have a way to do God&rsquo;s will. We become very wise in doing the will of God. As long as we experience the crucified Christ, Christ will become to us God&rsquo;s wisdom to fulfill His plan. We will have the wisdom of God to do His will.</p>
<p>When we experience the crucified Christ, we are terminated. All that we are, all that we have, and all that we can do&mdash;all is completely terminated. When we call on the name of the Lord Jesus, as we are enjoying Him and experiencing Him, His crucifixion will terminate us. Christ crucified is not only the power but also the way for us to be delivered from the flesh, the natural life, and the old creation.</p><h2 class="head4">b. God&rsquo;s Power and God&rsquo;s Wisdom<br />
to Those Who Are Called</h2>
<p>First Corinthians 1:24 says, &ldquo;To those who are called, both Jews and Greeks, Christ the power of God and the wisdom of God.&rdquo; Here <em>those who are called</em> refers to the believers who were chosen by God in eternity (Eph. 1:4) and who believed in Christ in time (Acts 13:48). To these called ones, the crucified Christ preached by the apostles is the power of God and the wisdom of God. It seemed to both the miracle-seeking religious Jews, who require signs, and the wisdom-seeking philosophical Greeks that Christ was crucified as a fool (1 Cor. 1:22-23). Because both to Jews and Greeks Christ was nothing, they rejected and despised Christ. To the Jews, the crucified Christ was a stumbling block, and to Greeks, He was foolishness. But to those who believe in Him and call upon His name, He is the power of God and the wisdom of God for them to be delivered from all negative things.</p>
<p>Christ crucified is the power of God for saving us and the wisdom of God for fulfilling His plan. In order to achieve anything, we need both power and wisdom. Power is the ability, and wisdom is the way. Christ is first our power, and then He is our wisdom, that is, our way. Christ is the power of God to carry out God&rsquo;s economy, and He is also the wisdom of God, the way of God, to carry out God&rsquo;s economy.</p>
<p>Christ as the power of God strengthens us with a dynamic power, supplying and sustaining us in what we are and what we do. In all our circumstances and conditions, Christ as the power of God enables us to suffer, to bear burdens, and to stand firm. He also sustains us to the point of being unshakable. For this reason, Paul declared, &ldquo;I am able to do all things in Him who empowers me&rdquo; (Phil. 4:13). Christ as the power of God is daily supplying and sustaining us through His divine dispensing.</p>
<p>Christ as the wisdom of God flows unceasingly from God to us to be our present and practical wisdom in our experience. As we face certain problems and realize that we do not know how to handle them, we should apply Christ as our wisdom. If we remain with the Lord to receive His dispensing, He will be transmitted into us as the wisdom to handle all kinds of problems and matters. This is to apply Christ as wisdom in our daily life.</p>
<p>Wisdom may be understood as the way to do things. If we have wisdom, we will know the proper way to do things, but if we are not wise, our way of doing things will be foolish. In order to have the best way to do things in our daily life, we must have wisdom. Christ as wisdom to the believers is actually the divine way. Hence, wisdom in 1 Corinthians 1:30 is equal to the way in John 14:6, a verse in which the Lord Jesus says, &ldquo;I am the way.&rdquo; God&rsquo;s way is His wisdom. If we enjoy Christ and participate in Him, we will have Him as our wisdom, as our way. This wisdom comes from our enjoyment of Christ. Day by day and hour by hour we should live in the spirit and exercise the spirit to call on the name of the Lord Jesus. If we do this, we will enjoy Christ and have Him as our wisdom, that is, our way of doing things.</p>
<h2 class="head4">c. Having Become Wisdom to Us from God</h2>
<p>Christ has become wisdom to us from God. In 1 Corinthians 1:30 Paul says, &ldquo;Of Him you are in Christ Jesus, who became wisdom to us from God: both righteousness and sanctification and redemption.&rdquo; In this verse Paul does not say that Christ became our wisdom; instead, he says that Christ became wisdom &ldquo;to us from God.&rdquo; The expression <em>to us from God</em> indicates something present, practical, experiential, and ongoing in the way of transmission. For Christ to become wisdom to us from God indicates that there is the transmission of Christ as wisdom from God to us for our daily experience. Paul composed verse 30 in the particular way he did in order to point out to the believers that Christ should continually become wisdom to us from God.</p>
<p>God has never given us wisdom as a thing apart from Himself. Rather, God Himself in Christ is wisdom to us, constantly transmitting Christ, His wisdom, into us as the divine element that constitutes us wise persons. In this transmission, Christ as righteousness, sanctification, and redemption is transmitted into our being.</p>
<p>Christ became wisdom to us from God as three vital things in God&rsquo;s salvation: (1) righteousness (for our past), by which we have been justified by God, that we might be reborn in our spirit to receive the divine life (Rom. 5:18); (2) sanctification (for our present), by which we are being sanctified in our soul, that is, transformed in our mind, emotion, and will, with His divine life (6:19, 22); and (3) redemption (for our future), that is, the redemption of our body (8:23), by which we will be transfigured in our body with His divine life to have His glorious likeness (Phil. 3:21). It is of God that we participate in such a complete and perfect salvation, which makes our entire being&mdash;spirit, soul, and body&mdash;organically one with Christ and makes Christ everything to us.</p>
<p>On the one hand, righteousness, sanctification, and redemption cover three stages of God&rsquo;s salvation: regeneration in the spirit (for our past), sanctification in the soul (for our present), and redemption in the body (for our future). On the other hand, righteousness, sanctification, and redemption refer to three aspects of the nature of God&rsquo;s salvation that we need to experience daily in our Christian living and work. Today in our living and work we need Christ as righteousness, sanctification, and redemption. Every day we need to be righteous, we need to be sanctified, and we need to be redeemed in all matters of our living. Christ, the wisdom of God transmitted into our being, is doing everything within us to make us righteous in our deeds and to sanctify us in our nature. Hence, whatever we do must be righteous and holy. Not only so, Christ as the wisdom of God redeems us from all things other than God (1 Pet. 1:18). Every day our living and work must be righteous, holy, and redeemed. Even our entire being should be righteous, holy, and redeemed.</p><h2 class="head5">(1) Righteousness</h2>
<p>Christ as righteousness takes care of our past. In the past we were unrighteous, always doing things unrighteously. Now Christ is transmitted into us as our righteousness to take care of our past in order that in Him we would be accepted by God.</p>
<p>None of us has a good past. Because our past life was sinful, we need Christ to be our righteousness. This is the real remedy, the real cure. Formerly, our past was awful because of our sins and wrongdoings, but now it is glorious because of Christ. By Him, through Him, and in Him, we have been justified by God, and our past has been forgiven. Now that we have Christ as our righteousness, we should no longer say that our past is awful. Instead, we should declare that our past is glorious, because our past is Christ.</p>
<p>Righteousness is actually Christ Himself. Christ, therefore, is not merely to be righteousness for our past so that we may be justified by God; He should also be our present righteousness in our daily living. Christ as righteousness enables us to be right and just toward God, man, and everything else. Christ is dispensed from God into us to be our life, power, and wisdom so that in our living we can be righteous in every word, deed, movement, and action. In this way, the Lord becomes righteousness to us.</p>
<p>Christ as our righteousness is for the believers&rsquo; enjoyment. Whenever we enjoy Christ and experience Him, we have Him as our righteousness not only objectively but also subjectively. As our objective righteousness, Christ is the One in whom we are justified by God. Justification is God&rsquo;s action in approving us according to the standard of His righteousness. In Christ as our objective righteousness before God, we are justified, approved, by Him (Rom. 3:26). As our subjective righteousness, Christ is the One dwelling in us to live for us a life that can be justified by God and that is always acceptable to God (Phil. 3:9). When we live this Christ and express Him, He becomes our daily righteousness. As believers, we need not only to receive Christ as our righteousness but also to live Him as righteousness subjectively. When we exercise our spirit to contact Him, we become righteous. The more we contact Him and enjoy Him, the more righteous we become in Him. Eventually, by having Christ wrought into us, we become the righteousness of God in Christ (2 Cor. 5:21).</p>
<h2 class="head5">(2) Sanctification</h2>
<p>Christ as sanctification takes care of our present. Because our present life is not holy, not sanctified, we need Christ to be our present sanctification that we may become holy and separated unto God. In ourselves, that is, in our natural life, we are altogether not holy, not sanctified unto God. However, the divine element in the life of Christ that is constantly transmitted into our being sanctifies us, separating us unto God and thereby making us holy.</p>
<p>Sanctification is more than holiness; it is holiness &ldquo;to us&rdquo; in a subjective and experiential way. Whereas holiness refers to the thing itself, sanctification is holiness becoming our experience. By calling on the name of the Lord continually, we gain Christ as our holiness in a subjective way and experience Him as our daily and hourly sanctification. Day by day we need to experience Christ as our sanctification in order that every aspect of our daily walk, including our appearance, our attitude, and our relationships, would be Christ. The more we exercise the spirit to call on the name of the Lord Jesus, the more we are separated from what is common and from being common ourselves. The Christ we enjoy causes us to become holy, sanctified, and separated. In this way, we are no longer common; instead, we are sanctified, separated, marked out, and absolutely different from the worldly people. This is sanctification&mdash;Christ becoming our holiness in our experience.</p>
<p>Christ as the sanctification to us from God is sanctifying us not only in position but also in disposition so that we can be set apart to God from everything common. He is both the power of our sanctification and the factor for our sanctification. Through Him, the divine dispensing is continually transmitted into us, sanctifying our whole being&mdash;spirit, soul, and body&mdash;making us holy, full of the divine element.</p><h2 class="head5">(3) Redemption</h2>
<p>Christ as redemption takes care of our future. Christ as righteousness saved us in that when we believed in Christ and were justified in Him, we were regenerated in our spirit. Christ as sanctification is now transforming our soul, thereby making us holy, yet our body still remains unsaved. In the future our body will be redeemed in Christ; that is, Christ will be our redemption. One day our body will be transfigured into the same body of glory possessed by Christ (Phil. 3:21). This is the redemption of our body, the full enjoyment of our sonship (Rom. 8:23). In this way we enjoy God&rsquo;s full salvation.</p>
<p>Christ as the redemption to us from God will transfigure our body of humiliation through His divine life into the body of His glory. Everything that God glorifies must first be redeemed by passing through the judgment of the cross. Everything in us that is of the natural being, the flesh, the self, the world, sin, the old creation, and Satan must be crucified and judged by God before we can be redeemed and glorified. First, there is redemption, then glory. We are all still in the old creation and in the natural life. Therefore, we need to take the judgment of the cross in order that we can receive Christ as our redemption and be qualified to enjoy God&rsquo;s glory. This is both for our living today and for the redemption of our body in the future, when our whole being will enter into God&rsquo;s glory and will express His glory and radiance forever.</p>
<p>Redemption includes three matters: being brought back to God, terminated, and replaced. When God redeems us, He terminates us, replaces us with Christ, and brings us back to Himself. First, when we enjoy Christ as our portion, we will experience Christ as our redemption and thus will be brought back to God. In our experience we may go astray from the Lord. But when we enjoy Christ and thereby become righteous and sanctified, we are brought back to God. Second, redemption also includes termination. The Christ who dwells in us, supplies us, and becomes our nourishment also terminates us. The more we call on the Lord&rsquo;s name, the more we will realize how much we are still in the old creation, and the more we will hate ourselves and confess that we need to be terminated. Third, redemption includes being replaced by Christ. When Christ terminates us, He replaces us with Himself. This is transfiguration. This is more than sanctification, which separates us and makes us different from others. This is the actual process in which our element, our old constitution, is terminated and replaced with a new element, a new constitution&mdash;Christ Himself in resurrection. When we are replaced, we are reconstituted with Christ. The future redemption of our body will be the transfiguration of our body, but today we may experience Christ as the One who transfigures our inner being. Thus, Christ not only will be our transfiguration in the future; He also is our present transfiguration, redemption, of our inner being.</p>
<p>With regard to everything in our daily life, we need to be brought back to God, terminated, and replaced with Christ. In the church life we also need redemption because we are still very natural in many matters, such as our preference or care for the saints. In the church life we need to be brought back to God, terminated, and replaced with Christ. In all things we need to be righteous, sanctified, and redeemed. When Christ becomes wisdom to us from God in our daily experience, eventually in everything He will be our righteousness, sanctification, and redemption.</p>
<h2 class="head4">d. It Being of God That We Are in Him</h2>
<p>According to 1 Corinthians 1:30, it is of God that we are in Christ. Whatever we believers, as the new creation, are and have in Christ is of God, not of ourselves. It is God who put us in Christ, and it is God who made Christ wisdom to us. How can God in Christ be transmitted into our being so that we may have Christ as our power and wisdom? This is because God has put us into Christ, transferring us from Adam into Christ (2 Cor. 5:17) through Christ&rsquo;s crucifixion and resurrection (Gal. 2:20) and by our believing and being baptized (John 3:15; Gal. 3:26-28). Christ could not become wisdom to us before we were in Him. But when we believed into Christ and were baptized into Him, God put us into Him, and then Christ became wisdom to us.</p>
<p>Although we never thought or even dreamed that we could be in Christ, one day through the gospel God called us and caused us to believe in Christ and to be baptized into Him. In so doing, God put us into Christ. To be baptized is to be put into Christ, the embodiment of God, and in Christ we believers have all been baptized into the Triune God. From that time onward, the heavenly, spiritual, and divine transmission has begun to unceasingly transmit all that God is and has into our being in order to make us one with Him. Just as we enjoy the constant supply of electricity transmitted from a power plant to our home, we may also always enjoy the rich supply of Christ as wisdom transmitted from God into our being.</p>
<p>Every day Christ, the power and wisdom of God, is being transmitted from God the Giver to us the enjoyers (Eph. 1:19-22). Without the transmission of Christ as power and wisdom to us from God, we have no power or wisdom. At times we may be weak, in sin, and in darkness, and thus be temporarily cut off from this transmission, but whenever we turn to the Lord and confess our sins, we are forgiven and are connected again to the transmission. As the transmission resumes, we enjoy Christ as our power, wisdom, righteousness, sanctification, and redemption. We must learn to remain in this transmission all the time. Our enjoyment of this continual transmission is the way to enjoy Christ.</p>
<p>Paul&rsquo;s word in 1 Corinthians 1:30 concerning our being in Christ is related to the divine dispensing of the Divine Trinity. On the one hand, God has put us into Christ positionally. This makes it possible for us to experience the divine dispensing of the Divine Trinity. On the other hand, the more God in Christ has dispensed Himself into us, the more we are transferred into Christ experientially. Although through Christ&rsquo;s redemption God has already transferred us from Adam into Christ, according to our actual experience we have been transferred into Christ only in part. From the standpoint of our position, we have already been transferred into Christ as the result of God&rsquo;s work, and we are now in Christ. But experientially we are not yet wholly in Christ. Therefore, God is continually seeking to dispense Christ into our being in order that we may be transferred into Christ experientially more and more.</p><h1 class="series">THE CONCLUSION<br />

IN THE EPISTLES</h1>
<h1 class="title">(14)</h1>
<h2 class="head3">23. The Content of the Apostle&rsquo;s Ministry</h2>
<p>Christ as the content of the apostle&rsquo;s ministry is an aspect of the enjoyment of Christ as our portion. First Corinthians 2:1-5 reveals that Christ who is our portion for our enjoyment is the content of the apostle&rsquo;s ministry. The apostle&rsquo;s ministry consists of not only Christ as the mystery of God but also the crucified Jesus Christ. In the apostle&rsquo;s ministry, Christ is the mystery of God ministered to us, and Jesus Christ is the crucified One. Such a Christ is ministered not in persuasive words of wisdom but in demonstration of the Spirit and of power, that is, the power of God. In contrast to many so-called ministries today that scarcely know the mystery of God, the apostle&rsquo;s ministry was the New Testament ministry, a ministry that ministers the mystery of God concerning Christ and the crucified Jesus Christ. In the eyes of human beings, the crucifixion of Christ is foolishness, but in God&rsquo;s eternal economy, it is something powerful, carried out in order to fulfill God&rsquo;s mystery, His eternal purpose (Eph 3:9-11). Moreover, Paul&rsquo;s proclamation was in demonstration of the Spirit and of power. Whenever we properly minister the mystery of God concerning Christ, we will have impact. The New Testament ministry that ministers the mystery of God concerning Christ is a powerful ministry, a ministry that is demonstrated by the living Spirit and the divine power.</p>
<h2 class="head4">a. The Mystery of God</h2>
<p>In 1 Corinthians 2:1 Paul says, &ldquo;I, when I came to you, brothers, came not according to excellence of speech or of wisdom, announcing to you the mystery of God.&rdquo; What the apostle testified was the mystery of God, which is Christ as the embodiment of God and the church as the expression of Christ (Rom. 16:25-26; Col. 1:26-27; 2:2; 4:3; Eph. 3:4-6, 9).</p>
<p>Today many preach about Christ and testify of Him, but most of those who preach Christ do not care for the church. However, in the New Testament, the full mystery of God includes Christ and the church. Christ is the Head, and the church is the Body. Christ is the mystery of God, and the church is the mystery of Christ.</p>
<p>In Colossians 2:2 Paul speaks of &ldquo;the full knowledge of the mystery of God, Christ.&rdquo; Christ is God&rsquo;s mystery. In Himself God is a mystery. He is real, living, and almighty; however, He is invisible. Because no one has ever seen God, He is a mystery. This mysterious God is embodied in Christ. Christ is not only God; He is also God embodied, God defined, God explained, and God expressed. Therefore, Christ is God made visible (John 14:9); Christ, God expressed, is the mystery of God.</p>
<p>As believers, we have Christ dwelling in us, but this Christ whom we have is a mystery (Col. 1:27). In Ephesians 3:4 Paul thus uses the expression <em>themystery of Christ.</em> Although Christ lives in us, worldly people do not realize that He is in us; to them, this is a mystery. But though Christ is mysterious, the church is the manifestation of Christ. As the Body of Christ, the church is the expression of Christ. When we see the church, we see Christ. When we come into the church, we come into Christ. When we contact the church, we contact Christ. The church is truly the mystery of Christ. When Paul came to Corinth, he preached concerning Christ and the church. That is, Paul presented the complete mystery of God: Christ, the Head, and the church, the Body.</p>
<h2 class="head4">b. The Crucified Jesus Christ</h2>
<p>In 1 Corinthians 2:2 Paul continues, &ldquo;I did not determine to know anything among you except Jesus Christ, and this One crucified.&rdquo; The crucified Christ is the unique subject, the center, the content, and the substance of the apostle&rsquo;s ministry. For this he did not determine to know anything but the all-inclusive Christ, and this One crucified, when he was going to minister the word of the testimony of God to the excellent-speech-exalting and wisdom-worshipping Greeks. What a determination! It should be a pattern to us all.</p>
<p>The expression <em>this One crucified</em> speaks of the example of the Lord&rsquo;s living, action, work, and way, indicating His humiliation and abasement. In order to overturn the pride of the Greeks in their elevated wisdom, Paul did not refer here to the Lord&rsquo;s resurrection in glory (Luke 24:26) and His ascension in exaltation (Acts 2:33, 36).</p>
<p>In order to belittle their highly esteemed knowledge and point them to the crucified Christ, Paul reminded the Corinthians that the Christ he preached was One who had been crucified. He proclaimed not an honored, exalted, and glorified Christ, but a Christ who had been despised, rejected, and even crucified. This indicates that after receiving Christ, we should no longer live in a way to exalt ourselves. Rather, we should live a crucified life, even live the crucified Christ. We should be willing to give the impression that we do not know anything other than the crucified Christ. We should learn to determine not to know anything among the saints except Jesus Christ, and this One crucified. If we determine not to know anything except Christ, there will not be any problems or divisions among us.</p><h2 class="head4">c. In Demonstration of the Spirit and of Power,<br />
Which is God&rsquo;s Power</h2>
<p>In 1 Corinthians 2:4 Paul says, &ldquo;My speech and my proclamation were not in persuasive words of wisdom but in demonstration of the Spirit and of power.&rdquo; Persuasive words of wisdom issue from the human mind; demonstration of the Spirit comes from our spirit. The apostle&rsquo;s speech and preaching were not from his mind with words of speculation, but from his spirit with the release and exhibition of the Spirit, hence of power.</p>
<p>In verse 5 Paul goes on to say, &ldquo;In order that your faith would not stand in the wisdom of men but in the power of God.&rdquo; Men&rsquo;s wisdom is the elementary philosophy; God&rsquo;s power is the all-inclusive Christ (1:24).</p>
<p>First Corinthians 2:4 and 5 indicate that Paul did not exercise words of wisdom but the demonstration of the Spirit and of power. The power demonstrated by Paul was the crucified Christ. The issue of such a demonstration was that the believers&rsquo; faith would not be the result of Paul&rsquo;s wisdom overcoming their wisdom but would be in God&rsquo;s power, the crucified Christ (v. 5).</p>
<h2 class="head3">24. The Depths of God</h2>
<p>In 1 Corinthians 2:7-12 Paul reveals Christ as the depths of God. Christ being the depths of God means that He is the deep things of God, the things that are not superficial. To know the depths of God is to know Christ in many aspects as our eternal portion. Christ, the all-inclusive and extensive One, is truly the depths of God.</p>
<p>As we enjoy Christ continually, we eventually enter into Christ as the depths of God&rsquo;s being. Then we realize that we are in the heart, the depths, of the almighty God and that He becomes our inner element. When we enjoy Christ, we touch the depths of God, and God becomes the element within us. As we advance in our experience of Christ, one day we will truly know Him as God&rsquo;s depths.</p>
<p>Moreover, we need to remember that Paul spoke God&rsquo;s wisdom in a mystery to the Jews and the Greeks, both of whom were wisdom-seeking people. The Jews were highly intelligent, and the Greeks were very philosophical. To these people who regarded themselves as wise, Paul did not preach superficial matters but the depths of God. Likewise, we also must preach the depths of God, the deep things of God.</p>
<h2 class="head4">a. God&rsquo;s Wisdom in a Mystery,<br />
the Wisdom Which Has Been Hidden,<br />
Which God Predestined<br />
before the Ages for Our Glory</h2>
<p>In 1 Corinthians 2:7 Paul says, &ldquo;We speak God&rsquo;s wisdom in a mystery, the wisdom which has been hidden, which God predestined before the ages for our glory,&rdquo; God&rsquo;s wisdom in a hidden mystery, which God predestined before the ages for our glory, is actually the all-inclusive Christ as the deep things of God. God&rsquo;s wisdom is Christ (1:24), who is the hidden mystery (Col. 1:26-27), predestined, predesignated, and foreordained before the ages for our glory.</p>
<p>According to 1 Corinthians 2:7, God&rsquo;s wisdom, Christ, is in a mystery; it is a mysterious wisdom. Furthermore, God&rsquo;s wisdom is the wisdom which has been hidden and which God predestined before the ages for our glory. God&rsquo;s wisdom is our destiny, and this destiny was determined by God, decided by Him, in eternity past. He predestined Christ, His wisdom, to be for our glory. This means that in eternity past He decided that His mysterious wisdom would be our destiny and glory. God has predestined His mysterious wisdom to be our glory.</p>
<p>A destiny is a person&rsquo;s final, ultimate portion. As Christians we have a destiny, and this destiny is the ultimate and consummate portion of our enjoyment. God&rsquo;s wisdom in a mystery has not only been hidden but also predestined by God to become our destiny for our glory. Glory is our destiny, our destination. In eternity we will all be in glory.</p>
<p>Glory in verse 7 refers to Christ who is the Lord of glory (v. 8). Christ is our life today (Col. 3:4) and our glory in the future (1:27). To this glory God has called us (1 Pet. 5:10), and into it He will bring us (Heb. 2:10). This is the goal of God&rsquo;s salvation.</p>
<p>Since glory is God expressed, to say that glory is Christ actually means that Christ is God expressed. The expression of God, Christ, is our destiny. This destiny will bring us into glory, a glory which is the expression of God.</p>
<p>In eternity past God predestined Christ, God&rsquo;s wisdom in a mystery, for our glory. Within God there is a mystery, Christ, and this mystery was predestined by God before the ages so that we may have glory. In eternity past God predestined Christ, God&rsquo;s wisdom, for our glory, and in eternity future, we will have glory.</p>
<p>We then need to consider how we can have the divine glory. God has a mystery, an economy, planned according to His wisdom. This plan is to put God&rsquo;s chosen people into Christ, the Son of God, in order that in Christ they may be saturated with the divine glory and be brought into the divine glory to enjoy the Triune God in His glorious expression. There is such a mystery, an economy, planned according to God&rsquo;s wisdom to put us, His chosen people, into Christ that we may be glorified (1 Cor. 2:9). This plan had been completely hidden, kept secret, within God&rsquo;s heart until it was revealed to the apostles (Eph. 3:5, 9-10). According to this plan, our entire being will ultimately be saturated with the divine glory and will be brought into the reality of the divine glory to enjoy the Triune God in His divine glory. One day we will all be in the divine glory; only then will we fully know what is God&rsquo;s wisdom in a mystery. This is our enjoyment of Christ as God&rsquo;s wisdom in a mystery, Christ as the deep things of God.</p>
<p>Again, deep within God is a plan, a plan made according to His wisdom to put His chosen people into Christ, His embodiment, in order that they may be saturated, and even soaked, with the divine glory and may enjoy the Triune God in His glory for eternity. This plan had been kept in God&rsquo;s heart as a secret; it had never been known by any creature including Satan and man. This plan is the goal of God&rsquo;s salvation.</p>
<p>Although today we have not yet thoroughly entered into the &ldquo;soaking&rdquo; glory of God, day by day we are in the process of being saturated with the divine glory. In fact, both sanctification and transformation are the process of saturating us with God&rsquo;s glory. Just as a cotton ball is put into ink and becomes soaked with ink, we believers have all been put into the Triune God to be soaked with Him in His glory.</p>
<p>Today we enjoy the foretaste of our destiny to enjoy God in His divine glory. Day by day we are being saturated with the divine glory. What matters to God is not our doing deeds that are right or wrong, good or evil. Rather, the central thought of God is that He intends to saturate us with Himself as the divine glory. This economy is altogether a procedure that takes place in the all-inclusive Christ, who as the Lord of glory is our life today and our glory in the future in order to bring us into glory. What will bring the Lord back is a group of His believers thoroughly saturated with God in His divine glory. The Lord will not come back until He has gained a group of His believers fully matured in the divine soaking. We must prepare ourselves for His coming by being daily saturated with God as the divine glory.</p><h2 class="head4">b. Things Which Eye Has Not Seen and<br />
Ear Has Not Heard and<br />
Which Have Not Come Up in Man&rsquo;s Heart,<br />
Which God Has Prepared for Those Who Love Him</h2>
<p>Christ as the depths of God is also the &ldquo;things which eye has not seen and ear has not heard and which have not come up in man&rsquo;s heart; things which God has prepared for those who love Him&rdquo; (1 Cor. 2:9). The sphere of what the eye can see is narrow; the sphere of what the ear can hear is broader; and the sphere of what the heart can realize is without limitation. God in His wisdom (that is, in Christ) has ordained and prepared for us many deep and hidden things, such as justification, sanctification, and glorification. All these the human eye has never seen, the human ear has never heard, and the human heart has never realized. This means that the things God has prepared for those who love Him are far beyond human understanding; human beings simply cannot dream or imagine them.</p>
<p>God has prepared the deep and hidden things&mdash;which the eye has not seen, the ear has not heard, nor has the heart considered&mdash;for those who love Him. Our love toward God is a strong proof that we have been chosen and predestinated to enjoy the Triune God by soaking in His divine glory, which is our destiny and God&rsquo;s mysterious wisdom.</p>
<p>To realize and participate in the deep and hidden things God has ordained and prepared for us requires us not only to believe in Him but also to love Him. To fear God, to worship God, and to believe in God (that is, to receive God) are all inadequate; to love Him is the indispensable requirement. To love God means to set our entire being&mdash;spirit, soul, and body, with the heart, soul, mind, and strength (Mark 12:30)&mdash;absolutely on Him, that is, to let our entire being be occupied by Him and lost in Him, so that He becomes everything to us and we are one with Him practically in our daily life. In this way we have the closest and most intimate fellowship with God, and we are able to enter into His heart and apprehend all its secrets (Psa. 73:25; 25:14). Thus, we not only realize but also experience, enjoy, and fully participate in these deep and hidden things of God.</p>
<h2 class="head4">c. Revealed to Us through the Spirit<br />
Who Knows the Things of God and Searches All Things, Even the Deep Things of God concerning Christ</h2>
<p>In 1 Corinthians 2:6 Paul says that the wisdom he spoke was a wisdom not of this age nor of the rulers of this age. In themselves, human beings are not capable of knowing this wisdom. It must be revealed through the Spirit. Therefore, Paul says in verse 10, &ldquo;But to us God has revealed them through the Spirit, for the Spirit searches all things, even the depths of God.&rdquo; God reveals the deep and hidden things to us through the Spirit, for these things have not been seen by man&rsquo;s eyes, heard by man&rsquo;s ears, nor have they come up in man&rsquo;s heart. This means that man has no idea concerning them, no thought of them. They are altogether mysterious, hidden in God, and beyond human understanding, but God has revealed them to us through the Spirit, who searches all things, even the depths of God.</p>
<p>To have something revealed to us is different from being taught about that thing. To be taught is related to our mind; to have something revealed to us is related to our spirit. To realize the deep and hidden things God has prepared for us, our spirit is more necessary than our mind. When our entire being becomes one with God through loving Him in intimate fellowship, He shows us, in our spirit through His Spirit, all the secrets of Christ as our portion. This is to reveal the hidden things planned by His wisdom concerning Christ, which have never come up in man&rsquo;s heart.</p>
<p>In verse 10 Paul tells us that the Spirit searches all things. The Greek word rendered <em></em> &ldquo;searches&rdquo; is used in reference to active research, implying accurate knowledge gained not by discovering but by exploring. The Spirit of God explores the depths of God concerning Christ and shows them to us in our spirit for our realization and participation.</p>
<p>The depths of God refer to the deep things of God, which are Christ in many aspects as our eternal portion, foreordained, prepared, and given to us freely by God. These have never arisen in man&rsquo;s heart but are revealed to us in our spirit by God&rsquo;s Spirit. Hence, in order to partake of them, we must be spiritual. We must move, act, and live in our spirit that we may enjoy Christ as everything to us.</p>
<p>In verse 11 Paul continues, &ldquo;Who among men knows the things of man, except the spirit of man which is in him? In the same way, the things of God also no one has known except the Spirit of God.&rdquo; The spirit of man is the deepest part of man&rsquo;s being. It has the faculty to penetrate the innermost region of the things of man, whereas the mind of man is capable of knowing only superficial things. In like manner, only the Spirit of God can know the deep things of God.</p>
<p>Christ as the depths of God is revealed to us through the Spirit who knows the things of God and searches all things, even the deep things of God concerning Christ. In order to partake of the deep things of God, we must exercise not merely our mind but our spirit. This is because the revealing Spirit of God is not in our mind but in our spirit. We must exercise our spirit by pray-reading the Word of God. In fact, the best way to exercise our spirit is to pray-read the Word. The more we pray-read with an exercised spirit, the more clearly we see a spiritual vision of the deep things of God. When we have seen these things, we should not teach them to other believers merely by exercising our mind; rather, we must teach by exercising our spirit. We must exercise our spirit to transfer what we have seen in our spirit into other believers. When we teach in this way, the Spirit of God, who is a revealing Spirit, will stir up their spirit. Here we have three spirits: the Spirit of God, our spirit, and their spirit. The Spirit of God who is in our spirit is at the same time in their spirit; this unveiling Spirit joins our spirit with their spirit. In this joining of our spirit with their spirit through the Spirit of God, they too see the spiritual things, the deep things of God that we see.</p>
<p>In order to know the depths of God, we must know that through incarnation God one day became a man named Jesus. Through His crucifixion the Lord Jesus terminated the old creation and released the divine life that it may be imparted into all who believe in Him. Now, in resurrection, He is the life-giving Spirit who indwells our spirit and who has become one spirit with us. Thus, we have a mingled spirit, our regenerated spirit mingled with the divine Spirit.</p>
<p>In keeping with this, 1 Corinthians tells us that Christ, the last Adam in the flesh, has become the life-giving Spirit (15:45b) and that &ldquo;he who is joined to the Lord is one spirit&rdquo; (6:17). In the context of the whole book of 1 Corinthians, the depths of God in 2:10 refers to the all-inclusive Christ who, as the life-giving Spirit, indwells our spirit. After accomplishing redemption, this Christ has become a life-giving Spirit. As such, He is so available to us that we can be joined to Him as one spirit. Nothing can be deeper than the last Adam becoming the life-giving Spirit and our being joined to the Lord as one spirit.</p>
<h2 class="head4">d. Graciously Given to Us by God</h2>
<p>In 1 Corinthians 2:12 Paul continues, &ldquo;We have received not the spirit of the world but the Spirit which is from God, that we may know the things which have been graciously given to us by God.&rdquo; We should praise the Lord that we, those who have been born of God by His Spirit, have received the Spirit of God. Hence, we are well able to know the deep things of God, which He has graciously given to us for our enjoyment.</p>
<p>God has predestined Christ for us, He has prepared Him for us, He has revealed Him to us, and He has given Him to us as the deep things of God, the depths of God. These depths can be realized and discerned, not by our philosophical mind but only by our regenerated spirit indwelt by the Spirit of God. By means of the mingled spirit alone can we discern the depths of God, the different aspects of Christ as our portion for our enjoyment. If we exercise the mingled spirit, we will enjoy Christ, not in a superficial way but as the depths of God and even in the depths of God. We will enjoy Him in a way that eye has not seen, ear has not heard, mind has not thought, and heart has never imagined. We will enjoy Christ in a way beyond all we have ever dreamed. We should praise the Lord that He is our portion through the mingled spirit.</p><h1 class="series">THE CONCLUSION<br />

<h2 class="head3">25. The Foundation</h2>
<p>In 1 Corinthians 3:11 Paul says, &ldquo;Another foundation no one is able to lay besides that which is laid, which is Jesus Christ.&rdquo; This verse indicates that as the Christ and the Son of the living God, the Lord Jesus is the unique foundation laid by God for the building of the church (Matt. 16:16-18). No one can lay another foundation. Nevertheless, certain of the believers at Corinth were taking Paul, Apollos, or Cephas as their foundation (1:12). When they were declaring that they were of Paul, Apollos, or Cephas, they were saying that these were their foundation and standing. In 1 Corinthians 1:13 Paul asks them, &ldquo;Was Paul crucified for you? Or were you baptized into the name of Paul?&rdquo; By asking these questions Paul points out that he is not the foundation. On the contrary, Paul says in 3:10, &ldquo;According to the grace of God given to me, as a wise master builder I have laid a foundation, and another builds upon it.&rdquo; The unique foundation is not Paul, Apollos, Cephas, or anyone other than Jesus Christ, the Son of God.</p>
<p>The problem among the Corinthians was that they were trying to lay many other foundations. Some of the Corinthian believers laid a foundation of opinion or wisdom. We see in chapter 14 that for some, speaking in tongues was a foundation. This indicates that it is possible for a particular practice, such as speaking in tongues or baptism by immersion, to become a foundation. Therefore, Paul wanted the believers at Corinth to realize that he had already laid the unique foundation, Jesus Christ.</p>
<p>Christ, the unique foundation, has already been laid. This foundation has been established not only for the time of the apostles but for eternity. However, it is common for Christians today to lay foundations other than Christ as the unique foundation. We may have preferences in persons, matters, and things, and we need to see that to have a preference is to lay a foundation. Whenever we claim to be for a particular person, doctrine, or practice, we are laying another foundation. Christians have been divided by the many different foundations. Thousands of foundations have been laid, and more are being laid. Thus, we should not say that we are of anything or anyone or that we are for anything or anyone. To speak in this way is to lay another foundation; it is also to cause division. A division is always caused by laying a foundation other than Christ Himself. To lay a foundation besides Christ ruins the Body life and damages God&rsquo;s building. In other words, this is not the building of the church; it is the tearing down of the church. We are only of Christ and for Christ. We should not exalt anything, anyone, or any doctrine or practice. We should simply build upon the all-inclusive Christ as the unique foundation already laid.</p>
<p>Building upon the foundation already laid means that we must build upon the unique Christ practically and experientially. To fellowship with others with a living spirit full of the riches of Christ is to build upon the foundation already laid. To minister to others the Christ whom we have experienced is also to build upon the foundation already laid. When we contact others in this way, we build upon Christ and with Christ. As a result, others will be solidly built up into the church as part of the Body. This is to build upon the foundation already laid.</p>
<p>According to 1 Corinthians 1:2 and 9, Christ is theirs and ours, and we have been called into the fellowship of Christ. This Christ, God&rsquo;s unique center and our unique portion, is the unique foundation. If we touch the depths of the truth in 3:11 and understand this verse according to its context and background, we shall see a vision of Christ as the unique foundation. This truth, this vision, will then govern and control us.</p><h2 class="head3">26. The Center of God and All Things</h2>
<p>In 1 Corinthians 3:21b-23 Paul presents Christ as the center of God and all things: &ldquo;All things are yours, whether Paul or Apollos or Cephas or the world or life or death or things present or things to come; all are yours, but you are Christ&rsquo;s, and Christ is God&rsquo;s.&rdquo; The believers are the church, and all things are for the church. Furthermore, the church is for Christ, and Christ is for God. In other words, all things are ours for the church, the church is for Christ to be His Body, and Christ is for God to be His expression. The all-inclusive Christ is God&rsquo;s center, God&rsquo;s centrality and universality, in the church as His fullness for His expression. Christ is the centrality and universality of God and of His move in the divine economy. Christ is the center and circumference of God&rsquo;s economy for the producing of His fullness for His expression. Our heart must be touched by God&rsquo;s center, the centrality and universality of Christ regarding God&rsquo;s economy. We need to be touched by this center so that in every book and every chapter of the Bible, we would see Christ.</p>
<p>Christ is also the center of all things. Verses 21b through 23 reveal that all things are ours, we are Christ&rsquo;s (2 Cor. 10:7), and Christ is God&rsquo;s. Since we are Christ&rsquo;s, we are God&rsquo;s. First, the expression <em>all things are yours</em> means that all things belong to us. Here Paul does not say that all things are for us; rather, he says that all things are ours. Second, the expression <em>you are Christ&rsquo;s</em> means that we belong to Christ. Third, the expression <em>Christ is God&rsquo;s</em> means that Christ belongs to God. Here we see that God is the Head in the universe (1 Chron. 29:11), and Christ is the center of all things in the universe, and we ourselves, who belong to Christ as His members, are part of this center.</p>
<p>God is the Head in the universe, and this universe subsists in Christ as the hub. In Colossians 1:17 Paul tells us that all things cohere in Christ. Through death and resurrection He was enlarged from the individual Christ to the corporate Christ&mdash;Christ as the Head with the believers in Christ as the members of His Body (John 12:24; Rom. 8:29; 1 Cor. 12:12). For this reason, the hub in which the universe subsists is now a corporate hub, the corporate Christ. Christ and His members form a corporate hub as the center of all things in the universe. All things are ours in the sense that they subsist by both Christ and us as their holding center. Just as all the spokes of a wheel cannot subsist without the hub as their holding center, but instead fall apart, all things in the universe cannot subsist without Christ and without us, His members, as their holding center, a corporate hub. Christ is the center of all things, and all His members are part of this center.</p>
<h2 class="head3">27. The Passover and the Unleavened Bread</h2>
<p>In 5:7-8 Christ is revealed as the Passover and the unleavened bread.</p>
<h2 class="head4">a. The Passover for Us to Be Saved</h2>
<p>In verse 7 Paul says, &ldquo;Purge out the old leaven that you may be a new lump, even as you are unleavened; for our Passover, Christ, also has been sacrificed.&rdquo; Here the word <em>Passover</em> indicates not only that the judgment of God passes over us because of the blood of Christ, the real Passover lamb (John 1:29); it also refers to the Feast of the Passover. The Passover was a feast in which the children of Israel enjoyed the roasted Passover lamb, the unleavened bread, and the bitter herbs. The entire Passover, including the Passover lamb, the unleavened bread, and the bitter herbs, is a type of the all-inclusive Christ in redemption. As our Passover, Christ is the reality of the lamb, the unleavened bread, and the bitter herbs. Christ as the Feast of the Passover has saved us from God&rsquo;s death-judgment. We have been saved from God&rsquo;s judgment by enjoying Christ as such a feast.</p>
<p>The passover portrayed in Exodus 12 is an all-inclusive type of Christ as our redemption to begin our experience of God&rsquo;s salvation. The entire Passover is a type of Christ (1 Cor. 5:7). Christ is not only the Passover lamb (John 1:29) but also every aspect of the Passover. In order to be our Passover, He was sacrificed on the cross that we might be redeemed and reconciled to God. Thus, we may enjoy Him as a feast before God.</p>
<p>According to Exodus 12, the passover lamb was taken on the tenth day of the month (v. 3) and was examined for four days to confirm that it was unblemished (v. 5); then it was killed on the fourteenth day. In the same way, the Lord Jesus as the real Passover lamb was examined for four days and was found to be perfect, without fault (John 8:46; 18:38; 19:4, 6), before He was killed on the day of the Passover (Luke 22:7-8, 14-15; John 18:28).</p>
<p>In the Bible seven days signifies a period of completion, and the end of a week denotes the end of life. The fact that the passover lamb was killed on the fourteenth day of the month, the end of two complete weeks, signifies that Christ&rsquo;s death terminated the entire history of our old life.</p>
<p>According to Exodus 12:13, God passed over the children of Israel because the blood of the passover lamb had been sprinkled on the lintel and the doorposts of their houses. The blood put on the doorposts and the lintel of the houses typifies the redeeming blood of Christ (Matt. 26:28; John 19:34; 1 Pet. 1:18-19). This blood opened the way for the redeemed ones to enter into the houses, implying that the blood of Christ opens the way for us to enter into Christ, who is typified by the house (Heb. 10:19). The same blood closed the way to the destroyer, thereby guarding the redeemed from judgment (Exo. 12:23).</p>
<p>Christ is the house whose lintel and doorposts have been sprinkled with the redeeming blood and in which the children of Israel ate the passover lamb. The lamb was the means of redemption, and the house was the means of preserving the redeemed ones. As the redeeming One, Christ is the Lamb, and as the keeping One, He is the house. The blood of the lamb was on the door, and the flesh of the lamb was in the house. The lamb, the house, and those who enjoyed the passover thus became one. This is a picture of the identification of the redeemed ones with Christ.</p>
<p>To participate in the passover, the children of Israel had to enter into and remain in the houses that had been sprinkled with the blood (vv. 13, 22-23). In the same principle, to participate in Christ and His redemption, we must be identified with Christ by entering into Him and remaining in Him (Eph. 1:7; 1 Cor. 1:30; John 15:4; cf. Gal. 5:2, 4). The house and the blood were inseparable; likewise, Christ and His redemption are one.</p>
<p>If the children of Israel had not remained in the house, they would have been deprived of the benefit, profit, enjoyment, and experience of the passover. To participate in the passover there was the need to remain in the house. To remain in the house is to abide in Christ and to be identified with Him. We need to remain in Christ, that is, to maintain our identification, our union, with Him. We should maintain our identification with Christ, with a constant realization that we are nothing and that He is everything.</p>
<p>According to Exodus 12:8-10, the flesh of the passover lamb was to be eaten for life supply. The blood of the passover lamb was for redemption, to redeem the children of Israel out of God&rsquo;s death-judgment, and the flesh of the lamb was for life supply, to strengthen the people to move out of Egypt. The flesh of the lamb signifies the crucified and resurrected life of Christ as the supply for God&rsquo;s redeemed people. Through Christ&rsquo;s incarnation, crucifixion, and resurrection His flesh has become the food of God&rsquo;s redeemed. In the reality of the passover, Christ&rsquo;s blood is drinkable, Christ&rsquo;s flesh is eatable, and Christ in totality is eatable (John 6:51-57, 63).</p>
<p>In Exodus 12:8 the children of Israel were given the proper way to eat the flesh of the passover lamb, roasted with fire. Fire signifies God&rsquo;s holy wrath exercised in judgment. When Christ was on the cross, the holy fire of God judged Him and consumed Him. He cried, &ldquo;I thirst&rdquo; (John 19:28) because He was being burned by the holy fire of God&rsquo;s judgment. On the cross Christ suffered for us under God&rsquo;s judgment. He was &ldquo;burned&rdquo; and &ldquo;roasted&rdquo; by the holy fire of God&rsquo;s wrath. As our Redeemer, Christ was judged for us. To eat Christ &ldquo;roasted with fire&rdquo; is to believe that on the cross Christ suffered for us under God&rsquo;s holy wrath exercised in His judgment.</p>
<p>According to Exodus 12:9, the children of Israel were to eat the lamb&rsquo;s head with its legs and inward parts. The head signifies wisdom, the legs signify activity and move, and the inward parts signify the inward parts of Christ&rsquo;s being, including His mind, emotion, will, and heart with all their functions. Eating the passover lamb with the head, legs, and inward parts signifies taking Christ in His entirety, in His wisdom, activities, move, and inward parts (John 6:57; 1 Cor. 1:24; Rev. 14:4b; Phil. 1:8).</p>
<p>In Exodus 12:8 the children of Israel were to eat the flesh of the lamb with unleavened bread and bitter herbs. In the Scriptures leaven signifies what is sinful, evil, corrupt, and unclean in the eyes of God (1 Cor. 5:6, 8). To eat with unleavened bread means to eliminate all sinful things. To eat with bitter herbs means to regret and repent, to experience a bitter taste regarding sinful things.</p><h2 class="head4">b. The Unleavened Bread for Us<br />
to Live a Pure Church Life</h2>
<p>In 1 Corinthians 5:8 Paul continues, &ldquo;So then let us keep the feast, not with old leaven, neither with the leaven of malice and evil, but with the unleavened bread of sincerity and truth.&rdquo; This verse reveals that Christ is the unleavened bread of sincerity and truth. As the unleavened bread, Christ is for us to live a pure church life. In the church there should be no leaven, which in the Bible signifies all the negative things such as wrong doctrines and practices, evil deeds, and sinful things.</p>
<p>Although in Christ we are unleavened, according to our natural being we are full of leaven. The crucial question is whether we eat unleavened bread or leavened bread. In other words, do we live Christ or do we live ourselves? If we live Christ, we eat unleavened bread, but if we live ourselves, we eat leavened bread.</p>
<p>In 1 Corinthians 5:7 Paul charges us to purge out the old leaven that we may be a new lump, even as we are unleavened. We need to be a new lump, which refers to the church, composed of the believers in their new nature. We are unleavened in Christ and should live according to Him, not according to ourselves.</p>
<p>The feast mentioned in verse 8 refers to the Feast of Unleavened Bread as the continuation of the Passover (Exo. 12:15-20). The Passover itself lasted only one day. Continuing from the Passover, the Feast of Unleavened Bread lasted seven days, a period of completion, signifying the entire period of our Christian life, from the day of our conversion to the day of rapture. This is a long feast, which we must keep not with the sin of our old nature, the old leaven, but with unleavened bread, which is the Christ of our new nature as our nourishment and enjoyment. Only He is the life supply of sincerity and truth, absolutely pure, without mixture, and full of reality. The feast is a time for the enjoyment of the banquet. The entire Christian life should be such a feast, such an enjoyment of Christ as our banquet, the rich supply of life.</p>
<p>According to Exodus 12, during the seven days of the Feast of Unleavened Bread, no leaven was to be found in the houses (v. 19), and no leaven was to be seen among the people of Israel (13:7). This signifies that, although it is impossible for us to be completely without sin, we must eliminate any sin that is seen; that is, we must forsake the sin of which we are conscious (cf. Heb. 12:1). To deal with manifested sin is to keep the Feast of Unleavened Bread (1 Cor. 5:7-8). If we tolerate sin once it is exposed, we will lose the enjoyment of the fellowship of God&rsquo;s people (Exo. 12:19; 1 Cor. 5:13). The only way to eliminate sin is to daily eat Christ as the crucified, resurrected, and sinless life, signified by the unleavened bread.</p>
<p>In 1 Corinthians 5:7 and 8 we have two feasts: the Feast of the Passover and the Feast of Unleavened Bread. When we were saved, we enjoyed the Feast of the Passover. Now throughout our entire Christian life we should enjoy the Feast of Unleavened Bread. The Christian life is a feast of unleavened bread, a feast of the enjoyment of Christ as our life supply without any leaven. Day by day we need to keep the Feast of Unleavened Bread. We should keep this feast throughout the course of our Christian life until we see the Lord.</p>
<p>Unleavened bread indicates a living which is without sin, without leaven. In ourselves we cannot possibly have this kind of living. However, in Christ it is possible to live a sinless life. We have been put into Christ, and now we must learn to live in Christ and by Christ. Then He will become our unleavened life supply. He will become the source, the fountain, of a sinless life and living. Because we have such a source and supply, it is possible for us to live a sinless life.</p>
<p>As the unleavened bread, Christ is the spiritual and divine food that makes us unleavened. The unleavened bread signifies the sinless Christ who is to be dispensed into us, His believers, as the unleavened (sinless) element. Just as the children of Israel ate the passover lamb with the unleavened bread, we should eat Christ not only as the Lamb but also as the unleavened bread. When we take Christ as our life, this life purifies us. This life is an unleavened life, a purifying life. The more we call on the name of the Lord Jesus and take Him into us, the more we are purified from within.</p>
<p>From the time of our regeneration, we began to have a new constitution. Christ as the unleavened bread became our unleavened food to reconstitute us so that we may become a new lump, the church. Before regeneration we were the old lump, full of leaven. But now we have become a new lump because we are becoming unleavened. As the unleavened bread He causes us to be unleavened constitutionally, making us a new lump, a lump without leaven. This means that we become a new creation without sin (2 Cor. 5:17).</p>
<p>In the book of 1 Corinthians Paul compares the New Testament believers to the children of Israel. He takes the history of the children of Israel as a background for this Epistle. This gives us the ground to say that the history of the children of Israel is a full type of our Christian life in the church life. The children of Israel did not live individualistically; on the contrary, they lived, camped, traveled, and fought battles together. Their corporate life typifies our life in the church. After experiencing the passover, they kept the Feast of Unleavened Bread. This indicates that we also should keep this feast. The church life is a feast of unleavened bread. For this reason, any leaven must be purged out of the church.</p>
<p>In order to live a life without sin, we must daily eat Christ as unleavened bread. Since we are what we eat, if we eat unleavened bread, we will eventually become constituted with unleavened bread. Then we will live an unleavened life. Although in ourselves it is impossible ever to be sinless, in Christ we can become sinless by eating Him as the source and supply of a sinless life. Since Christ, our source, is unleavened, if we feast on Him daily, we can have an unleavened church life.</p><h1 class="series">THE CONCLUSION<br />

<h2 class="head3">28. The Washer and the Spirit</h2>
<h2 class="head4">a. In His Name and in the Spirit of Our God<br />
Our Being Washed, Sanctified, and Justified</h2>
<p>In 1 Corinthians 6:11 Christ is presented as the Washer and the Spirit: &ldquo;But you were washed, but you were sanctified, but you were justified in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and in the Spirit of our God.&rdquo; In contrast to the washing, sanctifying, and justifying in 1 John 1:7, Hebrews 10:29, and Romans 3:24-25, the washing, sanctifying, and justifying in 1 Corinthians 6:11 are not by the blood in an objective way. They are the subjective washing of regeneration as in Titus 3:5, the subjective sanctifying by the Spirit as in Romans 15:16, and the subjective justifying in the Spirit as in this verse in 1 Corinthians 6. All these items of God&rsquo;s salvation were accomplished in us in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ (that is, in the person of the Lord, in an organic union with the Lord through faith) and in the Spirit of God (that is, in the power and realization of the Holy Spirit). First, we were washed from the sinful things; second, we were sanctified, separated unto God, transformed by God; and third, we were justified, accepted, by God.</p>
<p>According to 1 Corinthians 6:11, it is in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and in the Spirit of our God that we were washed, sanctified, and justified. In the New Testament the expression <em>in the name of the Lord</em> actually means in the person of the Lord, because the name denotes the person. Moreover, by speaking of &ldquo;in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and in the Spirit of our God,&rdquo; Paul indicates that we need to link the name of the Lord with the Spirit of our God. The name is the person, and the person is the Spirit of our God. It is in this person, the Triune God, that we were washed, sanctified, and justified. Here washing, sanctifying, and justifying are not merely outward, objective, and positional; rather, they are inward, subjective, and dispositional. Such intrinsic washing, sanctifying, and justifying are carried out by the Triune God Himself in the person of the Lord Jesus Christ, that is, the Spirit of our God.</p>
<p>We are washed, sanctified, and justified in the name of the Lord Jesus. If a person with a certain name does not exist, the name is in vain, but when we call a living person by name, that person responds. In like manner, when we call on the name of the Lord Jesus, He responds, and we experience the person of the Lord. The Lord is a living person, not merely a name. Therefore, whenever we call on the name of the Lord Jesus, we call on the person of the Lord. Since the name is the person and the person is the Spirit, when we call on the name of the Lord, He comes to us as the Spirit. By experience we know that when we continue to call on the name of the Lord, enjoying His name and His Spirit, we are continually washed, sanctified, and justified. However, when we cease to call on the Lord, the subjective experience of the washing, sanctifying, and justifying is no longer ours.</p>
<p>We may experience this subjective washing, sanctifying, and justifying day by day. There is a person within us, and His name is Jesus Christ. He is constantly working within us to wash us, sanctify us, and to justify us. This person is actually the Spirit, the Spirit of Jesus Christ; He is also the Spirit of our God. Hence, the Triune God embodied in Christ and realized as the Spirit is the Washer and the Spirit.</p>
<h2 class="head4">b. Our Being Joined to Him as One Spirit</h2>
<p>Christ is the Washer and the Spirit, and we are joined to Him as one spirit. First Corinthians 6:17 says, &ldquo;He who is joined to the Lord is one spirit.&rdquo; In this verse the word <em>joined</em> refers to the believers&rsquo; organic union with the Lord through believing into Him (John 3:15-16). This union is illustrated by that of the branches with the vine (15:4-5). It is a matter not only of life but in life (the divine life). Such a union with the resurrected Lord can only be in our spirit.</p>
<p>The expression <em>one spirit</em> indicates the mingling of the Lord as the Spirit with our spirit. Our spirit has been regenerated by the Spirit of God (3:6), who is now in us (1 Cor. 6:19) and is one with our spirit (Rom. 8:16). This is the realization of the Lord, who became the life-giving Spirit through resurrection (1 Cor. 15:45; 2 Cor. 3:17) and who is now with our spirit (2 Tim. 4:22). This mingled spirit is often referred to in Paul&rsquo;s Epistles, as in Romans 8:4-6.</p>
<p>Not only have we been saved and redeemed; we are even one spirit with the Lord, and as a result, we have the divine life and nature. We are not simply one with Him in a general way. We are actually one spirit with Him. We should testify with assurance that we truly believe that we are one spirit with the Lord. We need to see this experientially as well as doctrinally. We all need to humble ourselves before the Lord and pray: &ldquo;Lord, show us the vision that we are one spirit with You. I am not satisfied with a mere doctrinal knowledge of this. Lord, open the heavens and cause us to see that we are now one spirit with You.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At the time we were saved and regenerated, our spirit was joined to the Lord, and we became one with Him. When we were saved and regenerated, we entered into an organic union with the Triune God. This union is real and vital. As a result of salvation and redemption, the Lord dispensed Himself into our spirit and made us one with Him. Now, no matter what we do, we cannot separate ourselves from being one with Him in spirit. Even if we would seek to break this union, the Lord would not agree. What a wonder that sinners such as we can be one spirit with the Lord!</p>
<p>To be one spirit with the Lord is to enter into an organic union with Him, to be united with Him organically. Such a union with the resurrected Christ can only be in our spirit, because Christ today is the life-giving Spirit (1 Cor. 15:45) and is now with our spirit. We must exercise and practice to experience the Lord as the life-giving Spirit dwelling in our spirit. This is to practice being one spirit with the Lord.</p>
<p>The Christian life is not a religious life or an ethical life; rather, it is a life of being one spirit with the Lord. According to God&rsquo;s New Testament economy, the Lord desires to come into us, to become one with us, and to make us one with Him. The requirement in the New Testament is that we live one spirit with the Lord. We should live Christ by being one spirit with Him. We need to pray to the Lord in the morning: &ldquo;I thank You for another day in which to practice being one spirit with You. Lord, grant me this day&rsquo;s portion of grace that I may live one spirit with You.&rdquo; The more we are one spirit with Him in our daily living, the more we will enjoy salvation, sanctification, and transformation.</p><h2 class="head3">29. The Master of the Believers</h2>
<p>In 1 Corinthians 7:22-23 Christ is revealed as the Master of the believers: &ldquo;The slave who has been called in the Lord is the Lord&rsquo;s freedman; likewise the free man who has been called is Christ&rsquo;s slave. You were bought with a price; do not be slaves of men.&rdquo; These verses indicate that believers inwardly should be slaves only of Christ; they should not become slaves of men. Christ bought the believers with a price, that is, with His precious blood (6:20; Acts 20:28; 1 Pet. 1:18-19; Rev. 5:9). As a result, the believers become His slaves to serve Him by doing the will of God (Eph. 6:6-7). We must consider Him as our Master, and we must daily serve Him by doing the will of God.</p>
<p>In keeping with this, Paul in Ephesians 6:5-7 says, &ldquo;Slaves, be obedient to those who are your masters according to the flesh with fear and trembling, in singleness of your heart, as to Christ; not with eye-service as men-pleasers but as slaves of Christ, doing the will of God from the soul; with good will serving as slaves, as serving the Lord and not men.&rdquo; Paul exhorts the slaves to obey with fear and trembling in singleness of heart, as to Christ. In other words, the slaves are to be in obedience to their masters as to Christ. This means that the slaves are to regard their masters as if they were the Lord. The relationship between slaves and masters is a type of our relationship with Christ, our Master. We should obey Him as a slave, in singleness of heart.</p>
<p>A slave is to do the will of God from the soul. The expression <em>from the soul</em> equals from the heart, from the inner being. This means to serve not only with the physical body but with the heart. The slaves were to serve &ldquo;as serving the Lord and not men.&rdquo; This indicates that Paul&rsquo;s intention was to direct the slaves to the Lord. As the slaves of Christ, the believers must obey Him as their Master and do the will of God from the soul.</p>
<h2 class="head3">30. The Spiritual Food and the Spiritual Rock</h2>
<p>In 1 Corinthians 10:3-4 Christ is presented as the spiritual food and the spiritual rock.</p>
<h2 class="head4">a. The Spiritual Food</h2>
<p>As the spiritual food, Christ nourishes the believers. In verse 3 Paul says, &ldquo;All ate the same spiritual food.&rdquo; The expression <em>spiritual food</em> refers to manna (Exo. 16:14-18), typifying Christ as our daily life supply (John 6:31-35) for the Christian journey. We believers should all eat the same spiritual food and should not eat anything other than Christ. Christ as the heavenly manna should be the unique food for God&rsquo;s people.</p>
<p>John 6 reveals Christ as the real manna, as the heavenly food given to us by God. As the real manna, Christ was sent by God the Father for God&rsquo;s chosen people to live by Christ. In verses 32 and 33 He said, &ldquo;My Father gives you the true bread out of heaven. For the bread of God is He who comes down out of heaven and gives life to the world.&rdquo; Then in verse 35 He declared, &ldquo;I am the bread of life; he who comes to Me shall by no means hunger.&rdquo; In verse 57 He went on to say, &ldquo;He who eats Me, he also shall live because of Me.&rdquo; Without eating Christ as the real manna, it is impossible for us to live by Christ.</p>
<p>Moreover, manna signifies that Christ as the heavenly food is to be dispensed into us for our nourishment in order to constitute us a heavenly people. Every human being is a constitution of the food he has eaten. Food is anything we take into us for our satisfaction, and the food we eat enters into us organically and becomes our constitution. Before their exodus from Egypt, the children of Israel had an Egyptian constitution. The book of Numbers shows that while the children of Israel journeyed in the wilderness, they remembered the fish, cucumbers, melons, leeks, onions, and garlic that they had eaten freely in Egypt (11:5). This diet made the children of Israel Egyptian in their constitution.</p>
<p>God gave the children of Israel manna to eat in order to change their diet from the earthly to the heavenly. While the children of Israel journeyed for forty years in the wilderness, the divine diet replaced their Egyptian diet. Through the change of their diet, the children of Israel became a constitution of the heavenly diet. Thus, they became no longer an Egyptian people but a heavenly people.</p>
<p>Manna typifies Christ as our heavenly food, our bread of life, and our living bread (John 6:41, 35, 48, 50-51). What helps us most in our daily living with the Lord is eating Christ as heavenly food. By eating Christ we become Christ; that is, Christ becomes our constituent. If we eat Christ, we become Him and then live Him. As we partake of Him as our heavenly food day by day, He is reconstituting us to change our inward constitution. From the first day Christ entered into us, we should take Him as our daily food to be constituted with Christ as our heavenly diet so that we may become a heavenly people.</p><h2 class="head4">b. The Spiritual Rock</h2>
<p>In 1 Corinthians 10:4 Paul goes on to say, &ldquo;All drank the same spiritual drink; for they drank of a spiritual rock which followed them, and the rock was Christ.&rdquo; As the spiritual rock, Christ follows the believers to give them the spiritual drink. The spiritual drink in verse 4 refers to the living water that flowed out of the cleft rock (Exo. 17:6), typifying the Spirit, who flowed out of the crucified and resurrected Christ, as our all-inclusive drink (John 7:37-39; 1 Cor. 12:13). In His crucifixion Christ, as the living, spiritual rock, was smitten by the authority of God&rsquo;s law in order that the water of life in resurrection could flow out of Him into His redeemed people for them to drink. The water of life flowing out of the smitten rock signifies the Spirit (John 7:37-39). We should all drink the same spiritual drink and should not drink anything other than the all-inclusive Spirit.</p>
<p>The rock that was smitten and cleft to flow out the living water for God&rsquo;s chosen people was a physical rock. Yet the apostle called it a spiritual rock because it typified Christ, who was smitten and cleft by God to flow out the water of life (John 19:34) to satisfy the thirst of His believers. Hence, the apostle said that the rock was Christ. Since it was a spiritual rock signifying Christ, it was able to follow the children of Israel. This indicates that Christ as the real rock is following His believers.</p>
<p>Paul was bold to say that the physical rock of Exodus 17:6 was a spiritual rock and that this rock was Christ. In actuality the rock in Exodus 17 was physical. However, we need to have a spiritual view of this physical rock and see through the physical into the spiritual. Because Paul viewed this rock according to his spiritual sight, in his eyes it was a spiritual rock. To him, that rock was Christ, and he boldly declared this in 1 Corinthians 10:4.</p>
<p>Through incarnation Christ came to earth as the rock. On the cross He was smitten by the authority of God&rsquo;s righteous law to accomplish God&rsquo;s redemption. His side was pierced, and living water flowed out for God&rsquo;s people to drink (John 19:34). This living water is the water of life in resurrection, the all-inclusive life-giving Spirit as the ultimate issue of the Triune God. This water of life quenches our thirst and satisfies our being.</p>
<p>To drink of the water of life, we first need to be positioned to drink (1 Cor. 12:13), and we also need to be thirsty (John 7:37; Rev. 21:6). Then we need to come to the Lord (John 7:37; Rev. 22:17), to ask of the Lord (John 4:10; cf. Num. 20:8), and to call on the name of the Lord (Isa. 12:3-4; Acts 2:21).</p>
<p>As the spiritual rock, Christ follows the believers to be the source of living water to them (Exo. 17:6; John 4:14). Mainly, the Lord led the children of Israel through the wilderness into the good land in a pillar of cloud by day and in a pillar of fire by night (Exo. 13:21), but in regard to many details, the Lord followed them in their journey through the wilderness because they were disobedient to His leading. Likewise, mainly the Lord is leading us, the New Testament believers, into glory (Heb. 2:10), but in regard to many details He is following us because of our disobedience. For example, He does not want us to go to certain places. Yet when we go to those places, He does not give up on us; rather, He still follows us with a purpose of bringing us back under His leading.</p>
<p>On the one hand, the Lord was leading the children of Israel through the wilderness into the good land; as a result, they entered into the good land. On the other hand, while the children of Israel wandered in the wilderness for forty years, the Lord was following these foolish people. Today we need to know that as the spiritual rock Christ is following us, who often foolishly wander in the wilderness of our soul. Ultimately, He will achieve His purpose to bring us into Himself as the reality of the good land. We will then tell the Lord, &ldquo;You are the Lord. We were so foolish when we wandered in the wilderness of our soul for many years. Yet through these years of wandering, our real condition&mdash;our sinfulness, our unfaithfulness, and our shortage of the living water&mdash;was exposed. As the spiritual rock, You nevertheless followed us to give us the spiritual drink in order to quench our thirst and to bring us back under Your leading. Eventually, You have brought us into Yourself as the good land of Canaan.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As our guide, Christ not only leads us but also follows us. The Christ who follows us as the spiritual rock flows out the life-giving Spirit as the living water to satisfy our thirst. The fact that the spiritual rock followed the children of Israel indicates that they were not obedient to the Lord. Although they were disobedient to Him, they had the rock following them, and the living water flowed out of the rock to quench the thirst of these sinful people. According to the intrinsic significance of 1 Corinthians 10:4, the situation of the New Testament believers is exactly the same as that of the children of Israel in the Old Testament. Christ is leading us, yet we are not obedient to Him. Hence, as the spiritual rock He follows us to flow out His eternal life in order to quench our thirst and, ultimately, to carry out God&rsquo;s purpose, that is, to bring us all into the all-inclusive Christ as the reality of the good land.</p><h1 class="series">THE CONCLUSION<br />

<h2 class="head3">31. The Contents of the Lord&rsquo;s Table</h2>
<p>In 1 Corinthians 10:16-17 and 21 Christ is unveiled as the contents of the Lord&rsquo;s table. These verses reveal that His blood and His body, which compose the Lord&rsquo;s table, are for the believers&rsquo; fellowship, which signifies that the many believers are one bread, one Body.</p>
<h2 class="head4">a. His Blood and Body for the Believers&rsquo; Fellowship</h2>
<p>In 1 Corinthians 10:16 Paul says, &ldquo;The cup of blessing which we bless, is it not the fellowship of the blood of Christ? The bread which we break, is it not the fellowship of the body of Christ?&rdquo; Here the word <em>fellowship</em> refers to the believers&rsquo; communion in the joint participation in the blood and body of Christ. This makes us, the participants in the Lord&rsquo;s blood and body, not only one with one another but also one with the Lord. We, the participants, make ourselves identified with the Lord in the fellowship of His blood and body. The apostle&rsquo;s thought here is to illustrate how eating and drinking make the eaters and drinkers one with what they eat and drink.</p>
<p>The believers&rsquo; fellowship implies their mutual enjoyment of Christ by eating and drinking Christ. In ancient times, when people gathered together for fellowship, they feasted by eating and drinking. The children of Israel brought their produce of the good land to the feast, offered it to God, and feasted with God and with one another for their enjoyment. Likewise, the Lord&rsquo;s table is the Lord&rsquo;s feast. When we come to the Lord&rsquo;s table, we come to a feast of two courses, His blood and His body, both of which are for the believers&rsquo; fellowship.</p>
<p>The fellowship of the blood and the body of Christ implies that Christ&rsquo;s blood is separate from His body, indicating that it is now possible for us to feast on Him. In order to become our feast, Christ, the Son of God, had to be processed. In verse 16 we see that His blood and His body are now on the table, a place of feasting. This implies that Christ has been incarnated, crucified, and resurrected. If Christ had not been incarnated, He could not have blood and a body. If He had not been crucified, His blood could not be separated from His body. If He had not been resurrected, He could not be on the table as our food. In other words, through incarnation Christ put on a human body with blood and flesh (Heb. 2:14), through crucifixion His blood was separated from His body (John 6:53-55), and in resurrection He is served to us on the table as a feast for our nourishment and enjoyment. Therefore, on the table we see Christ&rsquo;s incarnation, crucifixion, and resurrection.</p>
<p>When the Lord Jesus ate with His disciples and established the table, He &ldquo;took bread and blessed it, and He broke it and gave it to the disciples and said, Take, eat; this is My body&rdquo; (Matt. 26:26). Then taking the cup and giving thanks, &ldquo;He gave it to them, saying, Drink of it, all of you&rdquo; (v. 27). By speaking in this way concerning His body and blood, the Lord is presenting Himself to us for our enjoyment. He gives Himself to us as our food supply so that we may enjoy Him. Christ, the all-inclusive One, has given His body for us to eat and His blood for us to drink. He has given us Himself so that we may partake of Him and enjoy Him by eating and drinking Him.</p>
<p>As the all-inclusive One who presents Himself to us for our enjoyment, Christ is the embodiment of the Triune God&mdash;the Father, the Son, and the Spirit. He is God incarnate, the One who lived on earth as a man for thirty-three and a half years, who died on the cross to terminate the old creation, who resurrected physically and spiritually, and who became through resurrection the life-giving Spirit. Today the One who presents His body and blood to us is Christ as the life-giving Spirit. This wonderful Christ is everything to us for our enjoyment. All that He is, is for our participation and enjoyment.</p>
<p>The Lord&rsquo;s table with the blood and body of Christ is the reality of Christ as the good land. The table is signified by the good land, which was a table to the children of Israel. When they were dwelling in the good land, they feasted on the table enjoying all the rich produce of the land. The various aspects of the produce of the land are types of the riches of Christ. Furthermore, Christ Himself is to us, the New Testament believers, the good land as the table. Therefore, whenever we come to the Lord&rsquo;s table to enjoy Christ as the all-inclusive One, in our experience we are in the good land, enjoying the riches of the land. This means that the good land has become a table, a feast, for our enjoyment. At this table, this feast, both God and we are satisfied. The table is a feast for our enjoyment. To come to the table is to enjoy Christ as the good land.</p>
<p>To eat the body of Christ is to have fellowship with Christ. It is to participate in Christ and to become one with Him. The Lord&rsquo;s table is the true enjoyment of the Lord Himself. The Lord&rsquo;s table is not only a matter of meeting on the Lord&rsquo;s Day; this table should be our enjoyment every day, even continually. Day by day the Lord is our good land, our feast, our table. Christ is our table, our feast, and our land. As the good land, Christ is a rich feast for our enjoyment.</p>
<p>God in Christ is edible and drinkable; He is good for food and drink. Thus, we can eat Him, drink Him, and enjoy Him.</p>
<p>At this juncture, we need to consider that the entire Bible is a book of eating and drinking. From beginning to end, the Bible reveals the matter of eating and drinking the Lord. In Genesis 2 God presented Himself as the tree of life (v. 9). The first commandment God gave to man concerned man&rsquo;s eating. Jehovah God commanded the man, saying, &ldquo;Of every tree of the garden you may eat freely, but of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, of it you shall not eat; for in the day that you eat of it you shall surely die&rdquo; (vv. 16-17). According to this commandment, man must eat rightly; that is, man must eat God as the tree of life. If man eats wrongly, that is, if he eats the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, he will die.</p>
<p>Exodus 12 reveals that at the passover the children of Israel held a feast, through which they were saved by eating the passover lamb. When considering the passover, many Christians pay attention only to the striking of the blood of the lamb on the doorpost, which caused the judgment of God to pass over the children of Israel. They are familiar with verse 13, which says, &ldquo;When I see the blood, I will pass over you,&rdquo; yet they overlook verse 8, which says, &ldquo;They shall eat the flesh in that night.&rdquo; They neglect the fact that along with the striking of the blood there was the eating of the flesh of the lamb; that is, after striking the blood on the doorpost, the children of Israel ate the flesh of the lamb. It was through eating the flesh of the lamb that they obtained energy to walk out of Egypt and to pass through the Red Sea. Christ as our Passover is a feast that saves us, a feast in which we eat Him as the Passover lamb. As the Passover lamb, Christ has two elements&mdash;the blood for redeeming and the flesh for feeding. The blood of the passover lamb, which signifies the precious blood of Christ, is for our redemption; the flesh of the passover lamb, which signifies the divine life of Christ, is for our satisfaction. As the Passover lamb, He not only redeemed us but also satisfies us.</p>
<p>Leviticus goes on to show that nearly all the offerings that were presented to God were food not only for God but also for His serving ones, the priests (2:3, 10; 6:16-18, 26; 7:6-7, 14-15, 31-34). The priests were destined to live by these offerings, because they ate what they offered to God. The offerings are types of Christ; as the Lamb of God (John 1:29), Christ is the totality, the aggregate, of all the offerings (Heb. 10:5-10). The offerings signify God in Christ for us to enjoy and even to eat, digest, and assimilate that we may be mingled with God. As the priests, we must eat Christ as the offerings for our priestly diet (1 Pet. 2:5). The more we enjoy Christ as such a diet, the more we will be nourished, qualified, strengthened, and supported to serve God in a priestly way.</p>
<p>Psalm 36:8-9 also unveils that we may eat Christ as the fatness of God&rsquo;s house and drink the Spirit as the river of God&rsquo;s pleasure. &ldquo;They are saturated with the fatness of Your house, / And You cause them to drink of the river of Your pleasures. For with You is the fountain of life; / In Your light we see light.&rdquo; Figuratively, <em>fatness</em> means abundance; specifically, the word refers to the (fatty) ashes of sacrifices (Strong). Thus, the fatness of God&rsquo;s house comes from the sacrifices, the offerings, all of which typify the all-inclusive Christ (Heb. 10:5-10). The fatness of God&rsquo;s house, therefore, refers to the riches of Christ (Eph. 3:8). The fatty ashes of the offerings are the signs of Christ&rsquo;s accomplishment through His death (cf. footnotes 12<sup>1</sup> in Lev. 4 and 10<sup>1</sup> in Lev. 6, Recovery Version). Psalm 36:8-9 reveals the Divine Trinity in His divine dispensing as the enjoyment of God&rsquo;s people in His house. The fatness refers to Christ, the Son; the river of the divine pleasures, to the Spirit as the river of water of life (John 7:37-39; Rev. 22:1); and the fountain of life and light (Psa. 36:9), to the Father as the source of life and light (John 1:4; 1 John 1:5; Rev. 21:23; 22:1-2, 5). These verses indicate that the entire Bible was written according to the controlling vision that the Triune God is working Himself into His chosen and redeemed people to be their life and life supply in order to saturate their entire being with the Divine Trinity, that is, with the Father as the fountain, the Son as the fatness, and the Spirit as the river.</p>
<p>In the New Testament the Lord Jesus called people to come to Him both to eat Him as the bread of life and to drink Him as the living water. In John 6 the Lord Jesus said, &ldquo;I am the bread of life; he who comes to Me shall by no means hunger&rdquo; (v. 35). He went on to say, &ldquo;He who eats Me, he also shall live because of Me&rdquo; (v. 57). In John 7 the Lord cried out, saying, &ldquo;If anyone thirsts, let him come to Me and drink. He who believes into Me, as the Scripture said, out of his innermost being shall flow rivers of living water. But this He said concerning the Spirit&rdquo; (vv. 37-39).</p>
<p>The tree of life is mentioned not only at the beginning of the Bible, in Genesis; it is also mentioned at the end of the Bible, in Revelation. In Revelation 2:7 the Lord unveils Himself as the tree of life in the Paradise of God for God&rsquo;s people to eat in order to become the overcomers. &ldquo;To him who overcomes, to him I will give to eat of the tree of life, which is in the Paradise of God.&rdquo; The Paradise of God in this verse is the New Jerusalem (3:12; 21:2, 10; 22:1-2, 14, 19), of which the church is a foretaste today. We are enjoying the crucified and resurrected Christ as the tree of life, the food supply in our spirit, as a foretaste today in the church. If we daily enjoy Christ as the tree of life, we will be overcoming Christians.</p>
<p>In keeping with the divine revelation in the entire Bible concerning eating and drinking Christ, we need to experience and enjoy Christ by eating and drinking Him day by day and moment by moment. Otherwise, we will become religious Christians who merely have forms, regulations, and teachings yet do not have practical and personal enjoyment of Christ. What we need is not mere forms, rituals, or teachings but a living Christ Himself who is edible and drinkable. We should know that Christ is edible, drinkable, and enjoyable, and we must all eat and drink Him. Eating and drinking Him is a crucial aspect of our experience and enjoyment of Christ.</p><h2 class="head4">b. Signifying That the Many Believers<br />
Are One Bread, One Body</h2>
<p>In 1 Corinthians 10:17 Paul says, &ldquo;Seeing that there is one bread, we who are many are one Body; for we all partake of the one bread.&rdquo; Partaking of (that is, eating&mdash;vv. 28-30) the one bread identifies us with it. This indicates that our partaking of Christ, our enjoying of Christ, identifies us with Him, making us one with Him.</p>
<p>The one bread signifies the one Body of Christ. We all are one Body because we all partake of the one bread. Our joint partaking of the one bread makes us all one. This indicates that our partaking of Christ makes us all His one Body. The very Christ of whom we all partake constitutes us His one Body.</p>
<p>When we jointly partake of the bread, which symbolizes the individual body of Christ, it comes into us to make us one bread, which signifies the corporate Body of Christ. On the one hand, the bread signifies the Lord&rsquo;s physical body that He gave for us on the cross in order to impart His life into us. On the other hand, the bread signifies the Lord&rsquo;s mystical Body constituted of many members regenerated through the resurrection of Jesus Christ, having been enlivened with the Triune God&rsquo;s life and brought into an organic union with the Triune God. Therefore, the bread indicates that the Lord sacrificed His physical body in order to bring forth His mystical Body.</p>
<p>In 1 Corinthians 10:17 the bread is a symbol of an organic composition, a corporate body, the Body of Christ. In this sense the bread signifies that which issued from the Lord in resurrection. Before His death the Lord Jesus was a single grain of wheat, but what issued out of His death in His resurrection was much fruit, a corporate entity, a loaf, the bread, a corporate Body. This implies that as the one grain of wheat, Christ fell into the ground and died, and grew up in resurrection to bring forth many believers as many grains for the producing of the one bread, which is His Body, the church. All the believers, the many grains (John 12:24), are ground into fine flour and then blended together to form one loaf. In this one loaf we see that all the children of God are one; all the members of Christ&rsquo;s mystical Body are represented in the loaf. The loaf is no longer the individual Christ; it is now the corporate Christ (1 Cor. 12:12), including the Head and the Body, that is, Christ and all His believers. The Lord fell into the earth and died as a grain of wheat and then in resurrection became a loaf composed of many grains. Therefore, at His table we enjoy not only the Lord Jesus but also the believers. In other words, we enjoy Christ and the church. Both Christ and the church are our enjoyment.</p>
<p>The bread signifies not only our participation in the life of Christ but also the fellowship of the Body of Christ. On the one hand, we enjoy the Lord by receiving the body which He gave for us on the cross in His death. On the other hand, we enjoy the mystical Body, which He produced through His resurrection from the dead, by fellowshipping with all the saints in this mystical Body and by testifying of the oneness of this mystical Body. By partaking of the same bread, we fellowship with all the members of the Body of Christ.</p>
<h2 class="head4">c. Composing the Table of the Lord</h2>
<p>The Lord&rsquo;s body, signified by the bread, and the Lord&rsquo;s blood, signified by the cup, compose the table of the Lord. In 1 Corinthians 10:21 Paul goes on to say, &ldquo;You cannot drink the Lord&rsquo;s cup and the demons&rsquo; cup; you cannot partake of the Lord&rsquo;s table and of the demons&rsquo; table.&rdquo; To partake of a table is to eat of it. To drink the Lord&rsquo;s cup and partake of the Lord&rsquo;s table is to identify ourselves with the Lord. Eating is related to enjoyment. On the one hand, eating is for our enjoyment, because whenever we eat something, we enjoy it. On the other hand, we become what we eat. In the same principle, to partake of the Lord&rsquo;s table is to enjoy this table and to become one with it, that is, to enjoy the Lord and become one with Him.</p><h1 class="series">THE CONCLUSION<br />

<h2 class="head3">32. The Head of Every Man</h2>
<p>In 1 Corinthians 11:3 Christ is presented as the Head of every man, who brings man under God&rsquo;s headship and sets up the order between man and woman: &ldquo;Christ is the head of every man, and the man is the head of the woman, and God is the head of Christ.&rdquo; In Ephesians 1:22-23 the headship of Christ over all things is to His Body, the church. In 1 Corinthians 11:3 the headship of Christ over every man is related to individuals. Christ is the Head of the Body, the church (Eph. 5:23), corporately, and of the believers individually. He is the Head of every one of us directly.</p>
<p>In 1 Corinthians 11:3 Paul points out that the head of the woman is the man. In the divine governmental ordination, woman is under the headship of man. God created the female in this way (Gen. 2:18-24; 1 Tim. 2:13). According to the nature (1 Cor. 11:14) created by God, woman is subordinate to man.</p>
<p>Paul also says in verse 3 of 1 Corinthians 11 that the head of Christ is God. Christ is God&rsquo;s anointed One, the One appointed by God. Hence, He is under God, and God as the Originator is His Head. This refers to the relationship between Christ and God in the divine government.</p>
<p>Verse 3 reveals the universal headship. In the universe there is the headship: God is at the top as the head of Christ, Christ is the head of every man, the man is the head of the woman, and human beings are the head of all animals and plants (Gen. 1:26-28). Originally, there was such a headship in the universe, a headship that maintained a proper order in God&rsquo;s creation. Yet this order was overthrown by man&rsquo;s rebellion. Among the unbelievers, despite their civilized or cultured appearance, there is disorder in their private life, particularly in their marriage life. The women are not under the headship of men, and since the men do not have Christ, they are not under the headship of Christ and thus are not under the headship of God. Hence, all unbelievers, both men and women, are lawless. They live under the human government by compulsion, and many of them murmur and complain about the government, disliking the human authorities that rule over them. However, when we receive the Lord and become believers, Christ becomes our head. Our enjoyment of Christ as our head brings us under the headship of God and sets up a proper order between man and woman. We should enjoy Christ in His headship in order that we may be under the headship of God and man may be the proper head over woman.</p>
<p>We all need to be under the headship in God&rsquo;s governmental administration. The headship of Christ is related to the headship in God&rsquo;s universal governmental administration. The archangel with his subordinates rebelled against God&rsquo;s headship (Ezek. 28:13-18; Isa. 14:12-15; Matt. 25:41), establishing his kingdom of darkness (12:26; Col. 1:13), and became Satan, God&rsquo;s adversary. God created man to deal with Satan and his rebellious angels. Nevertheless, Satan seduced man to follow him and rebel against God. God then sent His Son to destroy Satan and rescue man out of Satan&rsquo;s authority back to God&rsquo;s kingdom (1 John 3:8; Heb. 2:14; Acts 26:18; Col. 1:13); in redemption God in Christ brought fallen man back to Himself. God&rsquo;s redeemed people are now the church. As the church, we should declare to the angels, to both the rebellious and submissive ones, that as God&rsquo;s redeemed people, we are not rebellious against His headship but are under His headship, the divine authority. We enjoy Christ as our Head and thus remain under the headship of God. Not only will we be under God&rsquo;s headship in the coming kingdom age and in eternity, but we submit to His authority even in the present rebellious age. We need to realize that we must be under the headship of Christ. When we enjoy Christ as our Head, this enjoyment brings us under God&rsquo;s headship and sets up the order between man and woman. Hence, we must enjoy Christ as our Head in order to live under God&rsquo;s headship, the divine authority, and to keep God&rsquo;s ordained order in His administration.</p>
<p>In Revelation we see that Christ, the slain Lamb, is absolutely under the headship of God for the carrying out of God&rsquo;s administration. Christ is the Administrator who is carrying out God&rsquo;s administration through His submission to God&rsquo;s headship. Revelation 4 and 5 show that the slain, resurrected, and ascended Lamb is taking the lead to submit Himself to the headship of God in the heavens. In contrast, the earth is filled with rebellion. Satan is taking the lead to rebel against God. Nevertheless, in the midst of all this rebellion, there is a Body composed of those who have been redeemed and baptized into the Triune God. This is the Body of the One in heaven who submits Himself to God&rsquo;s headship. The Body of Christ on earth should reflect Christ the Head in submitting Himself to the headship of God. Although the earth is filled with rebellion, we must be a people under God&rsquo;s headship, who through their submission to Christ reflect Christ&rsquo;s submission to God.</p><h2 class="head3">33. The Object of<br />
the Believers&rsquo; Remembrance</h2>
<p>First Corinthians 11:23-26 indicates that we may experience and enjoy Christ as the object of the believers&rsquo; remembrance. According to this portion of the Word, when we eat the Lord&rsquo;s supper, we remember Him. In verse 20 Paul speaks of eating the Lord&rsquo;s supper. In 10:21 the Lord&rsquo;s supper is called &ldquo;the Lord&rsquo;s table.&rdquo; The emphasis of the Lord&rsquo;s table is on the fellowship of the Lord&rsquo;s blood and of His body (vv. 16-17), the participation in the Lord, the enjoyment of the Lord in mutuality, in fellowship, whereas the stress of the Lord&rsquo;s supper is on the remembrance of the Lord (11:24-25). At the Lord&rsquo;s table we receive His body and blood for our enjoyment; at the Lord&rsquo;s supper we give Him our remembrance for His enjoyment. To take the Lord&rsquo;s supper is unto the remembrance of the Lord Himself.</p>
<h2 class="head4">a. With His Broken Body Given for the Believers</h2>
<p>In 1 Corinthians 11:23 Paul says, &ldquo;The Lord Jesus in the night in which He was betrayed took bread.&rdquo; Then &ldquo;having given thanks, He broke it and said, This is My body, which is given for you; this do unto the remembrance of Me.&rdquo; The bread is broken that we may eat it, for concerning the bread, the Lord said in Matthew 26:26, &ldquo;Take, eat; this is My body.&rdquo; These verses show that we remember the Lord by eating the bread; to remember the Lord is to feed on Him, that is, to eat Him as the bread of life. The more we receive Him, eat Him, and feast on Him, the more we remember Him.</p>
<p>The bread in 1 Corinthians 11:23 signifies the Lord&rsquo;s body that was broken for us on the cross in order to be distributed to us as bread. In the Bible, bread refers to life. The Lord said that He is the bread of life that gives life to the world (John 6:33-35). The Lord&rsquo;s body being broken to be given as bread to us means that He gave His body for us that we may have His life; that is, through the breaking of His body on the cross, Christ released the life of God from within Him to impart it into us (12:24; 19:34). When we receive His broken body, we partake of His life. Christ gave His body as the bread of life for our life supply and enjoyment.</p>
<p>Eating the bread signifies taking the Lord in to digest and assimilate Him organically that He may become life to us. Just as the food we eat, digest, and assimilate becomes us, the Lord as bread is for us to take in, to eat, as our life supply so that He may become us. When we take in Christ as our food and thoroughly digest and assimilate Him into us, we are truly mingled with Him.</p>
<h2 class="head4">b. With His Blood for the New Covenant</h2>
<p>First Corinthians 11:25 goes on to say, &ldquo;Similarly also the cup after they had dined, saying, This cup is the new covenant established in My blood; this do, as often as you drink it, unto the remembrance of Me.&rdquo; The bread is of life (John 6:35) and the cup is of blessing (1 Cor. 10:16). This cup is the new covenant, comprising all the rich blessings of the New Testament, including God Himself. The new covenant, a covenant of full blessing, was established by the Lord&rsquo;s blood, which He shed on the cross for our redemption (Matt. 26:28).</p>
<p>According to Luke 22:20, the cup is the new covenant or title deed which was enacted by the blood of Christ and testifies of the portion we receive from God. The blood of Christ instituted a new covenant, a better covenant (Heb. 8:6-13), which became the new testament after His resurrection (9:16-17). The blood Christ shed on the cross has become a covenant, and this covenant has become a cup, a portion, which is God Himself as a blessing for our enjoyment. In this covenant God gives us forgiveness, life, salvation, and all spiritual, heavenly, and divine blessings. In short, the Lord shed His blood, God established the covenant, and we enjoy the cup, in which God and all that is of Him are our eternal, blessed portion.</p>
<p>The word <em>unto</em> in 1 Corinthians 11:24-25 implies not only a purpose but also a result. Participation in the Lord&rsquo;s supper will surely produce a result&mdash;a continual remembrance of the Lord for His satisfaction. To take the Lord&rsquo;s supper is to remember the Lord Himself by eating and drinking Him. The real remembrance of the Lord is to eat the bread and drink the cup (v. 26), that is, to participate in, to enjoy, the Lord, who has given Himself to us through His redeeming death. To eat the bread and drink the cup is to take in the redeeming Lord as our portion, as our life and blessing. This is to remember Him in a genuine way.</p><h2 class="head4">c. For the Believers to Eat and Drink,<br />
Declaring His Death until He Comes</h2>
<p>Christ is the object of the believers&rsquo; remembrance for them to eat and drink, declaring His death until He comes. In 1 Corinthians 11:26 Paul tells us that at the Lord&rsquo;s supper we &ldquo;eat this bread and drink the cup.&rdquo; The bread and the cup are the elements of the Lord&rsquo;s supper, a feast, set up by Him so that we, His believers, may remember Him by enjoying Him as such a feast. This means that we should remember the Lord by eating and drinking Him. At the Lord&rsquo;s supper we partake of the bread and the cup as the symbols of His body and His blood in order to enjoy Him. It is by eating, drinking, and enjoying the Lord that we remember Him. The following stanza of <em>Hymns,</em> #233 speaks of this:</p>
<p class="indent1">We long to eat and drink e&rsquo;en more,<br />
To take Thyself in spirit thus,<br />
Till Thou shalt all our being fill<br />
And true remembrance have from us.</p>
<p>The more we eat, drink, and enjoy Him, the more we render Him the true remembrance. To remember the Lord is not merely to recall that Christ is God who became a man, lived as a carpenter, and was persecuted, arrested, judged, and crucified. Rather, to remember Him is to eat and drink Him, to enjoy Him. In other words, we do not remember the Lord by using our mind to meditate about the Lord; instead, we remember the Lord by exercising our spirit to feed on Him. Our remembering the Lord in such a way declares to the whole universe that we daily enjoy Him as our food and drink. He is our feast, our enjoyment.</p>
<p>After we have been saved and regenerated, we should come together to take the Lord&rsquo;s supper in remembrance of the Lord by eating the bread and drinking the cup. On the first day of every week, we need to come together to remember Him by enjoying Him, that is, by eating and drinking Him. In so doing, we declare to the universe that we live by daily eating, drinking, and enjoying Jesus. When we come to eat the Lord&rsquo;s supper, we come to establish a testimony to the universe, including all the angels, demons, human beings, and creatures, that we are a group of people who live by Jesus, eating, drinking, and enjoying Him.</p>
<p>At the Lord&rsquo;s supper we not only remember the Lord but also declare His death until He comes. Whenever we eat the bread and drink the cup, we simultaneously remember the Lord and display His redeeming and life-releasing death (John 19:34). In 1 Corinthians 11:26 Paul says, &ldquo;As often as you eat this bread and drink the cup, you declare the Lord&rsquo;s death until He comes.&rdquo; The word <em>declare</em> here means proclaim, announce, or display. While we are remembering the Lord, we display His death. In fact, we remember the Lord Himself by declaring and displaying His death to the entire universe: to the demons, to the angels, and to human beings. When we remember the Lord, the bread and the cup are displayed separately on the table. The bread refers to the Lord&rsquo;s body, and the cup refers to His blood; the separation of the body and the blood signifies death. With this display of death, we proclaim and announce Christ&rsquo;s all-inclusive termination of twelve items on the cross: the angelic life (Col. 1:20), the human life (Gal. 2:20), Satan (Heb. 2:14; John 12:31), the kingdom of Satan (Col. 2:15; John 12:31), sin (2 Cor. 5:21; Rom. 8:3), sins (1 Pet. 2:24; Isa. 53:6), the world (Gal. 6:14; John 12:31), death (Heb. 2:14), the flesh (Gal. 5:24), the old man (Rom. 6:6), self (Gal. 2:20), and all creation (Col. 1:20).</p>
<p>According to 1 Corinthians 11:26, we are to declare the Lord&rsquo;s death until He comes. This shows that when we break bread to remember the Lord and to display His death, we are also waiting for His coming. We should display the Lord&rsquo;s death and thus remember Him in the spirit and atmosphere of waiting for His coming. We have a glorious hope: one day Christ will return and change our body (15:51-54). When our body of humiliation is transfigured into the body of His glory at His coming (Phil. 3:21), our redemption will be complete (Rom. 8:23).</p>
<p>We should take the Lord&rsquo;s supper unto the remembrance of Him by declaring His redeeming death without ceasing until He comes back to set up God&rsquo;s kingdom (Matt. 26:29). By His first coming the Lord accomplished His death to carry out an all-inclusive redemption for the producing of the church. After His death He went away to receive the kingdom, and He will come again with the kingdom (Dan. 7:13-14; Luke 19:12). The period between His first and second comings is the church age. The church thus bridges the gap between the Lord&rsquo;s first coming and His second coming and connects His death in the past with God&rsquo;s kingdom in the future. Hence, to declare the Lord&rsquo;s death until He comes may imply the declaring of the existence of the church for the bringing in of the kingdom. When we eat the Lord&rsquo;s supper in this way, with a view to a continual remembrance of Him in His first and second comings, that supper becomes a satisfaction to Him in relation to the kingdom, God&rsquo;s administration.</p><h1 class="series">THE CONCLUSION<br />

<h1 class="title">(19)</h1>
<h2 class="head3">34. The Grace of God</h2>
<p>First Corinthians 15:10 unveils that for our experience and enjoyment, Christ is the grace of God. Grace is the central thought of 1 Corinthians. Paul says in 1:4, &ldquo;I thank my God always concerning you based upon the grace of God which was given to you in Christ Jesus.&rdquo; In verse 9 Paul goes on to say that God has called us into the fellowship of His Son, Jesus Christ our Lord. This means that God has called us to participate in, or to partake of, the Son. The fellowship, the enjoyment, and the partaking of Christ are grace.</p>
<h2 class="head4">a. The Resurrected Christ Becoming<br />
the Life-giving Spirit to Bring<br />
the Processed Triune God in Resurrection<br />
into the Believers to Be Their Life and Life Supply<br />
That They May Live in Resurrection</h2>
<p>First Corinthians 15:10 says, &ldquo;By the grace of God I am what I am; and His grace unto me did not turn out to be in vain, but, on the contrary, I labored more abundantly than all of them, yet not I but the grace of God which is with me.&rdquo; Grace, mentioned three times in this verse, is the resurrected Christ becoming the life-giving Spirit (v. 45) to bring the processed Triune God in resurrection into us to be our life and life supply that we may live in resurrection. Thus, grace is the Triune God becoming life and everything to us.</p>
<p>Apart from the Triune God being processed in Christ, He cannot be enjoyed by us as the grace of God. Apart from the resurrected Christ becoming the life-giving Spirit, the grace of God cannot reach us, and we cannot participate in it. Therefore, the grace of God must be the resurrected Christ becoming the life-giving Spirit for our participation in Him.</p>
<p>The enjoyment of the processed Triune God is grace. Anything we eat must first be processed. Apart from being processed in resurrection to become the all-inclusive life-giving Spirit, God cannot be eaten and enjoyed by us. Our Triune God is not only God in creation, but, much more, He is God in resurrection. God in creation is for our worship, but God in resurrection is not only for our worship but also for our enjoyment. The Jews know how to worship God only as their Creator; however, we enjoy our Triune God as the life-giving Spirit. God in resurrection is for enjoyment. Hence, the grace of God is altogether a matter in resurrection.</p>
<p>The unprocessed God is not grace. Rather, grace is the Triune God in resurrection. The God in Paul&rsquo;s ministry is not merely the God of creation&mdash;He is God in resurrection. Resurrection involves the process of incarnation, human living, and crucifixion. After passing through this process in Christ, the Triune God entered into resurrection. Therefore, when we speak of God as the God of resurrection, we imply the process through which He has passed. Christ passed through incarnation, through thirty-three and a half years of human living, and through six hours of crucifixion. After He died, He was placed in a tomb. Then He went into Hades and had a tour of the realm of death. Following that, He came forth in resurrection. Now He is the God not only of creation but also of resurrection. This processed God is now our grace.</p>
<p>Christ, the grace of God, is now in resurrection as the life-giving Spirit, the consummation of the processed Triune God. Since He is in resurrection, we, His believers, should also be in resurrection and live in resurrection. Resurrection means that all the old, natural things have been terminated and that something new and spiritual has been germinated. This is resurrection&mdash;the termination of the natural and the germination of the spiritual, to transform the natural into the spiritual. In resurrection we do not live a natural life but a life that was terminated in the old nature and germinated in the new nature to make us members of Christ.</p><h2 class="head4">b. Making the Foremost of Sinners<br />
the Foremost Apostle</h2>
<p>It is by this grace that Saul of Tarsus, the foremost of sinners (1 Tim. 1:15-16), became the foremost apostle, laboring more abundantly than all the apostles. His ministry and living by this grace are an undeniable testimony to Christ&rsquo;s resurrection. The grace of God operated in him and for him, accomplishing things on his behalf.</p>
<p>In 1 Corinthians 15:10 grace is the Christ who is in resurrection and who is resurrection. By this grace Paul could be what he was and labor more than all the other apostles. <em>Not I but the grace of God which is with me</em> in 1 Corinthians 15:10 equals <em>no longer I...but...Christ who lives in me</em> in Galatians 2:20. This shows that Christ Himself is the grace of God&mdash;God Himself working through the apostle.</p>
<p>All the disciples and apostles who saw the resurrected Christ not only saw Him objectively but also experienced Him subjectively. Through their seeing of Christ, He entered into them and became the subjective One in them. When the day of Pentecost came, this was the reason they were living, energetic, and operative. The resurrected Christ was in them. Not only was Christ Himself resurrected objectively, but in resurrection He lived in Peter, John, and all the other apostles and disciples.</p>
<p>The grace that motivated the apostle and operated in him was not some matter or some thing but a living person, the resurrected Christ, the embodiment of God the Father who became the all-inclusive life-giving Spirit, who dwelt in the apostle as his everything. This corresponds to Paul&rsquo;s declaration in Philippians 4:13: &ldquo;I am able to do all things in Him who empowers me.&rdquo; Here Him refers to the resurrected Christ who became the life-giving Spirit. In such a Christ, Paul was empowered to do all things. This is the grace of God.</p>
<p>Grace is something of God which is wrought into our being and which works in us and does things for us. It is nothing outward. Grace is God in Christ wrought into our being to live, work, and do things for us. In 1 Corinthians 15:10 Paul does not tell us that by the grace of God he has what he has, or even that by the grace of God he does what he does. It is not a matter of doing, having, or working; it is absolutely a matter of being. Hence, Paul says, &ldquo;By the grace of God I am what I am.&rdquo; This means that the grace of God had been wrought into his being, making him that kind of person. Grace is not outside of us or beside us. It is a divine person, God Himself in Christ, wrought into our being to be the constituent of our being. Grace is the Triune God wrought into our being to be what we should be and to live, work, and do things for us so that we may say, &ldquo;I am what I am by the grace of God. It is not I, but the grace of God.&rdquo;</p>
<p>By this grace Paul could be what he was and labor more abundantly than all the other apostles. Paul indicates that by himself he was nothing and by himself could never be an apostle and that he labored more than the others, yet it was not he who labored&mdash;it was the grace of God. The grace which was with Paul and which enabled him to labor more than others was actually God Himself. God in Paul was eternal life as his supply and support for the carrying out of His New Testament economy.</p>
<p>Throughout the centuries, all the living servants of the Lord have had this resurrected Christ living in them. We can testify that He as the grace of God lives in us, enabling us to do what we could never do in ourselves. We may be persecuted and opposed, and we may suffer very much; however, we have the resurrected Christ in us. The more we are opposed, the more alive and active we become. We must all declare that in our labor it is not we but the grace of God with us.</p>
<p>We should not be the ones working; rather, the grace of God, the resurrected Christ who lives in us, should be the One working. We need to learn of Paul to coordinate with the One living in us. Although in ourselves we cannot carry out the Lord&rsquo;s work or bear the burden of the churches, the work is easy to do and the burden is easy to bear when it is the processed and consummated One living in us who does the work and bears the burden. We should praise the Lord that we can simply enjoy His living and His working and rejoice in Him.</p>
<p>Although many Christians define grace as unmerited favor or undeserved goodness bestowed on us, grace revealed in the Bible is far more than merely unmerited favor. Grace is the incarnated, crucified, resurrected Christ becoming the life-giving Spirit to enter into us, to indwell us, and to be our life and life supply. Such an amazing grace can make a sinner the foremost apostle.</p><h1 class="series">THE CONCLUSION<br />
OF THE NEW TESTAMENT</h1>
<h1 class="msg">MESSAGE THREE HUNDRED FOURTEEN</h1>
<h1 class="title">EXPERIENCING AND ENJOYING CHRIST<br />
IN THE EPISTLES</h1>
<h1 class="title">(20)</h1>
<h2 class="head3">35. The Firstfruits, the Second Man,<br />
and the Last Adam</h2>
<p>First Corinthians 15 presents Christ as the firstfruits (vv. 20, 23), the second man (v. 47), and the last Adam (v. 45). It is significant that these three aspects of Christ are mentioned in one chapter. When we put together these three aspects of Christ, we see that Christ is the first, the second, and the last; as such, Christ is everything. Concerning these aspects of Christ, we must not only learn the truth and see the vision but also have the experience.</p>
<h2 class="head4">a. The Firstfruits</h2>
<p>In 1 Corinthians 15:20 Paul says, &ldquo;Now Christ has been raised from the dead, the firstfruits of those who have fallen asleep.&rdquo; In verse 23 Paul speaks of &ldquo;the firstfruits, Christ.&rdquo; Christ is the firstfruits of resurrection to be the beginning of God&rsquo;s new creation and to be the Head of the Body, the church.</p>
<h2 class="head5">(1) To Be the Beginning of God&rsquo;s New Creation</h2>
<p>Christ was the first One raised from the dead, becoming the firstfruits of resurrection. This was typified by the firstfruits (a sheaf of the firstfruits, including Christ with some of the dead Old Testament saints, was raised at the Lord&rsquo;s resurrection&mdash;Matt. 27:52-53) in Leviticus 23:10-11, which were offered to God on the day after the Sabbath, the day of resurrection (Matt. 28:1). As the firstfruits, Christ is the beginning of God&rsquo;s new creation. Christ in resurrection is the beginning, the germination, of the new creation. Through the resurrection of Christ the old creation passed away and a new creation came into being. By His all-inclusive death He terminated the old creation; in His resurrection He germinated the new creation with the divine life. Christ is the firstfruits of the new creation in resurrection. This is confirmed by Colossians 1:18b: &ldquo;He is the beginning, the Firstborn from the dead.&rdquo; This verse shows that Christ is the first in resurrection; as such, He has the first place in the church, God&rsquo;s new creation (2 Cor. 5:17; Gal. 6:15).</p>
<h2 class="head5">(2) To Be the Head of the Body, the Church</h2>
<p>Christ as the firstfruits of resurrection is the Firstborn from the dead that He might be the Head of the Body (Eph. 1:20-23). Hence, Colossians 1:18a tells us that Christ is the Head of the Body, the church; He is the beginning, the Firstborn from the dead. Since He, the Head of the Body, has been resurrected, we, the Body, also will be resurrected.</p>
<h2 class="head4">b. The Second Man</h2>
<h2 class="head5">(1) Out of Heaven</h2>
<p>First Corinthians 15:47 unveils Christ as the second man. &ldquo;The first man is out of the earth, earthy; the second man is out of heaven.&rdquo; <em>Out of the earth</em> denotes the origin of the first man, Adam, and <em>earthy,</em> his nature. As the first man, Adam is the head of the old creation, representing it in creation. As the second man, Christ is the Head of the new creation, representing it in resurrection. In the entire universe there are only two men: the first man, Adam, including all his descendants, and the second man, Christ, comprising all His believers. We believers were included in the first man by birth and became a part of the second man by regeneration. Our believing has transferred us out of the first man into the second. In regard to our being part of the first man, our origin is the earth and our nature is earthy. In regard to our being part of the second man, our origin is God and our nature is heavenly. <em>Out of heaven</em> denotes both the divine origin and the heavenly nature of the second man, Christ.</p><h2 class="head5">(2) To Replace the First Man</h2>
<p>In the Bible there is a principle that the second always replaces the first (Gen. 17:18-19; 25:23; 48:18-19; 1 Sam. 16:1; 2 Sam. 12:14, 24-25; Rom. 9:12-13). This principle is indicated by 1 Corinthians 15:46: &ldquo;The spiritual is not first but the soulish, then the spiritual.&rdquo; <em>The spiritual</em> here denotes Christ the second man; <em>the soulish</em> denotes Adam, the first man (v. 47). According to human understanding, tradition, and practice, we should follow the one who is first, not the one who is second. For this reason, Paul deliberately says in this verse that the soulish and not the spiritual is the first; the spiritual is the second. If we take the Bible, we should follow the second and not the first. For example, we should not follow Cain, the first; we should follow Abel, the second. Furthermore, during the passover in Egypt, the firstborn were rejected, condemned, and killed. This indicates that God&rsquo;s judgment is upon the firstborn. The same principle applies to the first creation and the new creation. God does not want what is first; He wants what is second. Hence, God does not desire the first man; rather, He desires the second man to replace the first man.</p>
<h2 class="head4">c. The Last Adam</h2>
<p>First Corinthians 15:45 reveals that Christ is the last Adam. &ldquo;So also it is written, &lsquo;The first man, Adam, became a living soul&rsquo;; the last Adam became a life-giving Spirit.&rdquo;</p>
<h2 class="head5">(1) To Terminate the First Man</h2>
<p>Christ being the last Adam implies the termination of the first man. In the universe there are only two Adams and two men. The first Adam (v. 45) is Adam our forefather, and the last Adam is Christ. The first man is Adam, and the second man is Christ. The last Adam is the conclusion of Adam, the first man. The last of anything is the termination of that thing. Hence, the last Adam is the end of Adam. Christ became a man. As a man, He ended the Adamic race; Adam is terminated in Christ. The first Adam is the beginning of mankind; the last Adam is the ending.</p>
<p>The last Adam indicates an ending, and the second man indicates a new beginning. Christ being the last Adam means that He terminated Adam, whereas Christ being the second man indicates that He is a new beginning. We were all in Adam, and we were all terminated in Christ. Now we are in the second man, and we are in the new beginning. To be terminated is to be crucified; to be in the new beginning is to be in resurrection. We are in Christ as the last Adam; we have been terminated in Him. We are also in Christ as the second man; we have a new beginning in Him.</p>
<p>As the last Adam, He ended the old man. When He was crucified, our old man was crucified with Him (Rom. 6:6). His death as the last Adam was for God&rsquo;s dealing with our old man. As the end of the old man, He crucified the old man and terminated the old creation. The old man is the representative, the center, of the old creation; hence, by destroying the old man Christ terminated the old creation.</p>
<h2 class="head5">(2) To Become a Life-giving Spirit</h2>
<p>Christ, the last Adam, became in resurrection a life-giving Spirit. According to 1 Corinthians 15:45, the first man, Adam, became a living soul, and the last Adam became a life-giving Spirit. This verse implies both the old creation with the soul as the center and the new creation with the Spirit as the center. Adam, the first man, was the head of the old creation. When God created him, Adam became a living soul. This means that he became a person, a human being. In Hebrew <em>Adam</em> means &ldquo;man.&rdquo; Christ being the last Adam implies a termination and conclusion of the old creation. The old creation ends with a man, the last Adam. This man who terminated the old creation became in resurrection a life-giving Spirit. Now the Spirit is the center and lifeline of the new creation. The old creation was created by God, whereas the new creation comes into being not by creation but by resurrection. Therefore, verse 45 implies two creations: the old creation with man, a living soul, as its center and the new creation in resurrection with the life-giving Spirit as its center. Through incarnation Christ became the last Adam to die on the cross for the termination of the old creation, and through resurrection He as the last Adam became the life-giving Spirit to germinate the new creation.</p>
<p>The life-giving Spirit is the reality and life pulse of Christ&rsquo;s resurrection. Resurrection was a process to bring forth the life-giving Spirit. Through the process of resurrection, the last Adam, the man who ended the old creation, became the life-giving Spirit, the germinating element of the new creation. The life-giving Spirit is the essence to germinate a new creation. This Spirit is nothing less than Christ, the Triune God. Actually, the life-giving Spirit is the processed Triune God. In Christ God has passed through the process of incarnation, crucifixion, and resurrection. Now in resurrection He is the life-essence to germinate the new creation. We have become the new creation germinated by the Triune God as the life-giving Spirit.</p>
<p>The last Adam was Jesus Christ in the flesh. As a man in the flesh, He was the Lamb of God who took away our sins (John 1:29). Furthermore, when He was crucified, He dealt with our natural life and our old man. This made it possible for us to receive the divine life. After dying on the cross, the last Adam, our Redeemer, became in resurrection the life-giving Spirit to impart Himself into us as life. As the life-giving Spirit, He is the life-dispensing Spirit. Now He is the Spirit who gives life, the Spirit who imparts life to us, the Spirit who dispenses Himself as life into the believers.</p>
<p>When Christ came through incarnation, He came with the Father and by the Spirit. After coming in incarnation, He took a further step to pass through death and enter into resurrection. This is the process that we call Christ&rsquo;s transfiguration from the flesh into the Spirit. By going through this process of transfiguration, the Lord Jesus, who came in incarnation with the Father and by the Spirit, became the life-giving Spirit as the ultimate consummation of the Triune God. This transfiguration included a number of elements: humanity, human living, Christ&rsquo;s all-inclusive death, and His life-imparting resurrection. All these elements have been brought into the all-inclusive life-giving Spirit, the consummation of the Triune God.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the life-giving Spirit is the totality of all that Christ is as the all-inclusive One. First Corinthians unveils that the Christ who is the portion of all believers and into whose fellowship we have been called (1:2, 9) is all-inclusive. He is God&rsquo;s power and God&rsquo;s wisdom as righteousness, sanctification, and redemption to us (vv. 24, 30); our glory for our glorification (2:7), hence, the Lord of glory (v. 8); the depths of God (v. 10); the unique foundation of God&rsquo;s building (3:11); our Passover (5:7); the unleavened bread (v. 8); the spiritual food and the spiritual drink flowing out the spiritual rock (10:3-4); the Head (11:3) and the Body (12:12); the firstfruits (15:20, 23); the second Man (v. 47); and the last Adam (v. 45). As such an all-inclusive One, He is now the life-giving Spirit, the totality of all that He is for our experience and enjoyment.</p><h2 class="head3">36. The Coming King</h2>
<p>First Corinthians 15:24-25 reveals that for our experience and enjoyment, Christ is the coming King.</p>
<h2 class="head4">a. Needing to Reign until God<br />
Puts All His Enemies under His Feet</h2>
<p>First Corinthians 15:25 says, &ldquo;He must reign until God puts all His enemies under His feet.&rdquo; In order for Christ to reign He must be in resurrection. If there were no resurrection, Christ would still be in the tomb, and it would not be possible for Him to reign. Christ began to reign from the time of His resurrection. In Matthew 28:18 the Lord Jesus said to the disciples, &ldquo;All authority has been given to Me in heaven and on earth.&rdquo; Then He charged them to go and disciple all the nations. He has the authority to reign. Now under His reign we must disciple the nations, bringing the nations into His kingdom and making them His people. Today the real king, the real ruler, is the Lord Jesus. According to Revelation 1:5, He is the Ruler of the kings of the earth. Every king, queen, president, and head of state is under His reign.</p>
<p>In 1 Corinthians 15:25 Paul says that Christ must reign until God puts all His enemies under His feet. The longer Christ reigns, the more enemies are put under His feet. Eventually, at the end of the millennium, the last age of the old creation, every enemy will have been put under the feet of Christ. The word <em>until</em> indicates this and points to the end of the thousand years. That will be the time when every enemy has been put under Christ&rsquo;s feet.</p>
<h2 class="head4">b. Having Annulled All Rule, Authority, and Power,<br />
Delivering Up the Kingdom to God</h2>
<p>First Corinthians 15:24 says, &ldquo;Then the end, when He delivers up the kingdom to His God and Father, once He has abolished all rule and all authority and power.&rdquo; When Christ annuls the satanic authority, subdues all His enemies (v. 25), abolishes death (v. 26), and delivers up the kingdom to God the Father, that is, when all the negative things are done away with and the entire purpose of God is fulfilled, the old creation will be concluded.</p>
<p>After accomplishing redemption, Christ went to receive the kingdom from the Father (Luke 19:12, 15). Before the millennium He as the Son of Man will have received the kingdom from God, the Ancient of Days, to rule all the nations for one thousand years (Dan. 7:13-14; Rev. 20:4, 6). At the end of the millennium, after He has defeated Satan, the devil, and his evil angels (as all rule, authority, and power), and even death and Hades, putting all His enemies under His feet (1 Cor. 15:25-26) and casting all of them, including death and Hades, into the lake of fire (Rev. 20:7-10, 14), He will deliver the kingdom back to God the Father.</p>
<p>What is revealed in 1 Corinthians 15:24-25 will take place mainly after Christ comes back as the King to bring the kingdom of God to earth and to execute the kingdom for a thousand years. In the millennium the overcomers will be the co-kings with Christ, enjoying Him as such a King. Nevertheless, today we as the Body of Christ can enjoy Him as the King (Rom. 5:17).</p>
<p>In resurrection Christ not only became the life-giving Spirit to impart His life into His Body; He also became the reigning King to execute God&rsquo;s administration. On the one hand, to us as God&rsquo;s chosen people, Christ in resurrection is the life-giving Spirit imparting life to us. On the other hand, to the nations, Christ in His resurrection has become the reigning King executing God&rsquo;s administration. His Body must cooperate with Him in His resurrection life and resurrection authority so that the church may be headed up (Eph. 1:10). In His Body Christ must first head us up. Once the church has been headed up, the church will be used by Christ as His Body to head up all things. Then all the nations will be headed up. Moreover, as He is heading up all things, He is subduing, subjecting, His enemies under His feet. Eventually, at the end of the millennium, after the end of all the ages and dispensations, God&rsquo;s administration will be fully accomplished. Then there will be the new heaven and new earth, and we will be in the New Jerusalem enjoying Christ and reigning with Him over the nations.</p>
<p>We should not only understand the aspects of Christ revealed in 1 Corinthians but also experience them. We need to first understand all the wonderful aspects of Christ; then we will be brought into the experience and enjoyment of Christ according to these aspects. Experiencing Christ in these aspects requires much time. To enjoy, eat, and digest even one aspect of Christ takes time. As we enjoy Him in one aspect after another, we will realize that the all-inclusive Christ is an unlimited feast.</p><h1 class="series">THE CONCLUSION<br />

<p>In this message we will begin to consider aspects of the experience and enjoyment of Christ as revealed in 2 Corinthians.</p>
<h2 class="head3">37. The Source of the Apostles&rsquo; Comfort</h2>
<p>Second Corinthians 1:5-6 reveals Christ as the source of the apostles&rsquo; comfort. &ldquo;Even as the sufferings of the Christ abound unto us, so through the Christ our comfort also abounds. But whether we are afflicted, it is for your comforting and salvation; or whether we are comforted, it is for your comforting, which operates in the endurance of the same sufferings which we also suffer.&rdquo; In verse 5 Paul speaks of the sufferings of the Christ. Here <em>sufferings</em> does not refer to sufferings for Christ; rather, it refers to Christ&rsquo;s own sufferings as shared by His disciples (Matt. 20:22; Phil. 3:10; Col. 1:24; 1 Pet. 4:13). Furthermore, <em>the Christ</em> is a designation of the condition of Christ; it is not used as a name (Darby). In this verse it refers to the suffering Christ, who suffered afflictions for His Body according to God&rsquo;s will. The apostles participated in the sufferings of such a Christ, and through such a Christ they received comfort. According to 2 Corinthians 1:6 and 7, all their affliction and comfort were for the comfort of the believers.</p>
<p>The apostles were full of comfort, and the source of their comfort was Christ. As the sufferings of Christ constantly abounded unto Paul and his co-workers, so through Christ their comfort also abounded for the comfort of the believers who endured Christ&rsquo;s sufferings. Today we may enjoy Christ as such a source of comfort that we may abound in comforting others.</p>
<h2 class="head3">38. The Yes and the Amen</h2>
<p>In 2 Corinthians 1:19-20, Christ is presented as the Yes and the Amen.</p>
<h2 class="head4">a. Whatever Promises of God There Are,<br />
in Him Being the Yes;<br />
through Him Also Being the Amen</h2>
<p>In 2 Corinthians 1:20 Paul says, &ldquo;As many promises of God as there are, in Him is the Yes; therefore also through Him is the Amen to God, for glory through us to God.&rdquo; Christ, whom the faithful God promised and whom the sincere apostles preached, did not become yes and no, did not change, because in Him is the Yes of all the promises of God, and through Him is the apostles&rsquo; and the believers&rsquo; Amen to God for His glory. Christ is the Yes, the incarnate answer, the fulfillment of all the promises of God to us.</p>
<p>The Christ whom Paul ministered to the saints is not yes and no. The Christ he ministered is always the Yes. He is also the Amen in the universe. <em>The Amen</em> in verse 20 is the Amen given by us through Christ to God (cf. 1 Cor. 14:16). Christ is the Yes, and we say Amen to this Yes before God. The phrase <em>for glory</em> means &ldquo;for the glory of God.&rdquo; When we say Amen before God to the fact that Christ is the Yes, the fulfillment, of all the promises of God, God is glorified through us. Christ is the great Yes and the universal Amen.</p>
<p><em>Us</em> in 2 Corinthians 1:20 refers not only to the apostles, who preached Christ according to God&rsquo;s promises, but also to the believers, who received Christ according to the apostles&rsquo; preaching. Through us there is glory unto God when we say Amen to Christ as the great Yes of all God&rsquo;s promises.</p><h2 class="head4">b. The Apostles&rsquo; Preaching of Him<br />
Being Yes in Him</h2>
<p>In 2 Corinthians 1:17-18 Paul says, &ldquo;This therefore intending, did I then use fickleness? Or the things which I purpose, do I purpose according to the flesh, so that with me there should be Yes, yes and No, no? But as God is faithful, our word toward you is not yes and no.&rdquo; Here Paul indicates that he did not use fickleness; he did not change from yes to no and from no to yes. Moreover, he defended himself and his co-workers by saying that God is faithful so that the word of their preaching was not yes and no. Hence, neither were they fickle persons of yes and no. Their being was according to their preaching. They lived according to what they preached. The word of the apostles&rsquo; preaching in 1:18, that is, their word toward the Corinthians, was their message concerning Christ (v. 19).</p>
<p>Second Corinthians 1:17-18 indicates that Paul was one with the faithful God. He was the same as God in being faithful. His word toward the Corinthians, the word of his ministry, was not yes and no. Paul did not change his tune. From the first time he came to the Corinthians until the writing of this Epistle, his preaching sounded the same note. There was no change at all in the word of the ministry.</p>
<p>In verse 19 Paul continues, &ldquo;For the Son of God, Jesus Christ, who was preached among you through us, through me and Silvanus and Timothy, did not become yes and no, but our word has become yes in Him.&rdquo; <em>For</em> introduces the reason for what is mentioned in the preceding verse. God is faithful, never changing, especially in regard to His promises concerning Christ. Hence, the word the apostles preached concerning Christ was likewise never changing, because the very Christ whom God promised in His faithful word and whom they preached in their gospel did not become yes and no. Rather, in Him is the Yes. Since the Christ whom they preached according to God&rsquo;s promises did not become yes and no, the word they preached concerning Him was not yes and no. Not only their preaching but also their living was according to what Christ is. They preached Christ and lived Him. They were not men of yes and no but men who were the same as Christ.</p>
<p>The apostles&rsquo; preaching of Christ never changed; likewise, in our preaching concerning Christ, we should never change our tune. We can testify that the tune of our preaching in this ministry has never changed. Although we have encountered much opposition to this ministry, today in our preaching of Christ, we still sound the same note. Our preaching of Christ in Him is yes.</p>
<h2 class="head3">39. The Anointed One</h2>
<p>For our experience and enjoyment, Christ is also the anointed One. &ldquo;The One who firmly attaches us with you unto Christ and has anointed us is God, He who has also sealed us and given the Spirit in our hearts as a pledge&rdquo; (vv. 21-22).</p>
<h2 class="head4">a. God Firmly Attaching the Believers Together<br />
with the Apostles unto Christ</h2>
<p>God firmly attaches the believers together with the apostles unto Christ. This means that God has attached the apostles, the ministers, with all those to whom they ministered. The apostles, who preached Christ according to God&rsquo;s promises and lived Christ according to their preaching, and the believers, who received Christ according to the apostles&rsquo; preaching, are joined to Christ, becoming one with Him, through whom they say Amen before God to the great Yes of God&rsquo;s promises, which is Christ Himself. It is not they but God who attaches them together unto Christ. Their being one with Christ is of God and by God, not of themselves and by themselves.</p>
<p>In 2 Corinthians 1:21 Paul speaks of being firmly attached with the believers unto Christ, the anointed One (Dan. 9:26; John 1:41). The Greek words rendered <em>firmly attaches us with you</em> can also be rendered &ldquo;firmly connects us with you.&rdquo; Literally, the word <em>attaches</em> means &ldquo;establishes.&rdquo; God establishes the apostles with the believers in Christ. This means that God firmly attaches the apostles together with the believers unto Christ, the anointed One. Hence, the apostles and the believers are one not only with Christ, the anointed One, but also with one another, sharing the anointing that Christ has received of God.</p><h2 class="head4">b. Through Him God Having Anointed the Believers</h2>
<p>In Greek <em>Christ</em> means &ldquo;the anointed One.&rdquo; Christ, the anointed One, is full of ointment, full of anointing. He is the Son of God whom God has anointed above all His partners, His companions (Heb. 1:9). God attaches the apostles with all the believers unto this anointed One. The ointment flows in us because we have been attached to Him. Since we have been attached by God to Christ, the anointed One, we are spontaneously anointed with Him by God.</p>
<p>Second Corinthians 1:21 says that God firmly attaches us and has anointed us. He has anointed us by attaching us to the anointed One. In the universe there is only One who has been anointed by God. This One is Christ, the anointed One. Now we are all in this anointed One. Since we are members of Christ, we are also part of the anointed One. Because we have been joined to the universal anointed One, we also have been anointed.</p>
<p>The apostles were attached together with the believers unto Christ as the anointed One. This anointed One is also the anointing. The anointing is the moving of the ointment, that is, the moving and working of the all-inclusive life-giving, Spirit within us. Through such a Christ, who is both the anointed One and the anointing, God has anointed the believers. The anointing imparts His substance, His essence, into our being. God has anointed Christ and us with Himself as the divine ointment. The more we are anointed by God, the more we receive the element of God&rsquo;s divine nature. The anointing is for the imparting of the divine element into us. God imparts all His divine ingredients and constituents into us by His anointing.</p>
<p>In one sense, we believers who have been regenerated have all been attached to Christ. Yet in our experience the extent to which we have been attached to Christ depends on the amount of anointing we have received. The more anointing we receive, the more we are attached to Christ. If we are living and doing things under the anointing, this anointing teaches us concerning all things (1 John 2:27). When we walk according to this anointing, we have the sense that we are attached to Christ. If we take care of the inner anointing, that is, if we behave and act according to the inner anointing, we are experientially attached to Christ, the anointed One. Day by day the anointing Spirit anoints us with the ingredients and the constituents of God, the elements of God Himself. If we daily walk and behave according to this anointing, God Himself will be added to us and imparted into us.</p>
<h2 class="head4">c. Through Him God Having Sealed the Believers</h2>
<p>Through Christ, God has sealed the believers to impress them with God&rsquo;s image. Since God has anointed us with Christ, He has also sealed us in Him. We should not regard sealing as something separate from the anointing. Actually, anointing implies sealing. As we are under the anointing, the anointing becomes a sealing. In this way we become different from others. Furthermore, the seal is the image of God; the seal causes us to bear the appearance of God. First God through the anointing adds the essence of Himself to us. Then this anointing seals us with the essence of God and makes us the image of God. In other words, we are first anointed that we may receive the divine essence into our being; then we are sealed that we may receive the impression of the divine image.</p>
<p>The sealing forms the divine elements into an impression that expresses God&rsquo;s image. We have the mark of the Spirit as the living seal that causes us to bear God&rsquo;s image. If we experience the sealing Spirit, when others contact us, they will have the sense that God has been formed within us (Gal. 4:19).</p>
<h2 class="head4">d. Through Him, God Having Given<br />
the Pledge of the Spirit in Their Hearts</h2>
<p>In 2 Corinthians 1:22 Paul also says that God has given the Spirit as a pledge in our hearts. The pledge of the Spirit is the Spirit Himself as the pledge (5:5). The seal is a mark that marks us out as God&rsquo;s inheritance, God&rsquo;s possession, as those who belong to God. The pledge is an earnest, guaranteeing that God is our inheritance, or possession, and belongs to us. The Spirit within us is the pledge, an earnest, of God as our portion in Christ.</p>
<p>The Spirit is not only the anointing and a seal but also a pledge. A pledge is a guarantee, a sample, or a partial payment. The Spirit is the pledge of our inheritance that guarantees that we will receive the full taste of God Himself as our divine inheritance (Eph. 1:13-14). We have the Spirit for our taste, our enjoyment, and the Spirit is sweet to our spiritual taste. The Christian life is not a matter of meditating in the mind but a matter of tasting the Lord in the spirit (Psa. 34:8; 1 Pet. 2:3). We can taste the heavenly things and the things of the age to come (Heb. 6:4-5) by the Spirit. The Spirit also transmits the things in eternity and in the New Jerusalem to us because He is the eternal Spirit (9:14). We need to enjoy the indwelling Spirit as the foretaste day by day.</p>
<p>The Spirit transmits all the heavenly things and elements of Christ into us, not for our mental knowledge but for our taste and enjoyment. We need to continually taste the heavenly, spiritual, and eternal things by the Spirit. Everything in the New Jerusalem is included in the Spirit, who has been given to us as a foretaste, a sample, of the full taste of the Spirit in the ages to come. The quantity of the Spirit we have in this age is smaller than that which we will receive in the ages to come, but the quality and taste are the same. We need to learn how to taste the Lord by continually calling upon His name.</p>
<p>God&rsquo;s attaching us to Christ issues in three things: (1) an anointing that imparts God&rsquo;s elements into us; (2) a sealing that forms the divine elements into an impression to express God&rsquo;s image; and (3) a pledging that gives us a foretaste as a sample and guarantee of the full taste of God.</p>
<p>As believers, we have the Holy Spirit as the anointing, the seal, and the pledge, all of which are for our full enjoyment of Christ. Day by day we should be under the anointing, the sealing, and the pledging of the Holy Spirit. These three matters&mdash;the anointing, the sealing, and the pledging&mdash;are actually one. They are one thing with three aspects. First we are anointed, then we are sealed, and then we have the pledge as a guarantee. We have the essence, the image, and the guarantee, all of which are the processed God who is now the Spirit. The Spirit is the ointment with which we are anointed, the essence with which we are sealed, and the pledge which guarantees that God belongs to us and that He is our portion. Because we have been anointed and sealed and have received the pledge, we are now qualified and equipped to live the unchanging Christ.</p><h1 class="series">THE CONCLUSION<br />

<h1 class="title">EXPERIENCING AND ENJOYING CHRIST<br />
IN THE EPISTLES</h1>
<h1 class="title">(22)</h1>
<h2 class="head3">40. The Spirit and the Lord Spirit</h2>
<p>In 2 Corinthians 3:17-18 Christ is presented as the Spirit and the Lord Spirit.</p>
<h2 class="head4">a. The Spirit</h2>
<p>Second Corinthians 3:17 says, &ldquo;The Lord is the Spirit; and where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is freedom.&rdquo; This verse tells us first that the Lord is the Spirit; this proves that the Lord and the Spirit are one. Yet the verse goes on to speak of the Spirit of the Lord; this seems to show that the Spirit and the Lord are two. The expression <em>the Spirit of the Lord,</em> however<em>,</em> indicates that the Spirit and the Lord are in apposition to each other. This shows that the Spirit is the Lord and the Lord is the Spirit and that the Spirit and the Lord are one. The Spirit of the Lord is actually one with the Lord.</p>
<h2 class="head5">(1) The Lord Being the Spirit</h2>
<p>According to the context of 2 Corinthians 3:17, <em>the Lord</em> here must refer to Christ the Lord (2:12, 14-15, 17; 3:3-4, 14, 16; 4:5). This then is a strong word in the Bible telling us emphatically that Christ is the Spirit. &ldquo;The Lord Christ of v. 16 is the Spirit who pervades and animates the new covenant of which we are ministers (v. 6), and the ministration of which is with glory (v. 8). Compare Rom. 8:9-11; John 14:16, 18&rdquo; (Vincent). &ldquo;The Lord of verse 16, is the Spirit...which giveth life, v. 6: meaning, &lsquo;the Lord,&rsquo; as here spoken of, &lsquo;Christ,&rsquo; &lsquo;is the Spirit,&rsquo; is identical with the Holy Spirit...Christ, here, is the Spirit of Christ&rdquo; (Alford). &ldquo;All that transforming and indwelling Spirit is Christ Himself. &lsquo;The Lord is the Spirit&rsquo;&rdquo; (Williston Walker).</p>
<p>Some deny that the Lord in 2 Corinthians 3:17 refers to Christ the Lord. They claim that it denotes God in a general way. Furthermore, using John 4:24, they claim that 2 Corinthians 3:17 is simply saying that God is the Spirit. However, if we consider this verse according to the context, we will realize that the Lord in verse 17 must refer to Christ. Therefore, this verse tells us emphatically that Christ the Lord is the Spirit.</p>
<p>Throughout the centuries there have been a number of teachers who believed that, according to verse 17, Christ the Lord is the Spirit. Many Christians, however, are still under the influence of the creeds, especially the Nicene Creed. At the time of the Council of Nicaea (A.D. 325), the book of Revelation had not been officially recognized. This may be the reason that in the Nicene Creed nothing is said regarding the seven Spirits. In the book of Revelation the third of the Trinity is the seven Spirits of God. Furthermore, according to Revelation 5:6, these seven Spirits are the seven eyes of the Lamb. For those who claim that the Spirit is a separate person from the Son, we would like to ask how the third person, the Spirit, can be the eyes of the second person, the Son. We cannot deny what the book of Revelation says concerning the seven Spirits, that the third of the Trinity is the eyes of the second. For this reason, we should not speak of Christ and the Spirit as being two separate persons.</p>
<p>The Spirit, who is the ultimate expression of the Triune God, was not yet in John 7:39, because at that time Jesus had not yet been glorified. He had not yet finished the process that He, as the embodiment of God, had to pass through. After His resurrection, that is, after the finishing of all the processes, such as incarnation, crucifixion, and resurrection, that the Triune God had to pass through in man for His redemptive economy, He became a life-giving Spirit (1 Cor. 15:45). In the New Testament, this life-giving Spirit is called &ldquo;the Spirit&rdquo; (Rom. 8:16, 23, 26-27; Gal. 3:2, 5, 14; 6:8; Rev. 2:7; 3:22; 14:13; 22:17), the Spirit who gives us the divine life (2 Cor. 3:6; John 6:63) and frees us from the bondage of the law.</p><h2 class="head5">(2) Where the Spirit of the Lord Is,<br />
There Being Freedom</h2>
<p>In 2 Corinthians 3:17 Paul tells us that where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is freedom. The Spirit of the Lord is the Lord Himself, with whom is freedom. According to the context of 2 Corinthians 3, this freedom is freedom from the bondage of the letter of the Old Testament law, that is, the written code of the Old Testament. At Paul&rsquo;s time the Judaizers and those influenced by them were bound by the traditional code of the law. Nevertheless, the Lord Jesus came to release His followers from this bondage, in particular from the Judaic fold that was formed according to the code of the law in the Old Testament. All those who followed the Lord Jesus were freed from that bondage. Later the Lord appeared to one of the strongest Judaizers, Saul of Tarsus, called him, and brought him out of the bondage of the law. Therefore, in 2 Corinthians 3:17 Paul could say that we have been freed from this bondage by the Spirit of the Lord.</p>
<p>We know that we are freed by the Spirit because where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is liberty. Now the Spirit of the Lord is with us, and we have full liberty, full freedom, from the bondage of the Old Testament code of the law.</p>
<p>The Lord being the Spirit is to free us from regulations, rituals, religious teachings, and traditional doctrines. At Paul&rsquo;s time the Jews were under the bondage of circumcision, the bondage of dietary regulations, and the bondage of the Sabbath and other Old Testament regulations. Today, however, is not the age of the law of letters but the age of the Lord Jesus being the pneumatic Christ, the Spirit. Moses, with the letter of the law, put the people under bondage&mdash;the bondage of keeping the Sabbath, the bondage of circumcision, the bondage of dietary regulations, the bondage of not contacting Gentiles, as well as many other bondages. But the Lord being the Spirit is freedom to us. With Him there is no bondage, no Sabbath, no circumcision, and no dietary regulations. Rather, with Him there is full freedom. The Lord is the Spirit, and He is our freedom. When the heart turns to the Lord, the veil is taken away (v. 16), and then the Lord as the Spirit gives us freedom. Because the Lord is the Spirit who gives freedom, when the heart turns to Him, the heart is freed from the bondage of the letter of the law. Where the Spirit of the Lord is there is no bondage, no deadness, no entanglement of letters and regulations. Because Christ as the freeing Spirit is within us, we are free from the law, regulations, and dead letters.</p>
<p>As the liberating Spirit, He liberates us from all things that bind us. Paul tells us that whenever the heart turns to the Lord, the veil is taken away and that wherever the Spirit is, there is freedom (vv. 16-17). To be liberated, according to 2 Corinthians 3, is to have all our veils removed. He delivers us by taking away all the veils so that we can behold and reflect Christ with an unveiled face. When we are veiled, we are bound and imprisoned and do not have freedom. The Lord is the Spirit in our spirit (2 Tim. 4:22; Rom. 8:16). If we keep ourselves in the spirit, the veil is immediately gone. When the veil is gone, we are released. This freedom comes from the Spirit of the Lord. It is by the Spirit of the Lord that we look unto the Lord with an unveiled face to be transformed into His image from the Lord Spirit. We must turn our heart to the Lord, who is the Spirit, and set our mind on the mingled spirit; then the Spirit will free us that we may enjoy the full freedom in grace.</p>
<p>As the liberating Spirit, Christ liberates us from the letter of the law, from the letter of doctrines, teachings, and knowledge, and from regulations, rituals, religion, and culture. Religion, culture, doctrine, and knowledge confine us. On the one hand, they may restrain us from being wild; on the other hand, they actually bind us and even kill us spiritually. As the liberating Spirit, Christ is within us to liberate us from all bondage. Most Christians think that Christ liberates us from the outside by His power, but Paul indicates that as the liberating Spirit in us, Christ liberates us from within by being our life. The more we take Him as our life and person, the more we are liberated from all bondage.</p>
<p>The Spirit is the liberating Spirit. Where life is, there is always liberation. The more we grow in life, the more we become liberated. The more mature we become in life, the more we are freed from all kinds of bondage. The many habits that we have according to our flesh and our natural constitution are bondages. The liberating Spirit can free us from the bondage of our habits. Many of us are bound by religion and religious practices; hence, we need to experience the liberating Spirit. As we grow in life, we are released from our bondage. To enjoy the liberation of the Spirit to the uttermost, we need the growth in life.</p><h2 class="head4">b. The Lord Spirit</h2>
<p>Second Corinthians 3:18 says, &ldquo;We all with unveiled face, beholding and reflecting like a mirror the glory of the Lord, are being transformed into the same image from glory to glory, even as from the Lord Spirit.&rdquo; In this verse Paul speaks of the Lord Spirit. <em>The Lord Spirit</em> may be considered a compound title like <em>the Father God</em> and <em>the Lord Christ.</em> Again, this expression strongly proves and confirms that the Lord Christ is the Spirit and the Spirit is the Lord Christ.</p>
<p>The Lord Spirit is the transforming Spirit. He transforms us into the image of the Lord of glory from one degree of glory to another degree of glory. Today we should be constantly under this transforming work. Surely this experience of Christ as the Lord Spirit is full of enjoyment.</p>
<h2 class="head5">(1) Transforming Us into the Image of the Lord of Glory</h2>
<p>We are told in 2 Corinthians 3:18 that we are being transformed &ldquo;even as from the Lord Spirit.&rdquo; The preposition <em>from</em> here indicates that transformation is proceeding from the Spirit rather than being caused by Him. In order for the Spirit to do His transforming work in us, there is the need for a certain essence to be dispensed into us by the Spirit. Therefore, the Spirit is working in us to transform us in life, nature, essence, element, form, appearance, and every aspect of our being by dispensing the divine life, nature, element, and essence into us. This means that the divine life, nature, essence, element, and being are dispensed by the Spirit into our life, nature, essence, element, and being to cause a metabolic change within us. This change is organic, because it is a change in our being by another being, in our life by another life, in our nature by another nature, and in our element and essence by another element and essence. This transformation is from the Lord Spirit.</p>
<p>Christ as the Lord Spirit is now doing a transforming work within us as He imparts Himself into us as life. When we open to Him, behold Him, and reflect Him, we are under the process of transformation. All that He is, is transfused into our being. Through being transfused with what He is, we will be completely transformed. Today we are being transformed into His image from one stage of glory to another, until eventually we will be the same as He. This takes place only by means of Christ as the Lord Spirit.</p>
<p>The glory in 2 Corinthians 3:18 is the glory of Christ as the resurrected and ascended One, who as both God and man passed through incarnation, human living, and crucifixion, entered into resurrection, accomplished full redemption, and became a life-giving Spirit. As the life-giving Spirit, the resurrected Christ dwells in us to make Himself and all He has accomplished, obtained, and attained real to us, that we may be one with Him and may be transformed into His image from glory to glory. When we with unveiled face are beholding and reflecting the glory of the Lord, He infuses us with the elements of what He is and what He has done. Thus, we are being transformed metabolically to have His life shape by His life power with His life essence; that is, we are being transfigured, mainly by the renewing of our mind (Rom. 12:2), into His image. This transformation is from glory to glory, that is, from the Lord Spirit to the Lord Spirit. The Lord Spirit is upon the Lord Spirit. This means that the Lord Spirit as the rich supply is continually added into our being.</p>
<p>To be transformed is to have Christ added into our being to replace what we are so that Christ may increase and our natural life may decrease. As the process of transformation takes place within us, the old element of our natural being is carried away, and the glory, the resurrected Christ as the life-giving Spirit, is added into us to replace the natural element. The process of transformation is both organic and metabolic. It is organic because it is related to life, and it is metabolic because it is related to a process in which an old element is discharged and a new element is added.</p>
<p>There is a difference between change and transformation. Transformation involves the process of metabolism. However, something may change in an outward way without any inward metabolic transformation. In the process of metabolism a new element is supplied to an organism. This new element replaces the old element and causes it to be discharged. Therefore, as the process of metabolism takes place within a living organism, something new is added to it to replace the old element, which is carried away. Metabolism thus includes three matters: the supplying of a new element, the replacing of the old element with the new element, and the discharge or the removal of the old element so that something new may be produced.</p>
<p>Transformation is a metabolic process, a metabolic change. The Spirit&rsquo;s work in transforming us involves a change in our whole being&mdash;in life, nature, essence, element, form, and appearance. Transformation is not outward change, correction, or adjustment; transformation is altogether an inward, metabolic change of our being. Therefore, we may define transformation as a divine, spiritual metabolism wherein a new element is added to the old to discharge the old and to produce something new.</p>
<p>In 2 Corinthians 3:18 Paul tells us that we are in the process of being transformed into &ldquo;the same image.&rdquo; This is the image of the resurrected and glorified Christ. To be transformed into the same image is to be conformed to the resurrected and glorified Christ, to be made the same as He is (Rom. 8:29).</p>
<p>When we behold and reflect the glory of the Lord, He infuses us with the element of what He is and what He has done. In other words, He dispenses this element into us. The result is that we are being transformed metabolically to have His life shape by His life power with His life essence. We are then transformed into His image.</p>
<p>The constitution of life involves the life essence, the life power, and the life shape. Every kind of life has these three things&mdash;the essence, the power, and the shape. For example, a carnation flower has an essence and a power. Therefore, it is formed into a certain shape. As it grows with the life essence and by the life power, it is shaped into a particular form. It is the same with the divine life. This life has its essence, power, and shape. The shape of the divine life is the image of Christ. Thus, in 2 Corinthians 3:18 we have the thought of being transformed into the same image, the image of the resurrected and glorified Christ. This means that we will be shaped into the image of Christ. Based upon this fact and upon Paul&rsquo;s use of the word <em>transformed,</em> we may speak of being metabolically constituted into the image of Christ.</p><h2 class="head5">(2) From One Degree of Glory to Another</h2>
<p>In 2 Corinthians 3:18 Paul also tells us that we are being transformed into the same image &ldquo;from glory to glory.&rdquo; This means that we are being transformed from one degree of glory to another degree. This indicates an ongoing process of life in resurrection. Transformation does not happen once for all; rather, it is gradual, from one degree of glory to another. In the pathway of transformation, we proceed progressively from one level of glory to another level of glory. Transformation is a pathway of glory; it increases from one degree of glory to another degree of glory until we are transformed into the image of the firstborn Son of God.</p>
<p>We need to see that the glory is Christ blossoming in resurrection. When the Lord Jesus was on earth, He was God incarnate. God was concealed within the physical body of the Lord Jesus. Inwardly there was God; outwardly there was the flesh, and with this flesh there was no glory. In John 17:1 the Lord Jesus prayed, &ldquo;Father, the hour has come; glorify Your Son that the Son may glorify You.&rdquo; When the Lord Jesus prayed that the Father would glorify Him, He actually prayed that He would enter into glory through death and resurrection. In Luke 24:26 He asked the two disciples on the way to Emmaus, &ldquo;Was it not necessary for the Christ to suffer these things and enter into His glory?&rdquo; When the Lord Jesus spoke these words, He was already in resurrection. Thus, for Him to enter into His glory was for Him to be in resurrection. This verse reveals clearly that Christ&rsquo;s resurrection was His glorification.</p>
<p>We may use the blossoming of a carnation flower as an illustration of the glory in 2 Corinthians 3:18 being Christ&rsquo;s blossoming in resurrection. After a carnation seed is sown into the earth, the seed dies and then begins to grow up. It sprouts, grows into a plant, and eventually blossoms. This blossoming is the glorification of the carnation seed. Because a carnation seed dies when it is sown into the soil, we may say that its blossoming is its resurrection. Glorification, therefore, is equal to resurrection. Christ&rsquo;s resurrection was His blossoming. This blossoming Christ, the resurrected Christ, is glory.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the resurrected Christ as the glory is the life-giving Spirit. Therefore, we may go on to say that the glory in 3:18 is actually the life-giving Spirit. As previously mentioned, <em>from glory to glory</em> in verse 18 means from the Lord Spirit to the Lord Spirit, because in this verse the glory and the Spirit are synonyms. Therefore, to be transformed from glory to glory is to be transformed from the Spirit to the Spirit. Now we are in the process of being transformed from glory to glory. The more we live and walk in the life-giving Spirit, the more glory is added into our being, and the more we are transformed into the same image from glory to glory. To be transformed from glory to glory far surpasses a mere outward improvement of behavior according to religious or ethical teachings.</p>
<p>Today the glory is the resurrected Christ, and this Christ is the Spirit. This means that the Lord as the glory is the Spirit living in us and dwelling in our spirit. Now that we have the Spirit indwelling our spirit, we need to exercise our spirit more and more by praying, reading the Word, and calling on the name of the Lord. The more we exercise our spirit with an unveiled face, the more we will behold the Lord. As we are gazing on Him, we will also reflect Him. While we are beholding and reflecting Him in this way, His element will be added into our being. This new element will replace and discharge the element of our old, natural life, and we will experience transformation, a metabolic change.</p><h1 class="series">THE CONCLUSION<br />
OF THE NEW TESTAMENT</h1>

IN THE EPISTLES</h1>
<h1 class="title">(23)</h1>
<h2 class="head3">41. The Image of God and the Treasure</h2>
<p>Second Corinthians 4:4-7 shows that we may experience and enjoy Christ as the image of God and the treasure. The image of God refers to Christ as our outward expression, whereas the treasure refers to Christ as our inward content. We should bear Christ as the image of God without, and we should have Christ as the treasure within. We need to enter into the rich and full enjoyment of this Christ.</p>
<h2 class="head4">a. The Image of God</h2>
<p>In 2 Corinthians 4:4 Paul speaks of &ldquo;Christ, who is the image of God.&rdquo; The image of God is a subject that concerns a great many Bible teachers. It is exceedingly difficult to understand and to define the image of God. Twice the New Testament tells us that Christ is the image of God. Aside from the aforementioned verse, Paul refers to Christ as the image of God also in Colossians 1:15. The expression <em>the image of the invisible God</em> implies that although God Himself is invisible, His image is visible. The invisible God has a visible image, and this image is Christ. John 1:18 says, &ldquo;No one has ever seen God; the only begotten Son, who is in the bosom of the Father, He has declared Him.&rdquo; This means that Christ, the only begotten Son of God, came to man to express what God is. Christ being the image of God means that He is the expression of what God is. Although God is invisible, He is expressed by a living person, that is, Jesus Christ, the Son of God. This living person as the expression of God is the image of God.</p>
<h2 class="head5">(1) The Illumination of the Gospel of His Glory<br />
Shining in the Believers</h2>
<p>In 2 Corinthians 4:4 Paul says that &ldquo;the illumination of the gospel of the glory of Christ, who is the image of God, might not shine on them.&rdquo; This verse indicates that the terms <em>God, image, Christ, glory, gospel,</em> and <em>illumination</em> are all in apposition to one another; thus, they all refer to the same wonderful person. God is the image, the image is Christ, Christ is the glory, the glory is the gospel, and the gospel is the illumination. First, the expression <em>the image of God</em> shows that the image is in apposition to God. God, who is the source, has an image, and this image is simply God Himself. If we see the image of God, we see God; if God disappears, His image disappears as well. Since in verse 4 the image and God are in apposition to each other, they are one. Therefore, the image of God is nothing less than God Himself.</p>
<p>Second, as we have pointed out, the image of God is Christ. As the image of God, Christ is the expression of the invisible God. Third, Christ is the glory. This is confirmed by Hebrews 1:3, which says that Christ is the effulgence of God&rsquo;s glory. Fourth, Christ, the glory, is the gospel. Acts tells us that the believers preached Christ Jesus as the gospel (5:42; 8:35; 11:20; 17:18). This shows that the gospel is not something separate from Christ; rather, Christ is the gospel. Today some Christians in their preaching separate the gospel from Christ. But according to the divine revelation in the Bible, the gospel is a living person, Christ. Christ who is the gospel is the image of God, and the image of God is God. Therefore, the gospel is God Himself embodied and expressed in Christ.</p>
<p>Fifth, the gospel is the illumination, the enlightenment. The gospel is the gospel of the glory of Christ, which illuminates, radiates, and shines in the heart of man. When the gospel came to us, it came to us by shining, and this shining brought into us Christ, who is the image of the processed Triune God. As a result, Christ, the living person, was illuminated into our being. Many believers can testify that when they heard Christ as the gospel, a certain impression of Christ entered into them. Although they may try to reject this impression of Christ or erase it from their being, they cannot do it. Once the impression of Christ is illuminated into us, it remains within us forever. This illumination is the gospel, this gospel is the glory, this glory is Christ, Christ is the image of God, and as such, Christ is God. Therefore, what has been illuminated into our being is a living person, the Triune God embodied in Christ, who is the image, the expression, of God.</p>
<p>Furthermore, we need to see that the gospel of the glory of Christ first shines into us, and then it shines out from within us. The more the glory shines within us, the more it penetrates into our being and saturates it. Eventually, the inner glory will consume, swallow up, our entire inward being. Then the light of the gospel of the glory of Christ will shine out through us. Such a shining cannot come by way of teaching; it can come only through the experience of Christ who is Himself the glory of God and the manifestation of God. We praise the Lord that Christ has shone into the depths of our being, that now He is shining within us, and that He will shine throughout our inward being. Therefore, we need to pay attention to the inner shining of Christ as the glory within. The goal of God&rsquo;s economy is that we all shine forth His glory. As we are under such a shining, Christ saturates us with Himself, and we enjoy the sweetness of Christ living in us to be our life and our person.</p><h2 class="head5">(2) The Illumination of the Knowledge<br />
of the Glory of God Being in His Face</h2>
<p>Second Corinthians 4:4, speaking of &ldquo;the illumination of the gospel of the glory of Christ,&rdquo; refers to four matters: illumination, gospel, glory, and Christ. Verse 6 goes on to say, &ldquo;The God who said, Out of darkness light shall shine, is the One who shined in our hearts to illuminate the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ.&rdquo; God&rsquo;s shining in our hearts results in the illumination of the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ, that is, in the enlightenment that causes us to know the glory of the gospel of Christ. This illumination, the enlightenment, that makes the glory of Christ&rsquo;s gospel known to us, issues from the shining of God in our hearts. God&rsquo;s shining in the universe produced the old creation. His shining in our hearts has made us a new creation, because this shining brings into us, earthen vessels, the marvelous treasure of the Christ of glory.</p>
<p>The shining of God in our hearts is to illumine us that we may know the glory in Christ&rsquo;s face. The glory of God manifested in the face of Jesus Christ is the God of glory expressed through Jesus Christ, who is the effulgence of the glory of God (Heb. 1:3); to know Him is to know the God of glory. In particular, the illumination in 2 Corinthians 4:6, which refers to the shining of God&rsquo;s light on others out from those whose hearts have been enlightened by God, corresponds with the manifestation of the truth in verse 2 and is the same as the shining in Matthew 5:16 and Philippians 2:15. God shines in our hearts that we may shine on others so that they may have the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ, that is, the knowledge of Christ, who expresses and declares God (John 1:18).</p>
<p>God&rsquo;s shining in our hearts is in the face of Christ. In order to experience God&rsquo;s shining, we need to have direct, personal, God to shine in our hearts. God may shine upon us, but if we want Him to shine <em>in</em> us, we need to have direct, intimate contact with Him. This is the reason we call upon the name of the Lord Jesus. By calling on the Lord we are brought into face-to-face contact with Him and experience God&rsquo;s shining in our heart. Only when we have such direct, personal, and intimate contact with the Lord do we have the inner shining. Whenever we call on the Lord in a dear, intimate way, we are before His face, and the shining of God is in our heart. Then we may shine out what we have received for the shining of the glory of the gospel of Christ.</p>
<p>In our preaching of the gospel there should be an illumination, a shining. We need to preach the gospel in a very illuminating way. This means that while we are preaching, God shines into the hearts of those to whom we are speaking. We also need to help them to call on the name of the Lord Jesus in order that they would be brought to the face of Christ, have personal contact with Him, and experience God&rsquo;s shining in their hearts. To preach in this way is to present not merely a gospel of certain facts but a gospel of glory. Those who receive the gospel of glory will have Christ as the precious treasure dispensed into them. Then, like us, they will be earthen vessels containing this treasure.</p>
<h2 class="head4">b. The Treasure</h2>
<p>In 2 Corinthians 4:7 Paul says, &ldquo;We have this treasure in earthen vessels that the excellency of the power may be of God and not out of us.&rdquo; God&rsquo;s shining in our hearts brings into us a treasure, the Christ of glory, who is the embodiment of God to be our life and our everything. Because of the shining in our hearts, we have this treasure, a treasure that is wonderful, precious, and marvelous. The treasure in the weak earthen vessels is the very God in Christ shined into us. But we who contain this treasure are earthen vessels, worthless and fragile. A priceless treasure is contained in worthless vessels! This has made the worthless vessels ministers of the new covenant with a priceless ministry. This has been accomplished by the divine power in resurrection. The excellency of the power is surely of God and not out of us.</p>
<p>The treasure is the glorious Christ, the embodiment of God, becoming our life and everything to us. This treasure, the indwelling Christ, in us, the earthen vessels, is the divine source of the supply for the Christian life. It is by the excellent power of this treasure that the apostles as the ministers of the new covenant were capable of living a crucified life that the resurrection life of Christ, whom they ministered, might be manifested. Thus, they manifested the truth (v. 2) for the shining of the gospel.</p>
<p>The expression <em>this treasure</em> in verse 7 refers to verse 6, where Paul speaks of the face of Jesus Christ. The Greek word translated &ldquo;face&rdquo; in verse 6 is the same word translated &ldquo;person&rdquo; in 2:10, which refers to the part around the eyes, the look as the index of the inward thoughts and feelings, which shows forth and manifests the whole person. This indicates that unless we have the index of Christ&rsquo;s face, He cannot be a treasure to us in reality. We will not sense that we have a treasure within us until we see the face of Jesus Christ. On the one hand, we can all declare that we are the earthen vessels and that Christ is the treasure within us. On the other hand, we need to see that it is only when we are living in the presence of Christ, looking at the index of His being, that we will sense that He is a treasure to us. In the whole universe there is nothing that is more precious than beholding the face of Jesus Christ. The more we live in His presence, the more we will sense His presence.</p>
<p>If we learn to forsake our old person and instead take Christ as our person by looking at the index of His eyes and enjoying His presence, we will have a sweet sense of the preciousness of the indwelling Christ. This experience will cause us not only to be happy but also to shine; the glory of Christ will shine out from within us.</p><h2 class="head5">(1) In Earthen Vessels through<br />
God&rsquo;s Shining in the Illumination<br />
of the Gospel of the Glory of Christ</h2>
<p>The Christ of glory as the excellent treasure is received by the believers through the illumination of the gospel of the glory of Christ. We need to remember that we have within us the treasure, a living person who is more excellent than the world. Christ is the most excellent One in the whole universe; there is nothing that is more excellent than He. Since we have Christ as the treasure, the most excellent One and the most lovely One, we do not love the world. It is not that we should not love the world but that the world is inferior to the treasure, the excellent and lovely Christ. We treasure the Lord more than the world.</p>
<p>The illumination of the gospel of the glory of Christ, who is the image of Christ, has shined on us. The gospel of the glory of Christ in 4:4 corresponds with the knowledge of the glory of God in verse 6. We need to note that according to verse 6 the illumination of the knowledge of the glory of God is in the face of Jesus Christ. This indicates that the gospel preached by the apostle was not a doctrine, theology, or teaching; rather, it was a lovely person on whose face we can see the glory of God, the image of God. When we experience the glory of God shining in the face of Jesus Christ, this shining brings into us Christ as the image of God. We are attracted to such a Christ.</p>
<h2 class="head5">(2) That the Excellency of the Power May Be of God</h2>
<p>In 2 Corinthians 4:7 Paul goes on to say &ldquo;that the excellency of the power may be of God and not out of us.&rdquo; The Greek word for <em>excellency</em> also means &ldquo;transcendence, surpassingness, and exceeding greatness.&rdquo; The fact that we are earthen vessels proves that the excellency of the power is of God and not out of us. In ourselves we are nothing more than earthen vessels; we are sinful, fallen, and low. As such, we do not have the power to manifest the truth and shine forth the glory of the gospel. The excellency of the power is not out of us&mdash;it is of God. Although we are worthless earthen vessels, God has shined this precious treasure into us. Now this treasure becomes the source of the power energizing us and enabling us to shine forth God&rsquo;s glory and to manifest the truth.</p>
<p>We need to see that Christ as the marvelous treasure in earthen vessels empowers and energizes us from within. He supplies us continually with the excelling power through His dispensing, thereby constituting us, the worthless and weak vessels, as ministers of a new covenant (3:6). As believers, we have Christ operating within us as a living and active treasure. This treasure even constrains us to do certain things (5:14). This treasure is the power, the source of strength, for the apostles to behave themselves in such a way as to shine the gospel and manifest the truth.</p>
<p>We are the earthen vessels to contain the Christ of glory as the excellent treasure. These vessels are like today&rsquo;s camera, into which Christ the figure enters through the flash of God&rsquo;s shining. The shining reality of Christ is the treasure in us, the earthen vessels. Outwardly we are earthen vessels, but inwardly we have a priceless treasure&mdash;Christ as the embodiment of the processed Triune God to be the all-inclusive life-giving Spirit. This treasure has a power, and this power is excellent. Christ as the life-giving Spirit in us is the One who shines and works. This is the treasure we have in us.</p>
<p>Within us, we have Christ as an excellent treasure; outside us, we bear Christ as the image of God, the embodiment and expression of the Triune God. According to Hebrews 1:3, Christ is the effulgence of God&rsquo;s glory; that is, He is the expression of the image of God. When we believed in the Lord Jesus, we received more than simply a Redeemer; we received the most excellent One, the highest excellence, in the universe. Through the shining of the gospel, Christ was illuminated into our being. Now Christ, the embodiment and expression of the Triune God, is in us. Within us, Christ is the excellent treasure; outside us, He is the image, the expression, of God. Daily we need to experience and enjoy Christ as the treasure within and the image of God without.</p><h1 class="series">THE CONCLUSION<br />

<h1 class="title">(24)</h1>
<h2 class="head3">42. The Sphere and Element of the New Creation</h2>
<p>Second Corinthians 5:14-17 reveals Christ as the sphere and element of the new creation. According to the context of chapter 4, the new creation in 5:17 is composed of those who have Christ as the treasure within and bear Christ as the image of God without. The realm of resurrection is the sphere of the new creation, and Christ as the life-giving Spirit is the germinating element of the new creation.</p>
<h2 class="head4">a. The One Who Loved Us Having Died<br />
and Having Been Raised for Us</h2>
<p>Second Corinthians 5:14 and 15 say, &ldquo;The love of Christ constrains us because we have judged this, that One died for all, therefore all died; and He died for all that those who live may no longer live to themselves but to Him who died for them and has been raised.&rdquo; The phrase <em>have judged this</em> in verse 14 means &ldquo;have concluded,&rdquo; probably at the time of conversion. Paul concluded that because One died on behalf of all, &ldquo;therefore all died.&rdquo; Christ&rsquo;s loving death was the motivating factor of the apostles&rsquo; being constrained to live a loving life for Him. Since Christ died as our Substitute, suffering the sentence of death on behalf of us all, in the eyes of God we all died. Hence, we do not need to die in the way as has been reserved for men to die and face judgment (Heb. 9:27). Moreover, Christ died on behalf of all so that we may no longer live to ourselves, but to Him. Christ&rsquo;s death not only saves us from death so that we do not need to die, but it also causes us, through His resurrection, to live no longer to ourselves but to Him.</p>
<p>According to 2 Corinthians 5:14-15, Christ is the One who loved us, died for us, and was raised up for us. The death and resurrection of Christ show His love toward us. This love constrains us to live not to ourselves but to Him. Many of us can testify that we have Christ as the treasure within us and that we love Him. Yet at times we may be reluctant to go along with Him because certain things in the world distract us from the Lord. At such times, however, the constraining love of Christ appears to us, causing us to see that the most excellent One loves us and that He died and has been raised for us. Such love constrains us to the uttermost. It is this love&mdash;not a mere teaching, religion, or ritual&mdash;that constrains us to drop so many distracting things in the world.</p>
<h2 class="head4">b. His Love Constraining Us<br />
to Live Not to Ourselves but to Him</h2>
<h2 class="head5">(1) His Love Constraining Us</h2>
<p>The constraining love of Christ in 2 Corinthians 5:14 is the love which was manifested on the cross through His death for us. The Greek word rendered &ldquo;constrains&rdquo; means &ldquo;to press on...from all sides, to hold...to one end, to forcibly limit, to confine to one object within certain bounds, to shut up to one line and purpose&rdquo; (as in a narrow, walled road). The same Greek word is used in Luke 4:38, 12:50, Acts 18:5, and Philippians 1:23. In such a way the apostles were constrained by the love of Christ to live to Him.</p>
<p>Today we also are constrained by Christ&rsquo;s love toward us. This love surely limits us, confines us to a narrow way, toward the unique goal&mdash;Christ Himself. We need to be impressed with the fact that to be constrained by the love of Christ means to be pressed by it from all sides and held by it to one end. When we are thus constrained, we are limited, as if walking on a narrow, walled road, and we are forced to go in a certain direction. Although we love the Lord, we are not always willing to take His way. Had we not been walled in by Him, we probably would have escaped from Him. But the love of Christ constrains us; it presses us from every side and holds us to one goal. We have no other way; there is no other way for us to take. Actually, this is not our choice. If the choice had truly been ours, we would have probably been somewhere else today. No, it is not up to us to make the choice; rather, it is the love of Christ that constrains us. We are constrained by the Lord&rsquo;s love to live to Him.</p>
<p>We must be persons carried away by the love of Christ. In 2 Corinthians 5:14-15 Paul indicates that Christ&rsquo;s loving death is like the rushing of great waters toward us, impelling us to live to Him beyond our own control. To be constrained is similar to being carried away by a tide of water. The love of Christ is as strong as a tide of water which overcomes us and carries us away. We need to be flooded by the love of Christ. We need to be constrained by His love so that we have no choice. We should be able to say, &ldquo;I have no other way to go. I must love the Lord because His love has constrained me.&rdquo; When the flood waters come, we do not have a choice as to whether we will receive them or not; they give us no choice. We must all be constrained by the love of Christ in such a way.</p>
<p>We need to pray day by day that the Lord would show us His love so that we would be constrained by the love of Christ. We all need to pray to the Lord: &ldquo;Constrain me with Your love. O Lord, flood me with Your love.&rdquo; Although we may be at some crossroads in our Christian experience and may have choices, once we are flooded by the love of Christ, we will lose all our choices.</p><h2 class="head5">(2) To Live Not to Ourselves but to Him</h2>
<p>In 2 Corinthians 5:14-15 the apostle Paul puts together Christ&rsquo;s constraining love with our living to Him, indicating that because we love Christ, we live to Him, not to ourselves. It is quite meaningful that in verse 15 Paul does not say, &ldquo;No longer live for themselves but for Him&rdquo;; rather, he says, &ldquo;No longer live to themselves but to Him.&rdquo; Living to the Lord is deeper in significance than living for the Lord. Living for the Lord implies that I and the Lord are still two; living to the Lord indicates that I am one with the Lord, as the wife is one with the husband in married life.</p>
<p>To live to the Lord means that we are under the Lord&rsquo;s direction and control and that we desire to fulfill His requirements, satisfy His desires, and complete what He intends. Worldly people live to themselves. But the love of Christ constrains us to live to Him and not to ourselves. To live to ourselves means that we are under our own control, direction, and governing and that we care for our own aims and goals. This is to live not only for ourselves; it is to live to ourselves. But the apostles had the single ambition of pleasing the Lord by living to Him (v. 9). They were absolutely under the Lord. They were under His direction, control, and governing. Everything they did was to fulfill the Lord&rsquo;s purpose and desire. As such persons, they did not live to the law, to themselves, or to anything other than the Lord.</p>
<p>Paul did not live to himself but to his Master, Christ. He was different from the rabbis who lived to the law and did everything with a view to the law. Paul&rsquo;s only aim was to please his Master. Paul sought to please the Lord not by doing a work but by living to Him in every aspect of his daily life. Likewise, we should not seek to please ourselves but seek to please the Lord by living to Him. All that we do must be to Him. Since we are to the Lord, our time and money are also to Him. Nothing is for ourselves, because none of us lives to himself but to Him.</p>
<p>Moreover, if we consider the context, we will see that to live to the Lord in 5:15 means to live the kind of life the Lord Jesus lived. In chapter 4 we see that the apostles experienced the putting to death of Jesus (v. 10). When we experience the putting to death of Jesus, we can live the kind of life Jesus lived. This is to live to the Lord.</p>
<p>To live to the Lord is to live a crucified life. It is to live in such a way that the outward man is always put to death. The Lord Jesus lived this kind of life, and those who live such a life today are living to the Lord. This understanding of living to the Lord is according to the concept conveyed in chapter 4.</p>
<p>Christians often try to live for the Lord according to their own concepts. We may do many things for the Lord instead of to the Lord. What the Lord wants is not that we be so active for Him. He wants us to experience the putting to death of Jesus so that our natural man and our active being may be terminated. Many are active or aggressive for the Lord in a natural way. They do things for Him by their natural aggressiveness. This offends the Lord, and it distracts us from enjoying Him. Therefore, what we need is to be constrained by the Lord&rsquo;s love simply to live to Him.</p>
<p>If we would live to the Lord, we must deny our outward man. The outward man is the flesh. When we live to Christ, we do not live by our outward man, by our flesh. This means that living to Christ requires that we live by our inward man, by our regenerated spirit. Living to Christ in 2 Corinthians 5:15 is equal to walking according to the spirit in Romans 8:4.</p>
<h2 class="head4">c. Anyone Who Is in Him Being a New Creation</h2>
<p>Second Corinthians 5:17 says, &ldquo;So then if anyone is in Christ, he is a new creation.&rdquo; Anyone who is in Christ is a new creation. To be in Christ is to be one with Him in life and in nature. This is of God through our faith in Christ (1 Cor. 1:30; Gal. 3:26-28). The old creation includes the heavens, the earth, billions of items, and mankind, but the new creation includes only the chosen and redeemed people of God. God&rsquo;s people once were the old creation. But when Christ as the life-giving Spirit entered into us, we were germinated with the Triune God to become the new creation.</p>
<p>The new creation was created by God with Christ as the embodiment of the divine life. Hence, the material for the new creation is the divine life. Anyone who is in Christ is a new creation because God&rsquo;s life has entered into him. Before our regeneration we did not have the divine life, but through regeneration God imparted Himself into us and became our life. Thus, we became the embodiment of Christ. He has been born into us as our life. In this way we have become a new creation.</p>
<p>The new creation is actually the old creation transformed by the divine life, by the processed Triune God. The old creation is old because God is not part of it; the new creation is new because God is in it. We who have been regenerated by the Spirit of God are still God&rsquo;s creation, but we are now His new creation. However, this is real only when we live and walk by the Spirit. Whenever we live and walk by the flesh, we are in the old creation, not in the new creation. Anything in our daily life that does not have God in it is the old creation, but what has God in it is part of the new creation.</p>
<p>If we would be in the new creation, we must enter into an organic union with the Triune God. Apart from such a union we shall remain in the old creation. But now, by the organic union with the Triune God, we are in the new creation. As believers in Christ, we are the new creation through an organic union with the Triune God. In Adam we were born into the old creation, but in Christ we were regenerated into the new creation.</p>
<h2 class="head4">d. The Old Things Having Passed Away<br />
and Having Become New</h2>
<p>Second Corinthians 5:17 goes on to say, &ldquo;The old things have passed away; behold, they have become new.&rdquo; The old things of the flesh have passed away through the death of Christ, and all has become new in Christ&rsquo;s resurrection. The words <em>behold, they have become new</em> are a call to watch the marvelous change of the new creation. The word <em>they</em> in verse 17 refers to the old things. The old creation does not have the divine life and nature; however, the new creation, composed of the believers born again of God, does have the divine life and nature (John 1:13; 3:15; 2 Pet. 1:4). Hence, the believers are a new creation, not according to the old nature of the flesh but according to the new nature of the divine life.</p><h1 class="series">THE CONCLUSION<br />

<h2 class="head3">43. The Means of Reconciliation</h2>
<p>Second Corinthians 5:18-21 reveals the complete reconciliation of the believers to God, and Christ as the means of this reconciliation. This portion of the word shows three classes of people: the apostles who have been fully reconciled to God, sinners, and believers who have not been fully reconciled to God.</p>
<h2 class="head4">a. Through Him God Having Reconciled<br />
the Apostles to Himself</h2>
<p>In 2 Corinthians 5:18 Paul says, &ldquo;God...has reconciled us to Himself through Christ and has given to us the ministry of reconciliation.&rdquo; This verse indicates that, through Christ, God had fully reconciled the apostles to Himself and that they were then sent to reconcile sinners to God and to reconcile believers to God in full. Because the apostles had been brought back to God, they had the ministry of reconciling others to God. In this way, the apostles were commissioned with the ministry of reconciliation, a ministry to bring others fully back to God.</p>
<h2 class="head4">b. In Him God Reconciling the World to Himself</h2>
<p>In 2 Corinthians 5:19 Paul says, &ldquo;God in Christ was reconciling the world to Himself, not accounting their offenses to them, and has put in us the word of reconciliation.&rdquo; On the one hand, God was reconciling the world to Himself in Christ. On the other hand, God carries out this work of reconciliation through the apostles who are fully reconciled to God through Christ.</p>
<h2 class="head4">c. On Behalf of Him the Apostles<br />
Beseeching the Believers to Be Reconciled to God</h2>
<p>In 2 Corinthians 5:20 Paul goes on to say, &ldquo;On behalf of Christ then we are ambassadors, as God entreats you through us; we beseech you on behalf of Christ, Be reconciled to God.&rdquo; In verse 19 it was the world that was reconciled to God; in verse 20 it is the believers, who have already been reconciled to God and are to be reconciled further to God. This clearly indicates that two steps are required for men to be fully reconciled to God. The first step is to reconcile sinners to God from sin. For this purpose Christ died for our sins (1 Cor. 15:3) that they might be forgiven by God. This is the objective aspect of Christ&rsquo;s death. In this aspect He bore our sins on the cross that they might be judged by God upon Him for us. The second step is to reconcile believers living in the natural life to God from the flesh. For this purpose Christ died for us&mdash;the persons&mdash;that we might live to Him in the resurrection life (2 Cor. 5:14-15). This is the subjective aspect of Christ&rsquo;s death. In this aspect He was made sin for us to be judged and done away with by God that we might become the righteousness of God in Him. By the two aspects of His death He has fully reconciled God&rsquo;s chosen people to God.</p>
<p>These two steps of reconciliation are clearly portrayed by the two veils of the tabernacle. In ancient times, when the children of Israel came to contact God, they needed to pass through two veils in order to enter the Holy of Holies. The first veil is called &ldquo;the screen,&rdquo; which was the curtain at the entrance of the tabernacle, that is, the entrance to the Holy Place (Exo. 26:36). A sinner who was brought to God through the reconciliation of the propitiating blood entered into the Holy Place by passing this screen. This typifies the first step of reconciliation. The second veil (vv. 31-35; Heb. 9:3) still separated him from God, who was in the Holy of Holies. This veil needed to be rent that the sinner might be brought to God in the Holy of Holies. This is the second step of reconciliation. According to Hebrews 10:20, the second veil within the tabernacle typifies the flesh. The Corinthian believers have been reconciled to God, having passed through the first veil and having entered into the Holy Place. Yet they still lived in the flesh. They needed to pass the second veil to enter into the Holy of Holies to live with God in their spirit (1 Cor. 6:17). On the one hand, the veil&mdash;their flesh, their natural being, and their natural life&mdash;had been already split, rent, by God in the crucifixion of Christ (Matt. 27:51; Heb. 10:20). On the other hand, the reconciling Spirit was working on them in order to bring them through the veil into the Holy of Holies. The goal of this Epistle was to bring them there that they might be persons in the spirit (1 Cor. 2:15), in the Holy of Holies. This was what the apostle meant by saying, &ldquo;Be reconciled to God.&rdquo; This was to present them full-grown in Christ (Col. 1:28).</p>
<p>In the Old Testament, when a sinner came to God, he first had to come to the altar to have his sins forgiven through the blood of the sin offering. After experiencing the forgiveness of sins, he could enter the Holy Place. This is the first step of reconciliation, the step by which a sinner begins to be reconciled to God. This is the situation of most genuine Christians today. They have been reconciled to God in part through the cross upon which Christ died as their sin offering, where He shed His blood to wash away their sins. When they believed in Him, they were forgiven by God, reconciled to God, and brought back to Him. Formerly, they went astray from God. But through repentance they returned to Him and have been reconciled to Him. However, they have been reconciled to God only partly.</p>
<p>Although the believers have been saved and reconciled to God partly, they still live in the flesh; that is, they live in the soul, in the natural life. The veil of the flesh, of the natural man, still separates them from God. This means that their natural being is a separating veil. Therefore, they need the second step of reconciliation, the step in which the separating veil of the flesh is crucified so that they may enter into the Holy of Holies.</p>
<p>The blessings of God can be found in the Holy Place, but God Himself is in the Holy of Holies. Formerly, as sinners, we were outside the tabernacle. Yet when we believed in the Lord, we came into the Holy Place. Now in order to have God Himself, we need to be reconciled further by the Lord and come into the Holy of Holies. This is full reconciliation, which brings us not only out of sin but also out of the flesh, the natural man, the natural being. Then we are brought to God and become one with Him.</p>
<p>As those who have been reconciled to Him in the first step, we love the Lord and serve Him. However, we may love and serve Him in a natural way. Furthermore, we may be very active in the church life, but our living in the church is natural. This means that we live and have our being in a natural way. Therefore, God works through Christ to reconcile us to Himself in a fuller, deeper way. He exposes our natural life and unveils our real situation to us so that we may condemn our natural being and apply the cross subjectively. Then as our natural man is crossed out, we experience the second step of reconciliation. In this step the veil of our natural man is rent so that we may be in the Holy of Holies, living in God&rsquo;s presence.</p>
<p>The first veil signifies Christ&rsquo;s objective death: He died for our sins (1 Cor. 15:3). But the second veil signifies Christ&rsquo;s subjective death: When He died, He died with us and we died with Him (Gal. 2:20). Now we need to realize that we are terminated persons. As such, we should no longer live to ourselves, but instead we should live to Christ. We should experience the rending of our flesh. This means that according to Galatians 5:24, we should crucify the flesh. This is to have the veil torn and thereby experience Christ&rsquo;s subjective death in dealing with the flesh.</p>
<p>The second step of reconciliation is much deeper than the first step, because it takes place not in the outer court outside the tabernacle but within the Holy Place inside the tabernacle. Instead of taking place once for all, this kind of reconciliation is continuous. If you consider your experience, you will realize that no matter how long you have been a seeking Christian, you still have the sense deep within that you are separated from God&rsquo;s presence by something, mainly by your natural life, your old man, your self. You may be very good, nice, pious, holy, and spiritual, yet you know that there is still something separating you from God&rsquo;s presence. You are not fully one with God or altogether in harmony with Him. Instead, because you are still separated from Him, you need the second step of reconciliation. You need the application of the subjective death of Christ to your situation. In other words, the subjective death of Christ needs to be applied to your natural life. This application of the subjective death of Christ crucifies your natural life, rending the veil that separates you from God&rsquo;s inner presence.</p>
<p>If we are sincere and honest with God in our seeking of Him, we will realize that this is our situation. This is the reason that often we begin our prayer with confession. We may say: &ldquo;Father, I confess that I am still separated from You. In a sense I am with You, but in a deeper sense I am not with You. I am separated from You not by something sinful but by my natural life. Father, forgive me, and grant mercy to me that I may apply the subjective death of Christ to my inward being to such an extent that my natural life will be thoroughly crucified.&rdquo; This is to experience the rending of the veil within us so that, through the rent veil of the natural life, we may be reconciled to the inner presence of God the Father.</p><h2 class="head4">d. God Making Him Sin for Us That<br />
We Might Become God&rsquo;s Righteousness in Him</h2>
<p>In 2 Corinthians 5:21 Paul says, &ldquo;Him who did not know sin He made sin on our behalf that we might become the righteousness of God in Him.&rdquo; According to this verse, God made Christ sin for us that we might become the righteousness of God in Him. This indicates that eventually those who have been brought back to God in the Holy of Holies will enjoy Christ to the uttermost and even become the righteousness of God in Him. In the organic union with Christ, those who have been reconciled to God in the second step become the very righteousness of God.</p>
<p>As we have pointed out, Christ not only died for our sins that we might be forgiven of our sins; He also was made sin for us that we might become the righteousness of God in Christ. Many of today&rsquo;s Christians know only that Christ died for their sins. They do not realize that Christ died for them as the flesh, as the old creation. In 2 Corinthians Paul does not speak of Christ dying for our sins. Instead, in 5:14 he says, &ldquo;One died for all.&rdquo; This means that Christ died for us. In 1 Corinthians 15:3 Paul tells us that Christ died for our sins. In order that our sins might be forgiven by God, Christ died for our sins. This, however, is simply the initial stage of reconciliation. Christ died on the cross not only for our sins, but He died also for us, for our flesh, our natural being, our outward man. Christ died on the cross so that our outward man, our natural being, may be terminated in order that we may become God&rsquo;s righteousness. Therefore, Christ died for our sins in order that we may be forgiven and justified by God. Furthermore, Christ died for us so that we may become God&rsquo;s righteousness.</p>
<p>Christ did not know sin in an experiential way by contact or personal experience. Nevertheless, He was made sin on our behalf that we might become the righteousness of God in Him. Sin came from Satan, who rebelled against God (Isa. 14:12-14). This sin, which came out of the evil one, entered into man (Rom. 5:12) and made man not only a sinner but sin itself under God&rsquo;s judgment. Hence, when Christ became a man in the flesh (John 1:14), He was made sin (not sinful) on our behalf to be judged by God (Rom. 8:3) that we might become God&rsquo;s righteousness in Him.</p>
<p>Righteousness issues from God for His administration (Psa. 89:14; 97:2; Isa. 32:1). This righteousness is Christ to be our righteousness (1 Cor. 1:30), making us God&rsquo;s righteousness in Him (not making us righteous before God). Through Christ&rsquo;s redemption, man, who is a sinner and is even sin, is made God&rsquo;s righteousness, being reconciled to the righteous God, and is made a new creation living to God for His eternal purpose. The apostles are commissioned to minister such a Christ, with all the glorious issues of His marvelous achievement, to His believers, who are the members that form His Body.</p>
<p>The expression <em>in Him</em> in 2 Corinthians 5:21 means in union with Him not only positionally but also organically in resurrection. We were enemies of God (Col. 1:21) by becoming sin, which came from Satan, who rebelled against God. Christ was made sin for us by becoming one with us through being incarnated in the flesh. Through His death He was condemned in the flesh as sin for us by God that we might be one with Him in His resurrection to be God&rsquo;s righteousness. By this righteousness we, the enemies of God, could be and have been reconciled to God (2 Cor. 5:18-20; Rom. 5:10). In the organic union with Christ, those who have been brought back to God in the Holy of Holies are made the righteousness of God. They not only become righteous; they are the righteousness of God. This means that they not only become righteous persons, but they become righteousness itself.</p>
<p>Before we were saved, we were in a condition that was altogether condemned by God. Nothing was right, and God could by no means justify the condition we were in. But after we were saved, we were brought into a state where we could be justified by God. This is righteousness. However, if we are honest, we shall admit that, on the one hand, we are in a righteous condition, but on the other hand, certain things related to our living still are not right. These things may not be comparable to the gross sin that may have been in our living before we were saved. Nevertheless, there are matters which are not right. In particular, there is still the separation between us and God caused by our natural man, our self. This is sin.</p>
<p>In 2 Corinthians 5:21 Paul says that Christ was made sin on our behalf so that we might become God&rsquo;s righteousness in Him. Sin here is actually synonymous with the flesh. John 1:14 says that Christ as the Word became flesh. Second Corinthians 5:21 says that He was made sin. According to Romans 8:3, God sent His Son in the likeness of the flesh of sin. Thus, sin and the flesh are synonyms. Furthermore, since the flesh is our outward man, then the outward man is totally sin. We ourselves, our natural being, are nothing but sin. For Christ to be made flesh in His incarnation was equal to His being made sin. This also means that He was made us. When He was crucified, He brought our natural man&mdash;the outward man, the flesh, and sin&mdash;to the cross and nailed it there. That was the time God condemned sin, the flesh, and the outward man. When Christ died on the cross, God condemned our natural man. God&rsquo;s goal in doing this was that we may become in Christ the righteousness of God. The resurrected Christ is righteousness, resurrection, and the life-giving Spirit. In such a One, we may become the righteousness of God. This is the ultimate consummation of God&rsquo;s salvation.</p>
<p>God desires to have a people on earth who are not only righteous persons; He wants a people who, in the sight of God, the devil, the angels, and the demons, are the righteousness of God. To be made righteous before God is one thing; to be God&rsquo;s righteousness is another thing. To become the righteousness of God is the highest enjoyment of the Triune God in Christ.</p>
<p>In Adam we fell so low that we became sin. Not only were we sinful before God&mdash;we became sin itself. But now in Christ we, having been brought thoroughly back to God, may enjoy Christ to such an extent that in Him we become God&rsquo;s righteousness. What a reconciliation! To have this enjoyment is to be on the peak of God&rsquo;s salvation, to be on the peak of our holy Zion.</p>
<h2 class="head4">e. Our Becoming His Ambassadors</h2>
<p>In 2 Corinthians 5:20 Paul says, &ldquo;On behalf of Christ then we are ambassadors, as God entreats you through us; we beseech you on behalf of Christ, Be reconciled to God.&rdquo; According to this verse, the ambassadors of Christ are one with God; they are like God, and they entreat as God. Their word is God&rsquo;s word, and what they do is God&rsquo;s doing. Furthermore, the expression <em>on behalf of Christ</em> means &ldquo;representing Christ.&rdquo; As those who represent Christ, the apostles were ambassadors of Christ doing a reconciling work. Just as an ambassador is a person authorized to represent his government, the apostles were authorized by Christ to represent Him to do the work of reconciliation. They were one with Christ and one with God; Christ was one with them, and God also was one with them. God, Christ, and the apostles were one in carrying out the ministry of reconciliation.</p>
<p>An ambassador of Christ is one who represents God, the highest authority in the universe. God has given all authority in heaven and on earth to Christ (Matt. 28:18). God has appointed Christ to be the Lord of all, the King of kings and the Lord of lords (Acts 2:36; 10:36; 1 Tim. 6:15; Rev. 17:14; 19:16). Today Jesus is the Christ, the Lord of all, and the highest authority. The Lord needs some ambassadors on earth who are qualified to represent Him (Matt. 28:19). The highest authority is Christ as the Head, and we as members of the Body must be representatives of the Head, His ambassadors.</p>
<p>According to 2 Corinthians 5:20, Paul and his co-workers who were fully reconciled to God were the ambassadors of Christ. Paul&rsquo;s use of the word <em>ambassadors</em> indicates that the apostles were commissioned with a definite ministry, to represent Christ to accomplish God&rsquo;s purpose. They had experienced both steps of reconciliation and therefore were in the Holy of Holies. They then sought to bring others not only from the outer court into the tabernacle but also to bring them from the Holy Place into the Holy of Holies.</p>
<p>Only those who have been fully reconciled to God in both steps can be the ambassadors of Christ. The ambassadors of Christ are those who have passed through the second veil and have entered into the Holy of Holies, where they come forward to the throne of grace to be one with God (Heb. 4:16). Because they are one with God, they are qualified to be sent by God as His ambassadors. Only one who has passed through both veils, who is fully reconciled to God and is thus absolutely one with God, can be His ambassador, representing God with full authority. Such a person is fully authorized by God to deal with all things related to God&rsquo;s kingdom on earth. We need to experience and enjoy Christ as the means of reconciliation to the fullest extent so that we may become His ambassadors.</p><h1 class="series">THE CONCLUSION<br />
OF THE NEW TESTAMENT</h1>
<h1 class="msg">MESSAGE THREE HUNDRED TWENTY</h1>
<h1 class="title">EXPERIENCING AND ENJOYING CHRIST<br />
IN THE EPISTLES</h1>
<h1 class="title">(26)</h1>
<h2 class="head3">44. The Factor of Grace</h2>
<p>Second Corinthians 8:9 indicates that we may experience and enjoy Christ as the factor of grace. &ldquo;You know the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, that though He was rich, for your sakes He became poor in order that you, because of His poverty, might become rich.&rdquo; He is the factor of grace because He, being rich, became poor for us that by His poverty we might become rich. As the factor of grace, Christ, being rich, became poor in order to give Himself to us to be our grace.</p>
<h2 class="head4">a. It Being of Grace That He<br />
Being Rich Became Poor for Us</h2>
<p>It is of grace that the Lord Jesus, being rich, became poor for us. In the same principle, it is a grace to others that we would sacrifice our material riches for their sake. Apparently, the Lord Jesus becoming poor has nothing to do with the ministry of material supply to needy saints. Actually, if the Lord Jesus had not become poor, we could not have Him as our grace. Suppose the Lord Jesus had never come into humanity. How, then, could He be our life? How could He be the grace working within us, motivating, strengthening, and supplying us to carry on a ministry to the needy saints? This would be impossible. It is crucial for us to realize that Christ can work in us today only because He became poor. His becoming poor for our sakes should be an example. On the one hand, He is the life within us; on the other hand, He is the pattern, the example, outwardly. The life of the Lord within us is the life of the One who, being rich, became poor. As such a One who is both our life and pattern, Christ is grace to us. We need to receive grace from the Lord Jesus. Then this grace will enable us to do what the Lord Jesus did: to become poor for others. Even though we may be in deep poverty, we still have something to share with needy saints. We have the life within to become poor for others, and we have the outward pattern to follow. We should receive this grace.</p>
<h2 class="head4">b. That We by His Poverty Might Become Rich</h2>
<p>By becoming poor, Christ gave Himself to us to be our riches. If He had never lived in Nazareth in that poor environment to be a poor carpenter, how could He be our riches? This is all grace. By grace, Christ lowered Himself and left His position for our sake. He gave up His riches so that we may become rich. We can do such a thing only through the grace of Christ. If we take His grace as our enjoyment, spontaneously we will do the same thing Christ did&mdash;become poor for others. Actually, we will not be the ones who do this, but it will be Christ living in us.</p>
<h2 class="head3">45. The Factor of Human Virtues</h2>
<p>In 2 Corinthians 10:1 and 11:10 Christ is revealed as the factor of human virtues.</p>
<h2 class="head4">a. The Apostle, Being Firmly Attached to Him<br />
and One with Him, Living and<br />
Behaving by Him in His Human Virtues</h2>
<p>The apostle Paul was firmly attached to Christ and was one with Christ. Thus, as the ambassador of Christ, he lived and behaved by Christ in His human virtues, such as meekness, forbearance, and truthfulness. In human society some of the best human virtues are meekness, gentleness, and truthfulness; everyone appreciates a meek, forbearing, and truthful person. In Christ we see all the attributes of God and all the human virtues, because for His constitution is a composition of the divine nature with its divine attributes and the human nature with its human virtues. When Christ was on this earth, He not only expressed God in His divine attributes, such as love, light, holiness, and righteousness; He also expressed the human virtues in His uplifted humanity, such as meekness, gentleness, and truthfulness.</p>
<p>In a very real sense, God does not need to be meek or gentle. However, when Christ was on earth, He lived as a man under all manner of persecution and trouble. He was very meek and gentle, continually bearing people in a meek way.</p>
<p>Christ&rsquo;s meekness is seen in the way He entered Jerusalem, as described in Matthew 21:1-11. He was &ldquo;meek and mounted on a donkey, and on a colt, a foal of a beast of burden&rdquo; (v. 5). This signifies the meek and lowly state in which the Lord was willing to present Himself. The donkey and the colt together give an impression of meekness. If the Lord had been mounted only on a donkey, the impression of meekness would not have been so striking. The significance of the Lord&rsquo;s being mounted on a donkey and on a colt is not smallness but meekness. Christ, the heavenly King, did not come with haughty splendor but with gentle, humble meekness. He did not ride into Jerusalem proudly on a horse; rather, He came mounted on a little donkey, even a small colt. No earthly king would do such a thing. The Lord Jesus, however, came to be a meek King. In reality He was the heavenly King, but He had no intention to come as a great king fighting or competing with others. Instead, He came as a meek King who did not fight against anyone or compete with anyone. This is the meekness of Christ.</p>
<p>Furthermore, in His dealing with people, Christ was always full of truthfulness. He did not express any kind of crookedness; rather, He expressed only truthfulness. Therefore, He said, &ldquo;Let your word be, Yes, yes; No, no; for anything more than these is of the evil one&rdquo; (5:37). Paul had the meekness, gentleness, and truthfulness of Christ because the apostle, being firmly attached to such a Christ as the factor of human virtues, lived and behaved by Christ in His human virtues.</p><h2 class="head4">b. Meekness to Give In to Others and<br />
Gentleness to Bear Others</h2>
<p>In 2 Corinthians 10:1 Paul says that he entreats the Corinthian believers through the meekness and gentleness of Christ. Because Paul lived Christ, the virtues of Christ became his. The phrase <em>through the meekness and gentleness of Christ</em> indicates that Paul was one with Christ and that he took Christ as his life. Therefore, he entreated the believers not by himself but through the virtues of Christ, particularly through Christ&rsquo;s meekness and forbearance. Paul entreated others by Christ, in Christ, and with Christ.</p>
<p>All the virtues of Christ were becoming Paul&rsquo;s virtues. Meekness is a virtue in the humanity of Christ by the divine life. Christ&rsquo;s meekness is not a simple matter, because it is in His humanity and by the divine life. When He was on the earth, He lived a human life by the divine life. Through this mingling of divinity and humanity the virtue of meekness was manifested. The principle is the same with Christ&rsquo;s virtue of gentleness. Gentleness is another virtue of Christ lived in His humanity by the divine life.</p>
<p>To be meek is to give in to others, and to be gentle is to bear others. To have the virtue of meekness is not to invade others or fight with them; instead, it is to be willing to give in to others. To be meek is to be mild toward men, without resisting or disputing. Gentleness denotes humility, yieldingness, and approachableness. To have gentleness means to be willing to allow others to invade us. This means that to have gentleness is to be willing to suffer affliction and injury. To have meekness is not to invade others but to give in to them; to have gentleness is to be willing to be invaded by others. These are two of the virtues Christ lived in His humanity by the divine life. Because Paul lived by Christ, whatever Christ was became his virtue in his behavior.</p>
<p>Moreover, we may be meek and gentle, but we need to consider whether or not our meekness and gentleness are something of Christ. We all agree that we must reject or repudiate the character that is not meek and gentle, but we need to realize that we must reject our natural meekness and our natural gentleness. Some believers may be proud of their meekness and gentleness, but the apostle Paul said that he entreated the Corinthians not in his own meekness or gentleness but in the meekness and gentleness of Christ. This shows that Paul was a person living in the spirit, always taking Christ as his everything. He was a person living by Christ and experiencing Christ as his meekness and gentleness.</p>
<p>Furthermore, Paul did not say that he imitated the meekness and gentleness of Christ. To imitate Christ is one thing, but to live in His meekness and gentleness is another. In order to live in His meekness and gentleness, we need Christ to be wrought into us so that His meekness and gentleness can be ours. Paul enjoyed these aspects of Christ&rsquo;s unsearchable riches, and they also should be our enjoyment today. As we contact others, we should not try to imitate Christ. Rather, we should contact them in the meekness and gentleness of Christ.</p>
<p>In order to enjoy the meekness and gentleness of Christ, we need to be in the Spirit, because all the riches of Christ are in the all-inclusive Spirit. When we turn to our spirit, contact Christ as the all-inclusive Spirit, and take Him as our person, His meekness and gentleness become our food, nourishment, strength, and satisfaction. There is no need for us to desperately attempt to restrain ourselves or to manufacture meekness or gentleness. The meekness and gentleness of Christ are simply our spontaneous enjoyment. We can actually feed on these aspects of Christ&rsquo;s riches. When we take Him as our person, we spontaneously enjoy His meekness and gentleness. Instead of self-effort, we simply enjoy whatever Christ is. This was the living of the apostle Paul.</p>
<h2 class="head4">c. Truthfulness to Be Honest with Others</h2>
<p>In 2 Corinthians 11:10 Paul says, &ldquo;The truthfulness of Christ is in me.&rdquo; What is in Christ as truthfulness&mdash;as honesty, faithfulness, and trustworthiness&mdash;was also in the apostle Paul. Since Paul lived by Christ, whatever Christ is became his virtue in his behavior. Because the truthfulness of Christ was in him, Paul could be honest with others. Christ&rsquo;s truthfulness is His genuineness, sincerity, honesty, and trustworthiness as a divine attribute (Rom. 3:7; 15:8) and as a human virtue (Mark 12:14), an issue of the divine reality (John 4:23-24; 2 John 1; 3 John 1). Such a divine attribute and human virtue should be our experience and enjoyment of Christ.</p>
<p>The truthfulness of Christ was in Paul because Christ Himself was wrought into him. Christ is truthfulness. This is a further proof that Paul lived by Christ. Otherwise, he could not have had the truthfulness of Christ. Here truthfulness denotes faithfulness, trustworthiness, and honesty. Specifically, truthfulness indicates the faithfulness, the honesty, of the Lord Jesus in His human living. This virtue was also manifest in the living of the apostle Paul. Because Paul realized that he was one with Christ, he also realized that he had the virtues of Christ&rsquo;s human life. Paul not only enjoyed Christ&rsquo;s divinity in great things; he also enjoyed His humanity in the detailed items of His human virtues based upon the divine attributes.</p><h2 class="head3">46. The One Husband</h2>
<p>In 2 Corinthians 11:2 Paul says, &ldquo;I am jealous over you with a jealousy of God; for I betrothed you to one husband to present you as a pure virgin to Christ.&rdquo; Here we see that Christ is the believers&rsquo; one Husband, the unique Husband, for us to love. We should belong only to Him, and we should appreciate Him and love Him. As our Husband, Christ has attracted us, and we have been presented as a pure virgin to Him. Now we should care only for Him, allowing nothing to replace Him in our heart. Our love for Him should be pure, and our whole being should be focused on Him.</p>
<p>As those betrothed to Christ, we should take Him as our Husband. Taking Christ as our Husband is a most intimate matter. If we marry Christ, taking Him as our Husband, our life will be changed. We will realize that we must have a wife&rsquo;s fidelity, and we will learn how to enjoy Christ as our life, walking and behaving in oneness with Him. Then we will become those who gain Christ and enjoy Christ, loving Him and living with Him.</p>
<h2 class="head4">a. The Believers Having Been<br />
Betrothed to Him by the Apostle</h2>
<p>The apostle Paul betrothed the believers to one Husband in order to present them as a pure virgin to Christ. Just as the apostle engaged the believers to Christ as the unique Husband, when we preach the gospel, we should represent Christ in His courtship of His chosen people that He may marry them. In other words, when we preach the gospel, lead others to salvation, and baptize them, we should have the feeling that we are betrothing them to Christ as one Husband in order to present them as a pure virgin to Him. In fact, to preach the gospel to others, to bring them to Christ, and to baptize them into the name of the Triune God are to present them as a pure virgin to Christ and to marry them to the Triune God embodied in Christ. We need to learn the truth that Christ is the one Husband and that we should betroth others to Christ as one Husband. This truth will strengthen us with assurance to exercise our authority to betroth others to Christ.</p>
<h2 class="head4">b. For the Believers to Be Presented<br />
as a Pure Virgin to Him</h2>
<p>The word <em>virgin</em> in verse 2 means to be the bride for the Bridegroom (John 3:29), the wife of the Lamb (Rev. 19:7). In this sense, all the believers of Christ are female. Spiritually, we all, brothers and sisters alike, are virgins betrothed to Christ (S. S. 1:3). All the believers, especially the brothers, need to realize that they are a part of the virgin to Christ. Before the Lord and to the Lord we have to consider ourselves as females. We have to love the Lord, just as a virgin loves her husband. A brother may be a husband, but to Christ he is a part of His wife. We all are virgins and are parts of the corporate virgin to Christ. If you behave yourself as a man before Christ, you insult the Lord&rsquo;s headship; you must behave yourself as a virgin before the Lord. Paul betrothed the believers as a chaste, pure virgin to Christ.</p>
<p>Moreover, God has a jealous heart, an envying heart, toward us because He wants us to be solely for Him and to turn toward Him. He does not want us to have any other love apart from Him, just as a husband desires his wife to love him and wants his wife to be only for him. Therefore, we need to be blindly and foolishly satisfied with Christ alone. We should not know anything but Christ and have the attitude that nothing is as good as Christ. He is the best, and we simply love Him.</p>
<p>The goal of the Lord&rsquo;s recovery is to recover Christ Himself as the unique Husband for us to love. We should belong only to Him. As long as we have been brought as a pure virgin to this Husband and love Him, appreciate Him, and belong to Him, we will be preserved. This will keep us, sanctify us, and transform us. Christ is a lovely person, the unique, universal Husband. We have all been presented as a pure virgin to Him. We are for Him, and we should be attracted to Him, loving Him, appreciating Him, and treasuring Him.</p><h1 class="series">THE CONCLUSION<br />

<h2 class="head3">47. The Embodiment of Grace</h2>
<p>In 2 Corinthians 12:9 Christ is revealed as the embodiment of grace. Christ is not only the factor of grace but also the embodiment of grace; that is, Christ is grace itself.</p>
<h2 class="head4">a. His Grace Being Sufficient<br />
for the One Who Is in Him</h2>
<p>In 2 Corinthians 12:2 Paul says, &ldquo;I know a man in Christ.&rdquo; <em>A man in Christ</em>&mdash;a person who always lives in Christ and is found in Christ&mdash;refers to the apostle (v. 7), not as the old creation but as the new creation (5:17). Paul then tells us that because of the transcendence of the revelations that he received, he could not avoid being proud; hence, the Lord gave him a thorn, a messenger of Satan, to keep him from being exceedingly lifted up. Paul entreated the Lord three times that it might depart from him (12:7-8). However, the Lord said to him, &ldquo;My grace is sufficient for you&rdquo; (v. 9); instead of removing the thorn, the Lord supplied Paul with the sufficient grace to enable him to bear the suffering. If we put together verses 2 and 9, we see that the grace of Christ is sufficient for a man in Christ. As long as we are in Christ, His grace is sufficient for us.</p>
<p>The grace mentioned in 2 Corinthians 12:9 is not something done by the Lord or given by the Lord. It is the Lord Himself within us, supporting us, energizing us, and strengthening us to meet the situation. This is a living grace, a real grace, and it is nothing less than Christ as the embodiment of the processed Triune God dispensed into our being for our enjoyment. Grace is mainly not the work that the Lord Jesus does for us; grace is the Triune God in Christ dispensed into us and experienced as our enjoyment. In his experience Paul realized that grace is Christ Himself. When Christ is enjoyed by us as our portion, that is grace. Grace is Christ, not in doctrine but in experience, because grace is Christ with all He is for our enjoyment; this includes life, power, and His other divine attributes. Therefore, we need to learn not to expect to receive something outwardly or to have something done by the Lord for us. Rather, we should expect to simply enjoy the Lord Himself as grace.</p>
<h2 class="head4">b. His Grace Being the Power Perfected in Weakness That, as a Tent Spread over Us,<br />
Overshadows Us in Our Weakness</h2>
<p>In 2 Corinthians 12:9 the Lord said to Paul, &ldquo;My grace is sufficient for you, for My power is perfected in weakness.&rdquo; Accepting the Lord&rsquo;s word, Paul could go on to say in verse 9, &ldquo;Most gladly therefore I will rather boast in my weaknesses that the power of Christ might tabernacle over me.&rdquo; This verse reveals that the grace of Christ is the power that is made perfect in weakness. We must all love our weaknesses because our weaknesses become the very site in which the grace of Christ as His power is perfected. If we are strong in ourselves, we cannot enjoy Christ as grace. In order to enjoy Christ as grace, we must be weak persons. The weaker we are, the more we will realize the sufficient grace that constantly strengthens us into the inner man (Eph. 3:16). Christ does not want us to be strong or powerful in ourselves; rather, He wants us to be weak. Our weakness is precious. It is because of our weaknesses that the Lord&rsquo;s power has the ground to manifest itself and that we are able to enjoy His power. When we are weak, we may experience the power of Christ in our weakness.</p>
<p>When we are strong, we put the Lord aside because we do not need the Lord. In other words, when we are strong, the Lord has no ground in us and cannot do anything for us. Nevertheless, when we are weak and realize that apart from Him we can do nothing, the Lord has the ground in us and can do everything for us. When the Lord does everything for us, we enjoy the Lord&rsquo;s sufficient grace perfected in our weakness. For this reason, the Lord allowed the thorn to remain with Paul in order to expose his weakness so that he would experience His all-sufficient grace. Without the thorn Paul would not realize how weak he was; with the thorn in the flesh he needed the Lord to be his grace. The Lord left the thorn with Paul so that he would experience His overshadowing power perfected in his weakness.</p>
<p>We may complain of our weakness or lack of ability. However, we need to see that in our weakness Christ&rsquo;s power is made perfect. Our weakness gives us an opportunity to enjoy the power of Christ. For this reason, Paul boasted in his weaknesses, not in the revelations he had received, so that Christ as the sufficient grace, the power of resurrection, might overshadow him in his weaknesses. Eventually, Paul learned to say, &ldquo;I am well pleased in weaknesses, in insults, in necessities, in persecutions and distresses, on behalf of Christ; for when I am weak, then I am powerful&rdquo; (2 Cor. 12:10). Like the apostle Paul, we also should boast in our weaknesses that the power of Christ might tabernacle over us.</p>
<p>For the sufficiency of the Lord&rsquo;s grace to be magnified, our sufferings are required; for the perfectness of the Lord&rsquo;s power to be shown forth, our weakness is needed. Hence, the apostle would most gladly boast in his weaknesses that the power of Christ might tabernacle over him. Grace is the supply, and power is the strength, the ability, of grace. Both are the resurrected Christ, who is now the life-giving Spirit dwelling in us (1 Cor. 15:45; Gal. 2:20) for our enjoyment.</p>
<p>The grace of Christ is the power perfected in weakness that, as a tent or a tabernacle spread over us, overshadows us in our weakness. The Greek word for <em>tabernacle over</em> is a compound verb composed of two words. The first word means &ldquo;upon,&rdquo; and the second, &ldquo;to dwell in a tent,&rdquo; as in John 1:14 and Revelation 21:3. The compound verb here means &ldquo;to fix a tent or a habitation upon.&rdquo; It portrays how the power of Christ, even Christ Himself, dwells upon us as a tent spread over us, overshadowing us in our weaknesses.</p>
<p>Sufferings and trials are often the Lord&rsquo;s ordination for us so that, through the divine dispensing, we may experience Christ as grace and power. In his experience Paul realized that the Lord&rsquo;s grace became power spread over him like a tent. Hence, this grace-power became a dwelling place for Paul in his sufferings. As Paul was suffering, he could dwell in the tabernacle spread over him. This tabernacle, this tent, sustained him, supported him, maintained him, and kept him.</p>
<p>Paul was weak in his old being, but he was powerful in the overshadowing Christ (2 Cor. 12:10). Second Corinthians reveals a person who has been reduced to nothing, with no strength of his own, so that the power of Christ might be perfected in his weakness. Paul was reduced to nothing but took Christ as everything. Like Paul, we need to experience Christ as the all-sufficient grace meeting our need in every kind of environment, and we need to taste Him, experiencing His power being perfected in our weakness.</p><h2 class="head3">48. The Powerful One in the Believers</h2>
<p>In 2 Corinthians 13:3-5 Christ is unveiled as the powerful One in the believers. Christ is not weak in us; He is powerful. He is the powerful One. This powerful One is actually the power of resurrection spoken of in Philippians 3:10. Christ Himself is the power of His resurrection.</p>
<h2 class="head4">a. The One Who Speaks in the Apostle<br />
to Minister Himself to the Believers</h2>
<p>In 2 Corinthians 13:3 Paul says to the Corinthians, &ldquo;Since you seek a proof of the Christ who is speaking in me, who is not weak unto you but is powerful in you.&rdquo; Christ is the One who speaks in the apostle to minister Himself to the believers. Christ was powerful in the believers while He was speaking in the apostle. This was indeed a strong and subjective proof to the believers that Christ was speaking in the apostle.</p>
<h2 class="head4">b. The One Who Was Crucified out of Weakness<br />
but Lives by the Power of God</h2>
<p>In 2 Corinthians 13:4 Paul continues, &ldquo;For indeed He was crucified out of weakness, but He lives by the power of God.&rdquo; When Christ was crucified, He was weak. No person who is strong can be crucified; for one to be crucified, he must be weak. Christ was crucified out of weakness, allowing His persecutors to do what they wanted. Yet now in resurrection Christ is not weak but powerful, because He lives by the power of God.</p>
<p>Christ was the almighty God, but when He was crucified, He was willing to become weak, and He became weak. For Himself, Christ did not need to be weak in any way, but in order to accomplish redemption on our behalf, He was willing to be weak in His body that He might be crucified. When He was arrested, tried, and crucified, He made no display of His power. Instead, He was weak to the uttermost. If Christ had not been weak, He could not have been arrested, much less nailed to the cross. Only one who is weak can be crucified. Now that redemption has been accomplished and Christ has been resurrected, He is no longer weak. Rather, after being resurrected, He now lives by the power of God.</p>
<h2 class="head4">c. The Apostles Being Weak in Him<br />
but Living Together with Him by the Power of God Directed toward the Believers</h2>
<p>Second Corinthians 13:4 goes on to say, &ldquo;For indeed we are weak in Him, but we will live together with Him by the power of God directed toward you.&rdquo; Paul came to the Greek believers &ldquo;in weakness and in fear and in much trembling&rdquo; (1 Cor. 2:3). Paul did not display himself as a physically strong man while among the Greeks, who sought to be strong not only psychologically in their philosophy but also physically in their gymnastics. Paul&rsquo;s bodily presence was weak (2 Cor. 10:10), and he was meek, lowly, and humble when present with the Greek believers. Hence, the Greeks, who desired to be great in their philosophy and athletics, looked down on the apostle. Yet the apostle told the Corinthian believers that although he was weak in Christ, he lived by the power of God directed toward the believers.</p>
<p>The apostles followed the pattern of Christ and were willing to be weak in the organic union with Him that they might live with Him a crucified life. Thus, they would live together with Him by the power of God directed toward the believers. Apparently, they were weak toward the believers; actually they were powerful. We are always taught to be strong, but we must learn to be weak. We are too strong in ourselves, in our natural man. We need to learn to be weak that Christ might be powerful within us.</p>
<p>In 2 Corinthians 13:4 Paul points out to the Corinthians that the apostles were weak in Christ. Through the organic union, they were one with Christ to be weak. The purpose for their being weak in this way was for the sake of the building up of the church. When the apostles came to Corinth, they did not come in a way of strength but in a way of weakness for the purpose of imparting Christ into the Corinthians and of edifying them, perfecting them, so that they may be built up as the Body of Christ. Actually, the apostles were not weak. Nonetheless, they voluntarily became weak and, according to verse 4, continued to be weak in Christ.</p>
<p>The phrase <em>in Him</em> in verse 4 is very important. Our concept is that to be in Christ is to be strong, not to be weak. Nevertheless, in this verse Paul says that we are weak in Him. Why are we weak in Christ? We are weak in Him in order to live a crucified life.</p>
<p>Moreover, for Paul to live by the power of God toward the believers means that he was powerful in his speaking to them. On the one hand, when we go out to preach the gospel to others, we should not display ourselves as physically strong persons; rather, we should be weak in Christ and be humble among them. On the other hand, when we speak to them, we should be powerful in an inward way, not in an outward way; that is, we should be strong in our spirit, not in our body, for it is through the spirit that we can gain people for the Lord.</p>
<h2 class="head4">d. He Being in the Believers through Their Faith</h2>
<p>In 2 Corinthians 13:5 Paul says, &ldquo;Test yourselves whether you are in the faith; prove yourselves. Or do you not realize about yourselves that Jesus Christ is in you, unless you are disapproved?&rdquo; This verse indicates that Christ is in the believers through their faith. Here the faith refers to the objective faith (Acts 6:7; 1 Tim. 1:19). If one is in the objective faith, he surely has the subjective faith, believing in Christ and the entire content of God&rsquo;s New Testament economy. As long as a person has this faith, regardless of how big or little it is, he has Christ dwelling in him.</p><h1 class="series">THE CONCLUSION<br />

<h2 class="head3">49. The Center of the Triune God<br />
in the Divine Dispensing</h2>
<p>In 2 Corinthians 13:14 Paul says, &ldquo;The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ and the love of God and the fellowship of the Holy Spirit be with you all.&rdquo; The love, grace, and fellowship in this verse correspond to the Father, the Son, and the Spirit in Matthew 28:19. <em>The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ</em> means that Christ is grace and that grace is Christ. Likewise, <em>the love of God</em> means that God is love and that love is God, and <em>the fellowship of the Holy Spirit</em> means that the Holy Spirit is the fellowship and that the fellowship is the Holy Spirit. Hence, grace is Christ, love is God, and fellowship is the Holy Spirit. God as love is the source; Christ, the embodiment of God, as grace is the course; and the Spirit as fellowship is the flow in the course that reaches us for our application.</p>
<p>Second Corinthians 13:14 reveals Christ as the center of the Triune God in the divine dispensing. Christ is the center of the Triune God. He is the Son with the Father as the Spirit. Within Him is the Father, and He is the Spirit. If we have Christ, we have the Father, and we also have the Spirit. Therefore, if we desire to know Him, we must know the Spirit, because the Father is in the Son, and the Son is the Spirit. Also, if we desire to know the Son with the Father, we must know the Spirit. It is in Christ that the processed Triune God is dispensing Himself into the tripartite believers to be their element for their experience and enjoyment.</p>
<p>At the conclusion of 2 Corinthians Paul blesses the believers with the blessed Trinity in the participation of the Son&rsquo;s grace with the Father&rsquo;s love through the Spirit&rsquo;s fellowship. The blessing in verse 14 is composed of grace, love, and fellowship. The love of God the Father is the source, the fountain; and the grace of Christ is the flow, the expression, of love. The fellowship of the Holy Spirit is a matter of communication, transportation, and transmission. Therefore, love is the source, grace is the flow, and fellowship is the transmission of the flow with the source.</p>
<p>Second Corinthians 13:14 clearly says that grace is of Christ, love is of God, and fellowship is of the Holy Spirit. Grace is actually the Triune God embodied in Christ and transmitted into our being through the Spirit for our enjoyment. Hence, the grace of Christ is the Triune God as our life, life supply, and enjoyment. This grace issues out from the Father&rsquo;s love and is transmitted into us by the Spirit. Therefore, we have the grace of Christ, the love of God, and the fellowship of the Holy Spirit as the full enjoyment of the Triune God. Because the book of 2 Corinthians emphasizes grace, grace is mentioned first in 13:14; the grace of Christ is the central thought, the subject, of 2 Corinthians. The main purpose of this book is that we experience the Lord as grace (1:12; 4:15; 6:1; 8:1, 9; 9:8, 14; 12:9).</p>
<h2 class="head4">a. The Love of God the Father Being Expressed<br />
in the Grace of Christ the Son</h2>
<p>The love of God the Father is expressed in the grace of Christ the Son. The source of this grace is the love of God. Love is the hidden source; when love is expressed, it becomes grace. Grace and love are not two separate things but two ends of one thing. On God&rsquo;s end, it is love; on Christ&rsquo;s end, it is manifested as grace. In other words, when the grace of Christ is traced back to its origin, which is God, it is love, and when the love of God is expressed through Christ, it is grace. Grace is the expression of love, and love is the source of grace. The grace of Christ comes out altogether from the love of God.</p>
<p>What the Father does in His dispensing and in His operating in us is in love and based on love. Love is the source of the Father&rsquo;s dispensing. Hence, when we experience and enjoy the Triune God, we experience and enjoy Him as the Father in the love of God. When the divine love appears to us, it becomes grace.</p><h2 class="head4">b. The Grace of Christ the Son<br />
Being in the Fellowship of God the Spirit<br />
to Be Transmitted to the Believers</h2>
<p>The grace of Christ the Son is in the fellowship of God the Spirit to be transmitted to the believers. It is through the fellowship of the Holy Spirit that this grace is able to reach us. The fellowship of the Holy Spirit is the transmission of the Holy Spirit. The grace of Christ comes out of the love of God, but this grace comes into us, is conveyed to us, and is transmitted into us through the fellowship of the Holy Spirit. Therefore, in order to enjoy the grace of the Lord we must be in the fellowship of the Holy Spirit, and as we are enjoying the grace of the Lord, we taste the love of God. The Holy Spirit, the Lord Jesus, and God are not three separate Gods. In the same manner, these three&mdash;love, grace, and fellowship&mdash;are one. Today if we desire to enjoy the grace of Christ, we must be in the fellowship of the Holy Spirit, and as we are enjoying the grace of Christ, we will spontaneously taste the love of God.</p>
<p>The fellowship of the Holy Spirit is God Himself flowing into us. When the flow is hidden, it is love. When love flows out, it is grace. When grace flows into us, it is fellowship. This fellowship is by means of the Spirit, and this Spirit is in our spirit. Therefore, we must learn to turn to our spirit. Only when we enter into our spirit can we contact the Spirit of fellowship; only when we are in the Spirit of fellowship can we enjoy the grace of the Lord; and only when we are in the grace of the Lord can we taste the love of God.</p>
<p>In the divine dispensing we simultaneously experience and enjoy grace, love, and fellowship. While we are enjoying the fellowship of the Spirit, we also enjoy the grace of the Lord Jesus Christ and the love of God. The more we live in the fellowship of the Spirit, the more we receive the grace of Christ; the more we receive the grace of Christ, the more we enjoy the love of God. The fellowship of the Holy Spirit issues in the grace of Christ, and in the grace of Christ we receive the love of God. Hence, the love of the Father, the grace of the Son, and the fellowship of the Holy Spirit are simultaneously experienced and enjoyed by the believers in the divine dispensing.</p>
<h2 class="head4">c. The Believers Participating in<br />
and Enjoying the Divine Dispensing</h2>
<p>Grace as presented in 2 Corinthians is actually the Triune God embodied in the Son and transmitted into our being through the Spirit for our enjoyment. Hence, grace is the Triune God as our life, life supply, and enjoyment. This grace issues out from the Father&rsquo;s love and is transmitted into our being by the Spirit. Therefore, we have the grace of Christ, the love of God, and the fellowship of the Holy Spirit&mdash;the full enjoyment of the Triune God.</p>
<p>The grace of the Lord is the Lord Himself as life to us for our enjoyment, the love of God is God Himself as the source of the grace of the Lord, and the fellowship of the Spirit is the Spirit Himself as the transmission of the grace of the Lord with the love of God for our participation. The result of the enjoyment of the grace of the Lord, the love of God, and the fellowship of the Spirit is satisfaction, and the issue of this enjoyment and satisfaction is rest. All Christians should have this enjoyment, satisfaction, and rest.</p>
<p>The grace of the Lord is the Lord Himself as life to us for our enjoyment (John 1:17 and footnote 1; 1 Cor. 15:10 and footnote 1), the love of God is God Himself (1 John 4:8, 16) as the source of the grace of the Lord, and the fellowship of the Spirit is the Spirit Himself as the transmission of the grace of the Lord with the love of God for our participation. These are not three separate matters but three aspects of one thing, just as the Lord, God, and the Holy Spirit are not three separate Gods but three hypostases...of the one same undivided and indivisible&rdquo; God (Philip Schaff). The Greek word for <em>hypostasis</em> (used in Hebrews 11:1&mdash;see footnote 2 there), the singular form of <em>hypostases,</em> refers to a support under, a support beneath, that is, something underneath that supports, a supporting substance. The Father, the Son, and the Spirit are the hypostases, the supporting substances, that compose the one Godhead.</p>
<p>The love of God is the source, since God is the origin; the grace of the Lord is the course of the love of God, since the Lord is the expression of God; and the fellowship of the Spirit is the impartation of the grace of the Lord with the love of God, since the Spirit is the transmission of the Lord with God for our experience and enjoyment of the Triune God&mdash;the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit, with Their divine virtues. In 2 Corinthians 13:14 the grace of the Lord is mentioned first because this book is on the grace of Christ. Such a divine attribute of three virtues&mdash;love, grace, and fellowship&mdash;and such a Triune God of the three divine hypostases&mdash;the Father, the Son, and the Spirit&mdash;were needed by the distracted and confused yet comforted and restored Corinthian believers. Hence, the apostle used all these divine and precious things in one sentence to conclude his lovely and dear Epistle.</p>
<p>Second Corinthians 13:14 is strong proof that the trinity of the Godhead is not for the doctrinal understanding of systematic theology but for the dispensing of God Himself in His trinity into His chosen and redeemed people. In the Bible the Trinity is never revealed merely as a doctrine. It is always revealed or mentioned in regard to the relationship of God with His creatures, especially with man, who was created by Him, and more particularly with His chosen and redeemed people. The first divine title used in the divine revelation, <em>Elohim</em> in Hebrew, a title used in relation to God&rsquo;s creation, is plural in number (Gen. 1:1), implying that God, as the Creator of the heavens and the earth for man, is triune. Concerning His creation of man in His own image, according to His own likeness, He used the plural pronouns <em>Us</em> and <em>Our,</em> referring to His trinity (1:26) and implying that He would be one with man and express Himself through man in His trinity. Later, in Genesis 3:22 and 11:7 and Isaiah 6:8, He referred to Himself again and again as <em>Us</em> in regard to His relationship with man and with His chosen people.</p>
<p>In order to redeem fallen man that He might again have the position to be one with man, God became incarnated (John 1:1, 14) in the Son and through the Spirit (Luke 1:31-35) to be a man, and lived a human life on the earth, also in the Son (2:49) and by the Spirit (4:1; Matt. 12:28). At the beginning of the Son&rsquo;s ministry on the earth, the Father anointed the Son with the Spirit (3:16-17; Luke 4:18) in order that He might reach men and bring them back to Him. Just before He was crucified in the flesh and resurrected to become the life-giving Spirit (1 Cor. 15:45), He unveiled His mysterious trinity to His disciples in plain words (John 14&mdash;17), stating that the Son is in the Father and the Father is in the Son (14:9-11), that the Spirit is the transfiguration of the Son (vv. 16-20), that the three, coexisting and coinhering simultaneously, are abiding with the believers for their enjoyment (v. 23; 17:21-23), and that all that the Father has is the Son&rsquo;s and all that the Son possesses is received by the Spirit to be declared to the believers (16:13-15). Such a Trinity is altogether related to the dispensing of the processed God into His believers (14:17, 20; 15:4-5) that they may be one in and with the Triune God (17:21-23).</p>
<p>After His resurrection He charged His disciples to disciple the nations, baptizing them into the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit (Matt. 28:19); that is, He charged the disciples to bring the believing ones into the Triune God, into an organic union with the processed God, who had passed through incarnation, human living, and crucifixion and had entered into resurrection. Based on such an organic union, the apostle, at the conclusion of this divine Epistle to the Corinthians, blessed them with the blessed Divine Trinity in the participation in the Son&rsquo;s grace with the Father&rsquo;s love through the Spirit&rsquo;s fellowship. In this Divine Trinity, God the Father operates all things in all the members in the church, which is the Body of Christ, through the ministries of the Lord, God the Son, by the gifts of God the Spirit (1 Cor. 12:4-6).</p>
<p>The divine revelation of the trinity of the Godhead in the holy Word is not for theological study but for the apprehending of how God in His mysterious and marvelous trinity dispenses Himself into His chosen people, that we as His chosen and redeemed people may, as indicated in the apostle&rsquo;s blessing to the Corinthian believers, participate in, experience, enjoy, and possess the processed Triune God now and for eternity.</p></body></html>
