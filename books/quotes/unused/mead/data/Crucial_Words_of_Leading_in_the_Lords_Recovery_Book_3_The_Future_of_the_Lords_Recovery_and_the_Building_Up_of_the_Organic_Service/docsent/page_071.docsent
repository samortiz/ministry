   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>BEING ORGANIC, NOT ORGANIZATIONAL, IN SERVICE</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Before a brother is appointed as an elder, he may have had no sense of being anything but a saint who simply served the church.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>After being asked to coordinate in the eldership, he may regard himself as an elder, and from that day forward, all his service may be based on an organizational understanding.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>We need to ask ourselves whether our service comes out of an organizational or organic understanding.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>If a sister serves only because she has been given an assignment by the elders, her service is organizational.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>We have fellowshipped that it is difficult to appoint elders.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Prior to being appointed to the eldership, a brother may be good, always exercising to be in spirit and organic.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>However, the moment he is asked to join the eldership, he becomes organizational.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>An organic brother can easily become an organizational elder.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>This principle is true not only in the church but even in the world.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>As soon as someone is assigned to be in charge or to take the lead, he undergoes a change in disposition and behavior.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Prior to the assignment he had one disposition, but after the assignment he behaves organizationally based on his position.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>This is difficult to avoid.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>We should not have group leaders and deputy group leaders, or responsible ones and coordinators, because as soon as there is such an arrangement, everything becomes organizational.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>In 1976 we built a huge meeting hall in Anaheim, California, that could seat four thousand people, but we did not have much arrangement for service related to the building.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Taking advantage of this situation, a brother began to arrange service groups.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Eventually, he built up a pyramidal organization.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Initially, the brothers were organic, but soon everyone became organizational.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>One day I told the brothers in the elders meeting to abolish and tear down all the service groups.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The elders asked, How will the saints serve?</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>And I responded, Whoever has the heart will come to serve; whoever does not have the heart will not serve.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>After that, our service became living, and the number of serving ones was not reduced.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Fallen people are organizational by birth, and they form groups or communities, which are also organizations.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>However, the Bible shows that God does not want an organization; God wants an organism.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Revelation speaks of the messengers of the churches.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Anyone who is organic, in the spirit, and in life is a messenger of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>We need to be clear that we should not serve organizationally; instead, we should serve organically.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Our service is not organizational; it is organic.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>When this basic issue is resolved, it is easy to deal with other matters.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>THE BODY OF CHRIST BEING ORGANIC,</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>NOT ORGANIZATIONAL The Relationship between Apostles and Elders</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Influenced by the Lord s recovery, Christianity has begun to notice 1 Corinthians 12:28, which says, God has placed some in the church: first apostles, second prophets, third teachers; then works of power, then gifts of healing, helps, administrations, various kinds of tongues.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>I was born in Christianity.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Since my youth I listened to preaching every Lord s Day, but I had never heard a pastor speak of apostles, prophets, and teachers.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>It was not until the Lord s recovery was raised up in China that Brother Nee took the lead to speak about these things and opened the door for us.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Today in Christianity, especially in the East, people speak of apostles, prophets, and teachers, but they are not clear concerning what apostles, prophets, and teachers are.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Even the saints among us are not clear, and some of our co-workers are not clear.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>What are apostles, prophets, and teachers?</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>What are elders and full-time co-workers?</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>What is the relationship between apostles and elders and between full-time co-workers and elders?</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The co-workers and elders need to be clear concerning these relationships.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The church in Jerusalem was the first church established on the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>On the one hand, it was established by the Lord, and on the other hand, it was established by the first group of apostles through their preaching of the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>In Acts 2 Peter, standing with the eleven apostles, preached the gospel to the multitude, and about three thousand were saved.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>These three thousand new believers, in addition to the one hundred twenty disciples, became the church in Jerusalem vv.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>14-41; 1:15 .</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Therefore, the first church was established by the twelve apostles.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Although the Bible does not speak of the appointment of elders in Jerusalem, surely there were elders.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Although it is not easy to see, the apostles who established the church in Jerusalem were the elders there, because it was through them that the three thousand were saved.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>A large family may consist of multiple generations, including a grandfather, twelve sons, and the children of the twelve sons.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>When the grandfather dies, the twelve sons, that is, the second generation, become the elders.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>There is no need for them to be appointed, because it is clear to everyone in the family.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Likewise, when the church was established at Pentecost, three thousand souls were saved, and afterward another five thousand were saved.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>There was no need to appoint elders, because it was obvious to all the believers that Peter and the other eleven apostles were the elders.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>In every family the children know who the father is.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Concerning the appointment of elders, the Bible does not say that elders were appointed in the church in Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>The elders were produced spontaneously, and they were the twelve apostles.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Like the father in a family, they did not need to be appointed.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>The Bible first speaks of the appointment of elders in Acts 14:21-23, where Paul and Barnabas appointed elders in the churches in Lystra, Iconium, and Antioch.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>When Paul and Barnabas first passed through these places, they preached the gospel and raised up churches.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>After less than a year, they returned to appoint elders in every church.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Elders were appointed in every place where there was a group of believers meeting together as the church.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Even though the believers were young, they were the church.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Paul and his co-workers could not remain in these places to care for the churches; they had to leave.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Consequently, there was a need for some to take care of the local affairs, so it was necessary to appoint elders in the churches that had been established for less than one year.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Hence, the elders appointed could not have been very mature.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>They must have been considered as elders because they were a little more mature than the other believers in their locality.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>In order to avoid confusion, the apostles appointed elders in the churches, even elders who were not very mature or experienced.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>They were appointed elders because they were more mature compared to the other saints.</S>
