        <h1 class="msg">CHAPTER FOUR</h1>
<h1 class="title">THE RIGHTEOUS DEEDS<br />
OF THE KINGDOM PEOPLE</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Matt. 6:1-18</h1>
<p>In this chapter we will consider the fourth section of the Lord&rsquo;s teaching on the mountain, which concerns the righteous deeds of the kingdom people.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE GENERAL SKETCH</h2>
<p>Matthew 6:1 is the general sketch of this section concerning the righteous deeds of the kingdom people. The Lord said, &ldquo;Take care not to do your righteousness before men in order to be gazed at by them; otherwise, you have no reward with your Father who is in the heavens.&rdquo; The Lord asks us to do our righteous deeds in secret, not before men, because His central intention is that we would be delivered from our temper, flesh, and self.</p>
<p>In chapter 5 the Lord desires that we would allow the kingdom of the heavens to rule. In the matter of hatred, we should not deal with others but with ourselves. In the matter of lust, we should not give any place to our lust. In the matter of speaking, we should be simple and clear, not speaking for ourselves. In the matter of revenge, we should not contend with others but go along with them, and we should not allow things to touch us, giving the Lord all the ground in us. In the matter of loving others, we should not follow our choices and preferences; rather, we should love both those who are lovable and those who are unlovable. We should be perfect as our heavenly Father is perfect (vv. 21-48). All these matters require that we forsake our temper and flesh, live in the life of God, and be under the ruling of the kingdom of the heavens.</p>
<p>In chapter 6 the Lord spoke concerning the righteous deeds of the people of the kingdom of the heavens. His intention in this section is that we would still be delivered from our temper, flesh, and self, because our temper, flesh, and self can still be present in matters related to righteous deeds. When we commit sins and do evil, surely we are full of temper, flesh, and self; but even when we give alms and do good, our temper, flesh, and self can still be a factor. Hence, after the Lord spoke concerning how the authority of the kingdom of the heavens rules over us in matters related to the filth and corruption that men condemn, He continued to speak concerning how the authority of the kingdom of the heavens rules over us in matters related to righteous deeds that men praise.</p>
<p>The ruling of the kingdom of the heavens over righteous deeds requires that we do these things in secret. This requirement seems very easy on the surface, but in reality it is very hard, because a person must be delivered from the self in order to do righteous deeds in secret without making himself known.</p>
<p>Most people in the world do good deeds in order to make a show of themselves. If they cannot make a show, they often are unwilling to do good deeds. This proves that they are full of the self in doing good deeds. If the kingdom people can do righteous deeds without making a show, however, this is a proof that they have been delivered from the self. To do righteous deeds before men is to make a show of oneself. To do righteous deeds in secret is to deny and reject the self, not giving any place to the self.</p>
<p>After giving a general sketch in Matthew 6:1, the Lord lists three things. In principle, these three things include all the righteous deeds of man before God. In the first section of the Lord&rsquo;s teaching on the mountain in chapter 5, regarding the condition of the kingdom people&rsquo;s heart, there are three aspects: toward oneself, toward others, and toward God (vv. 1-12). On the one hand, the Lord teaches us what is required toward ourselves; on the other hand, He also teaches us what is required toward others and toward God. In the section on the kingdom people&rsquo;s righteous deeds in chapter 6, the Lord also speaks of these three aspects, because these three aspects include all the righteous deeds of man before God.</p>
<h2 class="head1">GIVING ALMS</h2>
<p>The giving of alms represents the righteous deeds of the people of the kingdom of the heavens toward others. Giving alms is to treat others graciously and mercifully with material things; hence, it is a righteous deed. A citizen of the kingdom of the heavens should have such righteous deeds in his living. In 6:1-4 the Lord does not speak of whether we should give alms but rather of how we give alms. The Lord said that we should not do our righteousness &ldquo;before men in order to be gazed at by them&rdquo; and that we should not give alms with the sounding of a trumpet (vv. 1-2). This means that we should give alms in secret instead of doing it in order to be gazed at, like the Gentiles. To be gazed at is to make a show of oneself. The people of the kingdom of the heavens should give alms without letting the left hand know what the right hand is doing (v. 3). This is an extreme description, but it means that we should not let others know by doing this in absolute secrecy.</p>
<p>In the Bible the right hand usually refers to divine matters, which is the top portion (Gen. 48:14; Exo. 15:6; 29:20; Psa. 48:10). The left hand usually refers to human matters. Therefore, according to the spiritual principle, the Lord&rsquo;s word implies that we should not allow our flesh to have any part in what we do according to God. We should not let our flesh have any part in our giving alms according to God&rsquo;s leading, God&rsquo;s power, and God&rsquo;s life. For the flesh to have no part requires secrecy. Whenever we want others to see our righteous deeds, our flesh is involved. A righteous deed may be of the Lord and may be carried out by the Lord&rsquo;s strength, signified by our right hand, but if we also want others to know and make a show of it, our left hand will be involved. It is possible to do something according to God but still allow some ground for the flesh. This is related to the self. By asking us to give alms in secret, the Lord requires that no element of the self be involved.</p>
<p>Sometimes, whether in the church or toward unbelievers, it is not possible to give alms in secret for some reason. This does not mean that we need to refrain from giving because of the Lord&rsquo;s speaking concerning not doing something &ldquo;in order to be gazed at by them&rdquo; (Matt. 6:1). As long as we are not doing something in order to be gazed at by others, it is good enough. We should try to do things in secret, but when circumstances do not allow this, we do not need to keep the letter in a dead way.</p>

 	<h2>Noise Words</h2>
 	<p>Common words, such as "and", "is", "but", and "the", also known as noise words, are bypassed in a search. The search string, the Spirit &amp; who, would result in an error since who, which stands by itself, is a noise word. The following is a list of noise words:</p>
	<p>$, a, also, an, and, another, any, are, as, at, be, because, been, being, both, but, by, came, can, did, do, each, for, has, had, he, have, her, here, him, himself, his, how, if, in, into, is, it, like, make, me, might, much, my, of, on, or, our, out, over, said, should, since, some, still, such, take, than, that, the, their, them, then, there, these, they, this, those, to, too, very, was, way, we, well, were, what, where, which, while, who, with, would, you, your</p>

  	<h2>Ranking</h2>
  	<p>Rank is a value from <strong>0</strong> to <strong>1000</strong> indicating how closely a match scored or ranked against the original search string. Rank values are affected by the following factors:</p>
		<ol>
            <li><span>The total number of occurrences of the original search words/phrases in a portion of a book.</span></li>
            <li><span>Content that includes the search words in close proximity to each other are ranked above those that do not. Therefore, a portion of a book that has the search words in close proximity may have a higher ranking than another portion of a book that has a higher hit count but the words are not in close proximity to one another. Therefore, we also include a search word hit count for reference.</span></li>
            <li><span>The rank values are relative to each other. Therefore, it is not possible to interpret the RANK value as a percentage or group the rank values into high/medium/low ranges. Think of rank as a method to order the results for a specific search.</span></li>

 	<h2>Search Scope</h2>
 	<h3>Include All Word Forms</h3>
	<p>This option breaks out the search string into its individual words and generates all conjugations and declensions for each word in the search phrase. A search on the word, dwell, would search for dwell, dwelling, dwelling's, dwells, dwelt, and dwelled.</p>
	<p>There is no need to use ^ (inflectional search) or * (prefix search) when using the Include all word forms search scope.</p> 
	<h3>Specified Word Forms</h3>
	<p>This option searches for exact matches of the specified words or phrases used in the search string. Use of ^ (inflectional search) with a particular word in the search string will broaden the search for that given word in that all conjugations and declensions for that word will be searched. Similarly, use of * (prefix search) with a particular word in the search string will broaden the search for that given word in that all words with that prefix will be searched as well.</p> 
	<h3>Note</h3>
	<p>Common words, such as "and", "is", "but", and "the", also known as noise words, are bypassed in a search. A list of all noise words is as follows:</p>
	<p>$, about, after, all, also, an,and, another, any, are, as, at, be, because, been, before, being, between, both, but, by, came, can, come, could, did, do, each, for, from, get, got, has, had, he, have, her, here, him, himself, his, how, if, in, into, is, it, like, make, many, me, might, more, most, much, must, my, never, now, of, on, only, or, other, our, out, over, said, same, see, should, since, some, still, such, take, than, that, the, their, them, then, there, these, they, this, those, through, to, too, under, up, very, was, way, we, well, were, what, where, which, while, who, with, would, you, your</p>
