   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER TWO INCARNATION, INCLUSION,</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>AND INTENSIFICATION 2 Scripture Reading: John 1:14; 1 Cor 15:45b; John 20:22; Rev 1:4; 5:6</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In the previous message we began to consider the three stages of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In this message I have the burden to give a particular and up-to-date message on Christ in the three stages of incarnation, inclusion, and intensification.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>A WONDERFUL PERSON IN THREE STAGES</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>If we would know Christ in these three stages, we need to consider the whole Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The Old Testament contains many types and prophecies concerning Christ, the Messiah, the coming One.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>In the New Testament we have the fulfillment of the types and prophecies regarding Christ in the Old Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>We have considered these in detail in The Conclusion of the New Testament, Messages 34 through 45.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The whole New Testament is concerned with one person Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The New Testament clearly reveals that as the fulfillment of the types and prophecies in the Old Testament, Christ is a wonderful person in three stages.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>As the wonderful One He is deep, mysterious, and very complicated.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The First Stage Incarnation</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>the Stage of Christ in the Flesh</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Throughout the centuries the New Testament has been read, studied, and investigated by millions of people.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>I myself have been reading and studying the New Testament for seventy years.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>My study has been in three stages: the first stage in mainland China, the second stage in Taiwan, and the third stage in the United States.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>When I was in China I was greatly helped, even tutored, by Brother Nee.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>I studied every book of the New Testament and also many different interpretations of the Scriptures.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Although I was helped to the uttermost by Brother Nee, while I was in China, my study was limited mainly to the first stage of Christ, that is, the stage of Christ in the flesh, Christ in His incarnation.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>As the record of the four Gospels indicates, this stage lasted only thirty-three and a half years.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>This was the time in which the Lord Jesus accomplished God's redemption judicially.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The four Gospels reveal Christ in the flesh as the One who lived a human life on earth and who was then crucified, dying for our sins in order to redeem us back to God.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Strictly speaking, this is a matter not of salvation but of judicial redemption.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>God's judicial redemption includes the forgiveness of sins Luke 24:47 , the washing away of sins Heb 1:3 , justification Rom 3:24-25 , reconciliation to God Rom 5:10a , and positional sanctification 1 Cor 1:2; Heb 13:12 .</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>In a judicial sense, one who has been forgiven, washed, justified by God, reconciled to God, and sanctified unto God is a saved person.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>This judicial redemption is not God's full salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Rather, judicial redemption is simply the initial part, the foundational part, of God's full salvation; it is the base upon which God's complete, organic salvation is built.</S>
