<p><em>Question: If we want to live in the anointing and be subject to the discipline of the Holy Spirit, does our will need to cooperate?</em></p>
<p>Answer: There is no need to analyze whether or not our will is cooperating. We should simply surrender to the anointing. We can say that this is the cooperation of the will. We need to give ourselves to the Lord. We need to learn to be genuine and to give ourselves to the Lord because we love Him. We give ourselves practically according to the anointing and our environment. Hence, we must learn to receive the teaching of the anointing.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Discerning the Intention<br />
of the Teaching of the Anointing</h2>
<p><em>Question: How can we discern the teaching of the anointing?</em></p>
<p>Answer: The teaching of the anointing is manifest in our daily living, letting us know whether we are in ourselves or in Christ. The anointing Spirit does not teach us whether or not we should do something. Rather, He asks, &ldquo;Is this Christ, or is it you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Do not think that the teaching of the anointing is to lead us concerning what to do and what not to do. The teaching of the anointing lets us know whether or not we are in Christ. As human beings, we are concerned with whether or not we should do a certain thing and whether or not we are doing it correctly. The leading of the Holy Spirit is for us to be delivered from the self so that we live in Christ. Hence, the teaching of the Holy Spirit asks, &ldquo;Is this Christ, or is it you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>For example, when I am about to lose my temper, I might ask, &ldquo;Lord, do You want me to lose my temper?&rdquo; The real question, however, should be, &ldquo;Am I losing my temper, or is Christ losing His temper?&rdquo; As long as it is Christ who is losing His temper, the inner anointing will say, &ldquo;It is right to lose your temper.&rdquo; If I am the one who wants to lose my temper, the anointing will say, &ldquo;No, it is not okay.&rdquo; Similarly, when we are not sure whether our love for a person corresponds to the Lord&rsquo;s will, we often ask, &ldquo;Lord, is it right to love this brother?&rdquo; In contrast, the teaching of the anointing will ask whether or not Christ is loving the brother. If we say that it is Christ, the Holy Spirit will say Amen. But if we answer that we are the one loving him, the Holy Spirit will say, &ldquo;It is not okay.&rdquo;</p>
<h2 class="head2">Living in the Anointing</h2>
<p><em>Question: What should I do if it is difficult for me to discern whether or not it is Christ who is doing something?</em></p>
<p>Answer: First John 2:27 does not say that when we have a need, we should ask the anointing to make us clear. The anointing Spirit is for our living and our life; we should live in the anointing. However, instead of giving ourselves to Him, we often check with Him only when we have a need. We have received mercy to love the Lord and give ourselves to Him; hence, we should give ourselves to the anointing inwardly and learn to live in Him. Instead of asking whether or not we should do something, we should exercise to live in Christ, not in ourselves. If we would practice this, spontaneously the anointing will show us whether or not Christ is living. This requires practice. It is ineffective to seek the leading of the anointing only when we have a need.</p>
<p>Believers often wait until they encounter a situation before they seek the Lord&rsquo;s will. The Lord reveals His will to those who give themselves to the anointing and live in the anointing. He does not reveal His will to those who do not give themselves to the anointing. The apostles did not make an effort to know the Lord&rsquo;s will. They gave themselves to the anointing and lived in the anointing; thus, they could know God&rsquo;s will.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Anointing and the Discipline<br />
of the Holy Spirit Putting Us to Death<br />
So That Christ May Be Our Life</h2>
<p><em>Question: When I learn a lesson from my environment, should I confess to God, or should I thank Him?</em></p>
<p>Answer: On the one hand, we should confess the sin of disobedience, and on the other hand, we should thank the Lord for showing us that we are wrong. However, such an experience is not precious, nor is it a genuine lesson. According to our concept, the teaching of the anointing is for us to know what is right and what is wrong, but the Lord does not lead us to know what is right and what is wrong. The teaching of the anointing shows us whether something is of the self or of Christ.</p>
<p>The Bible does not teach us concerning right and wrong. The concept of right and wrong is related to the tree of the knowledge of good and evil. The teaching of the Bible is centered on whether the self is living or Christ is living. This is the goal. However, it is difficult for us to drop our concept of right or wrong; thus, we expect the Holy Spirit to teach us what is right and what is wrong. This is not the work of the Holy Spirit. The work of the Holy Spirit is to teach us what is of ourselves and what is of Christ. As long as we are focused on what is right and wrong, we can only say that what is out of ourselves is wrong and what is out of Christ is right. However, when we focus on the leading, we will say that the Holy Spirit is leading us to live by Christ, not by the self.</p>
<p>May God have mercy on us so that our eyes would be opened to see that He does not want us to do &ldquo;right things&rdquo; but to live Christ. When we see this, we will ask, &ldquo;Am I living out myself, or is Christ being lived out?&rdquo; As long as Christ is being lived out, it will be right to love, and it will be right to hate; nothing will be wrong. But when Christ is not being lived out, both loving and hating are wrong.</p>
<p>The situations in our environment are for our breaking so that we may experience the resurrection life of Christ. The discipline in our environment does not teach us to discern right from wrong. When our concept is changed, we will know what it is to be led by the Lord. The Lord&rsquo;s leading is not for us to know what is right and what is wrong but for us to see what is according to the self and what is according to Christ.</p>
<p>For example, suppose a brother who has the gift of preaching the gospel is invited by a locality to preach the gospel. Because it is his habit, the brother may kneel down and pray, &ldquo;Lord, please tell me whether You want me to go and preach the gospel.&rdquo; However, we cannot find many examples of such a prayer in the Bible. This kind of prayer is not very spiritual. If this brother has the experience of living in the anointing and has learned the lesson, he would say, &ldquo;Lord, let me know whether going to this place is of me or of You. Am I the one who wants to preach the gospel, or is it You?&rdquo; If he receives the teaching of the anointing to see that Christ is asking him to go, then he should go. But if the anointing shows him that his desire to go is from himself, he should not go. There is a great difference between the two prayers. Almost every believer seeks the Lord&rsquo;s will according to the first prayer, not according to the second. Those who have the experience of living in the anointing will not ask the Lord, &ldquo;Do You want me to do this?&rdquo; Rather, they would ask, &ldquo;Is this matter of me, or is it of You?&rdquo; This is what the Holy Spirit is teaching us. The extent to which we give ourselves to the anointing determines our growth in life.</p>
<p>Furthermore, a person who knows the Lord will not only accept every circumstance in his environment; he will also ask what lesson he has learned. To learn to be patient is Buddhism, and to learn to endure sufferings is Hinduism. We must be able to say that our environment has caused us to know the flesh, that we have received the breaking of the cross, and that we have experienced Christ abiding in us. These are genuine lessons, and this is the genuine Christian living. We must know the self through the revelation gained from our environment. At the same time, we must receive the arrangement of the Holy Spirit in our environment to put the self to death by the cross. Through such experiences we will know that Christ is real in us; we will have genuine fellowship with Him and know Him more. This is the way to have genuine growth in life.</p>
<p>We must learn to surrender to the anointing within us and to the discipline of the Holy Spirit in our environment. The goal of these lessons is for us to be delivered from the self and to live Christ. This is the way to grow in life.</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_018.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_020.html">Next</a> </body></html>
