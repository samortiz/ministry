   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER TWO LOVE GOD'S REQUIREMENT</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In the experience of a believer, perhaps the most difficult thing is to submit to the Lord in the matter of love.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>But the Lord pays attention to the believer's love more than anything else.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The Lord requires him to fully hand over his love to Him that He may be Lord over it.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The Lord wants to have the first place in his love.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>We often hear people talk about consecration.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>We know that consecration is the first step of a believer's spiritual living.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>It is not the destination of spirituality; rather, it is the beginning.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>It leads the believer to the position of being sanctified.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>If there is no consecration, there certainly cannot be a spiritual living.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>However, nothing is more important in a believer's consecration than his love.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Whether his consecration is true or false depends upon whether or not there is a consecration of love.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Love is the touchstone of consecration.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>It is easy to present our time, money, ability, and many other things to the Lord, but it is difficult to offer our love to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>This is not to say that we do not love Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Perhaps we love the Lord very much; nevertheless, we may give the first place to someone else and give the Lord the second place; we may love someone else besides the Lord, or we may direct our own love.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Loving the Lord in these ways should not be considered as consecration, because we have not yet consecrated our love.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Every spiritual believer knows that love should be offered first.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Unless love is offered, nothing is offered.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>In the matter of a believer's love, God requires him to love Him fully.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The Lord is not willing to share the heart of the believer with anyone or anything.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Even if His share is the major portion, He still is not pleased.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The Lord demands absoluteness.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>This is a deathblow to the believer's soul-life, which is totally for the self.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The Lord wants us to part with what we love and not have a divided heart.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>He wants us to love Him fully and to love according to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>"You shall love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your mind" Matt 22:37 .</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The word "all" means that every part of our being is for the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The Lord does not want us to withhold any of our love so that we can love according to our wish.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>He wants absoluteness.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>He is a "jealous God" Exo 20:5 who will not allow anyone else to gain the love of His children.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>But we have many loves other than God!</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Perhaps some are those who are most intimate to us, like an Isaac, a Jonathan, or a Rachel.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>God demands that we put those whom we love upon the altar.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>He cannot tolerate us withholding someone who would compete with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>All that we have should be offered up.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>This is the way for a believer to obtain spiritual power.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>When the sacrifice, even the last sacrifice, is put upon the altar, fire will descend from heaven.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Without the altar, there is no heavenly fire.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Without bearing the cross and offering to the Lord all that we love, how can we have the power of the Holy Spirit?</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The altar should not be kept empty because fire will consume the sacrifice upon it.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>What will the fire burn if there are no sacrifices?</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>O brothers, we cannot obtain the power of the Holy Spirit by understanding the cross in our mentality or by discussing the cross; rather, we can obtain it by offering up everything completely.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>If we have any secret ties that are not yet cut off, if in our hearts we still spare some sheep, oxen, or Agag for God, we will not be able to see the power of the Holy Spirit manifested through us.</S>
