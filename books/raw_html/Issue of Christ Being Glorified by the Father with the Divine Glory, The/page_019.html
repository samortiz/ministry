Both the cultivated olive tree and the true vine signify Christ. Hence, to be grafted into the cultivated olive tree is to be grafted into the true vine.</li>	<li>Its grafted branches have been regenerated with the divine life, brought into the life-union with the crucified and resurrected Christ, and incorporated with the processed and consummated Triune God.</li>	<li>For the unlimited Triune God's multiplication as the increase of the immeasurable Christ, the embodiment of the processed and consummated Triune God (John 3:29-30), for His universal spreading:		<ol class="decimal">		<li>Through the fruit-bearing of the believers of Christ as the branches by their faithful abiding in Christ&#151;John 15:4-5, 16.</li>		<li>For the glorification of the Father&#151;John 15:8.</li>		</ol></li>	</ol></li><li>The third aspect of the incorporation of the consummated God with the regenerated believers is the child of the Spirit&#151;John 16:13-16, 19-22:	<ol class="upper-alpha">	<li>A new child, a new man, was born by the consummated Spirit&#151;vv. 21, 13-15:		<ol class="decimal">		<li>Created by Christ on the cross by abolishing in His flesh the law of the commandments in ordinances&#151;Eph. 2:15.</li>		<li>Regenerated by the Father with the resurrected Christ in His resurrection&#151;1 Pet. 1:3; Rom. 1:4.</li>		<li>Born by the Spirit in the believers' spirit&#151;John 3:6b.</li>		<li>The first group of Christ's believers who suffered Christ's departure through His death was the delivering woman&#151;John 16:20-21.</li>		<li>The Christ who returned in His resurrection was the newborn child&#151;v. 22.</li>		<li>To be the new man&#151;Col. 3:10-11.</li>		<li>Put on by the believers through the renewing in the spirit of their mind&#151;Eph. 4:23-24.</li>		</ol></li>	<li>To consummate the Body of Christ.</li>	</ol></li></ol>
