   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Reading the Word to Contact God Himself</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>When we contact the Word, we need to be clear that we are contacting God Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Whenever we open the Bible, our first thought should be to contact the living God.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The living God has breathed out all that is within Himself as the Word.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>All the riches within Him are breathed out in the form of the word.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Every word of the Bible, from the first to the last, is the breath of God.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The Bible is not for us to study philosophy or literature.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>It is for us to contact what God has breathed out, what He has exhaled.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Brothers and sisters, this is not a light matter.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Unless we have the concept that we are coming to God and contacting Him, our focus will be wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The first thought we should have, the first step we should take, when we open the Scriptures is to prepare ourselves to contact God.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>We are reading what God has breathed out.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>God has breathed His breath upon these words.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>We should not have the thought that we are reading teachings or literature.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Rather, we are altogether contacting the manifested God, the God who has revealed Himself through His speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The God who dwells in unapproachable light, who cannot be touched or known, has revealed Himself through the Word.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>In fact He Himself is the Word, and He is embodied in the Word.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Now He has put the Word, which is His breath, before us.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>When we study the Word, contact the Word, we are actually contacting God Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Many people ask why they do not receive anything when they read the Word.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>I would like to ask, When you read the Word, do you have the thought that you are coming to a book of letters, or do you have the thought that you are coming to the living word that has been breathed out from God?</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>This thought is very crucial.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Many brothers and sisters do not have this thought when they come to the Word.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>They think that they are reading merely words printed on paper.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>At the most they think that they are studying teachings, commandments, or doctrines.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>It is no wonder they do not receive a living supply.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>We need a consciousness that the Bible is the Word of God; it is God s speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>God has released Himself through His speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>He is embodied in the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Hence, when we come to the Bible, we should have the consciousness that we are contacting the revealed and released God.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>We are not touching merely letters; we are touching the living God.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>We are not touching merely teachings; we are touching a God who has breathed Himself out.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>In order to properly approach the Word, we must have this thought and prepare ourselves accordingly.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Exercising the Spirit</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Rather Than the Mind</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>With this initial understanding we can proceed further.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>We need to exercise our spirit rather than our mind whenever we study the Word.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>This is a trying lesson for many people.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>They may not agree and say, Who can study without using his mind?</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>It seems as if this is an unreasonable demand.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>But I would ask, Is there a difference between reading the Bible and reading a newspaper?</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>We will derive no value from exercising our spirit to read a newspaper.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>We should exercise our mind when we read a newspaper, asking ourselves about the content of an article or an editorial.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>We need to use our mind to analyze and understand international news, politics, and financial reports.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>But we must take a different approach when we read the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>When we come to the Word, our first thought should be that God can be released through these pages because these words are the very breath of God.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>God has spoken and revealed Himself through these words.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>We need to exercise our spirit, not our mind, when we read the Bible because God is Spirit John 4:24 .</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>We must believe that the more we turn from our mind to our spirit, our reading of the Scriptures will be proper.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>A brother once said that he received much light in his study of the Bible one morning.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>When I asked what light he had seen, he replied that he realized that Adam lacked one rib.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>I asked how he came to this conclusion, and he said that as he was reading Genesis 2, he pondered on how Eve could have been made from Adam s rib.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>He concluded that Adam must have lacked one rib.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>I pointed my finger at his head and said, Brother, your mind has killed you!</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>If you study the Bible in this way, you will never receive genuine light.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>You will forever be in darkness.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>This is not the way to study the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>In reading the Word, we must turn from our mind in order to release our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>It is very difficult for one who has never received any education, who is illiterate, to read the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>However, those who are able to read the Bible need to turn from their mind and exercise their spirit in order to receive any benefit.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>There is much to learn in this matter.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Let us use an example to see the difference between reading the Bible with the mind or with the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>If a person exercises only his mind when reading Genesis 1 concerning God s creation of the heavens and the earth, he may wonder when the creation occurred.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Was it six thousand years ago, or was it ten thousand years ago?</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>There is no limit to the questions one can ask.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>If a person is a geologist or has books on geology, his mind will dominate.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>He may set the Bible aside and pull out a book on geology to investigate the subject.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>With ten minutes or even ten hours of this kind of reading, he will not touch God.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>On the contrary, he will lose God s presence when he reads in this way.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>His mind will be full of knowledge, but his spirit will be dry.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>When he comes out of his library, he will be irritable; any slight provocation will cause him to lose his temper.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>This shows that his reading did not bring God into him.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Rather, it brought him into his flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>This is not an exaggeration.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>God s children commonly face this difficulty when they come to the Word.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>Even I studied the Bible in this way after I was saved.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>When I opened the New Testament to Matthew 1:1, which speaks of the son of Abraham, I asked, Who was Abraham?</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>If I could not determine this, immediately I looked it up in reference books.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>I eventually determined that Abraham was the father of the Jews, the father of Isaac and the grandfather of Jacob.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>Then more questions came.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>Who was Isaac?</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>Who was Jacob?</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>I was so completely occupied with reference books that there was no time remaining to continue reading the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>The more I looked in reference books, the more confused I became, and the more I was distracted from the verse itself.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>My spirit was dry, my heart was ill-tempered, and I received no supply.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>If this is the way we read, there is no value to it.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>Many new believers and even some long-time students of the Bible have only this kind of experience.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>When brothers ask me to recommend reference books, I am reluctant because my recommendation could damage them.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>It is better to have fewer books at our disposal when we come to the Word.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>It is best if we have only one book the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>We do not need to refer to any other material.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>If there is a need for a reference, that reference should be God.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>When we come to the Bible, our first thought should not be that we are coming to a book on knowledge or ethics; instead, we are coming to God who has revealed Himself through His speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>When we come to the Word, we are contacting the living God.</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>We do not need reference material, and we do not need to struggle with our mind.</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>We only need to contact the living God by exercising our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>If we read Genesis 1:1 with the exercise of our spirit, we will worship God, saying, Praise You.</S>
   <S PAR='98' RSNT='1' SNO='98'>You are the beginning.</S>
   <S PAR='99' RSNT='1' SNO='99'>Without You there is no beginning.</S>
   <S PAR='100' RSNT='1' SNO='100'>Everything begins with You.</S>
   <S PAR='101' RSNT='1' SNO='101'>This will enable us to immediately touch God in our spirit, not in our mind.</S>
   <S PAR='102' RSNT='1' SNO='102'>This is altogether a matter of our spirit touching the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='103' RSNT='1' SNO='103'>We may read the verse again: In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='104' RSNT='1' SNO='104'>This may prompt us to worship God, saying, You are the Creator.</S>
   <S PAR='105' RSNT='1' SNO='105'>Everything is of You.</S>
   <S PAR='106' RSNT='1' SNO='106'>You are the Initiator, the Inaugurator, of everything.</S>
   <S PAR='107' RSNT='1' SNO='107'>Without You there is no beginning.</S>
   <S PAR='108' RSNT='1' SNO='108'>Without You there is no heaven, and there is no earth.</S>
   <S PAR='109' RSNT='1' SNO='109'>Without You there is no universe.</S>
   <S PAR='110' RSNT='1' SNO='110'>This does not require the exercise of our mind.</S>
   <S PAR='111' RSNT='1' SNO='111'>It is fully a matter of contacting the living God with our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='112' RSNT='1' SNO='112'>Studying the Bible in this way does not require ten minutes.</S>
   <S PAR='113' RSNT='1' SNO='113'>Rather, our spirit can be filled in five minutes.</S>
   <S PAR='114' RSNT='1' SNO='114'>As we leave for work in the morning, we still may be saying, In the beginning God...In the beginning God...God created...God created...Praise You.</S>
   <S PAR='115' RSNT='1' SNO='115'>You are the beginning of everything.</S>
   <S PAR='116' RSNT='1' SNO='116'>You created everything.</S>
   <S PAR='117' RSNT='1' SNO='117'>Just a few minutes and a few words enable us to touch God.</S>
   <S PAR='118' RSNT='1' SNO='118'>Our inner being will touch God, and we will enjoy Him.</S>
   <S PAR='119' RSNT='1' SNO='119'>God s children need to see that whenever we come to His Word, we should be convicted in our heart that this Word is the speaking forth of the living God.</S>
   <S PAR='120' RSNT='1' SNO='120'>We should not study it with our mind; instead, we should contact it with our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='121' RSNT='1' SNO='121'>There is no need to understand the Bible too much.</S>
   <S PAR='122' RSNT='1' SNO='122'>Please give me the liberty to say that for many people, the more they understand the Bible, the worse their spiritual life becomes.</S>
   <S PAR='123' RSNT='1' SNO='123'>This is not a matter of understanding the Bible but a matter of contacting the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='124' RSNT='1' SNO='124'>The Bible is indeed a wonderful book.</S>
   <S PAR='125' RSNT='1' SNO='125'>The way to approach it is not to understand it but to contact it, touch it, and enjoy it.</S>
   <S PAR='126' RSNT='1' SNO='126'>Once a young brother asked me whether reading the Bible was useful since he did not understand much of what he read.</S>
   <S PAR='127' RSNT='1' SNO='127'>He said, I read the second half of the book of Exodus, and all I saw was the materials, the construction, and the dimensions of the tabernacle.</S>
   <S PAR='128' RSNT='1' SNO='128'>The more I read, the more confused I am.</S>
   <S PAR='129' RSNT='1' SNO='129'>What is the purpose of reading?</S>
   <S PAR='130' RSNT='1' SNO='130'>I answered, Dear brother, let me suggest an experiment.</S>
   <S PAR='131' RSNT='1' SNO='131'>Tomorrow morning when you wake up, change the way that you read, and see if there is a difference.</S>
   <S PAR='132' RSNT='1' SNO='132'>The next day he came to me and said, Brother Lee, there is a difference.</S>
   <S PAR='133' RSNT='1' SNO='133'>This morning when I opened up the book of Exodus, I still did not understand much of what I read, but I had the intention of coming to God and putting myself under His shining.</S>
   <S PAR='134' RSNT='1' SNO='134'>I said, Brother, this is very precious.</S>
   <S PAR='135' RSNT='1' SNO='135'>This is the right way.</S>
   <S PAR='136' RSNT='1' SNO='136'>When we read the Word, we should place ourselves under the shining of God s light.</S>
   <S PAR='137' RSNT='1' SNO='137'>We may read twenty-five chapters of Exodus, and our mind may lack understanding and be totally confused.</S>
   <S PAR='138' RSNT='1' SNO='138'>However, after fifteen minutes of coming to the Word in this way, we feel as if we have passed under God s shining.</S>
   <S PAR='139' RSNT='1' SNO='139'>We will be inwardly refreshed, cleansed, and enlightened.</S>
   <S PAR='140' RSNT='1' SNO='140'>This is the most valuable kind of reading.</S>
   <S PAR='141' RSNT='1' SNO='141'>This does not mean that we do not need to understand or remember anything when we read the Word, but understanding and memorization are secondary.</S>
   <S PAR='142' RSNT='1' SNO='142'>Our primary need is to pass through God s shining whenever we read the Word.</S>
   <S PAR='143' RSNT='1' SNO='143'>The Bible is a book for us to contact rather than to understand.</S>
   <S PAR='144' RSNT='1' SNO='144'>We contact sunshine every day even though we do not understand it.</S>
   <S PAR='145' RSNT='1' SNO='145'>We do not understand water, but we contact it every day.</S>
   <S PAR='146' RSNT='1' SNO='146'>To contact is one thing, and to understand is another.</S>
   <S PAR='147' RSNT='1' SNO='147'>Similarly, to receive is one thing, and to comprehend is another.</S>
   <S PAR='148' RSNT='1' SNO='148'>The Bible is not primarily for comprehension but for communication and reception.</S>
   <S PAR='149' RSNT='1' SNO='149'>Whenever we read God s Word, if we acknowledge that it is His very speaking and contact it with our spirit, our inner being will touch God and receive Him.</S>
