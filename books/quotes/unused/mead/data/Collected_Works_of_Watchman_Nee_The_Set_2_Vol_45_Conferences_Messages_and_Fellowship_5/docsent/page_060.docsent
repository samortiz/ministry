   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER ONE HUNDRED FIFTY-NINE THE VERDICT OF DEATH 2 Date: November 20, 1941</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Place: 7 Jordan Road, Kowloon, Hong Kong</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Scripture Reading: 2 Cor 1:8-10 DOCTRINE VERSUS LIGHT</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The verdict of death that we are speaking of here does not refer to death itself; rather, it refers to the reality, inevitability, and unavoidability of the work of death in man.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>This verdict removes man's trust in himself and turns him to God alone.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>But we have two questions: How do we know whether we have received this light, and how do we know whether God has done this work in us?</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>We have to know what is doctrine and what is light.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>If someone tells us about something and then we have to do it ourselves, we have received a doctrine.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>But when revelation and light touches us, it produces an immediate effect.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>For example, if the doctor says that you are seriously sick, he will immediately take you to the operation room.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>God's word is powerful, because when He says, "Let there be light," there is light.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>God does not say, "Let there be light," and then ask us to go and find light or create light.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>It is a characteristic of spiritual things that as soon as God says something, it is done.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>We do not have to worry about how God does a work; we only need to worry whether God has spoken.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>It is wrong for the ears to pick up something and for the hands to try to act upon it.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>As soon as Paul saw God's great light, he asked, "Lord, what wilt thou have me to do?"</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Acts 9:6, KJV .</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>God did not preach to him, yet he was able to ask such a question.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Much of our problem lies in the fact that we do not know what we should do.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>There is no short cut, and no doctrine can substitute for light.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>THE CHARACTERISTIC OF LIGHT</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>A brother from Mongolia once stayed in Shanghai for eight months.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>When he was ready to leave, he asked me to lay hands on him and to send him out for the work.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>I did not do it.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Later he went to Tientsin and wrote a letter to me telling me all the things he had seen while he was in Shanghai.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>After I read the letter, I became very angry and tore the letter apart.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>I said in my heart, "What do you really know?"</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>If someone says that he has fallen from a seven-story building and tells you exactly what was going on every second during the fall, he must be lying.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The most skillful liars will say the same thing every time.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Paul related his story three times, and every time it was different.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>This is because the light confused him.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Before he received the light, he was able to ride a horse; but afterwards, he could only proceed by allowing others to hold his hand.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>He could no longer tell the east from the west or the north from the south.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>One characteristic of being enlightened is becoming unclear.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Abraham's virtue rested in his ignorance; he could not do anything but wait for God's instructions.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The first result of all spiritual revelation is confusion.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>This is absolutely opposite to the tree of the knowledge of good and evil.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The tree of the knowledge of good and evil makes one clear.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>But one begins to trust in God when he is in a state of confusion.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>SPIRITUAL FACTS</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Spiritual matters have nothing to do with doctrines; they have to do with facts.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Mental apprehension, anxiety, or concern have no place in spiritual things.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>What counts are the facts.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>All that matters is whether or not there are the facts.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The more a person asks questions, the more it proves that he is in darkness.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>When a man has the light, he will see.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>He sees because he is in the light.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>All problems will go away when he sees.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>But if he does not have the light, he will ask all kinds of questions.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>He will ask about the color or shape of an object.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>But these questions will disappear once he has the light and sees.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Spiritual confusion does not lead to doubt, but doctrines lead to questionings.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>We need a fundamental dealing, a genuine shining, and a thorough blow from the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Only the verdict of death will result in the genuine denial of the self; only then will we trust in God, not in ourselves.</S>
