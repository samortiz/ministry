<H2 CLASS=HEAD2>C. Not Determining to Know Anything<br>except Jesus Christ and This One Crucified</H2><P>Paul also said, "I did not determine to know anything among you except Jesus Christ, and this One crucified" (1 Cor. 2:2). Many in today's Christianity determine to know everything except the cross. In today's Christian bookstores, there are books about things such as dating and marriage life but very little about the genuine, intrinsic significance of the cross of Christ, which crosses us out and ushers in Christ.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>D. Boasting in the Cross of Our Lord Jesus Christ</H2><P>Paul also said, "Far be it from me to boast except in the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ, through whom..I [have been crucified] to the world" (Gal. 6:14). We have no boast but the cross.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>E. Crucifying the Flesh</H2><P>Paul also said, "They who are of Christ Jesus have crucified the flesh with its passions and its lusts" (Gal. 5:24). Merely to resist temptations is insufficient. We must crucify our flesh with its passions and lusts.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>F. Conformed to the Death of Christ</H2><P>Paul lived a life to be conformed to the death of Christ (Phil. 3:10). The more he lived, the more he was in the pattern, the mold, of Christ's death.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>G. No Possibility of Having the Genuine Christian Perfection without the Cross of Christ</H2><P>Thus, how could we have the genuine Christian perfection without the cross of Christ?</P>
