   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>SANCTIFICATION BY THE WORD AND THE SPIRIT</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>This sanctification takes place by the Word, which is truth, and by the Spirit, which is the Spirit of truth.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In these four chapters of John the Word and the Spirit are mentioned again and again.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Actually, the Word and the Spirit are one.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>I thank the Lord that so many of us have come back to the Word and are getting into the Word every day.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>As we come to the Word every morning, outwardly we touch the Word, but inwardly the Spirit touches us.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>By the Word and by the Spirit, both of which are the reality, we are sanctified.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>To be sanctified is not merely to be separated from the world; it is to move out of ourselves and into the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>If you check with your experience, you will see that the more you touch the Word and the more the Spirit touches you, the more you move out of yourself.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>You move from one dwelling place, the self, to another dwelling place, the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Every day we need to make this move.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>If we do not move out of ourselves, we are wrong; for in the self there is worldliness, ambition, self-exaltation, and opinion.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>LEARNING TO DEAL WITH OUR OPINIONS</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>We may apply this to the practical situation in the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Now is the time for the church in Anaheim as well as for all the other churches to be built.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>In order for the church to be built, we need to come together for the church service.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Regarding this, the leading ones are quite cautious because they do not want the saints to be offended.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Do you know what causes the saints to be offended?</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>It is the self with its ambition and self-exaltation.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Suppose you are troubled because someone else is made a leader instead of you.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>If you are troubled in this way because of your ambition, you should get into the Word right away and allow the Spirit to touch you.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Then you will be able to move out of yourself and declare, Angels and demons, I do not care who the leader is.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>I will not remain in myself.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Instead, I will move out of myself into the Triune God and remain in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>In the service of the church the most damaging element is not ambition nor self-exaltation; it is opinion.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Apparently, opinion is not as ugly as self-exaltation.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>We may express our opinion in a meek and humble way.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Nevertheless, in the service of the church the first lesson we need to learn is to say, I don t know.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>If you say that you already know what to do in the church service, it indicates that you have an opinion.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>But if you say, I don t know, it reveals that you are willing to serve, but do not know how to serve.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>How wonderful it would be if we all could say, I don t know!</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>In 1928, at the beginning of the work in Shanghai, a certain brother who had been a postmaster became a co-worker.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Not knowing what to do when he was first invited to a particular place to work for the Lord, he asked Brother Nee for advice.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Brother Nee replied, Simply learn to say, I don t know.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>If you say this whenever people ask you something, you will be the best co-worker.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>However, it is very difficult for us to say this.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>When we come to the service of the church, we all have the assurance that we know something.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Nevertheless, our need is to learn to say, I don t know.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>We learn to do this only by moving out of ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>If we remain in ourselves, we shall always think that we know a great deal.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>But if we move out of ourselves into the Triune God and remain in Him, we shall regard ourselves as knowing nothing.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>To know nothing means to have no opinion.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>When we are in the Triune God, we have no opinions.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The Lord s disciples afford us a good example of moving out of the self and into the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Before the Lord s resurrection, the disciples stayed in themselves and were very opinionated.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Peter, Martha, and even Mary had opinions.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>But in Acts 2 we see that the disciples had lost their opinions.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>In the Gospels they were in themselves, but in the Acts they had moved out of the self and into the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>A big move took place between the Gospels and the Acts.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Although an important work began in Acts 2, there were no conferences or discussions about it.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>When people are opinionated, they need conferences and discussions.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>But in Acts 2 there was no such need.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Not many Christians know how to be free from opinions.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>When we come together to serve with the saints, we all must learn to have no opinions.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>How can we be without opinions?</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>It is not by adjusting ourselves or by improving our behavior.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>It is by moving out of ourselves and into the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>This is a deeper understanding of sanctification.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Once we are out of ourselves, we are separated from worldliness, ambition, self-exaltation, and opinion.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Then we are separated not only unto God, but also into God.</S>
