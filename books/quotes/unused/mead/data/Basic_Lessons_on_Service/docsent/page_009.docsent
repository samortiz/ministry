   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>In our first lesson on service, we shared about how to meet.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The first meeting we should come to is the Lord's table meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Before we fellowship about the Lord's table meeting, we need to see the two categories of meetings in the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>I. THE MINISTRY MEETINGS</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>First, there are the ministry meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The ministry means the work.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The meetings for the work are for three basic purposes: preaching the gospel, giving a report of God's work, and reading the apostles' writing the Scripture .</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>A. To Preach the Gospel</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The work meetings, the ministry meetings, are for preaching the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Acts 2 shows the first preaching of the gospel conducted by Peter at the very beginning of the church life vv.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>6, 14 .</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>That was not a meeting of the church, but a meeting for the work, a ministry meeting, to preach the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>B. To Give a Report of God's Work</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The ministry meetings are also for giving a report of God's work.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>After Paul took his first evangelical trip, he came back to Antioch, from where he was sent, and called a meeting to give the saints a report concerning God's work among the Gentiles Acts 14:26-27 .</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>That was not a meeting of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>It was a meeting of the ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>C. To Read the Apostles' Writing the Scripture</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The ministry meetings are also for reading the apostles' writing the Scripture .</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>This is shown in Acts 15:30-31.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>After the conference in Jerusalem, the apostles and elders made a decision to write something.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Then some went out to gather the saints together and read this writing to them.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>This gathering was not a meeting of the church, but a meeting of the ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>At that time they were listening to the writing of the apostles.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Eventually, the apostles' writings became the Scripture.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>This implies that a ministry meeting may be for the purpose of reading and studying the Scripture.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>In the New Testament there are mainly three things carried out in the ministry meetings: preaching the gospel, giving a report of God's work, and studying and ministering the Word.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>When we come together to listen to the ministry of the Word, that is not a church meeting but a ministry meeting.</S>
