<P>To interpret the Bible properly is not an easy thing. Many have their own interpretation of what the Bible says, but we need the proper interpretation. We need the proper study of the Word and the proper understanding of the Word. Paul charged Timothy to be a person who cuts straight the word of the truth (2 Tim. 2:15). This is like the cutting of wood in carpentry. We have to learn how to cut straight the word of the truth properly without bias. This is to unfold the word of God in its various parts rightly and straightly without distortion.</P><P>We need to see from the proper interpretation of the holy Word that there was no organization with the earthly ministry of the Lord Jesus. In Acts there was no organization either. Acts 14:23 says that Paul appointed elders in the churches he had established. There is no record, though, of how the elders in the church in Jerusalem were produced. Maybe the twelve became the spontaneous elders there because they initiated the church life, but there is no definite record of this. The first definite record of the appointment of the elders is in Acts 14:23.</P><P>After Paul appointed these elders, he returned to Antioch. Acts 15 then tells us of the big problem concerning the heresy of those who said that circumcision was required in order for one to be saved. Paul, Barnabas, and others went to Jerusalem, and this problem was solved. After coming back to Antioch, Paul proposed to his co-worker, Barnabas, that they return to "visit the brothers in every city in which we announced the word of the Lord, and see how they are doing" (v. 36). This was just a short time after the appointment of the elders in these cities. These churches and their elders were new and young. Thus, Paul had a sincere concern for them. After the appointment of these elders, Paul went back to take care of them. This shows it is wrong to say that after the appointment of the elders by the apostles that the apostles should keep their hands off the church, leaving the church absolutely in the hands of the elders.</P><P>The apostle Paul went back personally to visit the churches he had established. As we have seen, he had a concern for the church in Ephesus, and he called for the elders there to come to him. He charged the elders concerning what to do. He also wrote letters to the churches, such as his letter to the church in Corinth. He did not go to Rome, but he wrote a letter to the Romans. He wrote a number of letters to different churches to take care of them, even after the appointment of the elders. This shows that the apostles never gave up the churches.</P>
