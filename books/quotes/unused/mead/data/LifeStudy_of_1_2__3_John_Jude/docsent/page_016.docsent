   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>ENJOYING GOD AS LIGHT</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In 1:5 John says, And this is the message which we have heard from Him and announce to you, that God is light, and in Him is no darkness at all.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In addition to the three main things in the preceding verses life, fellowship, and joy a further message, which the apostles have heard from the Lord, is to announce to the believers that God is light.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>First we have the divine life, and then out of this we have the fellowship of the divine life.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Fellowship issues in joy.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>When we are in this joyful element of the fellowship, we are in the light of God.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Therefore, the sequence is life, fellowship, joy, and light.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>In the preceding verses, the Father and Son are mentioned with clear words, and the Spirit is implied in the fellowship of the eternal life.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Here God is mentioned for the first time in this Epistle, and He is mentioned as the Triune God the Father, the Son, and the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>This God, as revealed in the light of the gospel, is light.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The message that John and the other early disciples heard was, undoubtedly, the word spoken by the Lord Jesus in John 8:12 and 9:5 that He is the light.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>However, John says here that the message was that God is light.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>This indicates that the Lord Jesus is God and implies the essence of the Divine Trinity.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The expression, God is light, like God is love in 4:8 and 16, and God is Spirit in John 4:24, is used not in a metaphoric sense but in a predicative sense.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>These expressions denote and describe the nature of God.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>In His nature God is Spirit, love, and light.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Spirit denotes the nature of God s Person; love, the nature of God s essence; and light, the nature of God s expression.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Both love and light are related to God as life, which life is of the Spirit Rom 8:2 .</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>God, Spirit, and life are actually one.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>God is Spirit, and Spirit is life.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Within such a life are love and light.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>When this divine love appears to us, it becomes grace, and when this divine light shines upon us, it becomes truth.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>John s Gospel reveals that the Lord Jesus has brought grace and truth to us John 1:14, 17 that we may have the divine life John 3:14-16 , whereas his Epistle unveils that the fellowship of the divine life brings us to the very sources of grace and truth, which are the divine love and the divine light.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>His Epistle is the continuation of his Gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>In his Gospel it was God in the Son coming to us as grace and truth that we may become His children John 1:12-13 .</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>In his Epistle it is we, the children, in the fellowship of the Father s life, coming to the Father to participate in His love and light.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The former was God coming out to the outer court to meet our need at the altar Lev 4:28-31 ; the latter is we entering into the Holy of Holies to contact Him at the ark Exo 25:22 .</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>This is further and deeper in the experience of the divine life.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>After receiving the divine life in John s Gospel by believing in the Son, we should go on to enjoy this life in his Epistle through the fellowship of this life.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>His entire Epistle discloses to us this one thing, that is, the enjoyment of the divine life by abiding in its fellowship.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>God is Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>This refers to His Person.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>God is also love and light.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Love refers to His essence, and light, to His expression.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Both God s love and light are related to His life.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>This life is actually God Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Life is also the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>When this life was manifested, it came with grace and truth.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>When we received the Lord Jesus, we received life, and we now enjoy grace and truth.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>This life brings us back to God.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>First, God came to us so that we may receive grace and truth.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Now we go back to the Father and contact Him as the source of grace and truth, and this source is love and light.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Going back to the Father, we may enjoy love as the source of grace and light as the source of truth.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Therefore, in the fellowship of the divine life, we are being brought back to God to enjoy love as the source of grace and light as the source of truth.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>This understanding of love and light is not derived from human reasoning; it comes from the divine revelation in the Word.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>In this revelation we have a number of items for our enjoyment, comparable to many courses of a feast.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>We have God, the Spirit as the nature of God s person, love as the nature of God s essence, light as the nature of God s expression, the divine life, grace, and truth.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>When we have all these divine things, we are brought back to God the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>When we are brought back to the Father, we meet Him and enjoy Him as love, which is the source of grace, and light, which is the source of truth.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>How marvelous that in the fellowship of the divine life we enjoy the divine light!</S>
