This source is not in the saints but in God. If the source of faith were in the saints, faith would be fragile. Who could have faith? Many children of God sadly sigh over their lack of great faith. Some lack not only great faith but even small faith. We often acknowledge that we have no faith. We wish for greater faith so that we can trust God and He can perform daily miracles for us. We wish for practical faith so that we can commit everything into the hand of God with ease and calmness. "If only we could have greater faith, everything would be fine." This is our wish. "If only we could have faith like So-and-so, then everything would be all right." This is our word of admiration. How often have we asked the Lord to increase our faith? But why do we still lack faith? Does faith only belong to a certain privileged class of saints? Is there truly no way for us to obtain greater faith? There is a way in the Lord. But only those who want faith can obtain it.</P><P>The cry of the saints today is for greater faith. But where does greater faith come from? The saints aspire to have greater faith in themselves. Is this a mistake? Yes, the mistake of saints is that they want to have greater faith in themselves. They seek faith from the wrong source. No wonder they never get it!</P><P>We all ask ourselves, "Do I have faith?" "Can I trust God regarding this matter?" "Is my faith sufficient?" The answers to these questions are always "No" and "I cannot"! What a great grief it is! We should not ask these questions. We are not the source of faith, so we cannot expect ourselves to have greater faith. The more we ask ourselves and search, seek, and look within ourselves, the more we feel we have no faith or very little faith! What is the reason for this? The reason is that we are not the source of faith. Since the source of faith is not within us, we cannot obtain faith if we turn within ourselves to search for it. Therefore, we must learn a lesson: we are not the source of faith. When we examine ourselves, we cannot see or feel that we have faith.</P><P>The Word of God tells us what the source of faith really is: "Faith...not of yourselves; it is the gift of God" (Eph. 2:8). This verse of the Bible is more than clear; faith is given to us by God. A similar word is found in Acts 3:16: "The faith which is through Him." Therefore, we know that the source of faith is in God, not in us. This may seem very common, ordinary, and familiar to us. But there are not many who really understand the importance of the source of our faith. If we really understood that God is the source of our faith, we would never ask ourselves, "Do I have enough faith? Do I have faith?" These questions indicate that we still do not understand that God is the source of our faith, because if we did, we would not ask these questions.</P><P>God is the Giver of faith; God is the source of faith. Nevertheless, the fact that God is the source of faith does not mean merely that He gives faith to us. It means that men have faith or increase in faith through God because God is the source of their faith. In other words, men have faith or increase in faith because God possesses a nature that makes it easy for men to trust in Him.</P><P>What does this mean? It means that we do not have to ask, "Do we have faith? Is our faith sufficient?" These are not the most important questions. These questions will keep us in darkness and discouragement. We should ask, "Is God reliable? Is God honest? Is God trustworthy? Will God break His promises? Are God's power and love real?" Because we always pay attention to ourselves, the more we search, the more we are unable to find our faith. If we pay attention to God, we will find that faith comes spontaneously. Faith does not originate in ourselves. No wonder faith cannot be found when we examine ourselves! Faith originates with God. The more we look at God, look to God, and meditate on God, the more we will have faith.</P><P>An illustration may help us understand this teaching. Once a few brothers came to talk with me about the issue of faith. They felt that they had too little faith. But I told them that it was not their faith that was too little, but their God. If they wanted to have greater faith, they needed to have a greater God. That day I told them that faith means committing ourselves and our things to someone else. Believing in God means committing ourselves and our things to God and trusting in Him to accomplish these things for us. I asked, "When you commit your things to somebody else, do you ask, `Do I have the faith to trust this person? Is my faith sufficient to trust him?'" You never ask these kinds of questions. Rather, you ask, "Can I trust him?" You do not ask, "Do I have faith in him?" Suppose you are an owner of a store, and you hire a manager and commit your business entirely to him. When you hired him, you did not ask, "Do I have faith in him? Is my faith too little? Do I have to increase my faith in him?" Instead, you asked yourself, "Can I trust him? Is he honest? Is he faithful? Is he reliable?" Since he was honest, trustworthy, and reliable, you spontaneously committed your entire business into his hand. You did not have to ask yourself if you had faith or if your faith was great or sufficient.</P><P>Similarly you should trust in God. You do not have to ask, "Do I have faith? Is my faith great and sufficient? How much more should my faith be increased?" All you have to ask is, "Is God honest? Is God faithful? Is God reliable? Will God regret His promise and break His word?" If God is honest, faithful, and reliable, and if He promises and will not repent, then you do not have to search and examine yourselves to see if you have faith. You will spontaneously commit yourselves and your things to the hand of God. This is faith. Faith is not something produced from within. It is a trust that arises out of the fact that the other party is honest, stable, trustworthy, and reliable. Therefore, what is lacking is not greater faith but a greater God.</P><P>Most of the time, we do not dare commit ourselves and our things to God under the pretext that our faith is too small. Actually, the reason we do not dare commit ourselves to God is neither the absence of our faith nor the smallness of our faith. Rather, we think that God is not reliable. If God is faithful, why do we not rely on Him? If God is trustworthy, why do we not put our trust in Him? If God is reliable, why do we not depend on Him? If God will not break His word, why do we not rely on Him according to His promise? We are afraid that our God is muddle-headed, unreliable, dishonest, and always breaking His promises. This is the reason we do not have faith. Now is the time for us to confess our sins. We know a bank is honest and reliable. This is why we deposit our money in it. We ask if the bank is trustworthy; we do not ask if we have faith in the bank. When a baby is in danger, his fear ceases and he is at peace when he just touches his father's hand or mother's face. He will not trust anyone else because they are not trustworthy to him. He trusts in his parents because they are trustworthy.</P><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_066.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_068.html">Next</a> </body></html>
