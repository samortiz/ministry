It is more difficult to speak of Christ as man than to speak of Him as God. Man is very ordinary; there is almost nothing special about being a man. However, the apostle Paul said, &#8220;For there is one God and one Mediator of God and men, the man Christ Jesus.&#8221; This means that the Lord Jesus is not only God but also man; hence, He is qualified to be the Mediator, the go-between, of God and men. This does not mean that He tired of being God and became a man instead, after which He became God again. Rather, in eternity He was God and not man, but two thousand years ago He was born of the virgin Mary through the Holy Spirit to be a man. Since then He is both God and man; He is the God-man.<p>As a man, the Lord Jesus was not remarkable in appearance; He was an ordinary man. One time He entered the city of Jericho, and people crowded around to see Him. Zaccheus was there too, but being small in stature, he climbed up in a sycamore tree in order to see Jesus. As He came to that place, Jesus looked up and spoke to Zaccheus (Luke 19:1-5). If the Lord Jesus had been tall in stature, Zaccheus would not have needed to climb a tree in order to see Him. Moreover, verse 5 indicates that the Lord may have recognized Zaccheus before Zaccheus recognized Him. If the Lord Jesus truly had a remarkable appearance, Zaccheus should have recognized Him first. The Israelites have a wrong concept in thinking that the Messiah is One who is excellent in appearance. The prophet Isaiah said, &#8220;His appearance was marred more than that of any man,/And His form more than that of the sons of men....He has no attracting form nor majesty that we should look upon Him,/Nor beautiful appearance that we should desire Him&#8221; (Isa. 52:14; 53:2). This is the man Jesus!<p>It is remarkable that in the record of the four Gospels we rarely find expressions such as benevolent, just, moral, and good, which are used to describe the sages. We see, however, a man whose living was a human living, yet it was so wonderful, extraordinary, and perfect that even expressions used by the followers of Confucius for human relationships, morality, and benevolence cannot fully depict it. Although He lived a human life, His living far exceeded benevolence and morality; it is indescribable with human vocabulary. We always create an appropriate vocabulary to express what we have in our human culture, but in human society no one has ever lived a life that was like the one lived by the Lord Jesus as recorded in the four Gospels. Hence, there is no human vocabulary to express that kind of living.<p>In Luke 10 a certain lawyer of the Pharisees stood up and put Jesus to the test. He was elated, considering himself to be wise, unashamed to be a teacher of the Mosaic law, who understood the essence of God&#8217;s law, that is, to love God and to love one&#8217;s neighbor. Wanting to justify himself before the Lord Jesus, he asked Him, &#8220;Who is my neighbor?&#8221; (vv. 25-29). Then the Lord Jesus told a story, a parable that was marvelous yet easy to understand (vv. 30-35). It seems that He used that story to tell the lawyer, &#8220;You are elated and self-justified, yet you do not realize that you are the man who fell from Jerusalem to the place of curse and who was beaten on the way. The Jewish religionists have beaten you half dead, stripped you, and left you alone, and the priests and the Levites, the moralists, have passed by and ignored you. Only a good Samaritan, who was journeying, was moved with compassion toward you and has cared for you in a detailed way. Do you still remember that formerly you said that I am a Samaritan and have a demon (John 8:48-49)? I do not have a demon, but I am definitely a &#8216;Samaritan,&#8217; a lowly person whom you have despised and slandered. I am your neighbor, and only I can take care of you by pouring oil and wine on your wounds to anoint and heal you. I am the very neighbor who loves you.&#8221;<p>This story implies some deep matters. It shows us that we were fallen people &#8220;beaten half dead&#8221; and &#8220;stripped of our clothing.&#8221; Neither the religionists nor the moralists can save us. However, the Lord is the good Samaritan. He was God who became a despised man to pass through human life for us and journey through human life as we do. When He came, He not only saved us but also healed and soothed us with oil and wine. Furthermore, He carried us on His own beast, not in an impressive car or on a big horse but on a little donkey. He brought us to the inn, the church, not in a way to show off His mightiness but in a lowly manner. The Lord did not use a big hotel but a small inn as a type of the church. He entrusted us to the care of the small inn. He also promised that He will return and repay for us all the necessary expenses. Oh, what a sweet and lowly One He is! Actually, good is not adequate to describe the sweetness of His conduct. His kindness, which is far beyond what man can measure, is more than just sacrificing oneself for others. We cannot find any expression on earth to adequately describe His beauty. This is our Lord, the One who is altogether pleasant. He is truly a man, the Man among all men and the Man above all men, outstanding and unequaled in beauty. However, His excellence is not in His appearance or merely in His great actions, but in many small things.<br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_012.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_014.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Four Crucial Elements of the Bible, The-Christ, the Spirit, Life, and the Church &nbsp; pg 13</div><br></body></html>
