   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>I. THE DIVINE TITLES OF THE SPIRIT</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>IN THE OLD TESTAMENT</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The first title of the Spirit in the Old Testament is the Spirit of God.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>This title is in Genesis 1:2.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Genesis 1:1 says that in the beginning God created the heavens and the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Then verse 2 says that the Spirit of God brooded over the death waters.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The second divine title of the Spirit in the Old Testament is the Spirit of Jehovah Judg.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>3:10a .</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>In Genesis 1 we have the title God, but in Genesis 2 we have another title, Jehovah, because in this chapter God begins to have contact with the man created by Him.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Therefore, Jehovah is a title used for God's contact with man.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>It denotes God's relationship with man.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Whenever God came to contact people in the Old Testament, He was the Spirit of Jehovah.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Psalm 51:11 and Isaiah 63:10-11 refer to the Spirit of holiness, but this is not a divine title of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The King James Version translates the Spirit of holiness into the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>This, however, is a wrong translation.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>"Thy Holy Spirit" in Psalm 51:11 should be "Your Spirit of holiness" according to the Hebrew, and "his Holy Spirit" in Isaiah 63:10-11 should be "His Spirit of holiness."</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The Spirit of holiness in Psalm 51:11 and Isaiah 63:10-11 is a description, not a title.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>It does not denote the third person of the Trinity.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The Spirit of holiness refers to the nature and the essence of God.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Andrew Murray pointed this out strongly.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The Spirit of holiness is a description of what God is.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>II.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>THE HOLY SPIRIT CONCERNS</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>THE INITIATION OF GOD'S NEW TESTAMENT ECONOMY</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>RELATED TO THE CONCEPTIONS OF</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>JOHN THE BAPTIST AND THE LORD JESUS</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The title the Holy Spirit is not used in the Old Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>It was used particularly at the time when the New Testament economy started first at the coming of John the Baptist and then at the coming of the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>These two comings actually were one initiation of the New Testament economy.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The New Testament economy was initiated by the conception of John the Baptist and the conception of the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>With these two conceptions, the Bible started to use a new divine title, that is, the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Actually, according to the Greek, the title the Holy Spirit can be translated literally as the Spirit the Holy.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The Spirit of God, the Spirit of Jehovah, is the Spirit the Holy.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The Holy refers to the separated One, the sanctified One.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>In the New Testament economy, everything must be separated unto God, sanctified unto God, made holy to God.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The Spirit of God now is the Spirit the Holy, the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The Holy Spirit concerns the initiation of God's New Testament economy related to the conceptions of John the Baptist and the Lord Jesus Luke 1:15, 31-35; Matt 1:18, 20 .</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>When the New Testament age began, the Bible used a particular name to denote the Spirit of God.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The Spirit of God is the Spirit the Holy, the Holy Spirit.</S>
