   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER FOUR A BIRD'S-EYE VIEW</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Before proceeding further, we need a bird's-eye view of God's building in the entire Scriptures, especially in the first two books.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Genesis and Exodus.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The sixty-six books of the Bible contain many things, but we must be clear concerning the over-all view of the central matter.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>What do we see when we look at the entire Bible with a bird's-eye view?</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>One central thing stands out the building.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>If we do not have a view whereby we see all things related to this matter of building, we do not understand the Scriptures.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>We may read and reread, but we do not have the proper understanding.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>We are just like one who is confined in a narrow cell, restricted by his narrow, human vision.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>We must have a heavenly vision to be clear about the whole of Scripture.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>IN GENESIS</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>With such a view the first two books of the Scriptures reveal clearly the things related to God's building.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The First Picture</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Remember the picture in Genesis 1 and 2, the first picture related to God's building.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>There we saw a tree with a flowing river, and out of that flowing river came gold, pearl and precious stone, the materials for God's building.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>By carefully considering that picture in the light of the whole Bible, we realize that it portrays God as life to us.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>If man partakes of the fruit of the tree of life, he receives God into him as life; then God's life flows within that man, transforming him into precious materials.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>In the garden of Eden, Adam was a piece of clay.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>But in the New Jerusalem, the saints are precious materials.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>There are no men of clay there.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The twelve gates of the Holy City are named after the twelve tribes of Israel Rev 21:12 , but the outstanding thing concerning those gates is that they are all pearls Rev 21:21 .</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The twelve tribes of Israel originally consisted of men of clay.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The twelve foundations of the city are named after the twelve Apostles Rev 21:14 , that is, Peter, James, John, etc.; but these twelve foundations are made of twelve kinds of precious stone Rev 21:19-20 .</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>These Apostles also were originally pieces of clay.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>How could the twelve tribes of Israel and the twelve Apostles become pearls and precious stones?</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The answer is that they all must be transformed.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>In the garden of Eden man was nothing but clay.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>But in the New Jerusalem, he has become not only stone, but precious stone, as well as pearl and gold three precious items.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>In the beginning of Scripture, there is a corporate man made of clay, containing nothing precious.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>But at the end of Scripture, there is another corporate man, a greatly enlarged corporate man, a city.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>And in this city there is nothing of clay or earth.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Everything is gold, pearl and precious stone.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>All have been changed through the work of transformation.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>In the past, God accomplished His work of creation in six days, but in order to transform man He has used at least six thousand years.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>All Christians are in this daily process of transformation.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Why do Christians suffer?</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Many of us have a mistaken concept concerning suffering.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>We feel that we must have done something wrong; so we must suffer.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Yet frequently we have not behaved wrongly, and still we must suffer.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Why?</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Because such suffering is necessary for our transformation.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Many Christians are too raw.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>They must be cooked and even burnt; others must be pressed all that they may be transformed.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Throughout my entire Christian life I have had much enjoyment of the Lord, but on the other hand I have experienced trouble upon trouble.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>I need the troubles if I am going to be transformed.</S>
