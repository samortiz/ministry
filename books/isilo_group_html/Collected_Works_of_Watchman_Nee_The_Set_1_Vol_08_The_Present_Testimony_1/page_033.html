For this reason, we must greatly honor our responsibility and take care that we glorify God's name in our work. As The Present Testimony now enters its third year of publication in Shanghai, we would take this opportunity to say something concerning this magazine.</P><P>Today there are numerous books and magazines; each has its own responsibility, and each serves its own purpose. Many spiritual teachings and scriptural expositions are helpful, but they are not within our function. Others may do them, but they are not within the limits that the Lord has measured to us. We do not want to step beyond our boundaries and tread upon others' ground. We have seen that the main lack in the church of God today is Christ and Him crucified. This is not only an historical event; this is God's never-changing spiritual principle which He desires His church to confirm in her experience. We consider this as the center of all truths, and all other matters are merely secondary. Therefore, besides specific preaching on the spiritual principles of God, there are no Bible expositions or other such things in our magazine. Those things are good but they are not our task. The Lord is now teaching us not to argue, because once we argue we have fallen from our spiritual position. What is lacking now is life. This is true with individuals as well as with the church as a whole. We are short of the resurrection life of Christ, the life which overcomes death, the grave, and Hades. Today, almost all the terms in the Bible have lost their original meaning. The words are still the same, but what they denote is altogether different. The power which they speak of today is not the power which was spoken of before. The work which they speak of today is not the work which was spoken of before. Formerly, it was man being baptized into the death of Christ, but today baptism has become a religious form. Formerly, laying on of hands was for sympathy, but today it has become a formality. Things which were full of life and spiritual reality have now become mere empty ritual. Even though matters such as preaching the gospel and sending missionaries abroad may be considered quite living, such things as these are very different from the situation in the beginning. Therefore, the need today is to be filled with the life of the Lord in order to obtain spiritual reality. When life comes, all the existing terminologies will then become our experience.</P><P>Our goal, therefore, is fixed on this alone. While many secondary matters are quite urgent, we cannot give our attention to them. We believe that if the children of God are filled with the resurrection life of Christ, they will be able to adequately take care of all secondary matters with ease. However, the basis of resurrection is death; death followed by resurrection is God's principle. Therefore, we repeatedly stress in our preaching the fact and the principle of dying with Christ. We realize that some will accept the principle but ignore the fact, and some will believe the fact but neglect the principle. In either case, their life will become abnormal. If a person disbelieves the fact of dying with Christ, yet acts according to its principle, he commits spiritual suicide. If he does not walk according to the principle of dying with Him, while only believing the fact, his belief is just spiritual ideology. Hence we emphasize both.</P><P>Presently, we know that we are bearing a lonely testimony. In this time when love has grown cold, teachers have increased, and ears are itching, we know that our testimony will be rejected by many. But we also know that our isolation is worthwhile. We reckon that we can afford to be isolated because we are standing on God's side. We thank God that during the past years and days He has given us many friends. We thank you for expressing sympathy towards us. Many have written letters to us to tell us how they have prayed for us.</P><P>During the past two years, we have sent out close to thirty thousand copies of our magazine. Although we have never asked directly or indirectly for help with the cost of printing and postage, the Lord has always moved the hearts of His children to send us contributions to help this publication. We are especially thankful to the Lord for not having received large sums of money or contributions from rich ones. What we have received are offerings of a few dollars and cents from ordinary believers. Since God has provided for us in this way in the past, we believe that He will be faithful in the same way in the future.</P><P>During the past two years, we have sent out a few hundred thousand gospel tracts. At times we have received reports concerning how they have saved people. Although the cost has been high, thank the Lord that we have not been lacking, and not once have we been without means when the bills from the print shop have come; every time we have paid the bills in full. This kind of work is still continuing this year. We hope to send out more tracts than last year. We want to take this opportunity to especially thank those brothers and sisters who have helped us.</P><P>I would like to say a few words concerning the books that I have written which are published by the Gospel Book Room, because there has been some conjecture from those outside. Since the time the Lord called me to serve Him full-time, I have seen one thing: in preaching the gospel for the Lord, there should not be any wages attached. The leprosy that grew on Gehazi's hands is my warning (2 Kings 5:20-27). This is why during the past few years, except for some freewill gifts which some have given to me through the Lord's prompting, I have not received one penny from my speaking or my writing. Although I have written some books, they have not increased my income at all. On the contrary, I have had to put in some of my own money. Such words should not need to be said. But like Paul (with whom I am most unworthy to compare myself ), I have to say a few words. In 2 Corinthians 11:7 and 17, the apostle considered his confession that he "announced the gospel of God to you free of charge" as a speaking that was "not according to the Lord but as if in foolishness, in this confidence of boasting." Yet in 12:11 he said, "I have become foolish; you yourselves have compelled me."</P><P>Allow me to say another frank word for the few sisters and the one brother who are co-working with me here. They have not lived by the support of the Gospel Book Room. They all look directly to God for their sustenance. Although no one knows their need, God has not permitted them to be in debt even until today. Although we the co-workers are like the apostle who had occasions "both to abound and to lack" (Phil. 4:12), in looking back over the past few years, we can only say one word: Ebenezer (1 Sam. 7:12).</P><P>As far as I myself am concerned, I am still partly resting and partly working. Although there are many things which I still cannot do, I have to thank God for what I can do! Concerning the question of the conference, we do not have any plan for now. If there is going to be one, many will want to come, and the lodging will be a problem. Regarding many who have written asking questions on the Bible, frankly speaking, I cannot reply. If I were to answer each question, I would need to open a Bible correspondence course. However, if there are problems concerning spiritual life, I might be able to allot a little time for them.</P><P>Some have asked for my opinion concerning a new translation of the New Testament by a certain place in Nanking. I would say that, in my opinion, it is not as good as the original version published by the Bible Society. At this time of confused voices, it is better for us to be a little more careful concerning any Bible published by private parties.</P><P>We feel most sorrowful concerning the news of the passing away of Miss Barber in Lo-hsing Pagoda, Fukien. She was one who was very deep in the Lord, and in my opinion, the kind of fellowship she had with the Lord and the faithfulness she expressed to the Lord are rarely found on this earth. In reading the hymn published on the cover of this issue of the magazine, one can imagine the kind of person she was.</P><P>The servant of Christ,<br>Watchman Nee<br>March 12, 1930</P><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_032.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_034.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Collected Works of Watchman Nee, The (Set 1) Vol. 08: The Present Testimony (1) &nbsp; pg 33</div><br></body></html>
