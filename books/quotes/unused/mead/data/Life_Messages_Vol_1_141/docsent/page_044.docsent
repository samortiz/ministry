   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER ELEVEN THE WAY WHICH LEADS TO LIFE</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>"For the gate is narrow and the way is constricted which leads to life, and few are those who find it" Matt 7:14 .</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Before we consider various aspects of the way which leads to life, we shall answer a few questions.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Could you clarify the distinction you made between living by Christ and living Christ?</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>I realize that to say "live Christ" is grammatically odd, but we had to invent this new term to express what is on our heart.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>If we are living by Christ, we are still doing the living.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>To live Christ means that Christ is our life Col 3:4 .</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>When we live, He lives.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>When He lives, we live.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Of the four legalities, what does sleeping represent?</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Usually spiritual sleep has a negative sense, but we need to be aware of its positive value also.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>To sleep means to rest from all activities.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>It is most healthful to have a time every day of doing nothing.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Do not think I mean meditation.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Just rest; be free from your thoughts and anxieties.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Most of us are too busy, and our minds are too active, worrying about ourselves or the problems in the church.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>It is hard to make a time to have a spiritual sleep, but if we do, it will make us spiritually healthy.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>This time is not for praying, not for reading the Word, and not for answering the phone.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>It is a time set aside just for rest.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>With all these legalities eating, breathing, drinking, and sleeping there is a need for us to exercise a strong will.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The will is the only part of our natural being that is useful to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>If we are to keep these legalities and the commandments in the New Testament, we need to ask the Lord to strengthen our will.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Gossiping does not take will power, but bringing ourselves to pray and read the Word surely does.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Sometimes when I am reading the Word or trying to pray, I get bored and fall asleep.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>It is hard for us fallen human beings to stop even for a short while.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>If we fall asleep, that will stop us.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>It is good for our health.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>How can we help those who have left the church?</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>If the Lord wants us to help some of these dear ones, He will give us a burden, prepare the situation, and afford us the opportunity.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>There is no need to be distressed.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Psalm 127:1 reminds us, "Except the Lord build the house, they labor in vain that build it: except the Lord keep the city, the watchman waketh but in vain."</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The Lord is the Head.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>If this is His recovery, His church, nothing can damage it.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The Lord told the Jews, "Destroy this temple, and in three days I will raise it up" John 2:19 , meaning that when they destroyed His body, He would raise up an even greater one in resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Is it all right to submit myself to someone?</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>This is a good question.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Many great men throughout history submitted themselves to someone or to some idea when they were young.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Even if you submit yourself to a wrong person, your submission is still healthy.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>One who has never submitted himself is raw and of little use.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Even materials like iron, copper, and cotton have to be processed before they can be put to use.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>This is God's ordination for us as human beings too.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Regrettably, the modern trend is to throw off this principle.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>As a child, submit to your parents.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>As a student, submit to your teachers and the other school authorities.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>If you are working, submit to your employer.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>To be successful, be successful in your submission!</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>In the church, even if the elders are not so adequate, your position is to submit.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>This will help your growth.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>There is more need in the church for submission on the part of the young people.</S>
