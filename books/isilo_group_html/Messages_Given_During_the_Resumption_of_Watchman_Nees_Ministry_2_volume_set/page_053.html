We confess that we are not godly enough and do not have the adequate knowledge. We need You to open up our eyes within. Every time we come together, we need Your precious blood to cleanse us.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE BASIC PROBLEM</H2><P>We may be a proper Christian, and we may manage a church well, but this is not enough to meet the need of this age. We need to understand our basic problem before we can consider the question of methodology. What God wants to do is to work Himself into us. There is no problem with God in this matter. But with man there is a big problem.</P><P>If we want to put water into a bottle, we can do it any time. We do not have to preach to the bottle or have the bottle's consent. But man is not so simple; he is living. I do not know how many people there are who are willing to be filled with God as a result of these few evenings' meetings.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE ULTIMATE GOAL OF GOD'S SALVATION&#151;<br>WORKING HIMSELF INTO MAN</H2><P>The man whom God wants to gain is a person fully endowed with a free will. God's mind is higher than man's mind. But man's mind is nevertheless very complicated. In addition, he is full of emotion. For this reason, if man wants to be filled, his will must first be put under subjection. It is hard to chop a piece of wood with uneven grain because it is too complicated. Only wood with even grain is good for chopping. God picked up us, the complicated pieces of wood, for the purpose of manifesting His power. He is able to clear up and to subdue our will and emotion. Although God has redeemed us, has given us eternal life and the forgiveness of sins, and has lived inside of us, His ultimate purpose is to work Himself into us. God's ultimate work is to have the New Jerusalem. The New Jerusalem is made of gold, precious stones, and pearls. In it are the throne of God, His light, and the river of water of life with the tree of life, and so forth. Gold signifies the divine nature, and pearl signifies the result of the transformation of God's life within man. The precious stones speak of the glory as a result of the work of God. The tree of life, the water of life, and the fruit of life all refer to God Himself. God's masterpiece is the New Jerusalem. The New Jerusalem is God with man. Everything else will pass away, and the heavens and the earth will be burned. Everything apart from God cannot be joined to God. Only that which comes out of God can be joined to God. Our eyes need to be opened, and we need a deliverance. Once we see this matter, we will no longer do what we did before.</P><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_052.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_054.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Messages Given During the Resumption of Watchman Nee's Ministry (2 volume set) &nbsp; pg 53</div><br></body></html>
