   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHRIST AS OUR EVERYTHING</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The last main point concerns Christ being everything to us.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Christ is not only everything, but everything to us.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>We must learn how to experience Christ as everything to us.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Christ to us is our food and drink, and He is also our patience.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Many times we are short of patience.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>When we are short of patience, we should realize that we are actually short of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Christ is our patience.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Do we desire humility?</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Christ Himself is our humility.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Do we want to honor our father and our mother?</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The honor that we render to our father and mother must be Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Christ is even the way for us to honor our parents.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>There is no need for teaching concerning the way.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>If we love Christ and fellowship with Him, we will have Christ as the living way.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>We will know how to honor our parents, and Christ will become the strength for us to honor our parents.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Christ is everything to us.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>I believe that in these last days the Lord will recover His people to know Him not merely in doctrine but in a very experiential way.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>When we write a letter to a friend, our letter must be Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>We must learn to experience Christ in such a way.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Before we write the letter, we should fellowship with the Lord and be one with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>We must tell Him, "Lord, You Yourself must be my words.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>I will not write anything besides Yourself to my friend.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>What I am going to write must be You."</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>We must try to experience the Lord in this way, applying Him as everything in our daily life.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>He must be everything to us.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>When we minister the word, that word must be Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Our message and ministry must be Christ, and the way to minister and our strength to minister must be Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The book of Colossians was written because many of those believers did not know how to experience Christ in such a way.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>They were distracted from Christ to pay attention to other things.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Colossians was written to tell them that they must realize Christ as their everything.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>We also must learn to experience Christ in such a real and living way.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Even from our youth, we should begin to experience Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>I thank the Lord that I was saved as a young man.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>However, I did not receive the proper help.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>I received great help in studying the Bible according to the letter, but I was not helped to know the Lord in a living way, to experience Him as my life and everything.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>After about seven or eight years passed, I began to receive help in knowing Christ in a living way.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Praise the Lord that many of you who are still in your teenage years can receive this help now!</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>You should not take this in a light way.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>You should appreciate that you are being shown the way to take Christ, experience Him, and apply Him as everything.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>I hope that the younger generation will pay their full attention to this matter.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Then they will be the living witnesses, the living testimonies, of how dear, how real, how precious, how rich, and how living Christ is.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Let us learn to experience Him in this way.</S>
