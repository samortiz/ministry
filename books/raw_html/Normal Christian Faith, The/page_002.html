<H1 CLASS=MSG>SECTION ONE<br>CHRIST AND GOD</H1><H1 CLASS=MSG>CHAPTER ONE</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>THE SEARCH FOR GOD</H1><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE FIRST QUESTION</H2><P>We will look at the Christian faith from its very foundation. The first subject we are confronted with is God.</P><P>Let us read a few verses from the Bible. Psalm 14:1 of the Old Testament says, "The fool has said in his heart,/There is no God." This sentence may also be translated as "The fool does not want God in his heart." The result of saying this can be found in the second sentence of the same verse: "They are corrupt; they do abominable deeds."</P><P>Let us also take a passage from the New Testament. Hebrews 11:6 says, "For he who comes forward to God must believe that He is."</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THREE KINDS OF PEOPLE</H2><P>Whether you claim to be a Christian, a non-believer, or a seeker after truth, we will start by examining the subject of God. In this respect the world is divided into three camps. The first is that of the atheists who do not believe in a God. The second consists of the agnostics. They have no sure knowledge about the deity. On the one hand, they dare not say there is no God, but on the other hand, they are not clear if God does exist. We belong to the third category of those who believe in God.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>PROSECUTION</H2><P>Is there a God? I will not try to say yes or no to this question. Rather, I will make this place a law court. I will ask you to be the judge, and I will be the prosecutor. The work of a judge is to make decisions, to approve or disapprove the truth of statements; the work of a prosecutor is to present all the evidence and arguments that he can possibly gather.</P><P>Before we proceed, we have to be clear about one fact: all prosecutors are not eyewitnesses of crimes. They are not policemen. A policeman may personally witness an event, whereas a prosecutor obtains his information only indirectly. He places all the charges, evidence, and arguments collected before the judge. In the same way, I shall present before you everything that I can possibly find. If you ask whether I have seen God or not, I would say "no." I am reading or demonstrating what I have gathered. My job is to search for facts and to call for witnesses. You are to arrive at a conclusion yourself.</P>
