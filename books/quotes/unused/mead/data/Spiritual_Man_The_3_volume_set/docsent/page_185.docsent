   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Practically speaking, the feeling of the soul and the intuition of the spirit are markedly different.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Yet sometimes, the feeling of the soul is very similar to the intuition of the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Sometimes these two are almost identical, and it is very hard for believers to differentiate.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Although these times are rare, they still occur.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Between the two it seems that only a hairbreadth of difference exists.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>At these times, a hasty believer cannot avoid being deceived.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>However, if he waits patiently, discerning again and again the source of his feeling, the Holy Spirit will reveal the truth to him at the proper time.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>If we want to walk according to the spirit, we must not act in haste.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>All soulish believers, for the most part, have certain inclinations.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Generally speaking, they either tend to the emotions or to the mind.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>When they desire to be spiritual and walk according to the spirit, they often fall into the trap of the opposite inclination.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>This means that an emotional believer will regard his cool rationality as the leading of the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Since he realizes that his zealous life style in the past was soulish, he misjudges his present rationality as being spiritual.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>An analytical believer will treat his hot emotions as the leading of the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Since he also realizes that his cool life style in the past was soulish, he regards his present emotion as being spiritual.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Alas, these two only exchange places and they are not any less soulish.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Therefore, we must remember the function of the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>In other words, to walk according to the spirit is to walk according to the intuition, because spiritual knowledge, fellowship, and conscience are all obtained from the intuition.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The Holy Spirit uses the intuition to guide the believers.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Hence, a believer should not imagine what is spiritual.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>It would suffice if he follows the intuition.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>If he desires to obey the Holy Spirit, he needs to know His will in the intuition.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Some desperately seek after the gifts of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Many times, their seekings are merely a search for happiness; there is an "I" behind it.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Furthermore, if they feel the descending of the Holy Spirit, their body being taken over by some external power, or a warm heat flowing from head to toe, they consider that they have obtained the baptism of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The Holy Spirit can no doubt cause one to sense Him through his feelings, but seeking Him according to emotion is exceedingly harmful.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Not only will this stir up one's own soul-life, but it may bring about the disguise of Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>What is valuable before God is not our sense of the Lord's presence or our love toward Him through our emotion; rather, it is our following of the Holy Spirit in our intuition and living according to what He reveals to us in spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Often we see someone who has had the "baptism of the Holy Spirit" still living according to the natural life and not according to the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Neither does he have a keen intuition to dissect the spiritual world.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Only fellowship with the Lord in the intuition, not in the emotion, is valuable.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>When we have read about the functions of the spirit recorded in the Bible, we realize that the spirit can be as hot as the emotion and as cool as the reason.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>But experienced ones in the Lord know the difference between what is from the spirit and what is from the soul.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>If a believer does not seek to truly know God in the intuition and walk according to the intuition, but simply postulates in the mind or, even more commonly, seeks after the stirring of the Holy Spirit in his feelings, he still is walking according to the flesh and causing his spiritual life to sink into a lifeless condition.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>By observing Paul's conduct, we can better realize the importance of walking according to the intuition of the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>He said, "But when it pleased God...to reveal His Son in me that I might announce Him as the gospel among the Gentiles, immediately I did not confer with flesh and blood, neither did I go up to Jerusalem to those who were apostles before me, but I went away to Arabia and again returned to Damascus" Gal 1:15-17 .</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Revelation is a matter of the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Even when the apostle John was inspired to write the book of Revelation, he received the revelation in spirit Rev 1:10 .</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The Scriptures testify in unison that revelation is in the believer's spirit.</S>
