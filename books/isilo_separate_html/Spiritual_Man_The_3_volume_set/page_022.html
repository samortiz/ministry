The Bible considers all these to be from the soul. The soul includes the human intellect, or the mind.</P><P>The soul also includes the emotions:</P><P>The soul can love:</P><blockquote>"And you shall love Jehovah your God with all your heart and with all your soul" (Deut. 6:5).<br>"The soul of Jonathan was knit with the soul of David, and Jonathan loved him as his own soul" (1 Sam. 18:1).<br>"And you shall exchange the money for anything that your soul desires...or for anything that your soul would like" (Deut. 14:26).<br>"Whatsoever thy soul desireth" (1 Sam. 20:4).<br>"My soul longs, indeed even faints,/For the courts of Jehovah" (Psa. 84:2).<br>"That which your soul pitieth" (Ezek. 24:21).<br>"So my soul pants/For You" (Psa. 42:1).<br>"Tell me, O thou whom my soul loveth" (S.S. 1:7).<br>"My soul desires You in the night" (Isa. 26:9).<br>"My Beloved in whom My soul has found delight" (Matt. 12:18).<br>"My soul magnifies the Lord" (Luke 1:46).<br>"And a sword will pierce through your own soul" (Luke 2:35).</blockquote><P>These few verses reveal one function of the soul, which is to love. The desire to love comes from the soul. Hence, human love is a part of the function of the soul.</P><P>The soul can hate:</P><blockquote>"So that his life abhorreth bread, and his soul dainty meat" (Job 33:20).<br>"The lame and the blind, that are hated of David's soul" (2 Sam. 5:8).<br>"My soul was impatient with them, and their soul also detested me" (Zech. 11:8).<br>"My soul is weary of my life" (Job 10:1).<br>"Their soul abhorreth all manner of meat" (Psa. 107:18).</blockquote><P>These few verses teach us that hatred is a function of the soul.</P><P>The soul can be affected in other ways:</P><blockquote>"The soul of all the people was grieved" (1 Sam. 30:6).<br>"Her soul is vexed" (2 Kings 4:27).<br>"His soul was grieved for the misery of Israel" (Judg. 10:16).<br>"How long will ye vex my soul" (Job 19:2).<br>"My soul will exult in My God" (Isa. 61:10).<br>"Cause the soul of Your servant to rejoice" (Psa. 86:4).<br>"Their soul fainted in them" (Psa. 107:5).<br>"Why art you bowed down, O my soul? / And why do you groan within me?" (Psa. 42:5).<br>"Return unto thy rest, O my soul" (Psa. 116:7).<br>"My soul breaketh for the longing" (Psa. 119:20).<br>"My soul melteth for heaviness" (Psa. 119:28).<br>"Sweet to the soul" (Prov. 16:24).<br>"Let your soul delight itself in fatness" (Isa. 55:2).<br>"When my soul fainted within me" (Jonah 2:7).<br>"My soul is exceedingly sorrowful" (Matt. 26:38).<br>"Now is my soul troubled" (John 12:27).<br>"Tormented his righteous soul day after day" (2 Pet. 2:8).</blockquote><P>These few verses tell us how the soul is affected. The feeling of being affected comes from the soul.</P><P>From the above verses we can see the functions in our emotions. Love, hatred, feelings of being affected, sensations, etc., all come from the soul. This shows us that our emotion is also a part of our soul.</P><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_021.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_023.html">Next</a> </body></html>
