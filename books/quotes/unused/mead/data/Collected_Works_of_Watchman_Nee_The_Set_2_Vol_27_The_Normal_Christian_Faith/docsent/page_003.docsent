   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>SECTION ONE</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>CHRIST AND GOD CHAPTER ONE THE SEARCH FOR GOD THE FIRST QUESTION</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>We will look at the Christian faith from its very foundation.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The first subject we are confronted with is God.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Let us read a few verses from the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Psalm 14:1 of the Old Testament says, "The fool has said in his heart,/There is no God."</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>This sentence may also be translated as "The fool does not want God in his heart."</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The result of saying this can be found in the second sentence of the same verse: "They are corrupt; they do abominable deeds."</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Let us also take a passage from the New Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Hebrews 11:6 says, "For he who comes forward to God must believe that He is."</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>THREE KINDS OF PEOPLE</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Whether you claim to be a Christian, a non-believer, or a seeker after truth, we will start by examining the subject of God.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>In this respect the world is divided into three camps.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The first is that of the atheists who do not believe in a God.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The second consists of the agnostics.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>They have no sure knowledge about the deity.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>On the one hand, they dare not say there is no God, but on the other hand, they are not clear if God does exist.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>We belong to the third category of those who believe in God.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>PROSECUTION</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Is there a God?</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>I will not try to say yes or no to this question.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Rather, I will make this place a law court.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>I will ask you to be the judge, and I will be the prosecutor.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The work of a judge is to make decisions, to approve or disapprove the truth of statements; the work of a prosecutor is to present all the evidence and arguments that he can possibly gather.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Before we proceed, we have to be clear about one fact: all prosecutors are not eyewitnesses of crimes.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>They are not policemen.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>A policeman may personally witness an event, whereas a prosecutor obtains his information only indirectly.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>He places all the charges, evidence, and arguments collected before the judge.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>In the same way, I shall present before you everything that I can possibly find.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>If you ask whether I have seen God or not, I would say "no."</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>I am reading or demonstrating what I have gathered.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>My job is to search for facts and to call for witnesses.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>You are to arrive at a conclusion yourself.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>QUALIFICATIONS</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Many people assert that there is no God.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>As a prosecutor I ask you first to check the qualification of these people.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Are they qualified to make such claims?</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Are those who assert that there is no God moral or immoral?</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Do not just listen to their arguments.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Even robbers and swindlers have their arguments.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Of course, the arguments support them as robbers and swindlers.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The subject of their arguments may be very noble; they may talk about the state of the nations and the welfare of society, but their opinions cannot be seriously considered.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>They are not worthy of passing such judgments.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>If a man is upright in his conduct and moral judgment, we can give credibility to his words, but if not, his words lose their credibility.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>This is especially true when it relates to the question of deity.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>It is interesting to note that the moral standards of men are directly related to their concept about God.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Those who admit their own ignorance have a passable standard, while insistent atheists invariably have a low level of moral responsibility.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>I do not claim to know all atheists, but of the several thousand that I know, none of them possess a notably commendable morality.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>You may tell me that there was once a moral atheist, but if there was one, he is dead.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Or you may tell me that there will be a moral atheist, but whoever he may be, he is not here yet.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>At least we can say that for now, we do not know a moral atheist.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>NO ATHEIST IS MORAL</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Once at a gathering at the University of Nanking, I remarked that no atheist is moral.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>There were many students on the campus who did not believe in God.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>They were greatly offended by these words.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>The next day, while I was speaking, they came and shuffled their feet in an attempt to distract me and the audience.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>The next day when they came again, they made funny gestures and faces at me and carried on continuously throughout the speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>On the fourth day the vice-president of the university, Dr. Williams, came and said to me, "We had better change the place of meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>These students are infuriated by your assertion on the first day that atheists are not moral.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Today they are not going to use their feet and lips only; they are going to use their fists.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>I heard that they will be waiting at the entrance of the hallway and will jump on you when you step in."</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>I went along with the arrangement and conducted the meeting at another place.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>On the way to the meeting I walked alongside many students and listened to their conversations.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Although many did not agree with me and felt uneasy about my preaching, they wanted to come back.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>One among them remarked, "Mr. Nee said that people who have no God have no sense of moral responsibility.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>This is perfectly right.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>How can anyone with moral decency shuffle his feet and jest while others are delivering a speech?</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Yesterday they caused such a disturbance in the meeting, and today they are going to come to fight.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>This is surely not what an honorable person would do.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>There is no doubt that those who do not believe in God do not have moral decency.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Let us go to the meeting regardless of what they plan to do."</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Once a young man told a preacher, "When I was young, I seriously believed in God.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>But now that I am in college.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>I can no longer believe in Him."</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>The fifty-year-old preacher patted the young man's shoulder and said, "My son, you do not believe in God anymore!</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>Let me ask you a question: Since you have been converted to be an atheist, have you advanced morally?</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>Has atheism helped you become better?</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>Has it made your thoughts cleaner or your heart purer?</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>Or did it make you just the opposite?"</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>That young man felt ashamed.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>He admitted that he had gone downhill morally since his denial of God.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>The preacher pressed on: "I am afraid that you are not really saying that you believe there is no God, you are just hoping that there is no God."</S>
