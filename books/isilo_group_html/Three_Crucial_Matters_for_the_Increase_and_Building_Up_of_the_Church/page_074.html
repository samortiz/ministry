<p>In 1 Thessalonians 1:5 the apostle Paul said, &ldquo;You know what kind of men we were among you for your sake.&rdquo; This means that Paul lived a life in death and resurrection. He lived a life of witnessing the crucified and resurrected Christ. In fact, as Paul was living among the saints in Thessalonica, the crucified and resurrected Christ was living there. Paul was a witness of the Lord Jesus. He was constituted a witness through Christ&rsquo;s death and resurrection. Paul was crucified with the Lord Jesus (Gal. 2:20); he died together with Christ (Rom. 6:8). Hence, it was no longer Paul who lived; even though his name was still Paul, the person living was not Paul, because Paul was crucified with Christ.</p>
<p>From the human point of view, in the physical realm, the crucifixion of the Lord Jesus took place at the end of His thirty-three and a half years on earth. However, from God&rsquo;s point of view, in the spiritual realm, the Lord Jesus lived a crucified life from the day He was born; He lived a life under the shadow of the cross.</p>
<p>Even though the Gospel of Luke puts more emphasis on the human living of the Lord Jesus, it does not say whether the Lord cried when He was six months old. However, all babies cry because they cannot express themselves otherwise. When they are hungry, they cry, and when they are thirsty, they also cry. They cry when they are cold and when they are not feeling well. All mothers know this. The cries of a baby are related to the needs of the flesh. We have been living in the flesh since we were born. However, we believe that even when the Lord Jesus was a baby, He was bearing the cross. Throughout His life the Lord Jesus lived a selfless life, a life without &ldquo;I.&rdquo; This is death. He died every day until He was actually put to death on the cross. The cross was the sum total, the completion, of His death.</p>
<p>Throughout His life the Lord Jesus lived a crucified life. Without death there is no life; death causes life to multiply. When the Lord was living a crucified life on earth, God was living out from within Him. God lived out is resurrection. Resurrection did not merely occur after the Lord entered into death and came out of the grave. Resurrection was manifested in the crucified life He lived on earth. This life allowed God to live out from within Him. This is resurrection.</p>
<p>In John 11:25 the Lord said, &ldquo;I am the resurrection and the life.&rdquo; The Lord is life because He is resurrection. If He were not resurrection, He could not be life. In His human living the Lord died daily. Not one moment passed by without His being under the killing of the cross, and not one moment passed by without His living in resurrection. God was expressed in the Lord&rsquo;s living because the Lord died to His self. He lost His soul-life so that the living God could be expressed. This is resurrection, and this is the living of the Lord Jesus. Hence, when we go out as witnesses of Jesus, we should live this One. We should live like Him, dying daily and daily living out God.</p>
<p>Young people are more temperamental than older people and have more difficulty with the lust of the flesh, but older people can also have more problems than the younger ones. We can send out one hundred thirty young people to spread the work, but we dare not send out even three older people. Young people are more flexible and can adapt to their environment. If we send out older saints, within the first week they might return full of complaints. This does not mean that only the older saints are difficult; every one of us has problems. Little children are difficult, and young people are difficult. People in their thirties are difficult, middle-aged saints are difficult, and even the elderly saints are difficult. A person is a hard case regardless of whether he is young or old. If we see this, we will not be so quick to criticize others. What ground do we have to criticize others? We are not better! At best, we are &ldquo;a pot calling the kettle black.&rdquo; Thus, there is no need to fight with any saint or even with our own family, because we are all the same. This can be compared to the saying, &ldquo;In the whole world, all crows are black.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In general, people between the ages of twenty and thirty-five tend to have fewer problems. It is easy for a person who is over fifty to become a problem to others. A church that is experienced in providing hospitality knows that it might receive criticism from guests who are close to the age of sixty. However, when the guests are young people in their twenties, they are more flexible; they do not care whether it is hot or cold, whether the window is open or closed, or whether they have a blanket. The young people do not care for any of these matters; neither do they criticize.</p>
<p>We should not judge one another and say that this sister has a strong disposition or that that brother is stubborn. Someone may be strong or stubborn, but we are often stronger and more stubborn. Others may be strong on the outside, but we are strong within, or they may be stubborn outwardly, but our stubbornness is within. Others are frank and express themselves without any guise, but we hide everything within. Our hardness can even resist a nuclear bomb. Therefore, we must all learn from Paul, who said, &ldquo;When I came to you, brothers,...I did not determine to know anything among you except Jesus Christ, and this One crucified&rdquo; (1 Cor. 2:1-2).</p>
<p>Whether we are strong inwardly or outwardly, the cross is able to solve every problem. No matter how old a person is or where he goes, if he is on the cross, he will not be a problem to those who receive him, because the cross has solved the problem of his self. To a person on the cross, cold water is as good as hot water, and food that is overdone is as good as food that is not well cooked. Everything is all right to him. If we are guests and the blanket we are provided with is not warm enough, we can wear heavier clothes to bed. However, we should not let our host know; otherwise, he may give us his blanket, which will be a trouble to him. When we travel, we should take everything we need so that we do not cause our host any trouble. In summary, a person who has passed through the cross will not criticize or judge others; even if he must suffer a little, he will not speak, because a dead person has no feeling.</p>
<p>If we are such a crucified person, we will have no problems when we live with other people. Furthermore, we will give people a good impression, an excellent testimony; we will testify of the crucified and resurrected Christ. People will say that although we are only in our twenties, we live the life of a crucified Christian. This is what it means to be a witness, and this is a strong testimony. Hence, when we go out for the propagation, we must remember not to offend people while we preach the gospel. We can be eloquent when we preach the gospel. However, if we are not on the cross, after we stay in a new one&rsquo;s home for two weeks, he will see through us and will no longer receive us into his home. This would be a great failure.</p>
<p>We must have a living that is the living of Jesus Christ; we must be His witnesses. We are testifying of One who died and resurrected. He is in us today. He is repeating His life and His living within us. It is no longer we who live, but it is Christ who lives in us. If we are such people, we can stay in anyone&rsquo;s home, and there will never be problems. We will not cause any problems for our hosts. Whether their children cry or whether they rise early or late, we will not be bothered, and our sleep will not be affected. Whatever people do or say will not affect us because we are on the cross.</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_073.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_075.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Three Crucial Matters for the Increase and Building Up of the Church &nbsp; pg 74</div><br></body></html>
