   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER EIGHT THE CENTRAL THOUGHT OF GOD Scripture Reading: Rev 1:4; 3:1; 4:5; Eph 2:15-16, 19; Col 3:10; Eph 4:22</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The point which we are going to cover in this chapter is more important than all the other points covered in the previous chapters.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>I would ask you to exercise not only the understanding of your mind but also the apprehending ability of your spirit, so that the Holy Spirit may reveal to you something eternal.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>OUR HUMAN, RELIGIOUS CONCEPT</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>VERSUS WHAT THE NEW TESTAMENT TEACHES</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Before I touch the main subject, I wish to say something about our human, religious concept.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>This concept may be described in the following way.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>God is our Creator.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>He is holy, righteous, good, and loving, so we have to worship Him.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>However, we realize that we are sinful and that we need to repent and confess our sins before Him.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>We also realize that He loved us and even sent His only begotten Son into this world to be a man.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>This man, Jesus, died on the cross for our sins.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Then He resurrected and ascended to the heavens, and now He is sitting at the right hand of God to be our High Priest, our Advocate, interceding for us all the time.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>If we believe in Him, put our trust in Him, by His redemption our sins will be forgiven and we will be saved.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>We will be reconciled to God, justified by God, and accepted by God.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Then God will be favorable toward us.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>From this time on, we will enjoy His favor, and He will always be good to us.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>If we are weak, He will help us.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>If we have some troubles, He will take care of them.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>We can pray to Him about all our needs.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Furthermore, we have to try our best to please Him, to serve Him, and to glorify Him.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>This describes many people's religious concept.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>All these things are right and are up to the standard of our human concept, but they are not up to the standard of the divine revelation, the standard of God's purpose and desire.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Have you noticed that in our human concept there is nothing that pertains to the matter of life?</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>In our concept there is nothing concerning Christ coming into us to be our life.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>This is a big shortage, a serious shortage.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>It is not enough just to have the sound, scriptural, fundamental Christian teachings.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>We must see that what the New Testament teaches is that Christ comes into us to mingle Himself with us.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>When we say "Christ," we mean the all-inclusive One who includes many wonderful items such as the Divine Trinity, divinity, humanity, human living, death, resurrection, glorification, ascension, enthronement, the kingdom, and the authority.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>All these things today are embodied in Christ as the wonderful Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Today this wonderful, all-inclusive Spirit is in our spirit Rom 8:16; 1 Cor 6:17 .</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>We have everything in our spirit!</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>This is something in the center of God's thought, yet it is neglected by Christianity.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Many Christians consider the Holy Spirit as merely a power, a force, or a sensation coming down upon us to give us some gifts, might, strength, and power, and to help us to do good and serve God.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>They do not realize that the Spirit of God today is the all-inclusive and bountiful Spirit of Jesus Christ within us Phil 1:19b .</S>
