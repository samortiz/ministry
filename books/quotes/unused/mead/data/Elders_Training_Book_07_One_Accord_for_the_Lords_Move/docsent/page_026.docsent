   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>GROWING IN LIFE, BEING TRANSFORMED</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>INTO PRECIOUS MATERIAL FOR GOD S BUILDING,</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>AND BEING CAREFUL NOT TO DAMAGE OR DESTROY</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>CHRIST S BODY, GOD S TEMPLE</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>First Corinthians 3 shows us what life is.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>First; we all have to realize that we are plants; you are a plant and I am a plant.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Let us forget about things such as service, work, eldership, and apostleship.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>I want to remember that I am a little plant.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>As a little plant in life, I need to grow, and to grow I need water.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>I will take water from whoever can water me.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Then I will grow.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Furthermore, I want to be transformed into precious material for God s building gold, silver, and precious stone.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The first basic thing we have to learn is the matter of the growth in life.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>As a plant I am growing in the soil with all the riches.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>My soil is the processed and consummated Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>I want to dwell in Him and be rooted down in Him to absorb all His riches through my contacting Him.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>I like to contact Him, absorb Him, dwell in Him, be rooted in Him, and grow in Him to enjoy all His riches.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Then I will grow into transformation to become precious material for His unique building in this universe.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>While I am growing, He will lead me to participate in the divine work.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>What a privilege that I can be participating in God s divine work!</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Then I work in this divine building, not by my natural ability, not by wood, grass, or stubble.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>These categories of material are natural and worldly, having nothing to do with growth, life, and transformation.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>I would never work with this kind of material.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>I should deny myself, put my soul life aside, and condemn my natural ability.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>I build with what I grow with.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>I build with my growth, with my enjoyment of the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>This is what it means to build with gold, silver, and precious stones.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>I am also careful not to damage or destroy Christ s Body; otherwise, I will suffer destruction because the church, Christ s Body and God s temple, is a treasure so dear and precious to Him, purchased with His own blood Acts 20:28 .</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>If I destroy the temple, God will destroy me.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>I do not want to be a Christian like the Corinthians.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>They did not take care of the growth in life.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Paul said that they were still babes, behaving, acting, and touching the church affairs altogether in the flesh 1 Cor 3:1-3 .</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Because they were fleshly and even fleshy, Paul could not give them solid food.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>He could only feed them with milk.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The Corinthians were puffed up on behalf of Apollos against Paul and on behalf of Paul against Cephas 1 Cor 4:6 .</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>This is all in the flesh and is to build the church with wood, grass, and stubble.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>To criticize or condemn others carelessly is to destroy the temple, not discerning the Body, and will cause one to suffer loss.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Most Christians today are suffering loss.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Many are under a kind of destruction.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Years ago I warned the saints, but the opposers twisted my word to say that I am cursing and threatening people.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Actually, my warning was a word in love.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>We have to realize that it is not a small thing to touch the church.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>THE QUALIFICATIONS OF AN ARCHITECT</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>First Corinthians 3 is a chapter not on fighting but on growing.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>To be a planter like the Apostle Paul and to be a plant, you need some life.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>As a plant you need to grow, and through growth you will have transformation to become the precious material for God s building.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>You then will do the right work with what you grow and with what you have been transformed, building with gold, silver, and precious stones for the building of God.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>You would never use anything of your natural life or worldly ability wood, grass, or stubble to build the church.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Nor would you touch the Body, the church of Christ, the temple of God, carelessly to suffer destruction spiritually, soulishly, or physically.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>If you were such a person, the Lord would probably assign a portion to you that you might be qualified and able to be a designer because you know His concepts, His heart s desire, His eternal purpose, His eternal plan, His good pleasure.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>You also know His economy, the Old Testament economy and the New Testament economy, the eternal economy.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Since you know all these things, this qualifies you to be a designer, an architect, a wise master builder.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Because you know what you design, you also know how to superintend the construction.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>An architect does not control the workers.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>His controlling would keep them away from their work.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Nobody could work under another s control; they may even go on strike.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>An architect does not exercise control, but his view of the construction.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Based upon this view, he renders much helpful, positive, and constructive instructions.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>He helps by adjusting and sometimes by giving a warning.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>The master builder is not the controller but the one who has the design and the one who oversees, superintends, the construction work in detail.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Paul exercised much of his superintending ability in writing 1 Corinthians.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>In this one Epistle Paul dealt with eleven problems among the believers in Corinth; some of these problems were concerning division, fornication, bringing brothers to the law, and marriage.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Could you have such an all-inclusive view to write an Epistle to such a complicated and complicating church?</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Maybe all that you would be able to tell them would be to contact the Lord and pray often.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>You might even tell them to fast and pray and to love one another.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Your fellowship may sound very good.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>You may be very spiritual, loving, kind, and nice, but I do not think that someone who is building a house would hire you as an architect.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>You might be qualified to be a pastor in a small denomination.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>TRAINED FOLLOWERS WHO ARE</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>GROWING IN LIFE TO BE TRANSFORMED</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>INTO PRECIOUS MATERIAL FOR GOD S BUILDING,</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>WHO WOULD NOT SAY OR DO ANYTHING</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>TO DESTROY GOD S TEMPLE, AND</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>WHO SEE THE VISION OF</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>GOD S NEW TESTAMENT ECONOMY</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>I am trying my best to present to you what the Lord has shown me.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>By presenting these things to you in such a way, I hope you can see the great difference between the Lord s recovery and Christianity.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>There is no comparison.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>Such fellowship concerning the deeper truths of God s New Testament economy may cause some to be angry with me.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>This has been my suffering.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>Some of you may say, Brother Lee, we will follow you and go to fight.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>How will you go to fight?</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>Even the soldiers in today s United States Army need to be trained.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>You need to be trained in your character.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>Get rid of your looseness and inaccuracy in doing things.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>You cannot be a wild soldier.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>We must be so fine in being dealt with by the Lord to grow in life.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>We should have the attitude that we do not like to be anybody.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>We only like to grow to be transformed into precious material for God s building.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>We should be altogether careful not to do or say anything to damage or destroy any part of God s temple, which is the very dear Body of the Head, the Lord Jesus Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>With this building work there must be an architect who gives us the proper design.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>To lay the foundation is to give the design.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>These two things are one.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>Then the architect tells us, charges us, and warns us to be careful how to build and with what we build.</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>This is his superintending of the construction.</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>The architect, the wise master builder, gives us the design, which is to lay the foundation.</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>No one can give you another design, another foundation, which is the all-inclusive Christ becoming the life-giving Spirit as the very embodiment of the processed and consummated Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='98' RSNT='1' SNO='98'>This foundation is the very contents of our belief, the very contents of the New Testament economy of God.</S>
   <S PAR='99' RSNT='1' SNO='99'>The architect laid this foundation by such a design.</S>
   <S PAR='100' RSNT='1' SNO='100'>After giving such a design, after laying such a foundation, he is now superintending to see how the building is going on.</S>
   <S PAR='101' RSNT='1' SNO='101'>We need such a view in the Lord s recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='102' RSNT='1' SNO='102'>I believe this vision will control us, restrict us, and preserve us from being wild.</S>
   <S PAR='103' RSNT='1' SNO='103'>Where there is no vision, the people run wild Prov 29:18 Heb .</S>
   <S PAR='104' RSNT='1' SNO='104'>You may say that you follow Brother Lee, that you are one with this ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='105' RSNT='1' SNO='105'>This sounds very good, but I am a little concerned that you may not know what it means to be one with the ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='106' RSNT='1' SNO='106'>You may want to take me as your commander in chief and follow me, but I do not want to have many followers who know nothing about God s New Testament economy.</S>
   <S PAR='107' RSNT='1' SNO='107'>We are not doing anything but carrying out God s New Testament economy.</S>
   <S PAR='108' RSNT='1' SNO='108'>Christianity has delayed the Lord and missed the mark for centuries, but in the Lord s recovery the one thing, the unique thing, the Lord has been showing us is the New Testament economy of God.</S>
   <S PAR='109' RSNT='1' SNO='109'>I hate that you would not see this.</S>
   <S PAR='110' RSNT='1' SNO='110'>Because of your not seeing, some of you have been ambitious to be something and have tried to have another line in the Lord s recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='111' RSNT='1' SNO='111'>The seeing of the vision preserves you.</S>
   <S PAR='112' RSNT='1' SNO='112'>The seeing will be the white line for your driving.</S>
   <S PAR='113' RSNT='1' SNO='113'>What I have presented to you in this chapter is the white line for your driving to save and preserve you.</S>
