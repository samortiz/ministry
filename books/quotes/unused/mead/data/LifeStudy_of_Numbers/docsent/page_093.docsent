   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Korah, Dathan, and Abiram were not afraid because of what they had done.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>They, together with their wives, their sons, and their little ones, came out and stood at the entrance of their tents v. 27 . The fact that their tents were close together indicates that they were very intimate.</S>

   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>They went there directly; they did not need to die first.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Hades is like a temporary jail, and the lake of fire is the final prison.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>These perished ones entered into the temporary jail to wait for the final imprisonment in the lake of fire.</S>

   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>They were well-known leaders selected from the entire congregation.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>By this we can see that the rebellion was quite popular, even universal.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Immediately after the three leaders were swallowed up alive by the earth, fire came forth from Jehovah and consumed the two hundred fifty men while they were offering incense v. 35 . This was the second aspect of God's judgment.</S>
