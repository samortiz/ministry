   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Teaching Them Spiritual Words the Things of the Spirit of God for Spiritual Communication</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The Spirit teaches the believers spiritual words the things of the Spirit of God for spiritual communication.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>First Corinthians 2:13 says, "Which also we speak, not in words taught by human wisdom, but in words taught by the Spirit, communicating spiritual things by spiritual things."</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The Greek word rendered "communicating" literally means mixing or putting together, as interpreting or expounding.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>It is common in the Septuagint, found in verses such as Genesis 40:8; 41:12, 15.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The thought here is to speak spiritual things by spiritual words.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The stress is not on the person to whom the speaking is done but on the means by which the spiritual things are spoken.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Paul spoke the spiritual things, which are the deep things of God concerning Christ, by the spiritual things, which are the spiritual words taught by the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>In 1 Corinthians 2:13 Paul says that he did not speak the spiritual things in words taught by human wisdom but in words taught by the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>This means that he did not speak in the words of Greek philosophy or wisdom.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Rather, he communicated spiritual things by spiritual words.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>In 2:13 Paul uses the same term with two meanings.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>First, "spiritual things" refers to the spiritual things themselves, the deep things of God concerning Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Second, this expression refers to spiritual words.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Spiritual things are designated and communicated by spiritual words.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>These spiritual words are spiritual things used to designate spiritual things.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The speaking that is according to man's wisdom is not spiritual.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>But the words taught by the Spirit of God are truly spiritual things.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Thus, spiritual things are both the things given to us by God concerning Christ as our portion and also the words taught by the Spirit of God.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Paul spoke spiritual things by spiritual things.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>He used spiritual words that are equal to the spiritual things themselves.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Like Paul, we need to speak spiritual things by spiritual things.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>This we may do through the working of the Spirit, who teaches us spiritual words for spiritual communication.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>22.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Speaking with Them</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>As the Spirit works in the believers, He speaks also with them 1 Cor 7:40 .</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>This means that when we speak, the Spirit speaks with us.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>For this we need to be one with the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>If we are truly one with the indwelling Spirit, the Spirit will speak in our speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The matter of the Spirit's speaking with the believers is clearly seen in 1 Corinthians 7.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Paul's teaching in this chapter is very different from that of the prophets in the Old Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>When the prophets spoke for God in Old Testament times, the word of the Lord came to them and enabled them to speak on God's behalf.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Often the prophets would say, "Thus saith the Lord."</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The New Testament way of speaking for the Lord is very different.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>In 1 Corinthians 7 Paul never utters the words, "Thus saith the Lord."</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The reason Paul does not use such an expression is that the apostles' teaching in the New Testament is based on the principle of incarnation.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>According to this principle, God speaks in man's speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>With Paul in 1 Corinthians 7 we have an example of this principle of incarnation.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Although Paul writes here that certain things he says are not the Lord's word or commandment v. 25 , everything spoken by Paul in this chapter has nonetheless become part of the divine revelation in the New Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>This is because Paul was a person absolutely one with God.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Even when he says that he does not have a word from the Lord, the Lord speaks in his speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Because Paul was one with the Lord, when he spoke, the Lord spoke with him.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>In verse 40 Paul says, "She is more blessed if she so remains, according to my opinion; but I think that I also have the Spirit of God."</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>In verse 10 the apostle says, "I charge, not I but the Lord."</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>In verse 12 he says, "I say, not the Lord."</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>In verse 25 he says, "I have no commandment of the Lord, but I give my opinion."</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>In verse 40 he says, "According to my opinion; but I think that I also have the Spirit of God."</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>All these words indicate the New Testament principle of incarnation, that is, God and man, man and God, becoming one.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>This differs drastically from the principle of Old Testament prophecy speaking for God.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>In the Old Testament the word of Jehovah came to a prophet Jer 1:2; Ezek.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>1:3 , the prophet being simply the mouthpiece of God.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>But in the New Testament the Lord becomes one with His apostles and they become one with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Both speak together.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>His word becomes their word, and whatever they utter is His word.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Hence, the apostle's charge is the Lord's charge v. 10 . What he says, though not by the Lord, still becomes a part of the divine revelation in the New Testament v. 12 . He is so one with the Lord that even when he gives his own opinion, not the commandment of the Lord v. 25 , he still thinks that he also has the Spirit of God.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>He does not claim definitely to have the Spirit of God, but he thinks that he also has the Spirit of God.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>This is the highest spirituality, a spirituality based on the principle of incarnation.</S>
