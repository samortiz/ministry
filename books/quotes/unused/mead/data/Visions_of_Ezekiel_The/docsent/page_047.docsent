   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The Lord Jesus always takes care of us.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>We should not worry about our problems, how to make a living and so forth.</S>

   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>We must learn to put our trust in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>It is so good after the whole day and after the night's meeting to simply tell the Lord, "Thank You Lord, I am under Your care; now I am going to sleep.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Come and take care of me."</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Such a simple prayer is good enough.</S>

   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>There is no need to be so religious, asking the Lord to protect you and to do this and do that.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The Lord would say, "Stupid child, I know what you need.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Don't waste your time.</S>

   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>We are not a flock without a Shepherd.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>In His recovery, as His flock, we are under His shepherding.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>As He cares for us and feeds us, we have the real experience of Psalm 23.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The Lord is our Shepherd; we have no want.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Learn to experience the Lord Jesus as your Shepherd.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Enjoying Peace and Liberty</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>under His Shepherding</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>According to Ezekiel 34:25, all the evil beasts will be kept away from His recovered people.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>In the proper church life there are no wolves, only lambs.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>In the Lord's recovery, all the evil beasts are gone.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The Lord also promised to break all the yokes 34:27 .</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>With Him there is no bondage and no yoke.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Jesus breaks every fetter; Jesus sets us free!</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>In the local church there is no yoke, but rather full liberty and full release.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Furthermore, under His shepherding the Lord delivers us from all kinds of slavery.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>In the churches, there is no sensation that we are under a kind of slavery.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Rather, there is the sensation of liberty.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Furthermore, the Lord promised that His people in His recovery would never be a prey to the enemy 34:28 .</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>This means that they would never be defeated or captured by the enemy.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>In the local churches we share the spoil of the Lord's victory.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>We are not here struggling to win the victory; we are here enjoying the victory of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Eventually, the Lord promised that all those in the Lord's recovery would dwell in peace and safety 34:28 .</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>In these portions of the word are the phrase "lie down" and the word "sleep" 34:15, 25 .</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>It does not mean to sleep in a bedroom, but to sleep in the woods.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Under the Lord's shepherding, it is safe to sleep even in the woods.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>I never dared to sleep in the woods.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Sometimes while on vacation, people invited me to sleep in the woods, but I begged them, "Please don't put me out there.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>I'm afraid of the lions, the tigers, the scorpions, the snakes.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Don't put me in the woods.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>I would rather be under a roof."</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>But here it says they could even sleep in the woods.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>There is no need to be afraid of anything in the Lord's recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>If you go to a local church where you have to be careful because the situation is touchy and you are afraid, that must not be a proper local church in the Lord's recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>In the proper church life in the Lord's recovery, there is nothing for you to be afraid of.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>There is the sensation of safety.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>At every corner of the church life, you are safe.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>There should never be a situation in the church life that causes you to be fearful.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>You should never be afraid to talk to an elder, or to talk to the sisters.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Some have asked me why I can be so frank in my speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>It is because in the Lord's recovery we have safety and peace.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>I do not fear to speak frankly because this is the Lord's recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>Making Them a Blessing</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>The Lord promised that He would make them a blessing 34:26 .</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>He also promised them that there would be showers all the time, that there would be the timely rain 34:26 .</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>They would have no lack of water.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>We need not only the rivers, but also the showers from the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>Frequently, in the local church meetings we have the sensation that something is not only flowing, but also coming down like a shower as well.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>Sometimes even at home after the meeting, we have the sensation that the showers are still coming down upon us.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>This is the strongest sign that the Lord's blessing is upon the local church.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>He gives us showers of blessing in season, so timely.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>The showers will cause all the trees to yield their fruit and cause the herbs to yield their rich produce 34:27 .</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>The churches then will be rich with spiritual food.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>All the produce, the increase of the earth, is good for food.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>In the local churches, there is no famine, no shortage of spiritual food.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>Sometimes before a meeting there are only five small loaves, but after the meeting twelve baskets are left over.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>Hallelujah!</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>This is the real blessing.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>These are signs that the local churches are under the Lord's blessing: the showers in season, the trees yielding fruits, and much produce from the good land.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>We should never have the sensation that the local church meetings are short of food.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>If we are short of food, we are wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>If we are really in the Lord's recovery, we will be rich in food.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>In 34:29 the Lord promised to raise up a plant of renown, whose fruit would be for their enjoyment.</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>Again, this is Christ as the rich food supply.</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>Finally, the Lord said He would be with them, that they would be His people, and that He would be their God 34:30-31 .</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>This is fellowship in the oneness.</S>
   <S PAR='98' RSNT='1' SNO='98'>This is the mingling of God with us.</S>
   <S PAR='99' RSNT='1' SNO='99'>In the Lord's recovery we have God's presence.</S>
   <S PAR='100' RSNT='1' SNO='100'>God is with us and we are His people and He is our God.</S>
   <S PAR='101' RSNT='1' SNO='101'>We have such a fellowship and such a oneness.</S>
   <S PAR='102' RSNT='1' SNO='102'>We are one with God, and God is one with us.</S>
   <S PAR='103' RSNT='1' SNO='103'>The church is a real mingling of God and man.</S>
   <S PAR='104' RSNT='1' SNO='104'>The recovery of the church life is not a matter of teachings, gifts, or other things, but a matter of the Lord's presence.</S>
   <S PAR='105' RSNT='1' SNO='105'>We are here on earth enjoying such a mingling.</S>
   <S PAR='106' RSNT='1' SNO='106'>Hallelujah for the Lord's recovery by life!</S>
