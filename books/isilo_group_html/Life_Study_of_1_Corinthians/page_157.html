THE HEAD COVERING</h2><h2 class="head2">A. Every Man Praying or Prophesying<br />Having His Head Covered<br />Disgracing His Head</h2><p>In verse 4 Paul goes on to say, &ldquo;Every man praying or prophesying having his head covered disgraces his head.&rdquo; To prophesy here means to speak for God. Since man has the headship over woman and is God&rsquo;s image and glory (v. 7), he should keep his head manifested, unconcealed, uncovered, when he prays to God and speaks for Him in touching the throne of God&rsquo;s administration. Otherwise he dishonors or shames his head.</p><p>We should not think that praying or speaking for God by prophesying are insignificant matters. It is a great thing to speak for God. Both our prayer and our speaking for God are related to God&rsquo;s administration. They are related to God&rsquo;s authority and headship. Therefore, as those who are God&rsquo;s image and glory, the men should not cover their heads when praying or prophesying. To cover our head in this way is to shame our head.</p><h2 class="head2">B. Every Woman Praying or Prophesying<br />with Her Head Uncovered<br />Disgracing Her Head</h2><p>In verse 5 Paul continues, &ldquo;But every woman praying or prophesying with her head uncovered disgraces her head; for it is one and the same thing as she who is shaved.&rdquo; Since woman is under the headship of man, she should keep her head covered, not exposed, when she touches the divine administration by praying to God and speaking for God. Otherwise she disgraces or shames her head, as if having her head shaved, because she denies the divine governmental ordination by exposing her head to the observing angels (v. 10) when she touches the authority of God.</p><p>Paul tells us that a woman who disgraces her head is the same as one who is shaved. This is a strong indication that for a woman to have her head shaved or her hair cut off is shameful (v. 6).</p><p>Verse 6 says, &ldquo;For if a woman is not covered, let her hair also be cut off; but if it is shameful for a woman to have her hair cut off or to be shaved, let her be covered.&rdquo; This indicates that the head covering is a covering in addition to long hair. For a woman to have long hair, not having her head shaved, signifies that she does not reject God&rsquo;s governmental ordination; and for a woman to have a head covering in addition to her long hair is to say amen to the divine ordination.</p><h2 class="head1">IV. THE REASONS</h2><h2 class="head2">A. Man Being God&rsquo;s Image and Glory,<br />but Woman Being the Glory of Man</h2><p>One reason for head covering is found in verse 7: &ldquo;For a man indeed ought not to have his head covered, being God&rsquo;s image and glory; but the woman is the glory of a man.&rdquo; Man was made in God&rsquo;s image (Gen. 1:26) to express God and glorify Him. Since man bears God&rsquo;s image and glory and represents God, he ought not to have his head covered. If he does, God&rsquo;s image and glory will be concealed. Since woman is the glory of man, she ought not to have her head expressed but covered. She should not express herself but the man, under whom she is. This is also a ground taken by the apostle for his teaching of head covering.</p><p>When a man prays or prophesies, touching the throne of God&rsquo;s authority, he should not have his head covered. But when a woman prays or prophesies, she should be covered.</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_156.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_158.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Life-Study of 1 Corinthians &nbsp; pg 157</div><br></body></html>
