<h2 class="head2">The Bible Study in Shanghai</h2><p>Brother Watchman Nee was recently in Shanghai, and we invited him to conduct a Bible study on the topic of "The Truth Concerning the Outpouring of the Holy Spirit." The place was 34 Wen-teh Lane, Hardoon Road, every evening from 7 p.m. to 9 p.m., January 31&mdash;February 12. We saw God's blessing. Those attending the Bible study filled the room, and some received the promise of the Holy Spirit from God. We thank the Lord because His promise never changes. May the Lord give extra grace to each believer to receive all the gifts of the Holy Spirit which he should receive.</p><p>(Quoted from Issue No. 99 of the Shanghai Local Newsletter.)</p><h2 class="head2">A Letter from Brother Chai En-shang,<br />Shansi Province</h2><p>I am still waiting for God to give me a clear way. Please do not forget to pray for me. Last week there was a week-long Bible study. Many people desired the Lord. If the Lord allows, I plan to hold another Bible study the week after the Chinese New Year. Please pray for this and ask God to gain some. Sister Chang Chui-hsi of Tai-Ku sent a letter a few days ago saying that she was staying in a Methodist Church protected by the Lord. Thank the Lord, praise the Lord, this region is still peaceful. Please greet Sister Wang, Sister Chang, and all the brothers and sisters!</p><p>Chai En-shang<br />January 21</p><h2 class="head2">The Travels of Brother Hwa<br />and His Co-workers</h2><p>The few brothers here are all out working. Brother Hwa Tien-min has been traveling to several places in Kiangsu province the last few months. Thank the Lord, He has given grace in every locality. A few local churches are in a particularly good condition. Just before the Chinese New Year, Hwa Tien-min and Wu Jao-teh will return to Feng-Tien. There will be a conference for a few days during the Chinese New Year. Please remember all this before the Lord.</p><p>Chao Fei-wo, Sang Chen-guang</p><p>(This letter was sent from Feng-Tien&mdash;Editor.)</p><h2 class="head2">The Work in Tien-Shui and Shi-Shiang,<br />Kansu Province</h2><p>Since coming to Tien-Shui, I met with every church in She-Shiang. There are more than ten. I finished a few days ago and returned to rest.</p><p>The last time we had a meeting in Xie-Jia-Juang, Gan-Gu, Kansu province, more than ten people were saved. More than forty people were baptized on the day before Christmas. After the meeting we went to a few churches, and the Holy Spirit blessed us. We were in one accord, and some new ones were saved. Sister Chen Bi-hsi's elder sister sent a letter from Shantung saying that they had been kept safe by the Lord. My child (age 17) is now working with me. Please send more copies of The Open Door in the future. Please greet Brother Chang Yu-zhi. Also greet Sister Ruth Lee and Sister Phoebe Chang. Peace in the Lord!</p><p>Your brother in the Lord,<br />Duan Chai-ju<br />January 20<br />Please greet all the co-workers.<br />[Address omitted]</p>
