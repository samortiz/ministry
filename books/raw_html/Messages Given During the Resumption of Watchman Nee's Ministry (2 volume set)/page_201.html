<H1 CLASS=MSG>CHAPTER SIXTY-FOUR</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>THE WHOLE BODY SERVING</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>CO-WORKERS' MEETING (20)</H1><P>Date:Evening, April 26, 1948<br>Place:Hardoon Road, Shanghai<br>Speaker:Watchman Nee</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>GOD'S SALVATION AND DEMANDS BEING<br>THE SAME TODAY AS AT THE BEGINNING</H2><P>I believe that God is going to do great things today, and I believe that God has done something great already. God has given us a great salvation, a thorough salvation. In the first century, God saved men. Today, He is doing the same thing. The extent to which God saved men in the first century is the same as that which He is doing today. God cannot change the gospel in the course of two thousand years of human history. There is no change in the result and the demands of the gospel. We should not think that the first century Christians were required to pay a great price, and that today we do not need to pay the same price. Those who follow the Lord today must pay the same price as those in the first century. At that time, men had to forsake everything. Today, the requirement has not changed. There is, of course, a difference between putting a lamp under a bushel and putting it on the lampstand, but the lamp itself has not changed.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE DEGRADATION AND<br>THE RECOVERY OF THE CHURCH</H2><P>During the past two thousand years, the gospel has not changed. On the very day that the church was produced, God saw this new creation and considered that it was good. This is like God considering everything as good in Genesis after He created everything in six days. But after some time, the situation changed. Although the situation changed later, the beauty of the original creation remains the same. The beauty of the church on the first day at Pentecost was comparable to the beauty of Eve on the day of her creation. However, gradually the church changed. It turned from being Ephesus to becoming Sardis. At the time of Martin Luther, God began to take the way of recovery step by step. For the past four hundred years, every fifty years God did some recovery work. During the past one hundred years, His work has been especially strong. It seems as if the last few decades have seen the peak of recovery already. There has never been a time when the church has been as rich as it is now.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE BODY TESTIMONY BEING GOD'S FINAL RECOVERY</H2><P>We believe that God is recovering the most difficult thing today. What worries us the most today is the fulfillment of Ephesians 4. It seems as though we never have to worry about the fulfillment of John 3:16. We are not afraid that it will not be fulfilled, and we are not worried. Suppose someone says that he has believed and asks what he should do if he still has not received eternal life. He has believed, yet he has not seen any result. What should he do? We are not worried about this. I have read the New Testament more than two hundred times. I am not worried about any other passage. I have even read Revelation a few hundred times. I am not worried about that book either. However, I am worried about Ephesians 4. I am concerned how this passage of the Scriptures will be fulfilled.</P><P>Ephesians 4 says that the work of the ministry is to arrive at the oneness of the faith. The church is the Body of Christ, and it builds up itself in love. We are not concerned about things like the new heaven, the new earth, and the lake of fire. But when I lie on my bed, I am always apprehensive about the fulfillment of Ephesians. I have studied the Bible, and I have prayed. But I still do not have the assurance that the condition in Ephesians 4 will be fulfilled in the church today. Among God's children today, there is much confusion, and there are all kinds of divisions. When will we be one? Today, there are all kinds of ministries; the situation is very complicated. How can this chapter be recovered?</P><P>Yet, brothers and sisters, we believe that there will be a day when God's recovery will reach the fulfillment of Ephesians 4. God is doing a recovery work everywhere. The ultimate work among all these works may very well be the recovery of the Body testimony. God's leading today is to bring us back to the beginning, and to be recovered to the condition of the beginning.</P>
