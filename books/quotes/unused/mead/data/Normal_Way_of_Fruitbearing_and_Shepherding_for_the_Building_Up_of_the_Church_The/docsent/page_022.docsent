   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>PROCLAIMING THE WORD,</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>BEING READY IN SEASON AND OUT OF SEASON</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Paul told Timothy, Proclaim the word; be ready in season and out of season; convict, rebuke, exhort with all long-suffering and teaching 2 Tim 4:2 .</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>We should not say that it is winter and that we need to wait for spring to sow the seed.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Rather, we are peculiar farmers; to us every day is for sowing the seed and for reaping the harvest.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In season is when we have the opportunity, and out of season is when we do not have an opportunity.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Whether or not we have the opportunity, we need to be ready.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>To be ready means being urgent, attentive, and on the alert.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>We can compare this kind of readiness to instant tea or coffee.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Whenever we need some tea or coffee, it can be ready instantly.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>We need to be instant preachers, ready without need of further preparation.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>We should be ready at any time and in any place.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>We are ready at the supermarket, the bus station, the office, and the classroom.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>We must not say that we are not ready or that there are no opportunities.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Every occasion spring, summer, fall, and winter is the time for us to be ready.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>This is not the religious way of preaching.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>This is the proper Christian living.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>There is no other way to take.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>We need to have this kind of gospel living.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>We should not say that this is not the right place, the right time, or the right person for the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Every place is the right place, every time is the right time, and every person is the right person.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>We must be instant, ready, urgent, and attentive in season and out of season.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>NOT EXPECTING A GREAT REVIVAL</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>BUT BEARING FRUIT IN A NORMAL WAY</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>In the two Epistles to Timothy there are no miracles.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>If we have miracles, then we do not need to be in season and out of season.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>We can simply pray for three nights, and something will come down from heaven.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>However, the gospel is not that way.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Many Christians have prayed in a superstitious way, expecting a great revival to come, but the result has been poor.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>If, on the contrary, Christians will have a normal living of the gospel, it will be sufficient for each one to bring only one person to the Lord each year.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Then within twenty-five years the whole world will be evangelized.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Even in our own locality, if we all bear one fruit in a year, our numbers will double until the whole city will be evangelized.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>This is much greater than the biggest revival.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The subtlety of the enemy causes us to be too farsighted, looking to the future while neglecting the present.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>We do not need to look to tomorrow, and there is no need to pray for three years for a great revival to come.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>We should simply live for today and take care of one Nicodemus.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Many of us have been in Christianity for many years, and until today we are still under the influence of its traditional concepts, understanding, and teaching.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>We must be rid of all these concepts.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>We should care only for today, not for tomorrow.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Perhaps this evening we will meet one of our relatives.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Then we should spend some time to take care of him.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>This is a normal, daily gospel living, not a movement or special activity.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The Lord Jesus went to Samaria in a very normal way and waited at Jacob s well for someone to draw water.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Then He asked her for water, not in the way of preaching or of a movement but as part of His normal daily living.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>This daily living was His gospel preaching.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Because He was living in this way, God sent the right people to Him, and He brought people to God.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>If we would all live in this way, God will send His chosen ones to us.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Then every year we will reap fruit.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>However, because we have been influenced by the wrong concept, we have not borne fruit in a normal way.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Our time has been wasted in vain expectations, and we have not lived out our duty.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>If we have the proper living, day by day and one by one people will be brought to the Lord and into the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>This is the proper preaching of the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>FEEDING THE LORD S LAMBS</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>ACCORDING TO THE NORMAL PROCESS OF LIFE</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>John 4 speaks concerning reaping the harvest, John 15 concerning bearing fruit, and John 21 concerning feeding the lambs vv.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>15-17 .</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>No one can feed a lamb once for all in a miraculous way.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>If we try to do this, we will kill the lambs.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Rather, we need to feed them daily, several times a day, just as mothers feed their children meal after meal.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>We need to turn from the miraculous concept to the life concept.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>The Gospel of John is a book on life.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Reaping a harvest, bearing fruit, and feeding lambs are all processes of life.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>These are all related to a daily living in the way of life, not a mere work, activity, or movement in a miraculous, religious way.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>If we receive the Lord s mercy and enjoy His grace, we will all be built up in this life, and we will bear fruit and even double each year in a normal way.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Then in less than ten years the entire city we live in can be converted.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>This instant and constant way is solid, rich, and prevailing.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>This must be our living day and night.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>By living this way and being such persons, we will constantly enjoy the Lord s presence, supply, and all the riches of the life of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>We will have much to minister to the saints and much with which to function.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>This will enrich and uplift our meetings, and it will make us living and joyful.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>A family that has only the older generation with no children is not a joyful one.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>There is no doubt that to care for children is a bother.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Because my grandchildren are much trouble, they can stay with me for only short periods of time.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>Nevertheless, I love them all.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>How poor it would be if at my age I had no children or grandchildren!</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>My highest joy, however, is all the dear saints.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>We are a big family with all ages.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>Even a few new ones added to the church will make the meetings new, fresh, uplifted, and enriched.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>If the older generation of saints were the only ones who met all year round, we will all be disappointed, but if every Lord s Day we have several new ones, our spirit will be uplifted.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>To bear fruit in this way is the normal living of the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>We must all be built up in the living of the gospel.</S>
