   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER ONE HUNDRED SIXTY-THREE THE WORK OF THE HOLY SPIRIT</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>What is the fundamental difference between the work of the Holy Spirit in the Old Testament and the work of the Holy Spirit in the New Testament?</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In the Old Testament the Holy Spirit gave new birth to people.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>He also gave new birth to the people of the New Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Regarding the matter of the new birth, there is no difference in the Old and New Testaments.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>All is the work of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>We must not think of the new birth as something peculiar to the New Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The Lord told Nicodemus that as a teacher in Israel he should understand the new birth.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>What is the peculiar work of the Holy Spirit in the Old Testament?</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>In the Old Testament one thing is certain: we cannot find the Holy Spirit dwelling in human hearts.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Of course, He worked in human hearts, but He never dwelt within them.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>We cannot find one verse in the Old Testament that says the Holy Spirit took up His abode in human hearts.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>In the Old Testament we find the Holy Spirit coming upon, but not in, human beings.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>In the Septuagint we find epi, upon, used continuously, but never in. In the New Testament we also find the Holy Spirit coming upon people.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>This aspect of the Holy Spirit continued, but the Holy Spirit did more than that.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>On the night the Lord was betrayed, He said, "He abides with you and shall be in you" John 14:17b .</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>This was something quite new.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Thereafter men are said to be temples of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Being temples of the Holy Spirit means that the Holy Spirit lives within men.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>In the New Testament we find two aspects of the Spirit's work: 1 His coming upon men, and 2 His dwelling within men.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>His coming upon men is still for power, miracles, and witness.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>His dwelling within men is for holiness.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The indwelling of the Holy Spirit is to minister Christ to us, to make Christ ours, to make Him our life, and to make us bear the fruit of holiness.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>If we carefully differentiate between the two, we can understand the many misconceptions regarding the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Many think that if they can only have their "Pentecost," their problems would be settled.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>But now that you have had your "Pentecost," has it solved your problems related to holiness?</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Has it brought you victory over your temper, etc.?</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>This has not settled the question of victory over sin.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>With this kind of "Pentecost," we find only gifts but not fruit.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>When Paul saw the condition of the church in Corinth, he did not say, "Things are too bad here; we must stop everything."</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Many modern teachers would sweep everything away as carnal and devilish.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Paul did not sweep everything away; rather, he brought something in to balance it.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>First Corinthians 3:16 says, "Do you not know that you are the temple of God, and that the Spirit of God dwells in you?"</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>We must learn what it means to have the Holy Spirit dwelling in us.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Modern teachers teach us that the gifts are childish.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>They say, "We are grown up.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>We do not need toys like tongues.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Our Christianity is far beyond that stage.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>We are far beyond the apostles.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>We can cast them away."</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>However, those who stand for the gifts of the Holy Spirit have nothing in their mind except the gifts; they despise everyone who has not had a similar experience.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>They say, "On such and such a day I had the baptism of the Holy Spirit."</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Both of these parties are wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>In the New Testament we find these two aspects set before us.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>From the Lord's last supper until Pentecost, the Holy Spirit was spoken of four times: 1 During the Lord's supper, He was spoken of as the Paraclete, the Comforter.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>"He will give you another Comforter...He...shall be in you" John 14:16-17 .</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>2 After the Lord's supper the Holy Spirit was spoken of on the evening of His resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>He breathed into them and said, "Receive the Holy Spirit" 20:22 .</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>3 Immediately before the Lord was taken up to heaven, He referred to the Holy Spirit when He said, "I send forth the promise of My Father upon you;...stay in the city until you put on power from on high" Luke 24:49 .</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>4 Finally, the Holy Spirit was referred to on the day of Pentecost.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>People generally think that the promise of the Comforter was fulfilled at Pentecost, but this is not borne out by the Word of God.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Both chapter fourteen and chapter twenty of the Gospel of John were written by John.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>In John 14 the Lord promised, "He will give you another Comforter" v. 16 . In John 20 this promise was fulfilled.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>There is no promise that the Holy Spirit would come upon men before the death of the Lord; before His death He only promised that the Spirit would dwell within men.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>On the day of His resurrection, He breathed into them and said, "Receive the Holy Spirit" v. 22 . What is a breath? A breath is life.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>If we give up breathing, we give up life.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Christ breathed on the disciples and said, "Receive the Holy Spirit."</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Did the Lord say, "You must wait another fifty days"?</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>No. He breathed into them, and they received the Holy Spirit then and there.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>John 14 was fulfilled in John 20.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>The promise that was given at the Lord's supper was fulfilled on the day of resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Then the Lord said to His disciples, "Stay in the city until you put on power from on high" Luke 24:49 .</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Pentecost was the fulfillment of Luke 24.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Luke was written by Luke and Acts also was written by Luke!</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Acts 1 can be considered to be Luke 25 because it is the continuation of Luke.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>It is only natural that Luke would continue his own narrative.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Based on this we can see that the indwelling Holy Spirit, imparted by the Lord's breathing and based on His resurrection, is for life.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>The coming-upon Spirit, based on glorification of the Lord, is for service.</S>
