   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>The other side of authority is submission.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Therefore, the Bible mentions authority, on the one hand, and submission, on the other hand.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The Bible also pays considerable attention to the matter of submission.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Submission and authority are related one to the other.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>If a man submits, he comes under God's authority.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Otherwise, he overturns God's authority.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>In the church God has also appointed His authority, and we should submit to this authority.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>In the world, in the community, and in our homes, we should submit to authority.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>God has ordained us to do one thing, which is to submit to authority.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>We have to lay hold of this one point: whoever wants to overturn any authority overturns God.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Do not think that we can submit to God and, at the same time, disobey our parents, husbands, superiors, headmasters, principals, or other men with authority.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>There is no such thing.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>If we cannot submit to God's appointed authority on earth, we can never submit to God.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>In the same way, those who cannot submit to authority in the church cannot submit to God.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>I am afraid that many brothers and sisters have come to meet with us for different reasons.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Some have come for the purpose of practicing mutual love and mutual care.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>This, of course, is very good.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>But we have to realize that we are not without authority among us.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>There is authority among us, and we ought to submit to authority.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Christians often think that once they leave the denominations, they can act as they please.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>They think that we are all the same and that no one can rebuke anyone else.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>They think that they can be lawless Christians.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Actually, we have to realize that if we leave the denominations just because we want to be free from any kind of control or domination, this kind of presumptuous leaving of the denominations is a big mistake.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Those who come to meet with us have to know that we are more bound by authority.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>There are three reasons that a man leaves a denomination: 1 He is disappointed in the denominations.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>For example, he may expect to become a pastor.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>However, when his wish is not fulfilled, he disagrees and leaves.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>2 He does not have freedom in the denominations.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>He feels that he is limited and controlled by men, and he thinks that by leaving the denominations, he can be a free evangelist.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>He will not have to take a salary and be controlled by men, and he can act according to his own wish.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Actually, before God there is no such thing as a free evangelist.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Today, we only have the Body life.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>We are restricted by the church and do not have any freedom of our own.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>3 He sees the divisiveness in the denominations and that divisions are of the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>At the same time, he may see the Body of Christ and realize that everything he does has to be limited by the brothers and that he should learn to be a member in the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Yet many people do not see the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>They have merely left a big denomination and become a small denomination in themselves.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>They have not seen that they should be restricted among the brothers and sisters.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Of the three kinds of people mentioned above, only the third kind is right in God's eyes.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>God's goal is to have the Body life and to take away all independent movement.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>God has His authority in the church, and He desires to manifest His authority in the church.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Therefore, every member should learn to submit to God's authority and be restricted by the other members.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Therefore, on the negative side, every brother should see how wrong denominationalism is, but on the positive side, he should see that there are no independent activities in the Body life.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>THE AUTHORITY IN THE CHURCH</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>How should authority in the church be assigned?</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>God has appointed the elders and apostles to be the authority in the church.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>In each respective church, God establishes elders; among all the churches, God establishes apostles.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The authority of apostles is for overseeing all the churches, while the authority of elders is for overseeing each respective local church.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>In order to manifest His authority in the church, God appoints elders in each of the local churches to represent His authority.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Another name for elders is overseers, which bears the connotation of authority.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>The Bible tells us to submit to these ones because they represent authority.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>All authorities are there to represent God.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Therefore, the authority of the elders is for representing and expressing God's authority.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>It does not matter if an elder is a good representation or a bad one.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>One should submit to the elders as long as the authority is from God.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Whoever does not submit to the authority of the church has lost his standing as a brother.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>In the early meetings of a local church, there are no elders.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Later, some who bear some resemblance of an elder are gradually manifested.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Eldership and overseership are two designated names for the same office.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>An elder refers to the person, while an overseer refers to the function of such a person.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Moreover, in the Bible, elders are always plural in number.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>There is never just one elder, because it is necessary for the spirits of two to three persons to receive the same leading in order to be assured that what they are doing is right.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Individualism is not a scriptural principle, and it easily leads to errors.</S>
