   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>With the new nature as a contrast, the old nature is exposed to be evil, worldly, and devilish.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The new nature is holy, heavenly, and divine.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Because the old nature, with the passing of time, has become so deeply intertwined with the person himself, it takes quite a period of time to remove this old nature in experience.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The new nature has just come into being.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Since man's flesh and sinful nature have become too strong, the growth and function of the new nature are suppressed.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Of course, we are only speaking from man's point of view.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>This is like the thorns choking the growth of the seed of the word.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Because the two natures are opposite one to another, when temptation comes, a person experiences fierce conflicts.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Since the old nature is strong and the new nature weak, a person often ends up doing what he does not desire to do and not doing what he does desire to do.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Since the new nature is holy, when a person fails, he feels repentant and condemns himself, and he pleads for the sin-cleansing blood.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Brothers, by now, you should understand the reason for your conflicting experiences.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>This kind of conflict shows most assuredly that you are regenerated.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The most crucial question now is: how can we overcome?</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>In other words, how can we reject the power and work of the old nature, and walk according to the aspirations of the new nature, and thus please the Lord?</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Let us read three verses:</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>"But they who are of Christ Jesus have crucified the flesh with its passions and its lusts" Gal 5:24 .</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>"If we live by the Spirit, let us also walk by the Spirit"; "But I say, Walk by the Spirit and you shall by no means fulfill the lust of the flesh" vv.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>25, 16 .</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>These three verses tell us two ways to overcome the flesh, that is, the sinful nature, the old nature, and the old Adamic nature.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Actually, the two ways are merely two aspects, or two phases, of one way.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The cross and the Holy Spirit are the unique way to overcome the sinful nature.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Other than this way, any human resolutions, determinations, or vows to charity are destined for failure.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>We have seen that all our failures are caused by the tenaciousness of the sinful nature; we sink to such a low condition because of it.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Hence, whether or not we will overcome depends on whether or not we are able to deal with this sinful nature, which is the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Thank God that though we are helpless, He has the way.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>He has prepared a way for us on the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>When the Lord Jesus was crucified on the cross, not only did He die for us, but He crucified our flesh with Him on the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Hence, all those who belong to Christ Jesus and are regenerated have their flesh crucified.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>When He died on the cross, our flesh was crucified there as well.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Both the substitutional death and the identifying death have been accomplished by the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Both are fully accomplished.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Formerly, we believed in His substitutional death and were regenerated.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Now, in the same way, we believe that our flesh is crucified with Him, and we are brought into the experience of the death of the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>We know that the flesh is always the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>This is why God gave us a new life and a new nature.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>But what shall we do with the flesh?</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Since God considered it hopeless and impossible, He decided to terminate it, that is, to put it to death.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>There is no better way than to cause the flesh to die.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Hence, "they who are of Christ Jesus have crucified the flesh with its passions and its lusts."</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>This puts the flesh to death.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>This is what the Lord Jesus has accomplished; He has accomplished it already.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>By crucifying our flesh with Him, it becomes possible now for us to put to death the sinful nature.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>This has been accomplished without any effort of our own.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>How can this co-crucifixion become our experience?</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>We have said that the way is by faith.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Romans 6:11 says, "So also you, reckon yourselves to be dead to sin."</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Sin here refers to the sinful nature which is the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>By ourselves, we cannot cause the flesh to die.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>The only way is by reckoning.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Reckoning is an exercise of our will and our faith.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>This means that in our daily life, we should adopt the attitude that we are dead to the flesh, that we believe in God's word, and that we consider all God's words to be true.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>God says that our flesh has been crucified with the Lord Jesus; I believe that my flesh is indeed crucified.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>On the one hand, we believe that we are dead.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>On the other hand, we adopt the attitude that we are truly dead.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>If we do this, we will have the genuine experience of dying to sin.</S>
