He made the pillars thereof of silver, the bottom thereof of gold, the covering of it of purple, the midst thereof being paved with love, for the daughters of Jerusalem." This is the second part of the answer. The word "behold" in verse 7 covers verses 9 and 10 also. The word "chariot" is translated "palanquin" in Darby's New Translation. The bed is used by Solomon in the night, whereas the palanquin is used by him in the day. If the bed speaks of his rest, the palanquin must speak of his move. If the bed denotes his dwelling, the palanquin must denote his fellowship. If the bed is toward the enemy, the palanquin must be toward the friend.</P><P>We see a palanquin, not a chariot. If it were a chariot, there would be the need for a wheel. But a palanquin is carried by men. We should recall the history of the ark. The ark was not to be drawn by oxen. Rather, it had to be carried by the sons of Kohath. This means that in His move among God's children, Christ is carried by those who belong to Him.</P><P>The palanquin is made of the wood of Lebanon, which is cedar. Wood denotes humanity, whereas the wood of Lebanon denotes uplifted and noble humanity.</P><P>"He made the pillars thereof of silver." This speaks of His redemption. In the objective sense, it means that Christ is carried to others by means of His redemption. In the subjective sense, it means that the work of the cross has to remove all flesh. Only then can we express Christ.</P><P>"The bottom thereof of gold." This speaks of the fact that everything is from God. The divine life is the life we received at the time of regeneration. We come into full participation of this life when we become absolutely one with the cross. God's life is the unique basis upon which we can express Christ. Outside of God's life, we have no other ground to stand on.</P><P>"The covering of it of purple." It is purple because He is King, and He must reign. All the government is upon His shoulder. He will receive the kingship and sit as King.</P><P>"The midst thereof being paved with love, for the daughters of Jerusalem." Love is under the feet; it is at the bottom of the palanquin. This means that all the saints love Him.</P><P>The question that was posed asked, "Who is this that cometh out of the wilderness?", and the answer was, "King Solomon made himself a palanquin." This speaks of the union between the believers and the Lord. The answer first covers Solomon's position before his enemy. Now it covers his position before his friend. In the first case, it speaks of Solomon's power; in this case, it speaks of Solomon's glory. In the first part, we see Solomon's strength being the maiden's strength. In this part, we see Solomon's glory being the maiden's glory.</P><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_028.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_030.html">Next</a> </body></html>
