<h2 class=head2>86. Speaking with the Church</h2><p>Finally, the Spirit speaks with the church: “The Spirit and the bride say, Come!” (Rev. 22:17). In chapters two and three of Revelation it was the Spirit speaking to the churches. Here, at the end of the book, it is the Spirit and the bride, the church, speaking together as one. This indicates the improvement of the church in experiencing the Spirit.<p>In the New Testament the Spirit signifies the processed Triune God. Actually the Spirit is the ultimate expression of the processed Triune God. We have seen that Revelation 22:17 says, “The Spirit and the bride say, Come!” There is no expression in human language greater than this. The Spirit is the ultimate expression of the processed Triune God, and the bride is the ultimate expression of the transformed tripartite man. By the time of Revelation 22:17, the processed Triune God and the transformed tripartite man are married and become a universal couple. This means that the processed Triune God and the transformed tripartite man become one.<p>Here in Revelation 22:17 we have two consummations. Divinity has gone through a process—incarnation, crucifixion, resurrection, and ascension—to become the Spirit, the totality, the consummation, of the Triune God to be the Bridegroom. Humanity also has gone through a process— redemption, regeneration, and transformation—to become the consummation of God’s chosen, redeemed, regenerated, and transformed people. The consummation of the Triune God and the consummation of God’s chosen, redeemed, regenerated, and transformed people become one in a universal marriage. The Triune God marries the tripartite man. Here is an eternal couple expressing the Triune God. For eternity the tripartite man will enjoy the Triune God and match Him for His full expression and satisfaction.<p>In these messages we have covered four sections of the Spirit’s work in the believers: first, the section from initial sanctification, enlightenment, and regeneration through continual sanctification; second, the section of the working of the inner life; third, the section of the work to maintain the divine fellowship; and fourth, the section of the church, ministry, service, and work. From this we see that the work of the Spirit covers all areas of the Christian life and ministry. The Christian life and ministry are altogether in the Spirit, with the Spirit, and of the Spirit. Apart from the all-inclusive Spirit, we can have neither the Christian life nor the Christian ministry. Therefore, we need the infilling of the Holy Spirit and also the outpouring of the Holy Spirit so that we may have an adequate Christian life and work.
