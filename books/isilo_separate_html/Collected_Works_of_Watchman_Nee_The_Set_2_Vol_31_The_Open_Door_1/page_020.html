I have been remembering the brothers and sisters living in the war zone day and night. A while ago I received the Shanghai local newsletter as well as The Open Door from Hankow and realized that the Father has bestowed wonderful grace to preserve us all in peace. This is more than I had expected. Thank the Lord! We have a little sum of money which we are forwarding to Shanghai. I wonder how the saints are doing there and how the meetings in Shanghai are. Have the saints who are relocating to Szechuan and Hankow arrived safely? Our locality lies on the eastern sea coast and is not a strategic place for the military. Presently, little has been affected here. Our only assurance will be when the Prince of Peace appears soon. The work in the few meetings around Ch'iao Tun Men is being taken care of by the two Wang brothers; I am merely their helper. Presently, there is a lack of responsible ones; the number of meetings and attendants has gradually increased. It is a pity that the shepherding work has been absent. Dear brothers and sisters, we are often driven by the circumstances around us. Although we are far away from each other, we hope that our prayers for one another will be all the more earnest so that we may not commit any errors. I wish you victory and peace in the Lord.</p><p>A brother in the Lord,<br />Chang Wu-seng<br />November 10, after recovering from illness<br />[Address omitted]</p><h2 class="head2">Yu-Si, Fu-Ching, Fukien Province</h2><p>Dear Brothers Nee and Lan in the Lord:</p><p>Peace to you in the Lord! In 1934 the Lord's servants Faithful Luk, Chen Jai-seng, and Chen Ke-san came here for some pioneering work. The next winter the Lord's meeting was established. Thank the Lord! Now there are over forty brothers and sisters breaking the bread. The responsible brothers are Lin Wei-tze (who has since left the country), Lin Shao-liang, and Chai Yi-sung. After we received the baptism of the Holy Spirit, God performed many miracles and works of wonder and has confirmed the words that have been preached by saving many sinners.</p><p>Brothers in the Lord,<br />Lin Shao-liang, Chai Yi-sung<br />November 26<br />[Address omitted]</p><h2 class="head2">Da-Chien-Chun, Kutien, Fukien Province</h2><p>Dear Brothers Watchman Nee and Lan Tsi-yi in the Lord:</p><p>I have received The Open Door which you sent. Thank you. May the Lord fill you up in everything. We thank the Lord because our meeting here has witnessed His grace. Presently, we have eight brothers and sisters remembering the Lord. On Thursday evening we have our prayer meeting. We hope that you will pray much for us and for me in particular. The Lord has separated me from among the sinners. Thank Him! Now I can testify for Him. May the Lord glorify His own name at this end time, amen. Please write to me often. May you have more joy.</p><p>Brother in the Lord,<br />Wu Ju-shan<br />October 5<br />[Address omitted]</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_019.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_021.html">Next</a> </body></html>
