   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Being Built Together in the Local Churches Today</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In Ephesians 2:21 Paul said, In whom all the building, being fitted together, is growing into a holy temple in the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The phrase all the building in this verse refers to the universal church.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>However, in verse 22 Paul went on, In whom you also are being built together into a dwelling place of God in spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>In this verse you also refers to the local saints.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In each local church we are in the process of being built together.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>If we wait until the next age to be built, we will miss the mark.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>We need to be built today.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>We need growth, transformation, and building.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>We are being transformed not to be beautiful precious stones to be displayed individually; rather, as precious stones, we are good only for the building.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>We should not merely be piled together.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>According to verse 21, we need to be fitted together, that is, made suitable for the condition and situation of the building.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Not Being Able to Remove Ourselves</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>from the Building</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Once we are built together with the saints in the church, we cannot separate ourselves from the building.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>If we decide that we do not want to be in the building because we desire more freedom, it is too late.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Once we have been built into the church, we cannot leave the church.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>What a blessing this is!</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>What a glory it is to be built into God s building!</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>THE BODY-CHRIST BEING EXPERIENCED</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>TODAY IN THE CHURCH LIFE</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Today the Lord is building the Body-Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The main burden in this book is the Body-Christ, which is the individual Christ built with all His members.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>In the Body-Christ, Christ is wrought into all His members, and all Christ s members are wrought into Him.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The entire New Jerusalem will be the consummation of the Body-Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Today the church, the Body-Christ, is a miniature of the New Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>First Corinthians 12:12 says, All the members of the body, being many, are one body, so also is the Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The Christ in this verse is not the individual Christ but the corporate Christ Christ Himself incorporated with all His members.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>We are incorporated in Christ by the growth in life.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The more we grow in life, the more we are wrought into Christ and the more Christ is wrought into us.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Growth in life results in transformation, and transformation is for something corporate and mutual.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>As we are transformed, Christ is wrought into us, and we are wrought into Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Our old element is discharged, and Christ s element is wrought into us.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>This issues in the Body-Christ, which today is the proper church life, expressing Christ and satisfying God s desire.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>THE COMPLETED DIVINE REVELATION</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>IN THE BIBLE A Garden and a City</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>We need to see the vision of God s goal in the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>At the beginning, in Genesis, there is a record of creation.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>This record shows that God planted a garden 2:8 .</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Among the many trees in the garden was the tree of life v. 9 . Near the tree of life, there was also a river flowing to water the garden v. 10 , and the flow of the river issued in three precious materials: gold, bdellium, and onyx stone v. 12 . Bdellium is a pearl-like material produced from the sap of a tree.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>When the sap of a certain tree flows out, it congeals into a kind of gum, or resin, which becomes bdellium.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Onyx is a precious stone.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>In this picture we see not only the heavens and the earth formed by God but also the garden planted by God with the tree of life and a flowing river, which watered the garden and issued in gold, bdellium, and precious stone.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>To see the full meaning of the picture in Genesis 2:8-12, we need to go to Revelation 21 and 22.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The completion of this picture shows that the garden eventually becomes a city.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>A garden is something natural, but a city is something built, or constructed.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>In this constructed unit, the building of the New Jerusalem, there is the tree of life, a flowing river, and gold, pearls, and precious stones.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>However, these materials are no longer scattered about; rather, they have been built up into a city for eternity.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>This is the completed picture of the whole divine revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>The whole divine revelation is for this wonderful building, which is the Body-Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>The Body-Christ is Christ with the church, the Head with the Body, and it is produced by our eating Christ, drinking the Spirit, growing, being transformed, and being built together.</S>
