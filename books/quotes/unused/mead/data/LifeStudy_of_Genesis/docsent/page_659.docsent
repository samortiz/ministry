   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>IV.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>JOSEPH SHOWING LOVE</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>TO HIS BROTHERS</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Joseph's brothers were under his control, and he could have done whatever he wanted with them.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>If he had wanted them beheaded, he had the authority to command it.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>He also could have feasted with them if he had wanted to do that.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>But as one representing the reigning aspect of the mature life, Joseph behaved in a proper way toward everyone.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Because not all his brothers were the same, he did not treat them all in the same way.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The one who was the most evil required the most thorough discipline.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>As a type of Christ, Joseph did the same thing to his brothers that Christ will do to the nation of Israel in the future.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>First, Joseph disciplined them.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>In a sense, he terrified them.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>When I read about this as a child, I wondered why Joseph did not show love to his brothers.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>I thought that he should have immediately said, "I am Joseph, and you are my brothers.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Let us embrace, dance, and have a feast."</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>I wondered why, instead of showing love for his brothers, Joseph put them into prison.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Joseph did everything soberly and with discernment.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>But this did not mean that he had no love for his brothers.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>On the contrary, he had a great deal of love toward them.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>However, at the time he could not openly display his love for them.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Rather, he had to extend love to them in a secret way.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>He did this by restoring their money and by giving them provision for their journey 42:25 .</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Because Joseph's brothers did not understand his wise dealing with them, they were frightened by his secret love.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>I hope that the Spirit will speak more to you regarding these matters than I am able to utter.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>In the church life we need to learn to be calm and to restrain ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>We also need to learn not to show our glory.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Moreover, we must learn to do things not in a careless and foolish way, but in a sober and discerning way.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Finally, we also must have love for the brothers, even for those who require discipline.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>This is the life of Joseph.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>In the church life we need a calm life, a sober life, and a discerning life.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>If we have such a life, we shall know how to relate to the brothers and sisters.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>But whatever we do must be underlined with a secret love, a love that cannot be shown openly.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Verse 28 says, "And their heart went out, and they were afraid, saying one to another, What is this that God hath done unto us?"</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Heb .</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>This was the response of Joseph's brothers when they found their money in the mouth of their sacks.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>When they found the money in their sacks, their heart went out, that is, their heart was exercised.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>They might have wondered about what had taken place in Egypt.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>They were terrified of what had happened there.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Joseph was a very sober person.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>I do not believe that anyone else could have done what he did.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Genesis 42:9 says that Joseph remembered the dreams which he had dreamed of his brothers.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Now, after twenty-two years, his dreams were fulfilled.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>If we had been Joseph, we would have forgotten everything in our excitement at seeing our dreams fulfilled.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>We would have said, "Now that our dreams have been fulfilled, let us forget everything else and be happy."</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>But if Joseph had done this, enjoying to the uttermost the fulfillment of his dreams, he would not have been able to do anything to help his brothers.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>As far as he was concerned, he was ready to enjoy the fulfillment of his dreams.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>He did not need any more discipline.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>His brothers, however, certainly did need discipline.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Thus, Joseph did not act for himself, but for his brothers.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Rather, for their sake he was willing to sacrifice the enjoyment of the fulfillment of his dreams for a period of time.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Joseph's dreams were fulfilled in his brothers' coming to him and bowing down before him.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>If Joseph had intended merely to enjoy the fulfillment of his dreams, he could have said to his brothers, "I am Joseph, and I am so happy to see you.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Let us eat together.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Then you go back and bring my father here."</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Even in ancient times it would not have taken more than a few weeks for them to return home and to come back with their father.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Joseph could have said, "I cannot wait any longer to be with my father.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>I've been away from him for more than twenty years.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Now I want to enjoy his presence.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>I want to see him as soon as possible."</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>No doubt Joseph desperately desired to see his father.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>But for the sake of his brothers he was willing to postpone his enjoyment.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Joseph's sacrifice of this enjoyment caused him to delay the enjoyment of the fulfillment of his dreams for at least another six months.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>The brothers had to go home, exhaust the food supply, and return for more grain.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Eventually, their father came to Egypt to see Joseph.</S>
