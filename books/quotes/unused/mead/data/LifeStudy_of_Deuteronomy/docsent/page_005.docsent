   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The Word Being Christ as Food to Man</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>for Man to Take as His Nourishment</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The word is not only Christ as the word of God for man to receive as his life; the word is also Christ as food to man for man to take as his nourishment Deut 8:3; Matt 4:4; John 6:63b, 57b .</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Christ is first our life and then our life supply.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>For both our life and life supply, Christ is the word.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Matthew 4:4, a quotation of Deuteronomy 8:3, reveals that Christ as the word of God is our life supply.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Everything that proceeds out of the mouth of God is Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Since this message is on Deuteronomy, we would emphasize the fact that the word in this book is Christ as our life and life supply.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Let us come to this book to find Christ both as our life and as our life supply.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>II.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>THE GENERAL SKETCH</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The general sketch of Deuteronomy is this: the renewed training given to the new generation of the children of Israel after their long wandering, to prepare them to enter into the good land promised by God and inherit it as their possession.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The word training cannot be found in Deuteronomy, but in fact Moses was giving the people a renewed training.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The first training had been given forty years earlier at Mount Sinai, and in the book of Deuteronomy this training was given again, this time to the new generation, who had been wandering in the wilderness.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The purpose of this training was to prepare them to enter into the good land and inherit it.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>During the forty years in the wilderness, the children of Israel were carried by God.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Moses speaks concerning this in 1:31: "In the wilderness, where you have seen that Jehovah your God carried you, as a man carries his son, in all the way that you went until you came to this place."</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Although their wandering was not pleasing to God, He carried them all the time until eventually He gained a people who were ready to enter into the good land, possess it, enjoy it, and build in it a temple, a house, for God.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The principle is the same with us today.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Throughout the years, God has been carrying us.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>God carries us even when our daily living is not pleasing to Him; He does not cast us aside.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>He is carrying not only all the believers but also all the churches.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The churches today are on the Lord's shoulder.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>He is carrying the churches for the purpose of accomplishing His economy.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>God cannot be defeated; His goal will be attained.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>As He is carrying us, He needs us to have a deuteronomy, a respeaking, again and again.</S>
