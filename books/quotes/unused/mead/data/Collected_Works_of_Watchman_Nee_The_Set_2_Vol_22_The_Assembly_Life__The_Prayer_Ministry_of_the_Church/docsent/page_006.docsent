   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER ONE AUTHORITY IN THE CHURCH</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In order to understand authority in the church, we must first understand what authority is.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Otherwise, we will not understand authority in the church.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>What is authority?</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>In the whole universe, nothing is harder to understand than authority.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Two things are very difficult to explain in the Bible: glory and authority.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Many people can understand holiness, righteousness, and patience; they may comprehend these matters a little.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>But what is God's glory, and what is God's authority?</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Man cannot understand them and explain them.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>God's glory is related to God Himself, while God's authority is related to His government.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>God Himself is glorious, while His government is executed through His authority.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>God's authority was the principle by which He organized the universe.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>He rules the universe through authority.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Today, we will only mention the matter of authority in brief.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>We will wait for another day to discuss the subject in detail.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>How did God create the heavens and the earth?</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>He created by His authority.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>How did God restore this world?</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>He restored by His authority also.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>On the first day when God created light, He did not gather all of the electricity together and make light; He only gave a command and said, "Let there be light," and there was light.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The second day God said, "Let there be the firmament," and there was the firmament.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>God commanded with His word, and He acted according to His authority.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>He did not act according to His power or His ways.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>His word signifies His command, which represents His authority.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Can you see that God only exercised His authority?</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>God created the universe with His authority, and He rules the universe with His authority.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Both the beginning of the universe and the maintenance of the universe are the result of God's authority.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>In the beginning, after the universe was created, God appointed a cherubim as the archangel to rule over everything.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>God was over everything, and He ruled over the spirit-endowed animals and over all things through the archangel, the cherubim.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Sin is lawlessness, and lawlessness is just the overthrowing of God's authority.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Lawlessness was the reason the archangel fell and became Satan and also the reason sin entered the universe.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The archangel attempted to overturn God's authority because he desired to uplift himself to become equal with God.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Sin entered the world because Eve would not submit to Adam.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>She acted without Adam's command and ate the fruit of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Although the world is filled with sin today, authority is still the principle of God's government.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>In many things, we can see God's appointed authority.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>For example, wives should submit to their husbands, servants to their masters, students to their teachers, citizens to the officers, and subordinates to their superiors.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>All of this is ordained by God.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>God desires that man submit to authority because the authorities are not only appointed by God, but they also represent God.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>This is why Romans clearly says that there is no authority except God.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Therefore, no Christian student should boycott classes, no Christian worker should strike, no Christian children should dishonor their parents, and no Christian citizen should engage in a revolution.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>If anyone does these things, he is not just overturning those he directly opposes, he is overturning God's authority.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>God created the universe with His authority, and He maintains the universe with His authority.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>What is sin?</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>It is lawlessness refusing to submit to authority.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>"Sin is lawlessness" 1 John 3:4 .</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Both Satan and Adam overturned God's authority; by this both sinned.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Whoever does not recognize authority and submit to authority is a lawless one, and he has sinned.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Many believers have never realized such a wonderful thing as authority.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Yet if a man wants to be a good believer, he has to know what authority is.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Authority represents God.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>If one traces authority to its ultimate source, he will see that authority is just God.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Therefore, a Christian must not only submit to the head of a nation or to all its ministers, but he must submit even to a policeman on the street because the latter has authority.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>He represents not only the government, but God as well.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>You cannot despise him just because he earns a few dollars a month.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Authority is something that issues from God.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>The Bible is very strict about this matter.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Paul, Peter, and Jude all said that we should not revile those in high position.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Therefore, in our conversation, we cannot accuse or criticize the head of our government.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>It is difficult for a Christian to be an editor of a newspaper because one can hardly avoid criticizing the superiors in political commentary.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>The book of Jude records the incident of Michael arguing with the devil over the body of Moses.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Michael dared not revile Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>He would only say, "The Lord rebuke you," because he was once the subordinate of Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>There was a time when Michael was under his authority.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Therefore, Michael only said, "The Lord rebuke you."</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>He would not speak on his own; he only invoked an authority higher than Satan's God's authority.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>He knew what authority was.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Therefore, he dared not revile Satan himself.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>When our Lord was on earth, He was also fully under authority.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>During His youth, He was under the authority of His parents, and He kept all the ordinances.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>He was the Creator.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Yet He was limited by every one of man's limitations.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>He told His mother, "Did you not know that I must be in the things of My Father?"</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>Luke 2:49 .</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>If we were there, we would not have gone home with our parents.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>But the Lord was different; He went back with them.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>When He began to work, He was under the authority of the government.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>During His trial, He was still under the authority of the government.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>He did not revile the government; rather, He allowed it to do whatever it wanted to do to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>We can see that no one has ever been as submissive to authority as our Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>Once when Paul was judged and stood before the court, he willingly submitted to the authority there.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>When the high priest's accusations became too much, Paul said, "God is going to strike you, you whitewashed wall" Acts 23:3 .</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>When the others rebuked him for reviling God's high priest, Paul became quiet and allowed them to accuse him.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>According to the Bible, nothing is greater and more important than the matter of authority.</S>
