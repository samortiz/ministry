   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Guiding Them into All the Reality</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In John 16:13 we have the Spirit's work in the believers to guide them into all the reality: "When He, the Spirit of reality, comes, He will guide you into all the reality; for He will not speak from Himself, but whatever He hears He will speak; and He will disclose to you what is to come."</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The Spirit of reality guides the believers into all the reality of the Triune God and of all divine matters.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The Spirit of reality guides us into the reality of justification, holiness, love, and all other divine things.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>He leads us into, brings us into, the reality of these things.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>According to the context, "the reality" in John 16:13 refers to what the Father has, what the Son has, and what the Spirit receives of the Son and of what the Father has.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>What the Father has is a reality, what the Son has is a reality, and what the Spirit receives is also reality.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>What the Father has becomes the Son's, what the Son has is received by the Spirit, and what the Spirit receives is disclosed to us.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The Father, the Son, the Spirit, and we, the believers, are all involved in this process.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The Father, who is the source, the origin, has many riches.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>All that the Father has becomes the Son's. The Son has unsearchable riches Eph 3:8 . Whatever the Father has is the Son's, and what the Son has is received by the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Since what the Spirit receives is disclosed or transmitted to us, we become the destination.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The Father is embodied in the Son, the Son is transfigured to be the Spirit, and the Spirit is the reaching of the divine Trinity to us.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>All the riches of the Triune God reach us in the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Therefore, we are the destination of the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>All that the Triune God is and has has been disclosed, conveyed, transmitted, to us.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Because we are organically united to the Spirit, that is, organically united to the processed Triune God, whatever He is and has now is our portion as our reality.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The reality into which the Spirit guides us is the reality of the divine Trinity.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Actually, the reality of the divine Trinity is the indwelling Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>It is the Spirit who dwells within us, not the Spirit who rests upon us, who is this reality.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The Spirit is the reality of all that the Father and the Son are.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Without the Spirit, there is the essence of what the Father and the Son are, but there is no realization.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The Spirit is the application of all that the Father and the Son are.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>If we would apply all that the Father and the Son are, we need the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Now the indwelling Spirit is guiding the believers not into the doctrine of the Triune God but into the reality of the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Through the Spirit the reality of the divine Trinity is transmitted into us.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Through this transmission all the riches of what the processed Triune God is and has are dispensed into us.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Now whatever the processed Triune God is and has becomes our element.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>This makes the processed Triune God the very essence of our being.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>In this way the Spirit as the consummation of the processed Triune God becomes our portion.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>This is the Spirit as the reality of the Triune God for our experience and enjoyment.</S>
