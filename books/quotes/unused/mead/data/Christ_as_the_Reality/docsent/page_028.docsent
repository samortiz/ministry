   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE HUMANITY OF JESUS IN MATTHEW</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>If we would pray-read all the verses in Matthew concerning the Lord's humanity, we would see the humanity it takes to be a king.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Many years ago, a Christian teacher argued with me, saying that we would all be kings when the Lord comes back.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>But I asked, "Brother, look at yourself.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Could you be a king?"</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Do you believe that we can be so sloppy in our humanity now, yet when the Lord Jesus returns He will suddenly make us a king?</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Such teachings are nonsense.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>No Exception</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>All that the Lord is in His person depends upon His humanity.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Look at the verses in Matthew.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>John the Baptist was baptizing in the Jordan.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Even John saw that there was no need for Jesus to be baptized.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>He was the Son of God.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Nevertheless, Jesus said, "Permit it now, for in this way it is fitting for us to fulfill all righteousness" Matt 3:15 .</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>We must be so right with God in whatever He wants.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Sometimes we, and especially the younger brothers and sisters, think that it may be necessary for others to do certain things, but not us.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>However, Jesus in effect said to John, "Regardless of who I am, as long as I am a man in this age, I must be baptized by you.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>This is what God is doing today.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>As long as I am living in this day of God's dispensation, I must go along with God's righteousness."</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>This is the humanity of Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>We should never consider ourselves an exception.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>We need to fulfill all the righteousness of God.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Kept in the Position of Man</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>After His baptism the man Jesus was led into the wilderness to be tempted by the evil one.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Satan is so subtle.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>He said, "If You are the Son of God " But the Lord immediately answered, "Man shall not live on bread alone " Matt 4:3-4 .</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>In effect the Lord said to Satan, "Do not put me in the position of the Son of God.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>I am here as a man.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>If I am here as the Son of God, how could I be tempted by you?</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>I can be tempted only because I am a man.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Undoubtedly I am the Son of God, but I am not standing in that position; I am standing here as a man."</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Then the subtle one brought Him to the top of the temple and said, "If You are the Son of God, cast Yourself down; for it is written, He shall give charge to His angels concerning You, and on their hands they shall bear You up, lest You strike Your foot against a stone.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Jesus said to him, Again it is written, You shall not tempt the Lord your God" Matt 4:6-7 .</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Jesus told him that as a man He would never tempt God.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Finally, Satan even attempted to persuade the Lord to worship him by offering Him the kingdoms of the world.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>But Jesus answered, "Go, Satan!</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>For it is written, You shall worship the Lord your God, and Him only shall you serve" Matt 4:10 .</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The Lord kept Himself continually in the position of man.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>There is one more interesting matter in these verses concerning the temptation in the wilderness.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Satan tempted the Lord Jesus by quoting Psalm 91.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Even Satan can quote the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>But the Lord answered, "Again it is written."</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>It is not a matter of quoting one passage of Scripture.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>There must be another for confirmation.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>This is the humanity of Jesus, quoting Scripture not in an isolated way, but in the way of confirmation.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>No Resting Place</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Matthew 8:20 says, "The foxes have holes, and the birds of the heaven have roosts, but the Son of Man has nowhere that He may lay His head."</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>As a man, the Lord was not so comfortable all the time.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Let us apply it in this way.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Suppose five brothers move into an apartment with three bedrooms.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Who will take the one bedroom for himself?</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>If we seek a way to get the single bedroom for ourselves, that means that we are taking the humanity of foxes, not the humanity of Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>If we really take the Lord as our humanity, we will have no desire for the single bedroom.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>So many times we simply follow the foxes and birds of the air.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>The humanity that likes to have the fox's hole is of no use for the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Only the life that is willing to have nowhere to lay its head is good for the church.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>This is the humanity of Jesus, and this is the proper way to build up God's dwelling place.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>We all need such a humanity.</S>
