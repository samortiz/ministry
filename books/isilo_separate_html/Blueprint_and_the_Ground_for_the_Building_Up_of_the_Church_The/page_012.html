<h1 class="title">THE GROUND FOR THE BUILDING<br />
OF THE CHURCH</h1>
<h2 class="head1">THE GROUND FOR THE BUILDING OF THE TEMPLE</h2>
<p>According to the Bible, the site for the building of the temple was the threshing floor of Ornan on Mount Moriah (2 Chron. 3:1). If this had not been God&rsquo;s intention, it would not have been recorded in the Bible. The temple of God being built on the threshing floor of Ornan on Mount Moriah is not a small matter; it was a great event in the universe. If a temple had been built according to the same pattern and materials but in a different location, there would have been a serious problem of division among the Israelites. Using the same pattern, materials, and even builders, the Israelites could have chosen any location to build a temple. There could have been temples in the south, the north, the east, and the west, but the Israelites would inevitably have been divided.</p>
<p>God not only spoke of the pattern, the materials and their quantities, and the builders for building the temple, but He also chose the building site to be Mount Moriah. There was only one place for the building. This was the one ground that would forever keep the Israelites from being divided. Historically, however, the kingdom of Israel was divided into the northern kingdom and the southern kingdom because the northern kingdom forsook the one ground for the holy temple. The Israelites could build the temple on only one site. If the temple was to be built on the earth, it had to be built on this ground. Only the piece of land on Mount Moriah could be used for building the temple. Any other location would cause the Israelites to be divided.</p>
<p>For thirty years we have focused on the matter of the ground, emphasizing that the church is unique, that there can be only one local expression, and that the church can be built on only one ground. The church can be built on only one ground; apart from this ground the church cannot be built. If the building takes place apart from this ground, the church will be divided. The Lord has enlightened us in this matter so that we can fight the battle and contend for the ground of the church. This is an exceedingly great matter. If the temple had been built in a location other than the threshing floor of Ornan, many temples could have been built. However, for the past few thousand years of history there has been only one temple. Although the temple was destroyed, when it was rebuilt, it was built on the same ground.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE HISTORY OF THE BUILDING OF THE TEMPLE</h2>
<p>The temple was built by Solomon (1 Kings 6). Then the temple was rebuilt two times. It was rebuilt at the time of Ezra (Ezra 3:6b-13; 6:13-15), and then by Herod (John 2:20). Herod did not rebuild the temple because it had been destroyed but because he felt that the temple built at the time of Ezra was not large enough or adequately restored. Based on political considerations, Herod, a Gentile king, rebuilt the temple in order to cope with the Jewish sentiment. Nevertheless, the temple was built at its designated site, not at another site. The Israelites did not annul the unique ground for the worship of God.</p>
<p>The children of Israel who were scattered among the nations built synagogues. Although the Israelites had synagogues, they knew that the synagogues could not replace the temple. The Jews must worship God, and they know that the place which God has appointed for His worship is the threshing floor of Ornan in Jerusalem; there cannot be another place of worship. During the time of the Roman Empire, the Israelites were scattered among the nations, but they did not abandon their worship of God. They did not have the proper ground on which to build the temple, so they built synagogues instead as places for worship. No Jew would dare to claim that a synagogue is the temple. There are many Jewish synagogues in New York, but no Jew would claim that a synagogue is the temple. The temple can be built only on the unique ground. This keeps the children of Israel from division. Even though the Jews are scattered, they are not divided. They are waiting to gain the unique ground for the temple.</p>
<p>The threshing floor of Ornan on Mount Moriah is the ground for the building of the temple. The third largest Muslim mosque was built on this site and still stands there. The largest mosque is in Mecca. The third largest mosque was built on the threshing floor of Ornan on Mount Moriah. Mount Moriah is also the place where Abraham offered up Isaac (Gen. 22:2). The Muslims recognize Abraham as their forefather.</p>
<p>The city of Jerusalem has suffered many wars and has had its walls demolished and rebuilt. Today the city of Jerusalem is situated on several peaks, and the threshing floor of Ornan, which is the building site of the temple, is on the city border. Mount Zion is one of the high peaks of the city of Jerusalem.</p>
<p>The ancient fortress of David was on Mount Zion. This is also where he pitched a tent for the Ark (2 Sam. 6:17). Later God instructed David to build a temple on Mount Moriah, where his forefather Abraham had worshipped God (24:18-25; 1 Chron. 21:18&mdash;22:1; 2 Chron. 3:1). After Solomon, David&rsquo;s son, built the temple, he brought up the Ark from the city of David, which is Zion, into the temple (5:2; 1 Kings 8:1-11), and the tent that David had pitched was abandoned. At the same time, the Tent of Meeting in Shiloh with its vessels was moved into the temple, for Solomon merged the tabernacle with the temple (vv. 4-6). The tent that David pitched according to his will was abandoned. From then on, no matter how confused or troubled the children of Israel were, they had only one worship center. They could not build the temple anywhere other than the threshing floor of Ornan on Mount Moriah. This ground is unique and keeps the oneness of God&rsquo;s children. The ground is not the base or the material for the temple but the site for building the temple.</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_011.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_013.html">Next</a> </body></html>
