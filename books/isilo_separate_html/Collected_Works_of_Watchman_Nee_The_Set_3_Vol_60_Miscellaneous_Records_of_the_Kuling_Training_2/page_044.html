Peking-Tientsin, Canton, and Swatow (Hakka) can wait for one or two months; they can join together to boost Wenchow first. We can gather the brothers and sisters who have a heart to serve in Wenchow, train them for two or three weeks, and then send them out to different places for the work after the training. We have to share with them the things we have seen in Kuling. There is also the need for building a new meeting hall. The present meeting hall can only hold two to three hundred people. We have only three sisters from Wenchow who are in this training. Miss Gui should return to Shanghai and then move to the Wenchow region. You should pray about it first, and consider what you should do.</p><p>Concerning our work in the coming days, I hope that we will increase the flow between the north and the south. (If Brother Witness is to move here, we will need many brothers and sisters to go to Shanghai.) Brother Chai Chi needs more time to rest.</p><p>Tsingtao is presently under special circumstances. Outwardly it is being surrounded. Yet it is a promising region, and there are many promising ones from this region. Brother Zi-jieh can return to this region. Perhaps the brothers from Chefoo will also go to Tsingtao. In the future the work in Chefoo and Tsinan will hinge on Tsingtao. The brothers from Peking-Tientsin should temporarily go to Tsingtao, Canton, or Wenchow to strengthen the work in these places. I am only speaking of general principles.</p><p>Brothers Liu Xiao-liang and Suen Feng-lu should move to Tsingtao to strengthen the testimony there. We hope that the work in Tsingtao will begin immediately. Today we are merely telling you what our feelings are. Sisters Sung Tien-dong, Dong Huang De-hui, and Wang Shu-ching should be relocated. Perhaps they should not return to their own localities. Sister Sung and Sister Dong may return to Tsingtao.</p><p>Hakka region: The Hakka region is too weak at present. I hope that Brother James Chen can move to Swatow and bear the responsibility of the work in the Hakka region. The work in this region should begin from Swatow. The brothers and sisters who come from this region should perhaps go back to this region and begin working there. The situation in this region is different from that in Wenchow. There is the need for pioneering and foundational work. I hope that some can help Brother James in this area. Brothers Chen Ke-san and Tsai Chi-chung should discuss among themselves and see if another brother can be spared to help Brother James. We hope that this will take care of the need for a while. Perhaps the real work in this region has to wait until the work in Wenchow is well on its way.</p><p>Brother Weigh has to take more responsibility in Canton. In addition, I hope that some brothers and sisters from the north will also move to this area. This region needs someone with weighty spiritual stature to oversee the spiritual condition. We have to strengthen the brothers and sisters as well as the workers. There is also the need for some strong sisters. Sisters Lin, Tseng, and Lei should best be stationed in Canton while they begin their work in the Canton region. Other than gaining a few from the Christian and Missionary Alliance, nothing was raised up in Canton. God's way depends on man. Material supplies and finances are minor matters; the most important factor is the person. Catholicism is weakest in Kwangsi province; it is difficult for the Catholics to work in that region. There is definitely the need to strengthen the work in Kwangtung and Kwangsi.</p><p>Peking-Tientsin is still the region with the greatest amount of foreign influence. The best place for the center in this region is Peking. It is the center of education and the best place to establish student work. There are plenty of opportunities there. However, the meeting in Peking at present is behind that in Tientsin. The meeting hall in Peking must be built. The brothers have to bear more responsibility there. The brothers and sisters from Manchuria should temporarily stay in Peking, but the work in this region can only begin after the work in Tsingtao has had a start.</p><p>It is best if four or five co-workers travel together for itinerant preaching. They should go whenever a local church invites them. Every time they travel, they should have at least three brothers and two sisters in a team. Brother Hsu Jung-jieh and Sister Miao can take the lead in this matter. The question of lodging can be settled later. Brother Chow Kang-yao may have to travel. Brother Chow Hung-bao is not yet clear about his way ahead. These brothers and sisters either have their families with them here on the mountain, or they may reside in Foochow.</p><p>The need for the literature work is great. The Ministers is for news and reports on the work. The Way is for the new believers. The Testimony is for older brothers and sisters. (We hope that we can put out one issue a week.) The Gospel is for the unbelievers. We are also working on some reference books. These are not general books; they are for helping readers understand the Bible. We hope that we can translate some books, such as Henry Alford's word study. We hope to do a paraphrase of Darby's Synopsis of the Bible. This means rewriting it in language that we can understand. This is not for our study, but for reference and comparison. What these ones wrote may not be altogether correct. We hope also to translate Grant's Numerical Bible, at least the New Testament part. Alford opens the meaning of individual words in the Bible, Darby shows the meaning of the Bible as a whole, while Grant directs us to the proper method of exegesis. The literature work is not the work of the High Priest but the work of the Levites. If we have seven or eight sisters to help us, we can prepare our own concordance.</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_043.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_045.html">Next</a> </body></html>
