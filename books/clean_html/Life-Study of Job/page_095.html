<H2 CLASS=HEAD1>III. GOD PAYING NO ATTENTION TO ELIHU</H2><P>In His reply to Job, God paid no attention to Elihu because his concept had not come up to the level of God's ultimate standard, though it was not wrong. Elihu, a young man, thought that he was somebody, but he actually was nobody.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>IV. GOD CHARGING JOB'S THREE FRIENDS<br>TO GO TO JOB AND OFFER A BURNT OFFERING<br>FOR THEMSELVES</H2><P>God charged Job's three friends to go to Job and offer a burnt offering for themselves that God's servant Job might pray for them (vv. 8-9). This charge was according to the level and standard of that time. The three friends did as Jehovah had told them, and Jehovah accepted Job.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>V. JOB PRAYING FOR HIS FRIENDS,<br>AND GOD TURNING THE CAPTIVITY OF JOB</H2><P>Job prayed for his friends, and God turned the captivity of Job and gave Job twice as much as he had before (vv. 10-17). All his relatives and acquaintances came to him, ate bread with him in his house, and consoled and comforted him for all the misfortune that had been brought upon him, and gave to him some gifts. Job had been in captivity, having been captured by Satan away from his common situation. God turned Job's captivity and blessed Job with physical blessings.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>VI. ALL THE PHYSICAL BLESSINGS<br>WITH WHICH GOD BLESSED JOB<br>BEING TO SHOW JOB GOD'S LOVINGKINDNESS<br>AND FAITHFULNESS IN HIS LATTER DAYS</H2><P>All the physical blessings with which God blessed Job were to show Job God's lovingkindness and faithfulness in his latter days. This indicates that God is perfect and kind in dealing with those who love Him. Even today, after God deals with us by stripping us and consuming us, and after His purpose is accomplished, God gives us His physical blessings. However, God's purpose in dealing with His people is not to give physical blessings to them but to give Himself to them as their eternal portion, which ultimately consummates in the New Jerusalem (Rev. 21&#151;22).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>VII. JAMES CONSIDERING JOB<br>AS AN EXAMPLE OF SUFFERING AND OF ENDURANCE</H2><P>"As an example, brothers, of suffering evil and of long-suffering, take the prophets, who spoke in the name of the Lord. Behold, we call those who endured blessed. You have heard of the endurance of Job, and you have seen his end from the Lord, that the Lord is very tenderhearted and compassionate" (James 5:10-11). Here we see that James considered Job as an example of suffering and of endurance.</P>
