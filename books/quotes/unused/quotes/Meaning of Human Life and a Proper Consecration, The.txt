When we pray-read, we must first exercise, use, our spirit, because the substance of the Bible as the word of God is Spirit
The Chinese classics are excellent, but no matter how we read them, we cannot feel the Spirit, because the Spirit is not in them
When we come to the meeting, we can begin to sing prayerfully or pray-read even before the scheduled time of the meeting
Some saints are attending this training because they like to listen to messages or to the expounding of Scriptures
The Bible does not speak of exercising our soul but of denying it because of its contamination due to the fall
Although the Bible says that we should deny and forsake the soul , it does not say that we should forsake the function of the mind
If our heart is on something other than the Lord, there is a problem with our heart, and we should deal with it
Of saying, 'Which He caused to abound to us,' the Chinese Union Version says, 'Which He rewarded us bountifully'
God has a good pleasure which He decided planned arranged and determined in Himself in eternity that we would know the mystery of His will

When we pray-read these verses with a strong spirit, a sober mind, and a pure heart, we will receive the riches in the Word
God's purpose in creating man was for man to express God and represent Him, that is, for man to be His expression and His representation
Scientists and physicists study God's creation, but their studies are like a small grain in a field that is as expansive as the universe
Before any man landed on the moon, scientists conducted many studies and had many theories about life on the moon
Man is qualified and capable of representing God, because this is God's delight; God created us for this purpose
Dogs are not able to represent us, because they have neither human consciousness nor a discerning ability to represent man
On the second day God said, 'Let there be an expanse in the midst of the waters, and let it separate the waters from the waters'
On the third day God said, 'Let the waters under the heavens be gathered together into one place, and let the dry land appear
The record concerning God's creation of man is not as simple as that of His creation of other living things or the heavenly bodies
Even though we know the doctrine of the trinity, no one can clearly explain what it means for God to be three yet one
Matthew 2819 says Go therefore and disciple all the nations baptizing them into the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit
By considering these two verses together we see that God said Us and Our when He created man because it involved His economy and arrangement
The mystery of the three-yet-one God-the Father, the Son, and the Spirit-is not a doctrine; it is for Him to work Himself into us
When God created man, He referred to Himself as 'Us' and 'Our' because the Father, the Son, and the Spirit were involved
After the Lord Jesus came into the world, He died on the cross and was resurrected from the dead to become the Spirit
If another person were to wear this suit, it would not fit him, because it was not sewn according to his measurements
To be saved means to be rescued by God out of a human life that is void of meaning into a life that is full of meaning
Man needs to believe in Jesus not mainly because he has sins but because without Him man has no meaning in life
Even if man were not sinful he would still need Jesus because man was created in Gods image to express God and thus he needs to receive God
Not only so, He operates within us to transform and renew us so that we are conformed to the image of the Son of God
Although there are other planets in our solar system besides the earth, no human beings or organisms have been found on other planets
For this reason we must know the meaning of human life, which is God entering into man so that He may be expressed through man
Before entering the university, you thought that passing the entrance examination was something wonderful; hence, you worked hard
After graduating, some young people continue with graduate school and earn a master's degree or even become a doctor of philosophy
Eventually, when he graduates from the university and begins to work, the sense of emptiness within him becomes stronger
Education, marriage, and careers cannot satisfy man because the meaning of human life cannot be found in these things
If there were no saved person in Taiwan, even if there were millions of people on the island, the island would have no meaning
The saints who meet regularly in Taipei are joyful because they have the Lord in them, and they sing spontaneously wherever they are
Not only so, all the saints in the church in Taipei should go out and sing on the streets every two weeks or once a month
If there were no human beings on the earth the earth would be empty and if there were no Christians human life would be a complete tragedy
Revelation says that when the new heaven and the new earth appear, the New Jerusalem will come down out of heaven
In every community there is a need for a group of Christians to be filled with the Lord and to sing about the Lord
The brothers and sisters in San Francisco, especially the young saints, are like the early Christians; they have a special flavor
The old religious way is to tell him to pray for his parents' salvation and believe in the Lord's promise in Acts 16:31
The brother may know which evening his parents are at home, and he can ask some young brothers to visit him that night
One day Brother Nee released a message from 2 Corinthians 5:13: 'Whether we were beside ourselves, it was to God'
He also used Acts 26 where, after Paul defended himself before King Agrippa, Festus the governor said to him, 'You are insane, Paul
Paul said that it was not much learning but that it was God in him who emboldened him to speak freely so that he was beside himself
Some will regard us as fools, but we must remember that Christ is the meaning of our human life and that we are the meaning of society
In 2 Corinthians 3:17 Paul says, 'The Lord is the Spirit; and where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is freedom'
If we are willing to let go of our face, be emboldened, and declare that Jesus is Lord, we will no longer have a long face
Even if we have consecrated before, we still need to go to the Lord today and again thoroughly give ourselves to Him
We have said that we should be beside ourselves to the Lord, but it is not enough to be merely beside ourselves
If there is no consecration, our actions will only be outward, making us the same as those who act in a drama, who are merely pretending
We have seen that the Lord is the meaning of our human life, and the meaning of our human life is also the meaning of the universe
When we truly see the meaning of human life, we will go to the Lord in consecration, placing ourselves completely in His hand
When we consecrate ourselves to the Lord, He will operate in us, touching our sins and causing us to be conscious of them
As we give ourselves to the Lord and fellowship with Him, He will demand more ground within us, and He will occupy us more
In order to consecrate ourselves to the Lord, confess our sins, be emptied, and let the Lord occupy us, we must have transactions with Him
It is good for us to pray together in groups, but sometimes it is necessary for us to go to the Lord individually
We must personally take care of consecrating ourselves to the Lord, receiving His shining and dealing, and letting Him occupy our being
After we consecrate ourselves to the Lord and He touches our sins, we should confess our sins and ask Him to cleanse us with His blood
We should believe that the Lord will fill us and not rely on our feelings, expecting something to be poured on us
After we consecrate ourselves to the Lord confess our sins are emptied and give the Lord the ground in us we should not wait to be filled
Since we have consecrated ourselves to the Lord, confessed our sins, and let the Lord gain ground in us, the Lord will fill us
If we believe, we will be filled with joy and rejoice such that we can gather with other saints and praise the Lord
In verse 19 there are not only psalms and hymns but also spiritual songs, and there is not only speaking but also singing
As He touches different items, we should deal with them and give them to Him, allowing Him to occupy us inch by inch
Every one of us should have a genuine consecration; we should spend time to earnestly pray and offer ourselves to the Lord
Formerly, obtaining a bachelor's degree was our decision, and now giving up a bachelor's degree is still our decision
Consecration means that we offer ourselves as vessels to the Lord to let Him fill us, occupy us, and be expressed through us
If the Lord says that our attitude to our parents is not good, we should respond by asking Him to forgive us and cleanse us with His blood
The Lord may say that we offended a younger brother, and we should respond by asking Him to forgive us for offending this brother
Consecration does not mean that we should give up studying and eating, leave the world, and retreat to the mountains
If the Lord says that we should get rid of something, we get rid of it, and if the Lord says that we should keep something, we keep it
We are often influenced by natural concepts, religious thoughts, Christian tradition, and even our history in the recovery
The consecration that the Lord desires is for us to give ourselves to Him as vessels and let Him be our person
These traditions frustrate believers from understanding God's desire according to the original intention and revelation of the Bible
God chose us and predestinated us before the foundation of the world so that we would be conformed to the image of His Son
On the day that we first called on His name, the day we were saved, His desire was to enter into us in order to fill us completely
The first layer consists of sins, the second layer consists of things other than the Lord, and the third layer is the self
Our precious experiences of the Lord will not be our experience of Him as thunderstorms but our experience of Him as showers of rain
Eventually, we will experience the genuine filling of the Holy Spirit; that is, our inner being will be completely occupied by Him
To say that we will stand on the ground of the church in order to recover the truth for the Lord is to speak from the self
The Lord does not intend for us to go to remote regions or to live in the mountains; neither does He want us to stand on the ground for Him
The Lord would say that we do not have to be so strong and would ask whether He is the person or we are the person
It is not a matter of what we want to do; it is a matter of giving ourselves to the Lord and letting Him be our person
If we have a genuine consecration and are thus filled with the Holy Spirit, the church where we are will be blessed
Some of us have consecrated everything to the Lord except our person; hence, we still tell the Lord what we want
We should exercise our spirit so that it will be strong and fresh; otherwise, the spirit of the meeting will sink
Perhaps we resolve that one day we will preach the gospel overseas or declare the Lord's love to the aborigines
We may even be resolute and ask the Lord to cleanse us fill us and equip us for His use even though we are not qualified useful or gifted
Some consecrations are even based on strange concepts, such as being a ball for the Lord to throw wherever He wants
If we ask the Lord to be our person so that we will not lose our temper, then we are still the person; the Lord is not our person
Religion means that a person has something to worship and believe in and that he develops a set of teachings based on his beliefs
Some saints may be concerned about the uncertainty of their future but say that the Lord, not they, should worry about their future
It is easy for a person to go in and out of a physical house that is lifeless and void of a will and a personality
As the Lord's house, we are living creatures with a personality, a will, preferences, and inclinations, all of which are our person
Consecration means to let Him dwell in us by taking Him as our person; hence, our original person has to 'move out'
Even though we are the Lords dwelling place we have life a personality a will preferences and inclinations hence we are still our person
Even though our old man may be crucified and buried in the morning, he often is resurrected in our experience before noon
By the Lord's mercy we were brought into the light of His Word to see that His salvation is practical, complete, thorough, and simple
We say that we need His salvation to be forgiven of our sins, to be delivered from hell, and to be spared from God's judgment
Not only does the Lord give eternal life, but He gives His Spirit to live in us as our power, sanctification, and everything
Even though the messages that we heard in the past seem to have been fragmented, our need today is to receive the Lord as our person
We should not be influenced by complicated and natural thoughts and concepts; neither should we be influenced by religious traditions
Since many of us did not have a proper consecration when we received the Lord, we need to make up for it today
In the past we did not speak concerning Christ making His home in our heart, because we thought that people would not understand
When we are strengthened into the inner man, Christ will make His home in our hearts so that we may be filled unto all the fullness of God
Such a religious concept is harmful because it implies that they need to consecrate themselves so that they might be spiritual
It is rather simple for the unbelievers, who have never heard the things in Christianity, to comprehend the gospel and consecration
When we are strengthened into the inner man, Christ will make His home in our hearts, and we will be filled unto all the fullness of God
When we let Christ make His home in our hearts, the result is that we will be filled with the Holy Spirit unto all the fullness of God
We need to know the difference between these two phrases our regenerated spirit is our inner man and the Lord is the person in our inner man
By the Lord's mercy, we need a thorough salvation so that the Lord can enter into us, occupy us completely, and be our person
We need to continually experience consecration until it is something ordinary, regular, and normal in our Christian life
Verse 27 says, 'God created man in His own image, in the image of God He created him; male and female He created them'
On the other hand, these social groups are filled with sin, selfishness, treacheries, striving, and backstabbing
Similarly, the eyes cannot say that they dislike the body and will therefore leave the body and exist by themselves
Once a member is cut off, he is finished, and he loses his life and function and, at the same time, becomes quite uncomely
Whenever we are not in the Body, however, our life is over, our function vanishes, and we are no longer lovely
He said that the Lords sheep are everywhere and that the Lord is feeding His sheep wherever they are therefore every place is about the same
We cannot accept the view that it is good enough for a person to be spiritual, even if he is not on the proper ground
A few weeks later he disapproved of the ground of the church, which we stress, in private conversations and publicly
Ephesians 1 speaks of the church being the Body of Christ , and in chapter 2 this Body is the new man in the spirit
God does not want to gain individuals to express Him; rather, He desires to gain a corporate man for His expression
The church as the Body is a corporate entity with Christ as its life, and the church is also the new man with Christ as its person
Later the Lord showed us that the church is not composed of individual believers; the church is a corporate man
Our old man has been crucified with Christ, and now it is no longer our old man who lives, but it is Christ who lives in us
Now that we have received Christ as our person, we do not need to be concerned about the way to overcome our temper
In other words, we are still living by our old man, who is still here and is incapable of doing good but quite capable of doing evil things
We need an absolute consecration of handing ourselves over to the Lord and yielding our person to Him so that He can be our person
It is not that we hate or love others, it is not that we are meek or irritable, and it is not that we are humble or proud
If there were one hundred believers there would be one hundred persons if there were a thousand believers there would be a thousand persons
Verse 18 says that you 'may be full of strength to apprehend with all the saints what the breadth and length and height and depth are'
It does not matter whether we are old or young or from the mainland or Taiwan; neither does it matter if we are odd or eccentric
Since we lack the ability to love one another in ourselves, after a period of time we will accumulate bitter feelings toward one another
If we receive the Lord's grace, we will see that in order for Christ to make His home in our hearts, we should take Christ as our person
When the Lord is our person, we can spontaneously love an unlovable brother because the Lord, who is our person, loves him
By being joined to Him, we become people possessing not only our human nature but also His divine nature and His uplifted human nature
Psalm 90:14 says, 'Satisfy us in the morning with Your lovingkindness / That we may give a ringing shout and rejoice all our days'
Satan, the cunning one, hides behind every ordinance in order to create division and cause people to be in discord
The quiet saints should not rebuke the saints who shout, nor should the saints who shout criticize the quiet saints
Since the new man is the church in chapter 2, it cannot change its meaning in chapter 4 and become the new self
Our former manner of life includes everything related to us: what we are, what we have, our family life, and our social life
Our living and walk are related to our parents and children and to our siblings, classmates, colleagues, neighbors, and relatives
To live the church life does not mean that he should go to the meeting on Lord's Day morning and listen to a pastor's sermon
We can pray-read together and be built up, or we can go out to preach the gospel and spread the Lord's kingdom by saving souls
When we let the Lord strengthen us into the inner man, He makes His home in our hearts, and we are filled unto all the fullness of God
God 'is able to do superabundantly above all that we ask or think, according to the power which operates in us
Some believers say that while the Bible says that the church is the Body of Christ, it does not say that the church is the new man
Verse 16 then says, 'And might reconcile both in one Body to God through the cross, having slain the enmity by it'
Timothy 1:7 says, 'God has not given us a spirit of cowardice, but of power and of love and of sobermindedness'
If we have love without a sober mind, we will confuse our gospel friends, and they will be unreceptive to our speaking
Our former manner of life refers to the kind of life we lived and includes our contact with others, our social activities
To put off the old man means to put off our old manner of living that is the living we had in the past in contacting and dealing with others
Since we have put off our former manner of living, we can no longer seek worldly pleasures, such as social clubs
Our former manner of life, our old life, whether it was related to a social club, a society, or a certain community, has been put off
They translated verse 23 as 'that you be renewed in your will power'; they missed the two words spirit and mind
The Chinese Bible translators probably due to their inadequate experience could not understand the special terms used by Paul in his Epistle
The Bible reveals that our regenerated spirit needs to be strengthened, and then it will spread outward to all the parts of our soul
It is only when our spirit spreads and occupies our mind and becomes the spirit of our mind that it becomes the renewing spirit
To be renewed in the spirit of our mind is to put off our former manner of living and to put on the church life
In Ephesians 1 the desire of God's heart, His good pleasure, which He purposed in Himself, is to have an economy according to His will
When we have life and experience and an understanding of the truth, our speaking will convey the truth to others and supply them
In the 1800s Bible scholars acknowledged that some portions of the King James Version did not match the original text
The scholars knew that the original text of the Bible was copied by hand, and as a result, some manuscripts were inaccurate
Since numerous manuscripts of the Bible are available, archeologists determine which manuscripts are authentic and the most accurate
The British scholars published the Revised Standard Version, and the American scholars published the American Standard Version
When our regenerated spirit, indwelt by the Lord, is strengthened, it will spread into our mind and control, occupy, and saturate our mind
It is in this spirit that we put off the old man, our former manner of living, and put on the new man, the church life
In order to be useful persons we must pay attention to these three items growing in life knowing the truth and speaking the truth to others
From one perspective a school may seem small in scope, but even a small school can have several thousand students
The oldest students typically are no more than twenty-five or twenty-six years old, and they are not yet set and settled
The best time to speak to him concerning the Lord is while he is still a student, because students are not set or settled
It is not easy for a couple who are in their sixties and who are set and settled to receive the truth concerning the Lord Jesus
Initially, their parents may not be pleased, but if the young people will continue to speak, their parents will believe
Some parents say that the knowledge their children receive in high school or college is of a new era and should be right
They will follow their children because they love their children, and they identify with what their children do
Everyone is required to finish junior high school; therefore, we must aggressively preach the gospel to the students in junior high school
The co-workers need to open their eyes and see that to labor in the schools will reap double the results with half the effort
If we gain a classmate, he will preach the gospel to his parents, and in this way family after family will be saved
My desire is for them to graduate from college and then give themselves to preach the gospel throughout this island
Whether you are in college, high school, or junior high school, you should give yourself to the Lord while you are still a student
Should you serve full time, or should you first go abroad to study, or should you serve full time after you graduate?
We should not focus on these things; instead, we should simply take Christ as our person and begin preaching the gospel
If you feel that the Lord wants to gain a certain classmate, you should exercise your faith and contact that classmate
These saints should first come together at least two or three times a week for half an hour, maybe at noontime, to pray-read or fellowship
If these twelve saints would each diligently work on one classmate, within a year they could gain more than fifty classmates
If we desire to contact others for the release of the Lords life that is to lead others to salvation we need to pay attention to a few items
We are not ashamed to discuss Chinese classics, the world situation, science, chemistry, or mathematics with others
We all have had the experience of being ashamed when we speak with others concerning the Lord Jesus or the gospel
Whether they are preaching the gospel to a classmate or putting on a gospel vest, they should simply say, 'Get behind me, Satan
No matter how much we have achieved, if we do not overcome the feeling of shame related to the gospel, we will not be useful
We must deal with this matter of being ashamed of the gospel until we, like Paul, can say, 'I am not ashamed of the gospel'
After confessing in this way and asking for the Lord's cleansing, we should put the matter that we have confessed behind us
After we confess our sin, asking for forgiveness and the cleansing of the blood, we should not think about that sin any longer
If we confess our sins, He is faithful and righteous to forgive us our sins and cleanse us from all unrighteousness'
Whenever we sense that we have offended the Lord, we should immediately confess and ask Him to cleanse us with His blood
As we practice this, we will be clear concerning the Lord's leading and concerning His moving within us as our person
After he confesses these matters, he will be cleansed by the blood, and there will be no insulation between him and the Lord
The more we bargain with Him, the higher His demand will be; the more we comply with His leading, the more flexible He will be
If he bargains with the Lord by offering to write a note rather than to apologize face to face, he will lose the Lord's presence
After a day the Lord may have mercy on the young brother and again ask him to apologize, but this time the Lord may require more
It may seem that there is a price to pay in following the Lord's leading, but there is actually no price to pay
We may not be aware of it, but those whom we contact will be subdued by the power of the gospel and will believe in the Lord
Christians always try to persuade others to believe in Jesus; however, it is very easy for people to believe in Jesus
When some saints encounter difficulties, they say that they no longer believe in the Lord; however, eventually faith within them rises up
Outwardly he may feel that our speaking does not make sense, but inwardly he will sense the preciousness of the Lord
When another classmate believes in the Lord there will be two meetings and when three classmates have believed there will be three meetings
If there are two thousand brothers and sisters in a school, that is two thousand little speakers, who are more effective than one preacher
It is not easy for the children to listen to their parents, but it is rather easy for the parents to receive what their children say
When young people hear the gospel in school, they will tell their parents what they heard, and it will be easy for the parents to follow
