   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>God desired to become a man, and one day He became a man, living on earth as a God-man.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Yet when He lived on earth as the God-man, He did not live by His human life, but by His divine life.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>He was divine.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>He wanted to become human, and He was human.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Yet He lived a human life not by His humanity, but by His divinity.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>He was a human being that came with divinity.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>He lived on this earth not only as God but also as man.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>He lived as a God-man, yet not by the life of man but by the life of God.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>So His human living was not lived out by the human life but by the divine life.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Yet within the divine life, there was the element of humanity, and within the human life, there was the element of divinity.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The divine attributes became the human virtues.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Caesar Augustus Luke 2:1 was the first formal Caesar of the Roman Empire, who took possession of the land where this God-man lived.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>This God-man's living under the Roman Empire is a part of human history.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>He lived by always rejecting His human life, by always putting His human life under the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>From the first day He lived on earth, He was crucified.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>He lived a crucified human life, not by His human life, but by His divine life.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>His human living did not express humanity but divinity in the divine attributes becoming the human virtues.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>This is what Paul meant in 1 Timothy 3 when he spoke of Christ as God manifested in the flesh v. 16 .</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Many Christians know that one day God was incarnated to be a man by the name of Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>They know this just in black and white, but sorry to say, they do not know the intrinsic fact of this incarnation.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>This incarnation produced a God-man, who lived on the earth not by His human life but by His divine life.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>All the days when He was on earth, He put Himself on the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>He remained on the cross to die that He might live by God, not to express man but to express God in His divine attributes becoming man's virtues.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>This was the life of the first God-man as a prototype.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Today we are His reproduction, His many copies, so we should live the same kind of life.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>I was born in Christianity.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>From my youth I was taught that we have to follow Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>What they meant, however, was this: "Jesus loves people, so we have to follow Him in loving people.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Jesus was meek and patient, so we have to follow Jesus in meekness and in patience."</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Apparently, this teaching is right, but intrinsically, it is absolutely off.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Intrinsically speaking, to follow Jesus is to be a xerox copy of that first God-man.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>To follow Jesus is to live the life of a God-man, not by the human life but by the divine life, so that God may be expressed or manifested in the flesh in all His divine attributes becoming the human virtues.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>This is the intrinsic significance of what it is to follow Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>So the practical way to live a life according to the high peak of the divine revelation is that you must be a God-man.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>As a God-man you need to live a life not by yourself but by another One, not by your human life but by His divine life, not to express yourself but to express His divinity in His divine attributes which all become your human virtues.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>I. THE LIFE OF CHRIST, THE FIRST GOD-MAN,</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>ON THE EARTH A. Being Both God and Man,</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Having the Divine Life and the Human Life</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>First, we need to be clear about the life of Christ, the first God-man, on the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>He was both God and man, having the divine life and the human life.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>B. Living a Life of Humanity,</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Not by His Human Life, but by His Divine Life</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Christ lived a life of humanity, not by His human life, but by His divine life.</S>
