	 <h1 class="msg">CHAPTER TEN</h1>
<h1 class="title">THE JOINT MEETINGS OF THE CHURCH<br />
AND<br />
THE SMALL GROUP GATHERINGS</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Matt. 18:20; Acts 2:46-47; 5:42; 20:20; Heb. 10:24-25</h1>
<p>Prayer: Lord, we thank You from the depths of our being. By Your grace You have visited us, called us, and separated us from this evil age. Lord, when we see so many brothers and sisters meeting every day, we know that You are doing a work of grace in our heart. We look to You that Your work within us would be deeper and weightier every day.</p>
<p>Teach us to truly know that we are one spirit with You. We believe that You are among us; we declare that You are with us. We have a spirit, and we have Your Spirit in our spirit; these two have become one. We want to exercise our spirit to speak and to listen. Reveal Your words, heart&rsquo;s desire, and hidden mysteries. We want to be freed from oldness, traditions, and everything of the past; we want to live in freshness. Lord, grant us instant light, and speak a fresh word to us. May Your Spirit impart Your thoughts, feelings, and words so that we would touch Your presence and so that we would also sense that You have touched the depths of our being.</p>
<p>Lord, we worship You that You are with us. You promised that if we kept Your teaching, You would be with us until the consummation of the age. Therefore, we believe that You are speaking to us and that You are here with us. Cause every one of us to lift up our spirit to worship You and to open our heart to thank You.</p>
<p>Lord, we truly desire to receive rich grace from You again. Supply us individually, and supply all the churches. Supply all those who are under Your name; we know that there are still thousands of brothers and sisters in this city who are not meeting with us. We pray for them, just as You prayed for them. And Lord, just as You have visited us, we ask that You would visit them. May Your light shine upon them through us, and may Your truth reach them through us so that they would see the light, know the truth, and walk in the way of life.</p>
<p>Lord, destroy the enemy, destroy the demons, destroy Babylon, and destroy human organization. Release Your children, save Your Body, and strengthen Your testimony. In Your victorious name we bind the evil one. We stand on Your promise to trample serpents and scorpions under our feet. We curse the evil one, and we rebuke him before Your throne. Lord, we stretch out our hands of faith to touch the throne of Your authority, to destroy the authority of darkness, to rescue Your church, and to build up Your Body. You have overcome, and You will overcome unto eternity. Conquer our disposition, naturalness, and self. Glorify Your name; only You are able to protect Your glory. Lord, we truly worship You. We beseech You to speak to us again. Lord Jesus, we exalt Your name, call on Your name, extol Your name, and praise Your name, which is above every name. Amen.</p>
<h2 class="head1">MEETINGS IN THE BIBLE</h2>
<p>In this chapter we will fellowship concerning meetings. According to our concept, meetings are something very ordinary. In the Bible, however, meetings are not an ordinary matter. Meetings are first mentioned in the New Testament in Matthew 18:20, following the Lord Jesus&rsquo; reference to the church in verse 17, which speaks of telling a matter to the church. In verse 20 He said, &ldquo;Where there are two or three gathered into My name, there am I in their midst.&rdquo; In these two verses there are three matters: the church, the meetings, and the Lord&rsquo;s presence. These three things are interrelated. Where there is a church, there should be meetings; where there are meetings, the Lord is present in our midst.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Type of the Israelites</h2>
<p>The Old Testament shows that God&rsquo;s people lived a life of meeting. The greatest type in the Old Testament is the type of the called race of Israel. God did not save the Israelites individually; their salvation was a corporate salvation. Every household of Israel kept the Passover at the same time, and together they crossed the Red Sea, journeyed through the wilderness, and reached the good land. They journeyed through the wilderness, reached the foothills of Mount Sinai, and set up their camps together. From the night of the Passover, no one in the called race of Israel lived individualistically. They lived a meeting life, and they moved as an assembly (Acts 7:38).</p>
<p>At the base of Mount Sinai the whole assembly of the children of Israel gathered before God, who descended upon Mount Sinai and called Moses up to the mountaintop to reveal the pattern of the tabernacle to him. This was a kind of meeting. Even the building of the tabernacle at the base of the mountain was not an individual work but a corporate work, the work of the assembly. All the Israelites built the tabernacle of God with each tribe doing its part.</p>
<p>After the tabernacle of God was built, the whole assembly of Israel set out and journeyed onward. Even when they were moving forward, they walked together as an assembly. No Israelite acted individually. Rather, all the people of Israel moved corporately as an assembly. Moreover, God&rsquo;s leading was unique&mdash;a pillar of cloud by day and a pillar of fire by night. At that time there were at least two million Israelites, including men and women, young and old. Even though there were many Israelites, there was only one pillar of cloud by day and one pillar of fire by night. God&rsquo;s leading did not involve two million pillars of cloud and fire. The children of Israel were a corporate people, not scattered individuals, and their entire living was a meeting life.</p>
