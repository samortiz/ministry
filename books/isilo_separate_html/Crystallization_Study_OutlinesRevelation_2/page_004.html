<h1 class="title">Babylon the Great&mdash;<br />
Religious Babylon and Material Babylon</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Rev. 14:8; 17:1&mdash;19:4;<br />
2:18-24; Matt. 13:33</h1>
<ol class="upper-romanbd">
<li>Revelation 17 is an unveiling of religious Babylon&mdash;the apostate Roman Catholic Church:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>In the eyes of God the Roman Catholic Church, which perpetuates much of Judaism and has assimilated much of paganism, is Babylon.</li>
	<li><em>Mystery</em> in verse 5 indicates that Babylon the Great in chapter seventeen is the apostate church; she is mysterious in what she is, in what she practices, and in what she teaches.</li>
	<li>The woman in Matthew 13:33 is the Jezebel in Revelation 2:20, and Jezebel becomes the great harlot in 17:1:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>Jezebel, the pagan wife of Ahab, is a type of the apostate church&mdash;1 Kings 16:31.</li>
		<li>The principle of the deeds of the apostate church is to mix the heathen, pagan things with the worship of God by His people&mdash;Matt. 13:33; Rev. 17:4.</li>
		<li>Jezebel, the apostate church, is a self-appointed prophetess, who presumes to be authorized to speak for God and demands that people listen to her rather than to God&mdash;2:20.</li>
		<li>In the apostate church are &ldquo;the deep things of Satan,&rdquo; the mysterious teachings of Satan&mdash; v. 24:
			<ol class="lower-alpha">
			<li>Satan dwells in the apostate church in a subtle way through the teaching of the deep things of Satan.</li>
			<li>The deep thought of Satan has saturated the apostate church, causing it to become the embodiment of Satan.</li>
			</ol></li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>The harlot in 17:1 is the apostate Roman Catholic Church:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>The fornication of the apostate church consists of her having sinful relationships with the kings of the earth for her profit&mdash;v. 2a:
			<ol class="lower-alpha">
			<li>The Roman Catholic Church is intimately involved with worldly politics, and the kings of the earth commit fornication directly with her.</li>
			<li>In the eyes of God, this is spiritual fornication.</li>
			</ol></li>
		<li>The &ldquo;wine of her fornication&rdquo; signifies the heretical doctrines of the apostate church in her fornicating relationships with the governments on the earth&mdash;v. 2b.</li>
		<li>The apostate church is in a wilderness, a desert, where there are no springs of water prepared by God&mdash;v. 3.</li>
		<li>The harlot is &ldquo;gilded with gold and precious stone and pearls&rdquo;&mdash;v. 4a:
			<ol class="lower-alpha">
			<li>Gold, precious stone, and pearls are the materials with which the New Jerusalem is built&mdash;21:18-19, 21.</li>
			<li>The apostate church is gilded (not solidly built) with these treasures as ornaments for outward display and as a deception intended to entice people.</li>
			</ol></li>
		<li>The harlot has in her hand &ldquo;a golden cup full of abominations and the unclean things of her fornication&rdquo;&mdash;17:4b:
			<ol class="lower-alpha">
			<li>Since gold signifies the divine nature, the golden cup indicates that in her outward appearance the apostate church has something of God.</li>
			<li>Her &ldquo;golden cup&rdquo; is full of idolatry, pagan practices, and satanic things.</li>
			<li>The Roman Catholic Church has certain holy things, but she has mixed in many evil and unclean things.</li>
			</ol></li>
		<li>The great harlot is the &ldquo;mother of the harlots&rdquo;&mdash;v. 5:
			<ol class="lower-alpha">
			<li>The harlots, the daughters of the great harlot, are the sects and groups in Christianity that hold to some extent the teachings, practices, and traditions of the apostate church.</li>
			<li>The denominations and groups that still practice some of the great harlot&rsquo;s Babylonian traditions belong in the category of Babylon.</li>
			<li>Only the pure, genuine local churches have no evil transmitted from the great harlot, the apostate church&mdash;1:11-12.</li>
			</ol></li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>Because God hates the apostate church, at the beginning of the great tribulation, God will cause Antichrist and his ten kings to destroy the Roman Catholic Church&mdash;17:16-17.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>Revelation 18 is an unveiling of material Babylon&mdash;the city of Rome:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>In Revelation 17 and 18 two aspects of Babylon&mdash; the religious aspect and the material aspect&mdash; are mixed together:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>The harlot in 17:16 denotes religious Babylon, signifying the Roman Catholic Church, whereas the woman in verse 18 denotes material Babylon, signifying the city of Rome.</li>
		<li>In 18:3 the aspects of religious and material Babylon are both mentioned:
			<ol class="lower-alpha">
			<li>The Roman religion makes all nations drunk with her religious, devilish wine.</li>
			<li>The city of Rome enriches the merchants of the earth by the power of her luxury.</li>
			</ol></li>
		<li>Since Babylon the Great is twofold, to come out of her means to come out of both religious Babylon and material Babylon&mdash;v. 4.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>Material Babylon, the city of Rome, will become hateful in the eyes of God because it has been the source of both devilish politics and devilish religion&mdash;vv. 6-8, 20-24.</li>
	<li>Christ as another Angel will shine over the earth to destroy Babylon the Great, the city of Rome, with His great authority&mdash;vv. 1-2.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>Babylon the Great will have two falls&mdash;the fall of religious Babylon and the fall of material Babylon&mdash;14:8; 18:2:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>The fall of religious Babylon will take place at the beginning of the great tribulation&mdash;17:16-17.</li>
	<li>The fall of material Babylon will take place at the end of the great tribulation&mdash;18:2, 21.</li>
	<li>The praise in 19:1-4 is related not mainly to the fall of material Babylon but to the fall of religious Babylon, because in the eyes of God religious Babylon is more hateful than material Babylon.</li>
