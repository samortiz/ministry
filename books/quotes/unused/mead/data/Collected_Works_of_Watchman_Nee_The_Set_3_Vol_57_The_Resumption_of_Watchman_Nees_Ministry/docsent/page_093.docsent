   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE APPOINTMENT OF ELDERS</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The fifth point concerns the appointment of responsible brothers.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Not everyone can appoint elders.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Paul asked Timothy to appoint elders, but he did not ask Mark, Silas, Luke, or Demas to appoint elders.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Some are hands; they cannot be the eyes.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Some people say that they have to consider more.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>But if you are a hand, will you know whether a pillar is white simply by more consideration?</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Even if you considered for five days, you would not be clear whether the pillar was white.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>It is better for you to seek the help of the eyes.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>It is easy to appoint a person, but it is troublesome to ask anyone to step down from responsibility.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>If you do this, the whole church will be greatly affected.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>For this reason, we cannot appoint responsible ones lightly.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Paul asked Timothy to look for faithful ones.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>This is not an easy matter.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>When the Western missionaries select personnel, most of the time they select the good and the lovable persons.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>To us these ones may be the most useless; they may even be swindlers.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Some people ask why we do not appoint certain brothers as responsible ones.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>We have to realize that some brothers are good people and nice gentlemen, but they can easily be deceived.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Do not say that this is only the missionaries' problem; the Chinese can have the same problem.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>It is not a light matter for a man to receive a ministry before the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>There are certain basic qualifications in appointing a person.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>It is not such a simple matter.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>CONCERNING THE PHYSICAL NEEDS</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>OF THE CO-WORKERS Taking Simple Luggage When Traveling</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Sixth, the co-workers should pay special attention to their physical needs.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Concerning our personal life, the Lord's principle is first that our personal belongings have to be simple when we travel.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>It is too improper for a worker to travel with five or ten pieces of luggage.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Eating What Others Serve</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Second, we must pay attention to how we eat.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Whatever others put in front of us, we have to eat.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Other than for the reason of physical weakness, we have to make ourselves persons who are easy to be served.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>When we are at home, we can do whatever we like.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>But when we are traveling, it is not so simple.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Once I was in Anhwei province.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The people there like sesame oil, but I hate sesame oil.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>I had sesame oil continually for sixteen days.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>When they saw that my appetite was not good, they asked if I would like some preserved eggs.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>I said yes, and they served me preserved eggs, but they were also soaked in sesame oil!</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Learning to Overcome Our Bodies in Our Dwelling</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The third thing is related to the place where we live.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The co-workers should not pick places for sleeping that are too good or too coarse.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>They have to select moderate places.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Once they have decided where to stay, they should stay there until they leave the city.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Even if you find that you are staying in a lion's den, you have to wait until daybreak.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>If the king has not come, you cannot go out by yourself.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Unless others make further arrangements for you, you should not make any choice of your own.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Many workers are involved in trouble merely through moving around.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Once someone prepared a bed for me.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>It was supposed to be a sofa bed, but it was a bed that no one could lie on.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>The bed was put together with blocks of wood.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>When I turned over, the wood would make noise.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>I was disturbed not only by others' noise, but by the noise I made also.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>A worker has to learn to live in abundance, and he also has to learn to live in poverty.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>A worker must learn to overcome his body.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>There was a brother in southern Fukien province who had a somewhat higher standard of living at home.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>When he had to work in a place that had a lower standard of living, he found that he could not handle the situation.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>What we eat and wear and how we live at home are personal matters before the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>But when we are guests in others' homes, we have to live according to the standard of that family.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Habit is one thing, and a mind to suffer is another thing.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>No matter how weak we are or how many needs we have, we have to learn to lower ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Do not let any church think that it is a troublesome thing to provide hospitality for a servant of God.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>If we practice living in a low way at home, we will be able to stand it even when others put us in a lower place.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Only those who have learned to overcome their bodies present no difficulty to others.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Only a mind to suffer can give us the strength to humble ourselves before men.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Hence, we have to learn to overcome our bodies.</S>
