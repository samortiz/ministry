   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Ministered To by Watchman Nee</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>On a number of occasions when I had personal problems, I went to Watchman Nee for help.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Not one time was I rebuked.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>He would simply ask, "What have you learned from the Lord?"</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>He helped me realize that all things occur under God's hand and are working together for good to conform me to the image of His Son Rom 8:28-29 .</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>On one occasion my wife entered the hospital for an operation.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Following the operation, the enemy attacked her with accusations and caused her to think that she was about to die.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>This news was reported to Watchman Nee, and he and my sister went to visit her.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>He realized that she was under the accusation of the enemy and ministered to her from Revelation 12:11: "And they overcame him because of the blood of the Lamb and because of the word of their testimony, and they loved not their soul-life even unto death."</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Then he telephoned me and confessed that his failure to help keep me in the Lord's fellowship had given the enemy ground to attack my wife.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>For this failure he asked my forgiveness.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>He fully realized that the warfare was not simply a matter for my wife alone, but that the warfare also required her husband and the church.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>This is why he asked me to forgive him.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>He realized that in order to fight against the enemy I needed the church and that there had been neglect on his part in being one with me.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>I told him, however, that it was not his fault; the fault lay in my inadequate consecration and in my love for the world.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>That is what gave the enemy the ground.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Immediately I repented to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The moment I repented, the enemy left my wife, and the Lord gave her peace.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The next morning when Watchman Nee's mother came to pray with her, she was able to sing praises to the Lord and enjoy the Lord's sweet anointing.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>This incident shows that Watchman Nee knew the ways of God.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Through his spiritual discernment, my family was helped and was brought back to a complete union with Christ in our daily living.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>My Impression of Watchman Nee</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Watchman Nee was a person who was thoroughly saturated with the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>He was a man who lived in the Lord's presence.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>His disposition, character, and behavior had been transformed through the years under the perfecting hand of Miss Margaret E. Barber.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>He could listen without interruption to the words or suggestions of others.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>He was a man whose inner being had been touched by the Lord, and one who had acquired much rich experience from being dealt with by the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>If it were not so, such a genius would have found it extremely difficult to maintain a relationship with a foolish, stupid young brother like me.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Later on, when I worked closely with him, I observed that he could listen to any kind of person without giving the impression that he was superior.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>He was transformed to such a degree that he could be built up with anyone, no matter what their condition, without being frustrated by their shortcomings or childishness.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>In observing Watchman Nee's way of working, I never saw him try to impose his authority.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Rather, he would set an example himself.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>He would rise early in the morning and work regular hours.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>He never took things lightly or acted loosely.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Neither was he lazy.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>He never assumed that he was the boss, nor did he require of others what he himself would not do.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>He worked with his own hands, teaching others to work together with tenderness, love, patience, and cooperation.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Today most of Christianity criticizes him for his ministry concerning the church.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Yet, I can testify that his ministry regarding the church was not a doctrine, a theory, or an unworkable plan.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Not only did he teach what God revealed to him concerning the church he also put the revelation into practice.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Although the practice of the church, as God revealed it to Watchman Nee, was not seen on a large scale during his lifetime, today it has been fully vindicated.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>It is workable.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Thousands of believers today can testify that they are living in the full reality of the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>________________________________________________________________________________________________________</S>
