   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>In 1948 I again had opportunity to attend a conference in the church in Shanghai.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Brother Nee ministered on the matter of handing over ourselves with all we possess to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>His words were full of impact and the power of the Holy Spirit, and the meetings were full of the Lord's presence.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Many were revived and handed over themselves and their possessions, to be built together in serving the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>In the last meeting of the conference, because I was leaving for Foochow, Brother Nee, in the presence of all the assembled brothers and sisters, addressed me in the following words of farewell:</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>There is only one Christ, but due to different viewpoints and emphases of the workers, it seems that Christ has been divided into many Christs.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>If a worker cannot express to others the one Christ whom God desires to present, his work is a failure.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Many today have had very intimate contact with the Lord, while others are merely pressing against Him Mark 5:24 .</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Perhaps some have indeed touched His back, held His hand, or torn His garments; yet they have no relationship whatever with Him in life.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Among the many who thronged Jesus, the woman with an issue of blood was not the only one who was ill, but she was the only one healed in life Matt 9:20-22 .</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Some today indeed know the Christ of Bethsaida Mark 8:22-26 or the Christ of Gadara Mark 5:1-20 or the Christ of Emmaus Luke 24:13-35 .</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>In their experience they have really seen the miracles and the wonders.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>They may even be able to perform the miracles themselves.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Yet if there is no true inward revelation, none of these works will amount to anything.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Some may be able to tell others with moving power of a Christ of Emmaus.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>They may be able to expound the Scriptures and may cause others to become truly fervent in their hearts; yet it is all to no avail.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The real work is to impart a Christ of revelation to others.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>I speak these words not only to Brother Weigh, but to all the co-workers and to all the brothers and sisters alike.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>If you and I cannot impart a Christ of revelation to others, our work is a failure.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Here we see that there are two basically different stands that a worker of the Lord can take: one emphasizes work, the expounding of the Scriptures, miracles, works of wonders, and answers to prayers, etc. The other presents before men a Christ of revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>In the same year, 1948, from the beginning of June to the end of September, Watchman Nee held a period of training on Mount Kuling, Fukien, for the purpose of training co-workers from all over China.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>I attended that training.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Every day we spent approximately seven hours listening to Brother Nee and receiving his ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>I was greatly helped in my spiritual understanding and also in the principles of working for the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>What he spoke at the training sessions may be summarized as follows:</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>1 How to exercise our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>2 How to be a minister of the Word.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>3 How to read the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>4 How to preach the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>5 How to guide new believers.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>6 How to manage church affairs.</S>
