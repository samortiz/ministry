<H2 CLASS=HEAD3>7. Jehovah Judging between the Nations<br>and Deciding Matters concerning Many Peoples</H2><P>Jehovah will judge between the nations and decide matters concerning many peoples (Isa. 2:4a). At that time, Christ will be the unique Ruler on earth.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>8. The Nations and Many Peoples<br>Beating Their Swords into Plowshares<br>and Their Spears into Pruning Hooks</H2><P>The nations and many peoples will beat their swords into plowshares and their spears into pruning hooks. Nation will not lift up sword against nation, nor will they learn war anymore (v. 4b; Hosea 2:18). There will be no war, no weapons, and no learning of war.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>9. The House of Jacob<br>Walking in the Light of Jehovah</H2><P>Finally, when the nation of Israel is restored, the house of Jacob will walk in the light of Jehovah (Isa. 2:5).</P><P>Isaiah speaks concerning the ushering in of Christ and the restoration of the nation of Israel in several different sections of his prophecy. When we put these sections together, we will have a clear view of the revelation in this book regarding these two secret and mysterious matters.</P>
