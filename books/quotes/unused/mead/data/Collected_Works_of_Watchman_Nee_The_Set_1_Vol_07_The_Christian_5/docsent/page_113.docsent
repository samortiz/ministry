   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Issue No. 16 STUDY ON THE BOOK OF JONAH</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Ten cents.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>This book was written by a British teacher.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Its clarity in exposition and depth of knowledge has been welcomed by most Bible-believing men.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>In an age when the modernists have greatly criticized the historical value of the book of Jonah, this author boldly proved the story of Jonah as a history and not an allegory.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>This book is knowledgeable and contains much spiritual insight.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The translation is not bad.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>It is a suitable book to give to those seminary students who are deceived.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Issue No. 20 GUIDELINES FOR TEACHING THE BIBLE</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Writer:______.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Fifty cents.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>This is an instruction manual based on psychology for those teaching Bible classes in schools.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>We find many suggestions in the book interesting and valuable.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>But we cannot fail to find one great mistake and disastrous lack in the book!</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The Christianity described in this book is only one which teaches men to behave according to Christian principles.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>It is not concerned with regeneration, the receiving of a new life by a sinner.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Like all other modernist books, this book does not offer a gospel to sinners.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Instead, it only leads men to receive some Christian ethics and moral laws.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>This is again the arguments of the Young Men's Association.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>We often ask these ones: "If Christ is superior to others only in His moral and ethical teachings, why do we have to lead others to believe in Him?</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>There are so many people in this world who talk about ethics and morality already!"</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>What sinners need is the gospel, a gospel that will save them, and not better examples.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Issue No. 24 INTRODUCING DR.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>SCOFIELD'S</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>BIBLE CORRESPONDENCE COURSE</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Since the inception of this Bible correspondence course at the beginning of this year, over one hundred sixty students have enrolled for the course.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Many readers of this paper have enrolled themselves in this course, but I myself wish there could be more readers who would enroll in it.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Scofield's correspondence course can be considered the most complete for those seeking foundational knowledge of the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>If a believer receives the foundational help from Scofield, he will be able to do deeper research on the Bible at a later date.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>At this juncture, while this paper is being suspended, I would take this opportunity to remind all to pay attention to this matter.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Of course, if we study merely with our mind, the harm of reading the Bible is no less than anything else.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>This is something that we should be careful of.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Detailed instructions for enrollment can be obtained from Mr. Chen Chi-kwei in ______, Nanking.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Watchman Nee</S>
