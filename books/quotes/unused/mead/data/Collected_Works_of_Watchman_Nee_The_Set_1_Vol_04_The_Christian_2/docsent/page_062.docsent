   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Verse Thirteen</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Verse 13: "I know where you dwell, where Satan's throne is; and you hold fast My name and have not denied My faith, even in the days of Antipas, My witness, My faithful one, who was killed among you, where Satan dwells."</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The word for "throne" is thronos.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The throne is a symbol of reigning.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Satan's throne is not in hell for hell is only Satan's prison.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>It is not the sphere where he exercises his authority.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Satan's territory is the present world.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The world is the place where he reigns.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The Bible says, "The whole world lies in the evil one" 1 John 5:19 .</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The Bible calls him expressly "the ruler of the world" John 14:30 .</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Paul also called him "the god of this age" 2 Cor 4:4 .</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Hence, the place "where Satan's throne is" is the present world.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The church is living in the world!</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>How strange this is!</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The hostile world is no longer driving away the church, making the church feel that it is different from the world.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The church has now fallen into the bosom of the world.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The church is no longer the scum 1 Cor 4:13 , much less a pest Acts 24:5 !</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Now it has gained a position and is honored by man.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The church is living in the world where Satan reigns as king.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>To "dwell" is to make home.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>It is no longer a guest in the world but has become an important member in the world.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The church has made its home in the world!</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>How different this is from its Lord!</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Its Lord spent His first night on earth in a manger in an inn.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>He spent His last night on earth also in an inn.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The word "guest room" in Luke 22:11 is the same word in the original language as the "inn" in Luke 2:7.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The Lord Jesus was a traveller on earth from beginning to end. Even after He died, He was still buried in another person's tomb.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>He was truly a guest.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>He expects His church to be nothing more than a guest on earth.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>This is why He put the one He has saved into an inn Luke 10:34 .</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>He expects to find at His coming back all His saved ones in that inn.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>However, it is a pity that the church has lost its sojourning and pilgrimming nature!</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>There is a difference between "being" in the world and "living" in the world.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>In the former case the person is just a sojourner.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>In the latter case the person is a citizen of the world.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>This is a moral issue.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Since it has joined itself to the world, there is the possibility to receive heresy.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>When the flesh dwells in the world, there is no danger, but it is pitiful for the heart and the spirit to make home in the world.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The Savior admitted that the circumstance was difficult.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>He knew that the place where the church was was dangerous.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Sin and idols were everywhere.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>He realized the predicament facing the church.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>That is why He said: "I know where you dwell, where Satan's throne is."</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The Lord Jesus glories in His martyrs.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>This is why He said: "Antipas, My witness, My faithful one" Rev 2:13 .</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Neither the Bible nor history mention the name Antipas.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>However, this is the name of one who truly suffers for the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Although man does not know him, the Lord mentioned His name specifically.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>He mentioned His faithfulness.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>What a commendation this is!</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>How precious is the death of the saints in the eyes of the Lord!</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>The Lord knows those who are His.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>He knows who has passed through difficulties and sufferings for His sake.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Although man does not know Antipas, the Good Shepherd knows the name of His sheep.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>What a comforting thought this is!</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Although there was loneliness, although man's eyes did not see him, although persecution persisted until death, although he had nothing left behind in the world, and although historians would not even save a space for his name, the Lord's eyes saw and His heart remembered; He praised and commended.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>This is truly "A garden inclosed...a spring shut up, a fountain sealed" S.S. 4:12 . The world could not touch him for he was the apple of the Lord's eye.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>It was not easy for him to give anything to the world.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>He only knew the Lord and sought only to please Him.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>He is a lonely martyr, one whom the Lord praised.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>We thank and praise the Lord that He never forgets any of His nameless, hidden servants.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Everyone who suffers for Him, whoever he may be, is known by Him.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>He puts all of them in His heart.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Lord, how numerous are Your thoughts toward me!</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>In the coming kingdom, all those who suffer for the Lord will receive glory.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>The life that we lose now will be gained back in the future.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>This is not only true for Antipas alone but for all the unnamed heroes who are martyrs for the Lord in life or in death.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>They will all shine as the sun.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>"Who was killed among you, where Satan dwells."</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>The Lord saw the condition of Pergamos.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Satan not only had a throne there; he was personally dwelling there.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>It is hard for one not to find red blood stains and broken bones before a lion's den.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>It is not surprising to find persecution at the place where Satan dwells.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>Satan is a murderer from the beginning.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>He is the same from the first day until now.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>"In the days of Antipas, My witness, My faithful one, who was killed among you, where Satan dwells."</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>To be a witness, one who is true, who stirs up the wrath of Satan, and who cripples the kingdom of Satan, will necessarily bring out the enemy's persecution.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>Unless a witness can cripple Satan, he is not a true witness.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>A true witness will surely stir up the wrath of the enemy.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>However, at times, even when we witness, we will not be killed.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>Antipas was not only a witness but a faithful witness.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>All those who witness faithfully will be persecuted.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>Satan is not afraid of our empty words.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>What he cannot stand is a faithful witness.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>To be a witness alone does not seem to require much price, but to be a faithful witness requires one to risk his own life.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>The price is here.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>Who is willing to pay it?</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>"You hold fast My name and have not denied My faith, even in the days of Antipas...who was killed."</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>The Lord allowed difficulty to come upon them.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>This is why the Lord did not interrogate them.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>He is a merciful Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>He remembers His mercy in His judgment.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>He tried His best to commend the church.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>No merit of His children goes unnoticed and unappreciated.</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>He recognized the difficulty of their circumstance.</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>He praised them for holding fast His name and not denying His faith.</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>"You hold fast My name and have not denied My faith."</S>
   <S PAR='98' RSNT='1' SNO='98'>They did not deny the faith that was once delivered to the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='99' RSNT='1' SNO='99'>They were still holding fast everything that the Lord's name implies.</S>
   <S PAR='100' RSNT='1' SNO='100'>This name implies the glory of the Lord's person.</S>
   <S PAR='101' RSNT='1' SNO='101'>They did not forget the Lord's person because of His body of flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='102' RSNT='1' SNO='102'>Although their eyes had not seen the Lord, they believed in the Lord's divinity.</S>
   <S PAR='103' RSNT='1' SNO='103'>They held fast the Lord's name and did not deny His faith.</S>
   <S PAR='104' RSNT='1' SNO='104'>How incomplete it is for such a thing to come from a worldly church!</S>
   <S PAR='105' RSNT='1' SNO='105'>Yet the Lord does not annul any merit of man.</S>
   <S PAR='106' RSNT='1' SNO='106'>This is why He commends.</S>
   <S PAR='107' RSNT='1' SNO='107'>The first half of the Lord's commendation was stronger than the second half, for to "hold fast" is much better than to "not deny."</S>
   <S PAR='108' RSNT='1' SNO='108'>Nevertheless, both to "hold fast" and to "not deny" are not easy matters.</S>
   <S PAR='109' RSNT='1' SNO='109'>Even this is good enough to make the Lord grateful.</S>
   <S PAR='110' RSNT='1' SNO='110'>This is why He delighted in mentioning them and praising them.</S>
   <S PAR='111' RSNT='1' SNO='111'>Can the Lord say this word to the church today?</S>
   <S PAR='112' RSNT='1' SNO='112'>What do we see today?</S>
   <S PAR='113' RSNT='1' SNO='113'>Do we not see Christ's person being rejected everywhere?</S>
   <S PAR='114' RSNT='1' SNO='114'>Man extols the twentieth century culture, but is not the world of the twentieth century still the throne of Satan?</S>
   <S PAR='115' RSNT='1' SNO='115'>But here was an Antipas.</S>
   <S PAR='116' RSNT='1' SNO='116'>The meaning of his name is "against everyone."</S>
   <S PAR='117' RSNT='1' SNO='117'>He, like Stephen, sealed the witness he bore with his own blood.</S>
   <S PAR='118' RSNT='1' SNO='118'>He is one who refuses to keep silent.</S>
   <S PAR='119' RSNT='1' SNO='119'>Neither the power of hell, nor the persecutions of the world, nor the danger of life can stop him from opposing everyone.</S>
   <S PAR='120' RSNT='1' SNO='120'>Where are those witnesses today who will testify faithfully for the Lord and who will not love their life unto death?</S>
