   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER THREE THE RECOVERY OF THE EARTH IN SIX DAYS</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>We have seen that in the beginning God created a perfect world.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Later, because of the sins committed by Satan and those who dwelt on the earth, they and the earth were judged by God, and the earth became without form and void.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Now we will see God's work of restoring the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>In the book of Job, Job mentions the failure of Satan's rebellion in order to show that it is foolish to dispute with God.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>"He is wise in heart, and mighty in strength: who hath hardened himself against him, and hath prospered? which removeth the mountains, and they know not; which overturneth them in his anger; which shaketh the earth out of her place, and the pillars thereof tremble; which commandeth the sun, and it riseth not; and sealeth up the stars" Job 9:4-7 .</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>When did God do this?</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>When did He shake the mountains and the earth, and alter the position of the celestial bodies due to man's stubbornness towards Him?</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Since the time of Adam, such an act of God in the world has not been seen.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>This passage must be a description of God's judgment on Satan and on the earth under his dominion when he rebelled.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>At that time God shook the earth and overturned the mountains.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The calamity came so swiftly that the mountains were overturned unnoticed.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>In addition to the earth, the positions of the celestial bodies were also affected.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Because of God's judgment, the sun disappeared completely and the stars did not shine.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The world was plunged into darkness.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>There was no sun and no heat was produced.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Consequently, this led to the glacial epoch on this earth.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Then, after a long period of time, possibly due to internal heat at the earth's core Rev 9:2 , the ice gradually melted.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>However, the sun had not yet appeared and the stars were still "sealed up."</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>When the Spirit of God began to move, there was the deep, and darkness was upon the face of the deep.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Job not only mentions God's judgment, but also His work of restoration.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>He says, "Which alone spreadeth out the heavens, / and treadeth upon the high peaks of the sea; / which maketh Arcturus, Orion, and Pleiades, / and wonders without number" Job 9:8-10, Heb .</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The phrase "spreadeth out the heavens" indicates God's work on the second day.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>God divided the waters with a firmament in their midst, and this firmament was called Heaven.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>So the "high peaks of the sea" probably indicates the waters above the firmament.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The phrase "maketh Arcturus, Orion, and Pleiades" indicates God's work on the fourth day.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The word "maketh" does not mean creates but fashions.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>God did not create stars at this time, but He fashioned anew the existing stars.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>In Job 9:7 it says, "Sealeth up the stars."</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>This shows that the stars already existed.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Genesis 1:16 says, "He made the stars also."</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>This was a restoration to their condition before they were sealed.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Having read Job's word, we are more convinced that our exposition is correct.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>In Genesis God began His work of restoration.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>He called out for light because the face of the deep was dark, and this light divided the light from the darkness.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>There was light before, and now light came back.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Some mockers have said, "How could there be light without the sun?"</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>However, science no longer laughs at this kind of record in the Bible, and recently science has proven Moses' words to be correct.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The record here is "non-science"; it is not "anti-science."</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The book of God is not intended as a science textbook, yet the word of God is not erroneous according to science.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Man now understands that besides the sun there are other sources of light.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Light is an energy from an unknown source that produces vibrations of the ether around the universe.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>This vibration is beyond human imagination.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Of course, the light that we now see relates to the burning of the sun as well as other sources of light.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>But scientists cannot tell us about the sources of this energy.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Concerning this point, they are fully in darkness; but faith knows.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>"And God said, Let there be light: and there was light" Gen 1:3 .</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>It is most pitiful that while there is God, who is the source of all positive things, and in whom everyone should believe, people still reject Him and prefer to grope in the dark, considering it unscientific and superstitious to believe in God's Word!</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>But we are so happy that we not only have God, but that He is also our Father.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>It does not say that light was created or brought into being by God on the first day.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Light has not existed for merely six thousand years.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Before light came, darkness was confined to one place, the face of the deep i.e., the whole earth .</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Darkness was confined to this one assigned place.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>When light appeared, it appeared in the same dark place, the whole earth.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>When God said, "Let there be light" v. 3 , the whole universe was not in darkness.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>God was merely commanding the light to appear on the surface of this earth.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>In Moses' time, science did not know of other sources of light besides the sun such as the Aurora Borealis, the northern lights .</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>But Moses still recorded that God called out the light first, then made the sun to appear.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>If this was not a revelation of the Holy Spirit, how could he have made such a statement?</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Thank God that He is not limited by the ignorance of people.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>The more the scientists understand the natural laws established by God, the more they realize that the Word of God is worthy of all acceptance.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>"And God called the light Day, and the darkness he called Night.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>And the evening and the morning were the first day" v. 5 . God did not create the light here because it had existed for a long time; He just called out the light.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>When did the first day start?</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Someone said it was from the time when the earth was "without form and void" v. 2 ; however, that is not the meaning here.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>"And the evening and the morning were the first day" v. 5 . "Morning" was the time when the light of the first day appeared.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>If there were no light before the first day, then the "evening" mentioned here does not make sense.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>The "evening" came first, and then "the morning."</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>If the morning indicates the time when the daylight first appeared, and if there was no light before the first day, then the evening would indicate the darkness before the light, which would be the prolonged darkness mentioned in verse 2.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>If that were the case, would not the first evening have been too long?</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>If the evening of the first day was the darkness in verse 2, then the first day would have started from the darkness of the formlessness and void.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>But Genesis clearly does not consider the formlessness and void as the first day.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Hence, before the "evening" of the first day, there was light already.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>However, this light was not shining on the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>God called the darkness Night, but "the evening," being different from the night, was a darkness under control of the light.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>For this reason, light existed before "the evening" of the first day; otherwise, how could we differentiate between the evening and the morning?</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>Furthermore, the Bible does not say that God created light on the first day; He just commanded light to appear.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>Where was the light from?</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>If it was not from the earth which was without form and void and in entire darkness, it must surely have been from the beginning when God created the heaven and the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>This is a further proof that the world we are in now is a restored world.</S>
