   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>MEETINGS IN THE BIBLE</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>In this chapter we will fellowship concerning meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>According to our concept, meetings are something very ordinary.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>In the Bible, however, meetings are not an ordinary matter.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Meetings are first mentioned in the New Testament in Matthew 18:20, following the Lord Jesus reference to the church in verse 17, which speaks of telling a matter to the church.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>In verse 20 He said, Where there are two or three gathered into My name, there am I in their midst.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>In these two verses there are three matters: the church, the meetings, and the Lord s presence.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>These three things are interrelated.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Where there is a church, there should be meetings; where there are meetings, the Lord is present in our midst.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The Type of the Israelites</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>The Old Testament shows that God s people lived a life of meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>The greatest type in the Old Testament is the type of the called race of Israel.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>God did not save the Israelites individually; their salvation was a corporate salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Every household of Israel kept the Passover at the same time, and together they crossed the Red Sea, journeyed through the wilderness, and reached the good land.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>They journeyed through the wilderness, reached the foothills of Mount Sinai, and set up their camps together.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>From the night of the Passover, no one in the called race of Israel lived individualistically.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>They lived a meeting life, and they moved as an assembly Acts 7:38 .</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>At the base of Mount Sinai the whole assembly of the children of Israel gathered before God, who descended upon Mount Sinai and called Moses up to the mountaintop to reveal the pattern of the tabernacle to him.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>This was a kind of meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Even the building of the tabernacle at the base of the mountain was not an individual work but a corporate work, the work of the assembly.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>All the Israelites built the tabernacle of God with each tribe doing its part.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>After the tabernacle of God was built, the whole assembly of Israel set out and journeyed onward.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Even when they were moving forward, they walked together as an assembly.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>No Israelite acted individually.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Rather, all the people of Israel moved corporately as an assembly.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Moreover, God s leading was unique a pillar of cloud by day and a pillar of fire by night.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>At that time there were at least two million Israelites, including men and women, young and old.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Even though there were many Israelites, there was only one pillar of cloud by day and one pillar of fire by night.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>God s leading did not involve two million pillars of cloud and fire.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>The children of Israel were a corporate people, not scattered individuals, and their entire living was a meeting life.</S>
