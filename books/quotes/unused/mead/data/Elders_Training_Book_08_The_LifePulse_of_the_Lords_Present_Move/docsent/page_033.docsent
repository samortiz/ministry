   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>FULFILLING THE LORD S COMMISSION</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>TO HIS RECOVERY</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Since October of 1984, I fully realized that we had become somewhat stuck in the Lord s recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>We held the Lord back very much, so we did not carry out His commission to the recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>In the preaching of the gospel, we have not had much spread.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In the teaching of the truth, we rarely exercised.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>I began to feel that I should ask the Lord to forgive me since I am considered by many of the saints as the one to take the lead in the Lord s recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>I felt that I had not done an adequate job.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Therefore, in October of 1984 there was a big revolution, a big change, within me.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>We must change the situation among us so that we can fulfill the Lord s commission.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The Lord s commission is His recovery, and His recovery today is to recover Christ as life, to recover the church as our living, to recover the enjoyment of Christ as everything to us, and to recover all the significances of the church life for the purpose of not only preaching the gospel but also spreading the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>I believe that this is the unique reason that He has given us nearly all the truths in today s Christianity.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>He has given us His truths for us to spread them not only to Christians but even to the unbelievers.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The entire globe is under darkness.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Every human being on the earth needs to hear the truth, but our spreading of the precious truths we have received has been strongly limited.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>There have been many strong testimonies concerning people getting attracted and caught by the notes in the Recovery Version, but who has the burden to go out and spread these truths?</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Some brothers who are with us do not use these truths when they teach and preach.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>They teach and preach what they feel is good, yet they do not realize how poor their messages are.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Some brothers among us continually put out some publications.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>I was honest to tell them that there was no light and nothing new in what they put out.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The points in our publications are full of life and light, but these brothers would not present them as they are.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>I could not understand why they have to change the messages we publish to present something in their own style and in their own way.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>There are no new points of life or light in what they publish.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Any life or light in their material is altogether adopted from this ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>I have been observing this situation among us for years.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>I would like to see whether some younger brothers among us would be raised up by the Lord to speak something.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>If I could see this, I would praise the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>On the other hand, I have seen some who like to build up something around themselves.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>I have been in the line of the Lord s recovery for many years, and I bear much responsibility for the Lord s recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Thousands around the globe came into the recovery due to the ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>They sacrificed their future and everything.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>In these days hundreds of young people in Taiwan gave up their future after their graduation from college.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Humanly speaking, they sacrificed everything, so I am somewhat responsible to them.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>For them to sacrifice their entire future and come into the recovery in such a state is not fair.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>This is why I cannot allow this to happen.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The Lord has commissioned us with His recovery, and He has surely opened up the New Testament to reveal many dear and precious truths to us.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>What the Lord needs is for thousands of His dear saints who love Him, who live to Him, and who know nothing but His recovery to take one way.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Regardless of whether the saints are from Brazil, Australia, New Zealand, Taiwan, England, Thailand, Indonesia, or the United States, we all bear the same burden, take the same way, and spread the same truths.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>We dispense the truths embodied in the gold bar, the Recovery Version.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>We have no other merchandise!</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>If we would be like this, the entire earth will be taken!</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>It breaks my heart to see some practicing to have another ministry, using the material of the ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>We all have to pray, Lord, rescue me from my ambition to be somebody in the recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>We should only know the truths of God s New Testament economy.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>We only use one way by one accord, prayer, the Spirit, and the Word.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>This is what I believe the Lord is after, and this is what we all expect in the depths of our being.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Everyone will feel happy about this.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>We all have to realize that we are the full-timers.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>If we are a banker, we do banking to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>If we are a teacher, we teach to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>If we make one dollar or one million dollars, we make it to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Then when we go out, the Lord will surely back us.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>We do not need to worry about our living.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>The Lord will be backing us.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>When we go out, we do not go in a dissenting or ambitious way.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>If you go out with your ambition to build yourself up and I go out with my ambition to build my ministry up, we are finished.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>The Lord has to go to others.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>We all need to go out in one way like an army.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Then we will have the morale and the impact.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>We do not need to do that much.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>We just need to go out with a pure heart, without anything to ourselves but all things to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Just go out with all the truths and the Recovery Version to read to people.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>I assure you that you will catch someone every week.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>You do not need to preach your teaching or your kind of doctrine with your terminology.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>We have to see what the Lord s recovery is.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>The Lord s recovery has been commissioned with a big enterprise to spread the Lord s truths.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>He has given us the truths which we are holding.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>But we need the faithful, pure-hearted ones, who do not have any intention to live to themselves but to Him, to go out to spread these gold bar truths.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>There is no need for you to preach or teach in your way.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Open up the Recovery Version and read some of the notes with the hungry ones.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>If we all would go out in this way, I believe each one of us would get some persons every week.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>We would begin to have the increase, not just in percentage but in fold.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>We could even triple our number in one year.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>If we would all gain one person every three months, we would have a fourfold increase in one year.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>If you use the gold bar the Recovery Version , the rainbow booklets, and all the Life-studies, and present them to the believers and unbelievers all the time, within three months you will get one person.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>I believe that you may even get one person every week.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>In the Lord s ministry, we are not building something to ourselves but something altogether to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>Let us all be full-timers!</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>If we are led to drop our jobs, then we drop them to Him and go out to serve the precious truths in the Recovery Version, the rainbow booklets, and the Life-studies to everybody.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>We may read them note 14 1 in 2 Corinthians 13 or note 3 4 in Hebrews 1, which tells us what aspects of Christ are revealed in each of the books of the New Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>If we go out to read the notes of the Recovery Version to people, they will be caught.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>We will gain much increase.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>Actually, though, I do not care that much for the increase.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>I care for the spreading of the truths so that they can get into the needy hearts.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>If we spread these truths, we will become the faithful servants to serve food to the Lord s people at the appointed time Matt 24:45 .</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>Then we will fulfill the commission of the Lord s recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>This is where my heart is.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>I will die to this.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>I told the brothers in the Far East I will not stop until my entire being is exhausted by this ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>I hope you all will say the same thing.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>Let us rise up to go full-time, either by dropping our jobs to go out or by remaining in our jobs to make more money and give every cent to the Lord s move.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>Then the Lord s move will not be short of men or money.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>We will be short of nothing.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>If the Lord can gain ten thousand saints in the United States to go full-time with one kind of teaching, one kind of preaching, one kind of material, one kind of publication, one kind of way, and everything one kind, this will be our morale!</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>The wise way is that we all take the full-time way and speak the same thing, think the same thing, present the same thing, and teach the same thing, having the same essence, appearance and expression.</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>Then we will have the morale, the impact, to defeat the enemy.</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>This is what the Lord needs!</S>
