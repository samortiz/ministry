In order to see this excelling gift, we must first see the position of 1 Corinthians in the New Testament and its subject
In the New Testament there are firstly the four Gospels and then the Acts followed by Paul's fourteen Epistles from Romans through Hebrews
Within a short time after being saved by the Lord, we discovered in our experience that it is not that simple to be a Christian
When we read 1 Corinthians in the past, we may have seen only the troubles and problems in the church in Corinth
We need to realize that 1 Corinthians is a book on the enjoyment of Christ as the solution of all the problems
In what we are as the old creation, we need Him as our redemption to redeem us, to save us, and to transform us
The food that we eat every day, on the one hand, nourishes us, and on the other hand, kills the negative elements in our physical body
If we eat Christ every day to enjoy Him, we will be nourished and the negative elements within us will be killed
Because there were so many problems among the Corinthians, Paul wrote to them concerning the enjoyment of Christ
As the enjoyment of Christ solves our problems by taking away the negative elements within us, there can be the growth in life
The issue of our enjoyment of Christ is the growth in life, producing precious materials for the building up of the church
The enjoyment of Christ not only solves our problems and issues in the growth in life, but it also develops our gifts by the growth in life
If our enjoyment of Christ is real and without problems, the spontaneous result will be the development of our gifts
After ten years, however, we cannot see him functioning by speaking something concerning the Lord and for the Lord
Corinthians 14 stresses that the top gift, the gift that excels all the other gifts, developed by our enjoyment of Christ is prophesying
If a brother is speaking building up, encouragement, and consolation to others, this proves that his prophesying is not predicting
To prophesy in 1 Corinthians 14 is to speak for the Lord speak forth the Lord and speak the Lord into others ministering the Lord to others
As proper, growing believers whose spiritual gifts are being developed, we must speak the Lord into others every day
Ephesians 5:18-19 says that we are filled in spirit by speaking to one another in psalms, hymns, and spiritual songs
Speaking for the Lord, speaking forth the Lord, and speaking the Lord into others is for the building up of the church as the Body of Christ
With only one man speaking and the rest listening a congregation can be built up but the Body of Christ as an organism can never be built up
For us to come together to build up the Body of Christ organically the practice of one man speaking and the rest listening is not prevailing
Regardless of how good, how marvelous, and how excellent this speaker is, many would become tired of his speaking after two years
A meeting in which all the saints are speaking for the Lord is full of nourishing, cherishing, adjusting, and correcting
With only one person speaking and the rest listening, a message may never be given that touches this brother's habit
If twenty or thirty saints speak in the meeting, eventually someone will speak something that touches this brother's habit
His speaking in 1 Corinthians 14 is a great encouragement to prophesy, and a great recommendation and uplifting of prophesying
In the Greek text 'zealous' is a noun, so Paul was telling the Corinthians that they were 'zealots of spirits'
Darby indicates that before believing in the Lord, the Greek Christians were zealous for certain kinds of spirits
Now that they are saved, they should seek the excelling Holy Spirit and the excelling gift of prophesying for the building up of the church
A particular kind of speaking is needed to convict people, to judge people, and to make the secrets of their heart manifest
Whenever a mathematics professor teaches his students, they learn something, and whatever he has taught them, he has learned first
We will not read the Word in a shallow way, but we will dive into the Word and be immersed and transfused with the Word
We will also pray unceasingly to pray ourselves into the Spirit, and we will live and walk by the Spirit in our spirit all day long
Because the holy Word has become one with your being, you will not speak in a natural and ordinary way but with the equipping, holy Word
Fifty years ago in 1937, Brother Nee saw this matter, and his fellowship was published in the book The Normal Christian Church Life
He spoke it a second time, but soon after that he was arrested and put into prison where he died after twenty years
Certain factories must change the machines that they use at certain intervals so that they can be up-to-date with the most recent technology
Prayer: Lord, again we ask You to cleanse us with Your precious blood that we may enter into the enjoyment of Your anointing
In chapter one we saw that 1 Corinthians is a book on the enjoyment of Christ and that the enjoyment of Christ does three things
The development of the gifts comes out of the growth in life, and the growth in life issues from the enjoyment of Christ
Among all the gifts that are developed in the growth in life through the enjoyment of Christ, the top gift is prophesying
In the last verse of 1 Corinthians 12, a chapter on the gifts, Paul tells us to desire earnestly the greater gifts
As far as the building up of the church is concerned, miraculous gifts such as speaking in tongues and healings are low
If we do not have a life of love, we may abuse the gifts, using them wrongly to damage people rather than build them up
The first verse of chapter fourteen tells us to 'pursue love, and desire earnestly spiritual gifts, but rather that you may prophesy'
If all prophesy in a meeting, those who attend will be convicted and judged, and the secrets of their heart will be made manifest
To prophesy here is not to predict but to build up, encourage, console, convict, judge, and make manifest the secrets of the heart
The little increase that some of the denominations had was mostly from people who were already Christians and who joined them
He said that since the pressure of tradition is very strong, we all need to push against it day after day until it is pushed out of the way
From 1949 to 1984 we still did not find a way to practice the meeting of mutuality revealed in 1 Corinthians 14:26
The conclusion of my four-year study in Taipei beginning in 1984 is that we must cooperate with the Lord to fulfill 1 Corinthians 14:26
We may think that we have had mutuality in the past since the saints shared and testified after a brother gave a message
To prophesy is to speak for the Lord to speak forth the Lord to speak the Lord into others that is to minister Christ into peoples being
Someone who prophesies might speak something like this: 'Brothers, 1 Corinthians 15:45b says, 'The last Adam became a life-giving Spirit'
To prophesy is to speak divinely, to speak something related to God, to speak something of God, and to speak God forth
The God-created earth cannot be changed, but the means of transportation on the earth has been changed and improved again and again
In the traditional practice of Christianity, a newly baptized one simply enters into the congregation to sit and listen
We may say that we love Paul, but deep within we may feel that Paul is too hard on us, that he is over-burdening us
Just as doctors and lawyers are trained specifically for their jobs, he may feel that certain ones should be trained to be speakers
My burden is to pass on His word so that at least a small number of Jesus lovers would take His word and get into it
Many companies and big corporations like to hire young college graduates because they are open to learning new things
When the adding machine was invented, the abacus became outdated because it was much slower and less efficient
They may have been fresh with the Lord twenty years ago, but now that they are older, they do not like to have a change
Christianity has taken the lead to go the easy way, but the new way to practice the Lord's present recovery is the way of labor
The preaching of the gospel in the traditional way is according to the natural way, not by the way that is revealed in the Bible
The traditional way of meeting with one man speaking and the rest listening is also according to the natural way
In order for 1 Corinthians 14 to be realized among us, the co-workers and elders need to labor because all the saints need to be instructed
The saints needing the evangelists to perfect them indicates that preaching the gospel should not be done in a natural way
In taking the new way, we have to do our best to limit our loss by not going quickly but gradually and positively
In Taipei, we worked for thirty-seven months before we stopped having church meetings with one man speaking a message
We turned to the new way of meeting according to 1 Corinthians 14:26 after we labored much to fully prepare the church
A robot is mechanical with nothing organic, but a person is a living, moving, functioning organism with a body that is totally organic
We have to endeavor and train the saints until they arrive at a state in which they will be organically burdened to go out
Without any need of organization or arrangement the saints will have the burden to go to the homes of the new believers to take care of them
We also have to meet, to come together, not by the traditional way but by the way according to 1 Corinthians 14:26
Proverbs 4:18 says, 'But the path of the righteous is as the dawning light, that shineth more and more unto the perfect day'
In Taipei we gave the saints some practical fellowship concerning how to prepare to prophesy in the church meetings on the Lord's Day
We charged the saints to write down a short reminder of what the Lord inspired them with in their time with Him in the morning
When they go to the church meeting on the Lords Day they have something thus fulfilling the Lords word in 1 Corinthians 1426 each one has
They do not trust merely in instant inspiration, but they come to the meeting prepared with the riches of Christ that they have enjoyed
If only fifteen out of fifty saints prophesy in a meeting of the church, that meeting will be in the third heavens
When fifteen people speak, the riches of Christ come out of fifteen sources and fifteen portions of Christ are ministered
Lord, give us a clear sky that we all may see something in the heavens, something on Your heart, and something in Your Spirit
Give us the word, the instant utterance, the very expression, that can minister Yourself with Your ministry into the saints
Lord, speak a word to each one of us and unveil the mystery of Yourself, of Your plan, of Your economy, and of Your Body to all of us
In chapters one and two, we saw that prophesying is the excelling gift for the building up of the church as the Body of Christ
God's creation is full of things that are types, figures, and shadows of the spiritual, heavenly things which are difficult to describe
We must admit that even among us in the Lord's recovery, we cannot see much of the Body of Christ as the organism of the Triune God
About thirty years ago, my burden was primarily to release the word concerning the divine Spirit and the human spirit
The fundamental denominations try to get capable pastors who are eloquent speakers full of knowledge of history and of other things
Thousands of saints in city after city will be busy in praising, singing, prophesying, and preaching the gospel
The unscriptural, traditional way of meeting and serving from Christianity has been existing on this earth for many years
When people think of Christianity, they think of a church building with a big congregation and a good pastor as the speaker
Probably there has never been as much genuine worship of the Lord as from those saints who met in the catacombs
Ephesians 4 tells us that the Lord gave some apostles, some prophets, some evangelists, and some shepherds and teachers
In Ephesians 4 Paul gives us the teaching of the perfecting of the saints, and in Acts 20 there is a record of how he perfected the saints
After establishing the churches and appointing the elders in them, he went back to visit them and wrote epistles to them
Paul taught according to houses, which means that he taught in all the homes of the Ephesians, admonishing each one of them with tears
We may have preached the gospel to bring new people in, but we did not continue our work in the perfecting of the saints
We need to realize that all of us as members of the Body of Christ have a measure and that we all need to operate according to our measure
We have the apostles, the prophets, the evangelists, and the shepherds and teachers, but where is the perfecting?
We must gain the proper knowledge concerning God and concerning the things of God through the knowledge of the holy Word
As long as our fellowship with the Lord is cut off, we can never have the instant, living inspiration of the Holy Spirit
We must have a vision concerning God's interest, the churches' condition, our condition, and others' condition
When our eyes are open and the sky above us is clear we can speak what we see with the word of the Bible under the inspiration of the Spirit
When we speak in this way, we have the Word and the Spirit, and out of the Word and the Spirit, we have the authority and the power
To prophesy, we need the human element of learning the Word and the divine element of the inspiration of the Holy Spirit plus a clear view
If we really mean business to practice prophesying, we must first spend our time and energy to study the holy Word
Most of the book of Isaiah is prophesying in the sense of speaking for the Lord, speaking forth the Lord, and speaking the Lord into people
In the Old Testament, there were both male and female prophets , and according to the New Testament, women can prophesy
The Body growing through 'the operation in measure of each one part,' mentioned in Ephesians 4:16, will be fulfilled
When we work together with the Lord to visit others, the Word becomes living, and the Spirit exercises authority and power over people
If all of us pick up the burden to go and perfect others, the condition of the churches will be changed after two months
After another two weeks, the ones that we perfect will be able to do the same thing, and they will perfect others
The joints, the gifts, perfect the saints unto the work of ministry, unto the building up of the Body of Christ
Out from the Head all the Body is joined closely together and knit together through every joint of the rich supply
We saw in chapter three that the first means by which all the Body causes the growth of the Body is every joint of the rich supply
Although this is true, Paul emphasizes that these gifted ones were given for the same thing-the perfecting of the saints
A newly saved and baptized one is altogether not perfect or complete, so he needs some perfecting, some completing
In the same way, a new believer does not know anything about the Christian life, so he is not perfect or complete either
Even if we were just saved, we can go to preach the gospel because we have been perfected to lead people to Christ
After being saved, not many Christians endeavor to perfect others because they themselves have not received the perfecting
We need to be impressed that we Christians, in general, do not function to perfect others because of tradition
On the one hand, they received the Lord's salvation, but on the other hand, they received a pattern that killed their function
After a person gets saved in this way, he may love the Lord very much, but he has not received the perfecting to preach the gospel
The work of the New Testament ministry is not to build up anything organizational, a congregation, but something organic, the Body of Christ
To perfect the saints, we have to help them hold to truth , to hold to the real and true things in this universe
When we leave the truth and pay attention to things other than God, Christ, and the Body of Christ, there will be problems
To have more of Christ added into us means that we are growing not only in Christ but also into Christ in all things
Gradually, little by little, we grow up into Christ, taking Him as the Head, in item after item, in all things
Today you may not be an apostle, but in a short time you may be perfected to be able to do what an apostle does
Many of us may be in the 'student stage,' but after a certain amount of perfecting, we will become the 'teachers'
If we are not in the first category of gifted persons, we are surely in the second category of Christ's members
You may have operated very little because you have been drugged by the traditional way that kills our function
In the following verses Paul reveals that the will of God is to have a proper church to be the Body of His Son, Christ
If we could visit a new one twelve times in the first four weeks after he has been saved, he would be greatly established
If we all would do this, what a marvelous situation there would be in the church life, but our real situation is different from this
Ephesians 4:11-16 reveals that the Head has given the gifts, the gifts perfect the saints, and the saints operate
The Body is built up by itself through the gifted persons, the joints, and through the other members of the Body, each one part
When the joints and the parts are functioning, this keeps all the members of the Body living, moving, acting, and operating
The first twelve chapters of the book of Acts are on Peter's ministry and the last sixteen chapters are on Paul's ministry
In the first twelve chapters, we can see that before the church came into existence, the one hundred twenty were praying for ten days
After ten days on the day of Pentecost, something spectacular occurred, that is, the one hundred twenty were baptized in the Holy Spirit
Peter took the opportunity to stand up with the eleven to speak to the people gathered there and three thousand were saved
On the same day, those three thousand began to meet from house to house, which in Greek means 'according to houses'
In the past we baptized many people, but not many of them remained because we did not visit them again and again to perfect them
The Scriptures tell us that the three thousand new ones on the day of Pentecost met every day, and they even had the Lord's table daily
When Peter was living on this earth, the meetings that he saw were absolutely different from what is seen today in Christianity
We can also see something concerning the Christian meetings in the last sixteen chapters of Acts covering Paul's ministry
In Hebrews 10:25, Paul says that we should not forsake the assembling of ourselves together, but exhort one another
For this perfecting work to be carried out, we need to see the patterns of perfecting presented in the Scriptures
The Head and the gifted persons build the church indirectly, while the perfected saints do the direct building work
We have been so slow in practicing the scriptural way because we have been influenced by tradition, and now we are held back by our habit
The elders may schedule the prayer meeting and leave the rest of the week up to the saints for home meetings and small group meetings
They also may schedule the Lord's Day meeting for us to come together to take the Lord's table and share with one another
The situation among us, however, may remain the same week after week without the real progression into the Lord's present recovery
If we had been brought into Christ apart from the prevailing influence of traditional Christianity, our church life would be much different
Suppose that a group of us come to some people's door, preach the gospel to them, and baptize them into the Triune God
We open the Bible to these new ones and tell them about the process the Lord went through to become the life-giving Spirit
We also share with them how the Lord is both in the heavens and within us, that is, in our spirit as the life-giving Spirit
After two months of being visited by us, there will be a big change not only in their concept but also in their daily walk and family life
We can lead them into the proper practice of the Christian meeting, and begin to have the church life with them
They would all learn to have home meetings and group meetings, and they would learn to prophesy, to speak Christ
From the very beginning of their Christian life, the new ones will be brought into the scriptural way to practice the church life
The twenty full-timers are working in each locality as patterns, and the new ones are learning from these patterns
Those of us who have been in the church life for a number of years may have become old, so we all need to have a new start
In the recent winter training on Leviticus, we saw from Leviticus 27 that the Lord desires that we devote all that we are and have to Him
If we all would give the Lord six hours a week to visit people for preaching the gospel, we will surely and eventually gain some new ones
Whether we baptize ten or five in a year, we should look to the Lord that at least two of them will be remaining fruit
We can go out twice a week, three hours each time, either to baptize people or to nourish, cherish, and teach them
Suppose that fifty percent of the saints who meet with us decide to devote six hours a week to the Lord for this purpose
If there are three hundred saints meeting on the Lord's Day in a certain locality, they can be divided into six meetings of fifty each
On the Lords Day we can have a meeting for the Lords table and use the remainder of the time for the saints to practice 1 Corinthians 1426
The preaching of the gospel, the home meetings, and the group meetings are steps to prepare people to fully enter into the church life
The majority of the saints will be the most free on the Lord's Day, so we need to have a church gathering, but not with a big group
It is best to have meetings of fifty to eighty so that many saints are afforded the time and have the opportunity to speak for the Lord
The new ones will learn of us in our preaching the gospel, and in the home meetings and group meetings we can instruct them to speak
We can tell them that we do not have pastors or preachers, but all the saints exhort, encourage, and comfort each other
What we have fellowshipped is the principle of raising up the saints to form a church and to build up the Body of Christ
Even if the elders do not agree with what we are doing, they will be happy because we are bringing new ones into the church
If we meet with the same people for many years and never have any new ones among us, we may become bored of seeing one another
In the church in Taipei, hall sixteen had an attendance of about one hundred saints in the church meetings for many years
If we learn from the gifted ones to be perfected, we can become a perfecter to perfect others after a few months
Eventually, all the parts of the Body will be operating parts, so everyone will render some profit to the Body
If we cannot see the increase in number and the growth in life with a local church, that means that it is idle in the eyes of God
The work of the ministry, the biblical way, is not to build up a local congregation, but it is to build up the organic Body of Christ
He told them to remember how he was with them for three years, admonishing all the saints day and night with tears
Paul said that he yearned over the saints and was well pleased to impart to them not only the gospel but also his own soul
Some may ask whether Paul was doing the work of an apostle, a prophet, an evangelist, or a shepherd and teacher
We also have to speak Christ forth into others, ministering the riches of Christ into others whenever the church comes together
If God were not among us, how could an unbeliever or unlearned person's condition be manifested to him when we do not even know it?
We should not be disappointed or fearful concerning the Lord's requirements because when we heed His requirements, He is there to supply us
Verse 4 says, 'In Him was life, and the life was the light of men,' and verse 14 says, 'The Word became flesh and tabernacled among us
Chapter three says that unless we are born again, born of water and the Spirit, we cannot see the kingdom of God
The requirements of God are followed by His grace, which is God Himself as our enjoyment that we may live with Him, in Him, and by Him
In Leviticus 27, the final chapter of the book, God proposes to us that we devote all that we are and all that we have to Him with a vow
In the first eleven chapters of the book of Romans are God's grace, redemption, justification, and reconciliation
In chapter twelve Paul says, 'I beg you therefore, brothers, through the compassions of God to present your bodies
Many of us who have been in the Lord's recovery for years should ask ourselves if we have been enjoying Christ all the time
People hear the gospel, they repent, confess their sins, receive the Lord, and get baptized to become members of fundamental denominations
Once we are born into this world, we have to believe in the Lord Jesus to become Christians; otherwise, we will go to the lake of fire
In the New Testament, the Lord first called us to Himself, and then He sent us to preach the gospel, to disciple the nations
Even in the Gospel of John, a book on Christ as our life and life supply, we are charged to bear fruit and to feed and shepherd the lambs
When Peter told the Lord that he did love Him, the Lord told Peter to feed His lambs and sheep and to shepherd His sheep
We are under the Lord's blessing because He has shown us not only the truth of His present recovery but also the way to practice it
If all the saints in the United States rise up in this way, we will be prevailing, living, and a bright testimony
We need to confess our shortcomings, mistakes, sinfulness, and uncleanness from our natural life, the self, the flesh, and the old man
It seems that knocking on doors for the preaching of the gospel is difficult and a suffering but once we get into it it becomes an enjoyment
If we do not get on the altar, it remains an altar in our sight, but once we get on the altar, it becomes a dining table
Because He requires us to do something, we have no choice, but when we do it, it becomes a dining table, a real enjoyment, a real joy
Paul was what he was by the grace of God, and by this grace he labored more abundantly than all the other apostles
We all have this operation of Christ within us, but if we do not get ourselves exercised, the operation will stop
We have to get ourselves exercised according to this operation, not according to our natural energy, natural strength, or natural ability
In Acts 20 Paul said that he taught the believers publicly and from house to house, admonishing each one of them night and day with tears
Paul told us that he ran, not as uncertainly, that he boxed, not as beating the air, and that he buffeted his body and led it as a slave
The body is rebellious, so we have to buffet it and lead it into slavery, making it a slave to serve our purpose
Today it may seem that nothing happens if we do not preach the gospel or take care of the meetings, but in that day it will not be all right
The Lord will come to judge, and we will have to give Him a full account of what we have been and of what we have done
If we receive the fellowship in this book, it will be a great blessing to us and to many who will be our beneficiaries
Sinners will not be saved by us, the church will not be built up by us, and we will have no way to stand before the judgment seat of Christ
To redeem the time, we need to be wise to abandon the things of the evil age, which destroy, damage, and spoil our time
We cannot tell Him that we did not have time to bear fruit when we spent much time to take care of our homes and private interests
