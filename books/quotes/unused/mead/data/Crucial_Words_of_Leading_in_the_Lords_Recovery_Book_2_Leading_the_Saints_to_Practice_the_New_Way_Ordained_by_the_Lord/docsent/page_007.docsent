   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE CHURCH AS THE PILLAR AND BASE</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>OF THE TRUTH BEING</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>GOD MANIFESTED IN THE FLESH</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The church is God manifested in the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Regardless of whether a church is strong or weak, in principle it is still God manifested in the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>This unique entity by which God is manifested in the flesh is composed of a pillar and a base, that is, the pillar and base of the truth 1 Tim 3:15-16 .</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>In other words, this unique entity upholds the truth in the universe.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The only thing in the universe that real is God Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>This is to say that only the things pertaining to God and belonging to God, such as God s redemption and God s plan, are the reality, the truth, of the universe.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The truth is recorded in the Bible and upheld by the church.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Even if a church is the weakest church, she is still a manifestation of God in the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>As such an entity, she upholds the truth in the universe, for the church is the pillar and base of the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Strictly speaking, elders must spend much time to study and know the Bible, thereby allowing the truth to enter into them.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>They must do so because they are elders in local churches, and every local church is a unit that upholds the truth of God.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Thus, the elders must apprehend, understand, and know the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Only by all of us practicing this can we match God s desire.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>THE IMPORTANCE OF THE ELDERS</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>IN THE ADMINISTRATION OF THE LOCAL CHURCH Cooperating with the Apostles</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Acts 15 reveals the importance of elders in the administration of a local church vv.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>2, 6, 22-23 .</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>At that time nearly every church on earth encountered great turmoil because of those who were zealous for Judaism.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Although these ones believed in the Lord, they continued to teach people to keep the law and to be circumcised.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>They were very strong in promoting these teachings; thus, they became a problem in churches throughout Jewish and Gentile lands v. 1 . At that time Paul, Barnabas, and some others were sent to Jerusalem v. 2 , which was the source of the problem, that is, the place where the problem began.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The Bible says that when they arrived in Jerusalem, out of the tens of thousands of Christians, they discussed the matter with the apostles and elders v. 2 . This clearly demonstrates the importance of the elders.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Indeed, the elders are as important as the apostles.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Just as the apostles are important, the elders are equally important; elders function in cooperation with the apostles.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Following the Leading of the Holy Spirit</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Those serving as elders should learn to follow the leading of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Acts 15 presents such a picture.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Although the elders should cooperate with the apostles, both the apostles and the elders need to follow the leading of the Holy Spirit v. 28 in their mutual cooperation.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The elders need to see the importance of their position.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>On one hand, they must learn to cooperate with the apostles.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>If they refuse to cooperate with the apostles, their administration will disintegrate.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>On the other hand, if the apostles and elders do not follow the Holy Spirit, their administration will be paralyzed.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Hence, the elders must always cooperate with the apostles, and both of them must follow the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Only in such a situation can the administration be complete and whole, being neither disintegrated nor paralyzed.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>If the elders do not cooperate with the apostles, the administration of the church will disintegrate, and if the elders do not follow the leading of the Holy Spirit, the administration of the church will become paralyzed.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Hence, the elders occupy an important position in the church.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Moreover, the importance of their position is mainly in regard to two aspects they must cooperate with the apostles, and they must follow the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Some elders would neither cooperate with the apostles nor follow the Holy Spirit; instead, they try to do things according to their own views and ideas.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>This is dangerous.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>When they do this, the importance of the eldership is lost.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>We have already seen that the importance of the eldership lies in their cooperation with the apostles and in their walking with the Holy Spirit and following the leading of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>When they function in this way, their administration is worthwhile.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>This is because the apostles bring in the apostles teaching, and the Holy Spirit carries out the apostles teaching through the elders among the local churches.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Hence, the elders must cooperate with the apostles and follow the Holy Spirit.</S>
