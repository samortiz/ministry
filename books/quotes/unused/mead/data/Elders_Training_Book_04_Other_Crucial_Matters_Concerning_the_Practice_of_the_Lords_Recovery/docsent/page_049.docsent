   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>MONEY</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Now we come to the matter of finance, of money.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>It is not easy to create a financial condition which is profitable to the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>It is always good not to bring the saints together in the matter of money.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Money is a hard thing to handle.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Do not think that just because we are brothers in the church life who love one another that it is all right for us to do business with one another.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>As an older brother among you, I would advise you not to have financial relationships with brothers.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Do not get into a partnership with brothers and even the more with sisters.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>I want to warn you based upon my own experiences in the past.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>If you help a brother get a loan from another brother, you must prepare yourself to pay that loan.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>If you are not prepared to pay that loan, keep your hands off.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>It is better to be spiritual.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Tell the brother who wants the loan that you will pray for him.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>This brother may feel strongly that you can help him in this matter.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Again I say, however, do not touch the matter of marriage and do not touch the matter of money.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>We should help the saints in a very profitable way, but with certain practical limitations.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Even if we recommend a certain brother for a job, we must do it carefully.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>These are problems in human society.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>We are regenerated and we love the Lord, but practical things still cause trouble.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The biggest troubles in human society are sex, money, and business.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>If these three items were removed from human society, every country would be full of peace.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>None of the elders should touch these three things.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Do not touch the matters of marriage, money, and business without caution.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>We must love our brothers.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>If we have the ability to help a certain brother, then we can give to him.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Some of the churches have suffered in these matters already, but thank the Lord, not that much.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The longer a church exists in a certain place, the greater the possibility there is that there would be involvement in these three matters.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>These matters can all become temptations to the elders.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>IN TRUTH, IN LIFE, AND IN LOVE</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>As a leading one in the church, you should always move, act, and practice in truth, in life, and in love.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>This will be quite healthy.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>We must stay in these three things.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>We must realize that there are germs everywhere.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Our physical body can easily get sick.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Even while the fruits and vegetables are growing on the farm, the farmers try to find a way to protect the fruits and the vegetables from being corrupted or contaminated.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>In the church life it is the same way.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The entire human society is thoroughly sick.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>There are germs everywhere.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>If we are careless and do not stand strictly in the truth, in life, and in love, it will be hard for us not to be contaminated.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>This is why we should pray much and always be careful and trembling in contacting the brothers and in helping them.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Always learn to be fearful and trembling and to do things in truth, in life, and in love.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Then you will be protected.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>This does not mean that we will not have any problems.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Even a very healthy person can get sick with just a little carelessness.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>In order to keep ourselves healthy, we must be very careful all day.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>With just a little carelessness, we will get sick.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>All of us love the Lord, love His recovery, love the church life, and love all the saints, but do not think that merely to have a loving heart is sufficient.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>We must stick ourselves to truth, keep ourselves in love, and always help others in life.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>This is safe.</S>
