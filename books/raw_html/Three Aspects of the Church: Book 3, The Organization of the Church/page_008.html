	 <h2 class="head1">BEING ACCORDING TO MINISTRY</h2>
<p>The organization of the church must be according to life and according to the authority of God; moreover, it must also be according to function and ministry. The distinction between function and ministry is that function is general, whereas ministry is specific. Of course, whoever has a ministry has a function. Conversely, everyone who has a function has a ministry. For example, in Acts 6 Stephen was among those who served tables. His serving tables was a ministry (vv. 2-3, 5). However, we are speaking of ministry in a higher and larger sense. We are speaking of ministry in the sense of Paul&rsquo;s ministry (Rom. 11:13; 2 Cor. 4:1).</p>
<p>The general coordination in the church is according to function; the specific coordination in the church is according to ministry. Apostles, prophets, evangelists, and shepherds and teachers (Eph. 4:11) all have particular ministries. They do not merely have particular functions, as do all brothers and sisters. They also have particular ministries. Generally speaking, all brothers and sisters have respective functions; however, in the church some also have particular ministries, specific ministries. Ministry involves a higher requirement than function.</p>
<p>When we speak of function and ministry, we must set aside the matter of gifts. When we speak of the coordination in the church, we must set aside the matter of gifts because gifts are dangerous. If the appointment of elders and deacons in a local church is based upon gift, the church will suffer loss. Appointments should be made not according to gifts but according to function. Function has certain requirements, whereas gifts do not. Nevertheless, the requirements for ministry are even higher than that for function. The requirements for having a function are general, whereas the requirements for having a ministry are specific.</p>
<p>The ministry of a person who serves God is produced through the specific work of God on that person. Once God has worked on a person to a certain extent, He produces a ministry within that person. Madame Guyon is an excellent example. Although she went to be with the Lord many years ago, her life story has continued to render immeasurable help to many who have come after her. This immeasurable help is due to the ministry formed within her. The help she has rendered to the church and the supply she has rendered to the saints come out from her ministry. Her ministry was produced through God&rsquo;s work in her over a prolonged period of time.</p>
<p>Gift plus character equals function. This means that a gift plus a certain degree of growth in life, that is, learning the lessons of life, equals function. However, the requirement of ministry is even higher. To have a ministry requires us to pass through a considerably long process in God&rsquo;s hand in regard to certain matters and certain aspects. For instance, Paul had a ministry. On the one hand, he was a minister, and on the other hand, he had a ministry. The words <em>minister</em> and <em>ministry</em> are both used in 2 Corinthians 3. <em>Ministers</em> in verse 6 refers to persons, whereas <em>ministry</em> in verses 8 through 9 refers to a service. Paul, a minister with a ministry, surely passed through a great deal of God&rsquo;s work. Such a ministry could not have been produced in a short period of time or through a few shallow experiences.</p>
<p>For a person to have a ministry in the church requires that he be deep in the Lord, having passed through a great deal of God&rsquo;s constituting work, and having been dealt with by God to a great extent. Every person who becomes an apostle must have acquired a certain amount of spiritual constitution by passing through many dealings in God&rsquo;s hand. Only such a person can be constituted with a ministry. If a person does not have a ministry, he should not be considered as an apostle. Not all those who serve the Lord are apostles. All those who serve the Lord should ask themselves, &ldquo;As one serving the Lord, do I have a ministry?&rdquo; In the Bible the apostles spoke clearly concerning their respective and distinctive ministries (Rom. 11:13; Acts 1:17; 20:24; 2 Cor. 4:1). Peter, James, John, and Paul each had a ministry.</p>
<p>In the coordination, or organization, of the church, we need to pay attention to life and to the authority of God. We also need to pay attention to function and to ministry. If we do not pay attention to these basic issues, we will always encounter problems in our coordination. Although a brother has been sent by the Lord to serve the Lord, if others do not perceive the ministry in him and receive help from him, he cannot be called an apostle. An apostle is a person with a ministry; that is, he is a person who has been dealt with by God and constituted with God. As a result, others will be able to see that he has the measure of an apostle and realize that he has a portion that the church needs. As such, he is not a person who can easily be dispensed with in the church. In other words, after having passed through a certain amount of God&rsquo;s work, he has gained a portion of ministry that is indispensable in the church.</p>
<p>The Bible shows that Paul, Peter, and James each had their particular portion in the ministry. Such portions are not gifts but ministries. According to the Bible, every member in the Body of Christ has a ministry. Even the smallest member has a ministry and a function. It is difficult to separate ministry from function, although experientially there is a distinction between them.</p>
<p>A number of brothers among us consider that since they serve the Lord and have been sent by the Lord, they can act as if they are apostles who are able to do certain things in the church. To have such an attitude and intention is wrong. This is to take the way of the Roman Catholic Church. In the Roman Catholic Church a person acquires a position when he becomes a priest. However, it is not so among us. If we serve the Lord full time, we should not think that we have acquired a special position because we are a worker of the Lord. A person&rsquo;s measure in the church depends upon his spiritual ministry and spiritual constitution. The organization of the church depends on life, the authority of God, function, and ministry. It is wrong to be in a certain position without having a certain ministry, just as it is wrong to be in a certain position without a corresponding function.</p>
<p>In regard to the organization of the church, we should pay attention to four items&mdash;life, authority, function, and ministry. As an organism, the church must pay attention to these four items. If any of these four items are missing, there will be problems. When we observe the condition of a local church, we need to consider the condition of the items of life, authority, function, and ministry in the coordination of the saints. If all of these four items are in a proper condition, the result will be a wonderful, living, and healthy organism, a church under the authority of the Holy Spirit. If this is not the case, the result will be that the church will have problems and be in a sick condition.</p>
<p>I hope that among us no one will oppose the use of the expression <em>the organization of the church.</em> I also hope that no one would consider that since there is organization in the church, he can arrange and coordinate according to his preference. This should never be done. All the arrangements and coordination should be according to life, authority, function, and ministry. Without these four items, no one should discuss any arrangement or matter of coordination. This is a solemn matter.</p>
<p>What a beautiful sight it would be if all the brothers who are elders would grow in life, be subject to the authority of the Holy Spirit, bear the mark of having been passed through and dealt with by God, allow the cross and Christ&rsquo;s life to deal with and work on their character, have the authority of God, function, and bear their responsibility as elders.</p>
<p>In the past, in some local churches the matter of appointing elders was carried out in an improper way. Some who were called by the Lord forsook their jobs and began to serve the Lord full time; however, because they were called by the Lord to work for the Lord, they considered themselves to be apostles with the ability to appoint elders. This is a wrong concept. This is not what is spoken of in <em>The Normal Christian Church Life.</em> According to the letter, this may seem to be correct, but it is a wrong application of the truth. For a person to be able to appoint elders in the churches requires that God work on him to a great extent. If a full-time serving one has only recently been called by the Lord to serve the Lord full time, it is wrong to say that he can appoint elders.</p>
<p>Those who serve in the church should not apply these words to others. Every elder, deacon, and responsible one must check with himself, especially the brothers and sisters who serve full time, asking, &ldquo;Have I assumed the position of a worker for myself? In the arrangement and coordination in the church, what is my condition in life, what is my relationship to the authority of the Holy Spirit, and what is my function and ministry?&rdquo; If we disregard these questions, we will become a dead organization. A dead organization does not have the life of God, the authority of the Holy Spirit, the functions that are according to the Lord&rsquo;s dealing, and a ministry constituted of the Holy Spirit. A dead organization has only dead arrangement and lifeless coordination.</p>
<p>When we speak concerning the organization of the church, we need to pay attention not only to the truth in the New Testament but also to our actual situation. We realize that this matter is solemn because we have seen the danger; that is, we have seen that if we are not cautious and serious in taking care of this matter, we will become a dead organization in which there is no life of God, no authority of the Holy Spirit, no function that is according to the Lord&rsquo;s dealing, and no ministry that has been constituted of the Holy Spirit. We do not want to correct these mistakes with our human hand, but we look to the Spirit of God to work in each of our hearts. I hope that all of us would humbly submit ourselves under the hand of the Holy Spirit.</p>
<p>We should not be proud, and we should not despise others. We all need the Lord&rsquo;s grace in order to come back to the Lord and ask Him, &ldquo;O Lord, do I exercise my portion properly in the church?&rdquo; We all must endeavor to do one thing; that is, we must allow the Holy Spirit to have the authority among us. We cannot deny that there is an order in the church; nevertheless, we must be fearful so that this order would be according to life, the Lord&rsquo;s authority, function, and ministry. May the Lord have mercy on us so that we would be on the alert and would not allow the church to fall into the condition of a dead organization. For this, we must pay attention to four items&mdash;life, authority, function, and ministry.</p>
