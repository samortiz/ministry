   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE RAPTURE AND THE TRIBULATION 4 Issue No. 1, The Christian, Resumed</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In the first two messages I spoke about those who advocate the belief that the whole church will be raptured before the tribulation, and I pointed out the lack of an adequate reason and biblical basis in their arguments.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In the last message I spoke about those who advocate the belief that the whole church will go through the tribulation and showed that even though their arguments are more biblically based, they are not without flaws.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In this message we will consider whether the Bible teaches that the whole church will go through the tribulation.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>BIBLICAL PROMISES CONCERNING NOT PASSING THROUGH THE TRIBULATION</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>It is a fact that saints will have to go through the tribulation, and there are biblical proofs for it.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>However, the Bible never says that the whole church will have to pass through the tribulation.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>On the contrary, it says that some will not pass through the tribulation.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Let us consider the following verses.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>A. The First Promise</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Revelation 3:10 says, "Because you have kept the word of My endurance, I also will keep you out of the hour of trial, which is about to come on the whole inhabited earth, to try them who dwell on the earth."</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>First of all, we have to decide on one thing, what is the time referred to by "the hour...which is about to come on the whole inhabited earth, to try them who dwell on the earth."</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Every reader would agree that this is the time of the great tribulation.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>This verse says that there are some people who will be kept out of the hour of trial.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>This verse shows both the unreasonableness of those who advocate the whole church being spared from the tribulation as well as the unreasonableness of those who advocate the whole church will go through the tribulation.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>This verse shows us that a group of people, those who have "kept the word of My endurance," will be kept from the great tribulation.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>This verse is a problem to those who believe that the whole church will go through the tribulation; it is hard for them to bypass this verse.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>At the same time, this verse also shuts the mouths of those who believe that the whole church will be spared from the tribulation.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>This verse was given to the church in Philadelphia.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The church in Philadelphia was a very good church at that time in Asia Minor.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Although the seven churches in Asia Minor signify the seven stages that the church goes through, they were, nevertheless, seven actual local churches at that time.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>When the apostle John wrote Revelation, this promise was not given to the six other churches.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>It was given only to the church in Philadelphia.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>This shows that this promise was not given without restrictions.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Although the Lord promised Thyatira that it would receive the "morning star," which appears to be a promise of the rapture, the only explicit promise of the rapture is given to the church in Philadelphia alone.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>If the promise of the rapture had been given to all seven churches, it would mean that it was given to the whole church.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Since it was not given to all the churches but only to the church in Philadelphia, this shows that the rapture is conditional.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The rapture is not based on our status as children of God, nor on salvation and eternal life; rather, the promise of the rapture was given only to those like the church in Philadelphia.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Therefore, in order to be raptured, there are conditions which have to be met besides being saved and having eternal life.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>What is the meaning of the expression, "Because you have kept the word of My endurance"?</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The word of endurance is not any ordinary kind of endurance; it is the word of "My endurance."</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>It is not a common endurance but an endurance that has to do with Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Christ endures patiently for the day of His reigning to come.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>He is not anxious today, and He does not seem to mind others' persecutions and opposition.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>When a person opposes Him today, He does not get revenge by sending bolts of lightning.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>He has not stood up to speak for His own right or position; He is waiting for God to make His enemy His footstool.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>This is the endurance of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Today we endure with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>When John wrote to the seven churches, there was such a word in his introduction: "Fellow partaker in the tribulation and kingdom and endurance in Jesus."</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>There are three things that one partakes of in this sentence: tribulation, kingdom, and endurance.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>If a Christian partakes of the tribulation and the endurance on earth today, he will partake also of the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Only those who keep the word of the endurance of Christ will be kept from the hour of trial.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>If anyone says that the whole church will be kept from the hour of trial, I have to ask, has the whole church kept the word of His endurance?</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>All those who have some position in society, some money in the world, and some activities in the political realm have not kept the word of Christ's endurance.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Those who want a name for themselves who want to fight for their rights, and who want to gain something for themselves are not keeping the word of Christ's endurance.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The promise of the rapture is not for this kind of people.</S>
