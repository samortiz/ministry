   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>WEEK 15 DAY 4</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Matthew 20:22-24, 26-28, 30, 34</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>22 But Jesus answered and said to them, You do not know what you are asking.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Are you able to drink the cup which I am about to drink?</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>They said to Him, We are able.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>23 He said to them, My cup you shall indeed drink, but to sit on My right and on My left, this is not Mine to give, but it is for those for whom it has been prepared by My Father.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>24 And when the ten heard this, they were indignant concerning the two brothers.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>26 But whoever wants to become great among you shall be your 1 servant,</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>27 And whoever wants to be first among you shall be your slave;</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>28 Just as the Son of Man did not come to be served, but to serve and to give His life as a ransom for many.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>30 And behold, two blind men sitting by the road, hearing that Jesus was passing by, cried out, saying, Have mercy on us, Lord, Son of David!</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>34 And Jesus, moved with compassion, touched their eyes, and immediately they received their sight and followed Him.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Portions from Life-study Messages</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>If we ask to sit on the throne in the kingdom, we must be prepared to drink the cup of suffering vv.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>22-23 .</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>To suffer the cross is the way to enter into the kingdom Acts 14:22 .</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The selfish entreaty of the mother of John and James afforded the Lord an opportunity to reveal the way to enter into the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>In answering the mother of James and John the Lord said, "To sit on My right and on My left, this is not Mine to give, but it is for those for whom it has been prepared by My Father" v. 23 . These words indicate that the Lord had a submissive spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>He did not assume anything, but gave place to the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Standing in the position of man, the Lord was fully subject to the Father; He did not assume the right to do anything outside the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>We all need to learn to give everything to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>We have no place to say anything regarding position.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>In verse 24 we see the fleshly rivalry of the disciples.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>They were more than angry; they were indignant, apparently fearing that nothing would remain for them.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The twelve were filled to the brim with ambition for position, and nothing regarding the Lord's death and resurrection penetrated them.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>What a pitiful situation!</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Regarding the matter of ambition for position, two things are clear: first, in 1 Corinthians 12:28 Paul lists the function of the elders administrations after the function of the deacons helps ; hence, in the New Testament there is a verse telling us that the administrating of the elders is lower than the help of the deacons ; second, to be an elder is to be a slave.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The matter of the leading ones being slaves corresponds to the Lord's word in Matthew 20:25 through 27.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>What is revealed in the Bible is absolutely different from our natural understanding.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>When our concept has been thoroughly revolutionized, the shame of ambition for position will be slain.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>In 20:29-34 we have a record of the healing of the two blind men.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The fact that this incident immediately follows the record of the mother of James and John indicates that James and John were blind.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>According to the Old Testament, the healing of blindness is related to the millennium.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>No one who is blind is on the way to the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Apparently James and John were on the way; actually, they were blind and on the wayside.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Their eyes had not yet been opened to see the way of the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>As long as we are ambitious, we are on the wayside and need healing.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>As soon as the two blind men received their sight, they followed the Lord on the way.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Life-study of Matthew, pp.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>651-652, 654, 656-657</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Portions from Footnotes</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>26 1 This is absolutely contrary to the natural, self-seeking mind.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The indignation of the ten disciples v. 24 also afforded the Lord an opportunity to reveal the way to live in the kingdom: to be willing to serve others as a servant, even as a slave v. 27 , rather than rule over others.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Suggested daily reading: Life-study of Matthew, pp.</S>
