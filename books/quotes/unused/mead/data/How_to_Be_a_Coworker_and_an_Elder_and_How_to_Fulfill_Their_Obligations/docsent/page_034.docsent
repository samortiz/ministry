   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Even with Paul, the Lord Was Wary of His Exceeding Exaltation of Himself, So He Let Him Have a Thorn in His Flesh from Satan</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Even with Paul, the Lord was wary of his exceeding exaltation of himself, so He let him have a thorn in his flesh from Satan 2 Cor 12:7 .</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Concerning the thorn, Paul entreated the Lord three times that it might depart from him.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Nevertheless, the Lord said to him, "My grace is sufficient for you" v. 9 . The Lord seemed to be saying, "Paul, I will not remove the thorn, because My grace is sufficient for you.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>I will give you sufficient grace."</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Why is it that Paul might be lifted up?</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>It is because no one had ever seen a vision and revelation higher than that seen by Paul.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Not only was he born on this earth, but he had also been down to the Paradise in Hades and even had been up to the third heaven.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Because the visions and revelations which Paul received were so high, so great, and so many, the Lord, being concerned, permitted a thorn to be given to him in his body.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Now I am also afraid that the visions I have seen may be too high, so I pray daily, "O Lord, I humble myself at Your feet; I am a slave and You are the sovereign Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>I am truly in fear and trembling, Lord."</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>I am in fear and trembling that I may be lifted up.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Sometimes when I receive numerous letters of appreciation, I am also afraid that people may regard me too highly.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Therefore, be cautious; do not praise people carelessly.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Your praise may damage them.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>3.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>A New Convert Should Not Be an Overseer, Lest Being Blinded with Pride He Fall into the Judgment Prepared for the Devil</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Hence, the apostle Paul taught that a new convert should not be an overseer of the church, lest being blinded with pride he fall into the judgment prepared for the devil 1 Tim 3:6 .</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Here, new convert, literally, "newly planted one," denotes a person who has recently received the Lord's life but has not yet grown and developed in it.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Blinded with pride literally means "beclouded with smoke."</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Pride here is likened to smoke that beclouds the mind, making it blind.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>This is a serious matter.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>When a person is proud, he follows Satan, and consequently he will be judged with him to suffer the judgment prepared by God for him.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>4.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Always Remember That Humility Saves You from All Kinds of Destruction and Invites God's Grace</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Pride means destruction.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Once you become proud, your family is destroyed; once you become proud, your married life is destroyed; once you become proud, your job is destroyed.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Always remember that humility saves you from all kinds of destruction and invites God's grace for you James 4:6 .</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>God resists the proud but gives grace to the humble.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>If you are humble, grace comes.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>If you are proud, grace goes away; you have hindered grace.</S>
