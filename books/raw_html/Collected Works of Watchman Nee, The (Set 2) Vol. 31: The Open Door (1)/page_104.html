<h2 class="head2">Sui-Yuan Province</h2><p>The churches here have been deeply blessed by God. His work is proceeding on as usual. The brothers and sisters have all been protected by God. Thank the Lord, I was sent out by the Lord to Bao-Tou. If God opens the way, I am willing to come see you shortly. May the Father bless His own work. We petition, pray, thank, praise, and give glory to our Lord and Father for each other. Greetings to all the brothers and sisters in the Lord.</p><p>Lee Jin-biao<br />February 8<br />[Address omitted]</p><h2 class="head2">Sian, Shensi Province</h2><p>Greetings to my brother in the Lord, Mr. X:</p><p>Thank God. By reading The Open Door, we can learn the news about the brothers and sisters in every place and about the apostles, and we also see God's marvelous leading of His children and His multifaceted care through miracles of love. Hallelujah! There is a group of brothers and sisters in Sian that have the same burden concerning the need for a meeting. There were some difficulties at first in finding a place, but God worked them all out for us. There was a meeting of the brothers and sisters last Lord's Day (February 20) at 4 Chao- Jia Lane, Dong-Kwan&mdash;that is Sister Lee Kwei-rong's home. More than ten people attended. Most have come here because of the war. We will begin to have the table to remember the Lord this next Lord's Day. We do not have a gospel meeting yet. May the Lord give us grace for everything. May the Lord's name be glorified. Please pray for us. Peace in the Lord!</p><p>Your sister in the Lord,<br />Yuan Hai-lian<br />February 22<br />[Address omitted]</p><h2 class="head2">Fen-Jou, Shansi Province</h2><p>Greetings to X:</p><p>Although we have never met, we are born of one Spirit in the Lord. I have been saved for six years, but spiritually I am just a six-year-old child and am still quite ignorant of the Lord's purpose. Every time I pray, I believe that God is protecting Brother Hsu Jung-jieh, Brother Tang Shou-ling, and Brother Chao Rue-tze and his wife. However, I still worry about them. While I was worrying and hoping, I suddenly received a copy of The Open Door. When I read it, I found that the first news was of Brother Hsu and then of Brothers Tang and Chao. I also learned about the situation of the other brothers and sisters in the work. I must joyfully give thanks and praise to the Lord, and I must thank you. However, I cannot stop worrying about Brother Tang. May the Lord protect and lead him, amen. Perhaps I will go to Ch'eng-tu, Chinghai, or Tibet. I will see how the Lord leads. Please pray much for me so that I would follow you to glorify His name. Please pray for my family also (my mother, my wife, Ling-wei, and my children, Ching-sin, Yueh-ling, Jieh-sin, and Hsu-sin) because they are all still in the war zone (Fen-Cheng, Shansi). May God protect them. I will tell you the rest later. I greet you with peace. Greetings to the brothers and sisters in the Lord.</p><p>Your little brother in the Lord,<br />Chang Kuang-tai<br />March 5<br />[Address omitted]</p>
