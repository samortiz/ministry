   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>2 Typified by the Water</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>through Which Noah and His Family</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Were Delivered Out of the Old Generation</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>of the Flood-judged World into a New Environment Produced by the Judgment of the Flood</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The water of baptism is typified by the water through which Noah and his family were delivered out of the old generation of the flood-judged world into a new environment produced by the judgment of the flood.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In 1 Peter 3:20 the Greek words translated were brought safely through mean to arrive safe into a place of security through difficulty or danger as in Acts 27:44 Darby .</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The Greek words rendered by water literally mean through water.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Water was the medium through which the saving was accomplished.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The ark saved Noah and his family from God s judgment, the destruction of the world by the flood.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>But the water saved them from the corrupted generation and separated them unto a new age, just as the water of the Red Sea did to the children of Israel Exo 14:22, 29; 1 Cor 10:1-2 and the water of baptism to the New Testament believers.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>First Peter 3:21 says, Which figure also now saves you, baptism, not a putting away of the filth of the flesh, but the appeal of a good conscience unto God, through the resurrection of Jesus Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>This verse does not teach baptismal salvation, and we do not hold the belief that the waters of baptism put away the filth of the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The words which figure refer to the water in the preceding verse, which is a figure of the water of baptism.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>This indicates that Noah and his family s being in the ark and passing through the flood was a type of our going through baptism.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The water of the flood delivered them out of the old manner of life into a new environment.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>In like manner, the water of baptism delivers us out of the vain manner of life into a manner of life in resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Baptism itself does not and cannot put away the filth of our flesh the dirt of our fallen nature and defilement of fleshly lust.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The erroneous teaching concerning baptismal salvation based upon this verse and Mark 16:16 and Acts 22:16 is corrected here.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Baptism is only a figure.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Its reality is Christ in resurrection as the life-giving Spirit, who applies to us all that Christ has passed through in His crucifixion and resurrection, making these things real in our daily life.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>j.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>To Appeal to God 1 For a Good Conscience, Conscience</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>with No More Offense,</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>But Rather Full of Peace and Confidence</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>That They Have Been Baptized into the Triune God</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>and Organically United with Him</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>First Peter 3:21 indicates that baptism is the appeal of a good conscience unto God.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The Greek word rendered appeal is eperotema , a question, an inquiry.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Its meaning is very much disputed.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The right meaning of the phrase seems to be, as Alford said, the seeking after God of a good and pure conscience, which governs the proper Christian life.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>This kind of question, asking for something, may be considered an appeal or demand.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Peter s thought here may be that baptism is the appeal to God of the baptized one for a good conscience unto God.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Such a conscience has no more offense, but rather is full of peace and confidence that the baptized one has been baptized into the Triune God and organically united with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>When we are baptized, we, as baptized ones, appeal to God for a good and pure conscience.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>After we have been baptized and rise up out of the water, we have a conscience that is good and pure, a conscience without condemnation.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>All our sins, offenses, transgressions, and trespasses have been forgiven, and all the problems that estranged our life and our being have been buried in the water.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>This means that through baptism we have a clearance of our sinful past.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Because of this clearance, we can have a good and pure conscience.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>We would emphasize the fact that baptism itself does not put away the filth of the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>However, baptism does enable us to have the assurance to appeal to God for a good and pure conscience.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Then, after we have been baptized, God answers us by indicating that we now have a conscience that is good and pure.</S>
