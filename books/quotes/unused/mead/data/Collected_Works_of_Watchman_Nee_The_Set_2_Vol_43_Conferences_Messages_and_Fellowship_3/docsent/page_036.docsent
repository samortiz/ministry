   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER SEVENTY-FIVE THE REVELATION ON THE MOUNTAIN Date: August 8, 1937</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Place: Singapore</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Scripture Reading: Mark 9:1-8 THE REVELATION ON THE MOUNTAIN</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>UNVEILING THE TRUE IMAGE OF THE LORD</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Brothers and sisters, we all know that revelation cannot be found on a plain.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>All revelation is found on the mountain.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The Bible tells us that the mountain is the place where one draws near to God.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>If a man does not leave the plain and ascend to a higher place, he cannot draw near to God.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>We are all very familiar with these verses in Mark 9.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>But I wonder how many of us have truly seen the Lord's revelation of Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>When the Lord was on the earth, He put on human flesh as a garment.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>He was first the Son of the living God, and then He became the Christ of God.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>What does this mean?</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>As far as His person goes, He is the Son of God, and as far as His work goes, He is the Christ of God.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The Son refers to His person, and the Christ refers to His work.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Matthew 16:16 tells us that He is both the Son of God and the Christ of God.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Actually, only the Son of God is qualified to be the Christ of God.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>He was the Son of the living God with unmatched glory, position, and authority.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Yet He put on the flesh and came to the earth "in disguise."</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Men did not recognize Him as the Son of God; they only recognized Him as the brother of James, Joses, Judas, and Simon Mark 6:3 and the cousin of John the Baptist.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Men only saw His outward form; they did not recognize who He was within His flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>They only knew Him as Jesus of Nazareth, and they criticized Him, saying, "Can anything good be from Nazareth?"</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>John 1:46 .</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Unless a man receives revelation from the Holy Spirit, he cannot see the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Who is Christ?</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>He is the Son of God in disguise.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>What is a disguise?</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>It is putting on a form that is different from one's original form.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The Word becoming flesh means that the Word put on a disguise.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>When the Word put on the flesh, He disguised Himself as flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Men only saw the disguise of the flesh; they did not realize that He was the Son of God.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>They could touch Him, hear Him, and see Him.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>They could be with Him in His preaching, eating, and casting out of demons.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>But they did not recognize Him as the Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Those who were more discerning, like the young man and Nicodemus, called Him Teacher, Rabbi Matt 19:16-20; John 3:1-2 .</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>They only knew that He had a relationship with God, but they did not know who He was.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>In Matthew 16:13 the Lord asked His disciples who men said that He was.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>They answered that some considered Him to be Elijah, while others considered Him to be Jeremiah.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Why did men not consider Him to be Daniel or Zechariah?</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>This is because no other prophet was as strong as Elijah; he condemned everything that was against God.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>He fought with the prophets of Baal and prevailed over them 1 Kings 18:18-40 .</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Jeremiah was a very gentle person.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>He was so gentle that others called him the weeping prophet.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>When he was faced with a situation and could do nothing about it, he could only weep.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>He was not as strong as Elijah.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Men said that the Lord Jesus was Elijah because He hated and condemned sin.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>They said that He was Jeremiah because He wept for the sinners, the poor, and Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>These ones knew Him a little, but they could only say that He was Elijah or Jeremiah.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Men only saw His outward appearance; they only saw Jesus' relatives, dwellings, work, and character.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>They did not know the Lord Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>But one day the Lord brought Peter, James, and John up to the mountain, and He was transfigured before their eyes.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>His garments became as white as the light, and His face shined like the sun.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>The significance of the revelation on the mountain is that the Lord revealed His very own self to men.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>He was no longer wrapped in an outward shell and shrouded from men's knowledge.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>The Lord's transfiguration on the mountain did not change Him into something that He was not.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Rather, He changed into what He was from the beginning.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Through this He revealed to others the kind of person He is.</S>
