   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>MANCHURIA</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>In 1933 God's servant came to Ch'ang-ch'un in Manchuria, and the meetings started.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Later, some were raised up in Shenyang and Jilin.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>In the past ten years the number of assemblies has increased to more than twenty localities.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>In 1942 God's servant, our brother Philip Luan, came to Manchuria to make some arrangements.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Because of the change in the world situation and the cruel attack of the Japanese, we passed through many trials and tribulations, but we all came through safely.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>We were not able to fellowship with the elder brothers and sisters in the inland for some time because communication was blocked.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Because of our immaturity and uncertainty in our direction, many brothers and sisters received teachings that appeared to be truth but were not.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>This occurred because we were starving and had no choice of food.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>These ones departed from the proper way.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>With the exception of Jilin and Ch'ang-ch'un, almost every locality was carried away by this deception.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>These brothers and sisters suffered much for their moment of blindness!</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Last summer, the church in Peking sent a brother to visit the churches in Manchuria.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>He passed through the localities of Ch'ang-ch'un, Shenyang, Jilin, and Harbin, and he met with the saints for forty days.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The assemblies in all the localities were much blessed by the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The brothers and sisters in Harbin suffered much for four or five years because they left the proper way.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>They turned this time and all were released.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>They are now very fresh.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The Lord's presence is with them in a special way.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The Lord is also gradually adding saved ones to the church.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The meeting place was too small, and a larger place has been rented which can hold three to four hundred people.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The population of Harbin is almost one million.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>It is an important point in the water and land transportation network in the area north of the Songhua River.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>It is at present full of needs.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>There is also Mudanjiang, a locality along the northeastern border of the country.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>It is a center of transportation: east to Vladivostok; west to Manzhouli; north to Jiamusi, the mines in the Heligang mountains, the forest regions, and the Heihe border; southeast through Tunhua to Tumen and on to North Korea; southwest to Harbin, Ch'ang-ch'un, and Shenyang.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Its produce is abundant, and life is easy.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>It has a population of almost three hundred thousand.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>It used to be a Baptist region, and there are many people who love the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Although they are in tribulation, their testimony is strong.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>They have been reading books from the bookroom for many years.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Those who have a heart for the Lord are looking for the way to go on.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Once a brother from Ch'ang-ch'un visited them, and everyone was helped through the fellowship in the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>In January of this year, Peking sent a brother to visit all the local churches in Manchuria.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>He went to Shenyang, Harbin, Mudanjiang, and Ch'ang-ch'un.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>There were meetings for two months.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>By the Lord's grace and mercy, every locality received much blessing.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>There are now thirty localities.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Some already have assemblies; others do not have as many people, but they do have prayer in one accord.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Only Ch'ang-ch'un, Shenyang, Jilin, and Harbin have the Lord's table.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>All the churches in Manchuria are now one.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>The Lord has led us to the way of righteousness for His name's sake.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>We can only give thanks and praise to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Dalien was not able to send people to visit these places because of barriers to transportation.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>The brothers sent letters of invitation, and Brother Yuan Zhu-wu and Brother Chin Jia-ye came to attend the meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>They fully received the Lord's truth and expressed the desire to stand with all the churches on the ground of oneness to serve the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>They also consecrated themselves and are willing to follow the footsteps of the flock.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>After they returned to Dalien, the brothers and sisters willingly received the Lord's truth and obeyed all the Lord's arrangements.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>They hope some brothers will go and visit them.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>The brothers and sisters in Manchuria spiritually have lost much over the past few years.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Since the Lord has brought them back to the way of oneness, He will indeed multiply His blessings to them.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>We ask the brothers and sisters in every locality to pray for them!</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>On the following page is a map of the churches in Manchuria.</S>
