[1]  CONTENTS The First Testimony Salvation and Calling Given on October 18, 1936 The Second Testimony Given on October 20, 1936 The Third Testimony Given on October 20, 1936 Appendix: A Letter from Brother Watchman Nee to the Compiler, March 10, 1950
[2]  He preached the gospel to me, explaining that God loved me and gave His only begotten Son for me, and that if I would truly believe in Him, I would not perish but would have eternal life.
[3]  In 1924 I transferred to Nanking University and came under the influence of modernism.
[4]  I did not want to be a preacher on salary, but I did not know how to live by faith, so I went to Watchman Nee for fellowship.
[5]  In 1948 I again had opportunity to attend a conference in the church in Shanghai.
[6]  There were also meetings for testimonies, in which the participants gave brief testimonies.
[7]  At that time I was afraid of being saved, for I knew that once I was saved I must serve the Lord.
[8]  Among them is Brother Weigh Kwang-hsi, who can testify concerning what an ill-behaved student I was, as well as what a wonderful student I was in school.
[9]  When my schoolmates saw me, they recognized that I had changed, but I had not changed thoroughly, for I still occasionally lost my temper and did some things wrong.
[10]  About this time I met a Western missionary, Miss Groves Margaret Barber's co-worker , who asked me how many persons I had brought to the Lord in the year following my salvation.
[11]  I bowed my head, hoping to forestall further questioning, and shamefully admitted in a low voice that, although I had preached the gospel to my schoolmates, they did not like to listen, and when they did listen, they would not believe.
[12]  Though some had been saved, I was still not satisfied, because many in the school and in the town were still not saved.
[13]  I felt the need to be filled with the Holy Spirit and to receive power from above that I might be able to bring more people to the Lord.
[14]  One day while seeking a theme from the Bible before delivering a message, I randomly opened the Bible and Psalm 73:25 appeared before my eyes: "Whom have I in heaven but thee?
[15]  I must admit that I did love her, but at the same time I suffered her laughter at the Lord I believed in. I also questioned at that time whether she or the Lord would have first place in my heart.
[16]  I told God of my willingness to give her up, but deep in my heart I was not willing.
[17]  Today I want to testify concerning four things: 1 learning the lesson of the cross, 2 leading in the work, 3 receiving healing to my sickness and experiencing God as my Healer, and 4 four aspects of work entrusted by the Lord.
[18]  I have never seen a revival greater than this one.
[19]  In 1924, some workers were not satisfied with me, and God suffered the church in Foochow to be suddenly brought to a test.
[20]  In order to avert a split, I then left Foochow.
[21]  I was not afraid of death but I could not help thinking of what I had learned from the Lord during the many years before and the lessons I had experienced, none of which had yet been put into writing.
[22]  When I first became aware of my illness in 1924, I was feeling feeble, there was pain in my chest, and I had a slight fever.
[23]  Dr. H. S. Hwang said to me, "I know you have faith and that God can cure you, but allow me to examine you and diagnose your disease." After the examination he spoke to Brother Wong Teng-ming for some time in a very low voice.
[24]  But when I informed them that I was not afraid, Dr. Hwang told me that I was afflicted with tuberculosis and that my condition was so serious that prolonged rest would be necessary.
[25]  I felt that even though I might not live long, I should believe that God would increase my strength and that I must work for Him.
[26]  My concept had been that one should not write books until he was old, but when I considered that I might be leaving this earth, I felt I should begin writing.
[27]  I wrote The Spiritual Man during my long illness.
[28]  When someone told me of this, I said, "Let this be my end. I realize I am going to die soon." One brother telegraphed the churches in various places, telling them there was no more hope for me and that they need pray for me no more.
[29]  Walking within the room might be all right, I thought, but how could I walk downstairs?
[30]  I prayed to God, "Oh God, I can stand by faith, and by faith I am also able to walk downstairs!"
[31]  I tell you honestly that when I stood at the top of the staircase it seemed to me to be the tallest staircase I had ever seen in my life.
[32]  I said to God, "If You tell me to walk I will do so, even if I die as a result of the effort."
[33]  From the time I was bedridden by illness until the time I was healed by God, I was being shown more clearly the kind of work God wanted me to do.
[34]  Before I became ill, I not only visited various places to conduct special meetings, but I also had a great ambition to compose a good comprehensive commentary.
[35]  After completing The Spiritual Man, which I began in Nanking when I became ill, I realized that the task of expounding the Scriptures was not for me.
[36]  In 1923 Brother Weigh Kwang-hsi invited me to preach in Kien-ou in the north of Fukien province.
[37]  I had only about fifteen dollars in my pocket, one-third of the traveling expenses.
[38]  Not only was no money forthcoming, but also I had a feeling within that I should give five dollars to a certain co-worker.
[39]  I prayed to the Lord again, "O Lord, if You really want me to give away five dollars, I will," but I was still rather unwilling inwardly.
[40]  This time I had a feeling of certainty in my heart, recalling that before I left Foochow, God had asked me to give five dollars to a co-worker, which I then begrudged giving.
[41]  Then he said, "When you get back to Foochow, I will give you The Dynamic of Service written by Mr. Padget Wilkes, a gospel messenger greatly used by the Lord in Japan." I soon felt that I had missed a great opportunity; what I needed then was money for traveling expenses, not a book.
[42]  When I left the following day, I had only a few dollars in my pocket.
[43]  Many brothers and sisters came to see me off, and some carried my luggage.
[44]  While walking I prayed, "Lord, surely You wouldn't bring me here without taking me back."
[45]  When I prayed to God, He told me that I am not like a Christian, for I have never done well in the matter of offering, and that I love money too much.
[46]  5 There should be no tension in meetings or in the church.
