This is like saying that Brother Luk is a man, but this does not mean that all men are Brother Luk.</p><h2 class="head1">MATTHEW 5:28</h2><p>Question: What does Matthew 5:28 mean?</p><p>Answer: Matthew 5:28 says, "Every one who looks at a woman in order to lust after her has already committed adultery with her in his heart." It does not say "every one who sees," but "every one who looks." Seeing is unintentional, whereas looking is intentional. There is a difference between seeing a person on the street and looking at him. Seeing him is unintentional, but looking at him is intentional. It is a sin to look at a woman for the purpose of lusting after her. Today the temptation of looking at a woman on the street is great because many women do not dress or walk properly. This can be a constant temptation to sin. While one is walking on the street, he naturally sees many women, but there is no need to consciously look at them. Seeing women is unavoidable, but looking at them involves the will. The first glance is unintentional, but the second look is intentional; it constitutes adultery in the heart. You cannot stop a bird from flying over your head, but you can stop it from building a nest on your head. The first glance does not involve the will; it is unintentional. The second glance, however, involves the will; it is intentional and constitutes a sin.</p><h2 class="head1">DEALING WITH THE THOUGHTS</h2><p>Question: How can we overcome our thoughts?</p><p>Answer: Satan knows us more than we know ourselves. Our words and actions originate from our thoughts. Many people say that their words are unintentional. Actually, however, everything we say is intentional, but the intention may be hidden in the heart. Thoughts that exist within will eventually be expressed in words (Matt. 12:34-35). If a Christian cannot control his thoughts, he has failed already. There are very few believers who have overcome their thoughts. Every temptation must first be translated into a thought before it will lodge itself in a person. In order to reject temptations, we must first reject the thoughts.</p><p>How can we overcome our thoughts? First, we must, as Romans 8:6 says, set the mind positively on the things of the spirit. Second, we have to reject all wandering thoughts. If we do not reject wandering thoughts, they will eventually become sinful thoughts. Our thoughts are prone to wander when we pray, but at other times they wander also. A brother asked me what he should do when he found his thoughts straying and when he was unable to concentrate as he prayed. I asked whether his thoughts wandered all over the world when he was not praying. He admitted that they did. This is where the problem lies. If our thoughts are always wandering, it will be hard to keep our thoughts from straying and to concentrate in prayer.</p><p>In order to deal with wandering thoughts, we first have to ask the Lord to cover our thoughts with His precious blood. We should apply the weapon mentioned in Ephesians 6. Many people do not wear any helmet on their head. As a result their thoughts tend to wander. Our whole body needs to be equipped, but we need more on our head than on any other part. A helmet cannot be used as a weapon, but it can protect the head from attacks. However, there is another problem. Some say, "The more I reject wandering thoughts, the more they come and the more confused I become. What should I do?" When this happens, we must not be discouraged. Remember that Satan will not persist. When Moses went to Pharaoh, there were two Egyptian magicians (2 Tim. 3:8). Aaron turned a staff into a snake, and the two magicians did the same thing. Aaron turned water into blood, and they did the same. Aaron caused frogs to come to the land of Egypt, and they did the same. But when Aaron struck the dust and turned it into lice, they could not do the same thing. Satan's temptations do not last long. If we persist and are not discouraged, Satan will soon be stripped of his power.</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_028.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_030.html">Next</a> </body></html>
