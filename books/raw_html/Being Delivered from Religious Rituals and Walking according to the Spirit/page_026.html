        <h1 class="msg">CHAPTER TEN</h1>
<h1 class="title">BEING IN SPIRIT, NOT IN LETTER</h1>
<p>As human beings, we are still in the old creation. We exercise to walk according to the spirit, but we are still in the old creation, and our spirit is not so strong. Consequently, it is easy for us to depend on methods. Even when we drop an old method, we look for a new method. Whether the method is old or new, it is nonetheless a method that we depend on and are reluctant to drop.</p>
<h2 class="head1">FOLLOWING THE SPIRIT</h2>
<p>It is easy to adopt a method. Even though we have dropped the old methods, we adopt new methods, and as long as we depend on a method, it can become an ordinance. For example, calling on the name of the Lord loudly has become a popular method for exercising the spirit. Our meetings can be considered to be calling meetings. This seems to be our practice. We should not criticize this calling, because it is beneficial, just as it is beneficial for those who box to punch with their fists. However, a person who knows only how to punch will not be a skillful boxer. Our spirit is much more agile than our body, and the exercise of our spirit should not be limited to calling loudly.</p>
<p>The Spirit is like the wind that blows where it wills. Sometimes the wind is fierce, and at other times it is gentle. A hurricane can tear a steel roof off a house, but a gentle breeze is pleasant. Sometimes the wind blows from the south in the morning, from the north in the afternoon, and from the west or the east in the evening. Likewise, the Spirit blows as He wills.</p>
<p>We tend to take the easy way to release the spirit. We want the Spirit to blow from only one direction. It is not easy for us to follow the Spirit when He blows from different directions. Our spirit is not limited to calling loudly. The Spirit will not lead us to call only in this way in every meeting, including the Lord&rsquo;s table meeting. Calling loudly has become a method we use to exercise our spirit.</p>
<p>The Spirit leads us in many ways. For example, in Psalms sometimes there is a cry of &ldquo;O Lord&rdquo; (35:17; 57:9). Some psalms are long, some psalms are short, and some psalms have a selah, which is a pause, a quiet interlude. This shows that the saints in the Old Testament expressed their inspiration in different ways. In the New Testament the believers prayed, praised, called on the Lord&rsquo;s name, and sang. We need to practice exercising our spirit in many ways. Calling loudly and short prayers of three to five words have become a regulation.</p>
<p>The Spirit blows where He wills. He can lead us to be loud, to cry, or to be quiet when we praise or pray. We must be freed from ordinances. We should not keep any ordinance when we sing the hymns. In the meetings we usually sing an entire hymn. After we sing a hymn, we also pray it. We do not need to follow a set procedure. We can pray a few phrases from a hymn before we sing it. After we sing one stanza, a brother or a sister may give a testimony. Then another saint may suggest that we sing the stanza again. After singing there may be further prayer. There is no need for us to wait until we sing the entire hymn before we pray. We can pray after singing one stanza, and we do not have to follow the lyrics of the hymn rigidly when we pray. We can use the lyrics to develop our prayer.</p>
<p>We are human beings; we are not robots. A robot is mechanical. We do not need to call on the Lord or call mechanically in the meetings. We do not need to be rigid. We were rigid with our old practice, and now we are rigid with the new practice. Formerly we were rigid in a dead practice, and now we are rigid in a living practice. After a period of time, however, being rigid in this way will become unbearable. May the Lord have mercy on us, and may we receive His mercy.</p>
<p>Some saints may say that we are Chinese and that our character is conservative. We should not be too considerate of ourselves or say that the Chinese character is conservative. If we hear that there will be an explosion, we will run for safety faster than anyone else. The Chinese people who went to the United States to mine gold were able to endure much hardship.</p>
<p>Within us there is a new life with a new nature. The Lord&rsquo;s Spirit dwells in our new spirit, but we limit the Lord. It is as if we are in a room with many windows, but we always open the same window. Today we open the window that faces east, and tomorrow we open the same window even though we could open any window. Since the wind does not blow from only one direction, we should open all the windows.</p>
<p>In whatever we do, we should be flexible; we do not need regulations. The churches should no longer have regulations. Every saint should be released. This does not mean that we practice anarchy. As long as the citizens of a country observe the law, no one interferes with their freedom. As soon as they commit a crime, however, the police enforce the law. This can be applied to our meetings. As long as the saints live in the spirit and walk by the spirit, there is freedom (2 Cor. 3:17). However, if anyone causes trouble in the meetings, the responsible ones should stop them.</p>

 	<h2>Noise Words</h2>
 	<p>Common words, such as "and", "is", "but", and "the", also known as noise words, are bypassed in a search. The search string, the Spirit &amp; who, would result in an error since who, which stands by itself, is a noise word. The following is a list of noise words:</p>
	<p>$, a, also, an, and, another, any, are, as, at, be, because, been, being, both, but, by, came, can, did, do, each, for, has, had, he, have, her, here, him, himself, his, how, if, in, into, is, it, like, make, me, might, much, my, of, on, or, our, out, over, said, should, since, some, still, such, take, than, that, the, their, them, then, there, these, they, this, those, to, too, very, was, way, we, well, were, what, where, which, while, who, with, would, you, your</p>

  	<h2>Ranking</h2>
  	<p>Rank is a value from <strong>0</strong> to <strong>1000</strong> indicating how closely a match scored or ranked against the original search string. Rank values are affected by the following factors:</p>
		<ol>
            <li><span>The total number of occurrences of the original search words/phrases in a portion of a book.</span></li>
            <li><span>Content that includes the search words in close proximity to each other are ranked above those that do not. Therefore, a portion of a book that has the search words in close proximity may have a higher ranking than another portion of a book that has a higher hit count but the words are not in close proximity to one another. Therefore, we also include a search word hit count for reference.</span></li>
            <li><span>The rank values are relative to each other. Therefore, it is not possible to interpret the RANK value as a percentage or group the rank values into high/medium/low ranges. Think of rank as a method to order the results for a specific search.</span></li>

 	<h2>Search Scope</h2>
 	<h3>Include All Word Forms</h3>
	<p>This option breaks out the search string into its individual words and generates all conjugations and declensions for each word in the search phrase. A search on the word, dwell, would search for dwell, dwelling, dwelling's, dwells, dwelt, and dwelled.</p>
	<p>There is no need to use ^ (inflectional search) or * (prefix search) when using the Include all word forms search scope.</p> 
	<h3>Specified Word Forms</h3>
	<p>This option searches for exact matches of the specified words or phrases used in the search string. Use of ^ (inflectional search) with a particular word in the search string will broaden the search for that given word in that all conjugations and declensions for that word will be searched. Similarly, use of * (prefix search) with a particular word in the search string will broaden the search for that given word in that all words with that prefix will be searched as well.</p> 
	<h3>Note</h3>
	<p>Common words, such as "and", "is", "but", and "the", also known as noise words, are bypassed in a search. A list of all noise words is as follows:</p>
