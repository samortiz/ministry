   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>LIVING CHRIST BY LOVING HIM</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>As we are engaged in our daily activities, our living should not be those activities, but Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Our mind should be concentrated on Christ, but this concentration of our mind depends upon our love for Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>This is why the New Testament charges us to love Christ Mark 12:30; Rev 2:4-5; John 14:23; 21:15-17; 1 Pet 1:8 .</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>If we do not love Christ, we cannot live Him, and loving Him is the best way to concentrate our entire being on Him.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>When a young mother delivers a child, her whole living is that new baby.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>For her, to live is her new baby.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>This is because of her love for her child.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>When we love Christ to the uttermost, our entire being is occupied with Him, and we live Him.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>This was Paul's experience; therefore, he said, "To me to live is Christ, and to die is gain" Phil 1:21 .</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>To Paul, to continue to live was Christ, and if he should die, it was gain.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Living Christ requires that we love Him to the uttermost.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Sometimes when we have been very captivated by something, that night we would have a dream about that thing.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Even in our dreams, for us to live was the thing that captivated us.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Christ needs to captivate us to such an extent.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>THE MIND SET ON THE SPIRIT BEING LIFE</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Romans 8:6 says, "For the mind set on the flesh is death, but the mind set on the spirit is life and peace."</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>In our practical Christian life, we must set our mind on the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>When we set our mind on the spirit, our mind is life.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Life is God, Christ, and the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>This life becomes real and practical to us when our mind is life.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>If our mind is not life, God and Christ as our life seem far away, and the Spirit is very objective to us.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Christ is our life, but Christ as our life is practical to us when we set our mind on the spirit, and our mind is life.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>When our mind is set on the spirit, we have life.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>THE MIND SET ON THE SPIRIT BEING TO ABIDE IN CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>To set the mind on the spirit is also to abide in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>When we abide in Christ, the issue, the result, is fruit-bearing.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>If we do not bear fruit, our abiding is false.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>If a married couple desires to have children and after a number of years does not have any, they may go to a medical doctor to find out what is wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>We should not be deceived.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Our abiding in Christ should produce fruit.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Christ today is the Spirit 1 Cor 15:45b; 2 Cor 3:17 , so we can now abide in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>To abide in Christ, taking Christ as the Spirit, is to set our mind on the mingled spirit, our regenerated spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>This proper abiding in Christ will surely result in fruit-bearing.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Everyone who enjoys Christ will be charged by the Lord to go John 15:16 !</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>We are charged to "go forth" which implies that we should go some distance.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>We should not stay home, but we must go forth to bear remaining fruit.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>This is the result of abiding in Christ which is a matter of setting our mind on the spirit.</S>
