   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Here we have to raise two matters.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>First, we must know that the breaking of the outer man is a work of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>There is no need for imitation by the self.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>But if we know that an activity is of the flesh, should we try to stop it ourselves, or should we wait for the Holy Spirit to break it?</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Should we wait for a great light to come and not try to put any restraint on it at all?</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Our answer to the above question is: We should cease all activities of the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>This is different from pretension.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>If I have the tendency to become proud, I should deny my pride.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>However, I should not pretend to be humble.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>If I am about to lose my temper at someone, I should deny my temper.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>But I should not pretend to be meek.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Ceasing doing something is a negative prevention, while pretending to act a certain way is a positive move.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Pride is something negative, and we should deal with it.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Humility is something positive, and we cannot imitate it.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Suppose we are very stubborn with a harsh voice and an unbending attitude.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>We have to deny this harshness, but we should not pretend to be meek.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>We have to stop all activities and works of the flesh that we are aware of.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>But we should not imitate any of the positive virtues.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>We should offer ourselves to the Lord and say, "Lord, I will not try to imitate anything.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>I will look to You for Your work."</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>If we do this, we will find God breaking us and building us up.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>All outward imitations are not God's work; they are man's work.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Therefore, every seeking person should learn the inward lessons, not the outward imitations.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>He should allow God to effect something in him.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>It is through this work that he will derive his outward expressions.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Anything that a person does in an outward way is not genuine.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>All manmade structures have to be demolished.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>When a man puts up something false, he will not only cheat others but also cheat himself.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>As we give ourselves to imitations and artificiality, we will gradually be led to believe that we are what we pretend to be.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Even if others point out that we do not have anything real and that we have to get rid of it, we will still wonder whether their words are true.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>We should never imitate anything in an outward way.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>It is better to be a little bit more natural in the way we conduct ourselves and allow God to build up something in us instead.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>We should live in a simple and unpretentious way.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>We should not engage in any outward imitating or copying; rather, we should look to the Lord to daily add the virtues that we need.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The second matter is that some people have some virtues in the natural realm.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>For example, some are naturally very meek.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>What is the difference between natural meekness and a meekness that comes as a result of discipline?</S>
