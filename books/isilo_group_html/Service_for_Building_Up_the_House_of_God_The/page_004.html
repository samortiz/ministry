<p>Here are a few points concerning the way to practice this fellowship.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Placing Ourselves in the Church</h2>
<p>If we have seen God&rsquo;s desire and sense our need, we must resolve to place ourselves in the church. We should settle this matter once for all. Whether or not the church is strong, we must put ourselves in the church. This must be our determination and decision. Some saints do not have such a resolve, and as a result, their spiritual condition will not be healthy. If we want to pursue spirituality, to serve God, and to preach the gospel, we cannot be individualistic; rather, we must be in the church. We must have a determination to be in the church.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Submitting to the Headship of Christ</h2>
<p>We need to learn the lesson of submitting to the headship of Christ. This lesson requires a thorough consecration in which we recognize the Lord as our Head and acknowledge His authority and position in all things. Ephesians 4:15 says that we should &ldquo;grow up into Him in all things, who is the Head, Christ.&rdquo; In order for us to be in a proper condition in the church, we must be under the authority of the Head. Without a proper relationship with the Head, we cannot have a proper relationship with the other believers in the church. This is not a matter of doctrine. We must learn the serious lesson of maintaining a proper relationship with the Head, Christ, by being ruled by Him in all things, that is, letting Him be the Lord in all matters, whether great or small. If we are willing to submit to the headship of Christ in this way, those who come into our midst will sense that Christ is our Head. No one in the church can take the place of Christ. Everyone needs to honor Him as the Lord and take Him as the Head.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Accepting the Breaking</h2>
<p>Not only should we have a proper relationship with the Head, but we must also maintain a proper relationship with the brothers and sisters. Not only should we submit ourselves to the headship of Christ, but we must also be fitly joined together with the brothers and sisters. This requires that we learn the lessons of being broken. I can coordinate with any responsible brother and with any elder. I have no problem coordinating with the co-workers as well as with the saints. It does not matter whether a person is elderly or young; I can coordinate with him. I have a proper relationship with the Head and also with the saints. In order to have a proper relationship with the Head, we need to submit to the authority of the Head, but in order to have a proper relationship with the saints, we need to be willing to be broken.</p>
<p>If we are not willing to be broken in relation to a particular matter, sooner or later we will have problems with the saints in that matter. Therefore, we need to learn serious lessons. A person who is broken will depend not only on God but also on the saints. This is not referring to depending on the saints in financial matters or general matters. We need to learn to rely on the saints in spiritual matters. We need to rely on the saints in order to live before the Lord and to serve Him. We must have the consciousness that we cannot serve God by ourselves; we must be joined to the saints and rely on them. This is not doctrine. It must be our experience.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Living before God</h2>
<p>We need to learn to live before God. On the one hand, we need to depend on the saints, and on the other hand, we should learn to live before the Lord, to read His Word, to pray in fellowship with Him, and to fear Him. We should not say, &ldquo;There are many brothers and sisters. Some of them give messages, and others administrate the church. I will run errands and let them take care of the spiritual matters.&rdquo; This is not right. Every saint needs to draw near to the Lord, to pray, to read His Word, and to fellowship with Him, always living in the shining of His face.</p>
<p>We do not have enough experience. The authority of the Head is not adequately expressed through us. The position of the Head is not sufficiently manifest among us. Hence, we lack the element of submitting to the Head. We have not fully learned the lessons of being broken. Sometimes we criticize the saints, the elders, and the responsible ones. Criticisms prove that we are not broken. A believer who is broken does not have anything to say, even if the elders are wrong or the saints are somewhat undesirable. A believer who is broken does not have opinions. Rather, he is submissive to God. Such a believer feels that he is short and seldom notices others&rsquo; mistakes.</p>
<p>We do not depend on one another as members of the Body, because we are not broken. Being confident in ourselves and not needing the other members in order to visit the saints or to give a message are the expression of death, not life. Being confident in ourselves is a tearing down of the Body, not the building up. It issues in spiritual heroes who can do everything but who do not have God&rsquo;s presence.</p>
<p>When we submit to the authority of the Head and accept the breaking, we will realize our need to rely on the saints in all things. Those who give messages will rely on the other brothers. The sisters will depend on one another for spiritual matters. Then when people come into our midst, they will sense that God is among us. The Spirit will move in our midst, and God&rsquo;s intention will be fulfilled.</p>
<p>As we depend on one another, we will also learn to fear God, to live in His presence, and to have a private life of reading the Bible and praying, and we will learn the lessons of being broken. As a result, we will not be confused; rather, we will each walk before the Lord and express Him.</p>
<p>The church will be strong, bright, rich, and glorious. The gospel will be powerful, and the saints will be edified. Every meeting and every aspect of service will have the Lord&rsquo;s presence so that when people enter, they will declare, &ldquo;This is God&rsquo;s house!&rdquo; They will receive rest, be nourished, and meet God. This is the building that God desires.</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_003.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_005.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>The Service for Building Up the House of God &nbsp; pg 4</div><br></body></html>
