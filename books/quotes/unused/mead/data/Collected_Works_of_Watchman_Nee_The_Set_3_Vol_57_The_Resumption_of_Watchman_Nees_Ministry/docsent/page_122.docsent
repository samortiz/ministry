   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CONCERNING MONEY</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>We have the following fellowship concerning money.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In the coming days many brothers and sisters will have to leave their jobs.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In Shanghai we have asked two sisters and two brothers to do this.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Brother Hsia Hsi-ling has been working in the customs department for many years.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>We are asking him to leave that job.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>In addition, perhaps twenty to thirty brothers and sisters will also have to hand themselves over.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Perhaps we will need fifty or sixty brothers and sisters to do this.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>If they give up their jobs and offer themselves up full-time, their support will be on the shoulders of the brothers who are holding jobs.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>During the past twenty years, we have not mentioned the matter of money.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>This platform can testify for me concerning this.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>But today we are going into business as partners and preaching the gospel as partners.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>For this reason, the brothers and sisters who are holding jobs should work conscientiously, and they should do their best to make money as well as to save money.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Today we stand on a different ground, and that is why we are not afraid to say something and do something.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Today I can pass around my hat to ask for money for a brother.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>If some have misunderstood what we have said and are no longer willing to offer up everything, you can claim back your consecration slip from Brother Witness after the meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>There is no need to be shy and no need to be ashamed.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>We do not force anyone to do anything.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>But when the brothers come together to discuss matters, and when a decision has been reached, you cannot draw back.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Today we are not asking you to be frugal to the extent that you will suffer in your physical health.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>We are not asking for one-tenth, one-half, or one-hundredth.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>We are asking you to offer up all that you have except what you need.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>If you make ten million dollars a month, and you need all ten million, you do not have to offer a cent. If you make only eight million, the church will gladly give up two million to make up enough to meet your need.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>But if you make eleven million, you can only keep the ten million that you need.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>You have to offer up the remaining one million.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>If you make a hundred million, then ninety million will have to be offered up.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>If you do not do this, you owe these brothers who are giving up their jobs something.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>We have to learn to bear the responsibility of the gospel together with the brothers.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Only by doing this will the gospel spread, and only then will we be able to go on in the way before us.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>FOUR THINGS CONCERNING THE WORK</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Concerning the future of the work, there are a few things that we have to pay attention to.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>In order for God's work in China to be carried out properly, four things are indispensable.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The first is that strong messages need to be delivered in the local meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The second is that the literature work needs to spread.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The third is the need to perfect the young people.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The fourth is the need for joint conferences everywhere yearly.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>If any of these four things are lacking, our work will not be covered adequately.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Shanghai and Foochow should maintain very strong message meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Then when a person wants to be perfected, he has to come to the church.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>THE NEED FOR SUITABLE MEETING HALLS</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>IN DIFFERENT PLACES</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Furthermore, we need suitable meeting halls.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Brother Miao said that he has been to many places and that in no place is the meeting hall as bad as the one here in Shanghai.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>In the winter it is cold, and in the summer it is hot.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>When someone gives a message, the audience is spread out over seven or eight different places.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The listeners cannot see the speaker, and in some places they cannot even hear the speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>We have to build a meeting hall that can seat three thousand immediately and that can hold another two thousand if we add another level to it later.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>In total we need a place that can seat five thousand.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Many people have been stirred up in Nanking already.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Hence, Nanking also needs a meeting hall.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>In addition, we have to consider how to maintain a strong message meeting in Nanking.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Foochow also needs a meeting hall.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Presently, the meeting hall in Foochow is very hot in summer, and the windows are on the roof.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>What the brothers and sisters have offered up in these days is not enough to take care of these three meeting halls.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>THE NEED FOR THE PUBLICATION OF THE MAGAZINES</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Before the war we published an average of eighteen thousand copies of The Christian every issue.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>At its peak we were publishing twenty-one thousand copies.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>The publication of one magazine alone requires seven hundred million dollars.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>This is only one magazine.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>There are three other kinds of magazines.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Do not think that it is a simple thing to put out a magazine.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>As far as an individual is concerned, it is an embarrassing thing to ask for money.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>But here we are not afraid of misunderstanding.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Every month we need much money.</S>
