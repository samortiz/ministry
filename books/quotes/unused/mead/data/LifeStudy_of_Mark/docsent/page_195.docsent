   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>In the Experience of the Disciples</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The disciples also received the Holy Spirit both essentially and economically.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>They received the Spirit essentially in John 20:22.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The receiving of the essential Spirit was for their spiritual existence, their spiritual being.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>When the disciples received the Holy Spirit in John 20, they received the divine essence.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>After receiving the Spirit in this aspect for their spiritual existence, it was still necessary for them to receive the Spirit economically so that they could carry out God s economy as the continuation of the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The disciples had to carry out God s economy in the same way the Lord Jesus carried it out.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Since the Lord carried out God s economy by the economical Spirit, the disciples had to carry out God s economy by the economical Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Therefore, after receiving the Spirit essentially, the disciples needed to receive the Spirit economically.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>They received the economical Spirit in chapter two of Acts.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>We have emphasized that in John 20:22 the disciples received the Holy Spirit essentially for their spiritual being and existence.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>In Acts 1 we see the disciples living in this spiritual being.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Before John 20, that is, before the Lord s death and resurrection, the disciples had not been made alive in their spiritual being for their spiritual existence.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Instead, they had a fallen natural, fleshly being.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Even after the Lord had revealed to them His death and resurrection the third time Mark 10:32-34 , the disciples were still disputing concerning who was greater Mark 10:35-45 .</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>In addition, Peter certainly was in his natural being when he denied the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>But after Christ s death and resurrection, the disciples received the essential Spirit as the source of their spiritual being.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>In chapter one of Acts, although the disciples had not yet received the Holy Spirit descending upon them economically, they had experienced the Spirit essentially for their spiritual existence.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Therefore, in their being they became spiritual.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The disciples had the essential Spirit for their spiritual being, but they still needed the Holy Spirit to descend upon them economically.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>This took place on the day of Pentecost.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>In Acts 2 the Spirit was fully consummated for the experience of the believers.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>In Our Experience Today</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>When did you receive the Holy Spirit essentially and economically?</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Some may say that they received the Holy Spirit essentially when they were regenerated and economically at a time after their regeneration.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>According to the biblical way of understanding this matter, we received the Holy Spirit essentially and economically more than nineteen hundred years ago.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>We all received the Holy Spirit essentially in John 20.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Then the Jewish believers in Christ received the Holy Spirit economically in Acts 2, and the Gentile believers received the Spirit economically in Acts 10.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>We may use purchasing a house as an illustration of receiving the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Suppose a certain brother buys a house before he is married.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Later he gets married and has children.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>When did this brother s wife and children buy the house?</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The correct answer is that they bought it when he bought it.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The principle is the same with our receiving the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>When did we receive the Holy Spirit?</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>We received the Spirit when the disciples as our representatives received the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Throughout the centuries a great many people have believed in the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Each time a person believes in Him does the Lord come to that one to breathe on him and then baptize him in the Holy Spirit?</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>No, the Lord Jesus breathed out the Spirit and baptized the believers in the Spirit once for all.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Both the Lord s breathing out of the Spirit and His baptizing in the Spirit are accomplished facts.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>In John 20 the Lord breathed the Spirit essentially into His Body.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>This happened once for all.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Now, as a brother s wife and children share in the house purchased by him before he was married and before his children were born, in a similar way, we have a share in the Lord s breathing out of the Spirit as those who have become members of His Body.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>In the one case, there is no need for the wife and children to purchase the house again.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Instead, they simply share in the house purchased by the brother.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>In a similar way, there is no need for the Lord to breathe out the Spirit again.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>We simply need to share in the Spirit breathed by the Lord into the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>After His resurrection, the Lord Jesus came to His disciples and, regarding them as His Body, breathed the Holy Spirit into them essentially.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Fifty days later, on the day of Pentecost, He baptized the Jewish part of His Body into the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Later, in the house of Cornelius, He baptized the Gentile part of His Body into the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>At that time the consummation of the Spirit for the Body was fully accomplished.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Whenever a sinner believes in the Lord Jesus, his believing joins him both to the Lord and to the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>In this way, the Spirit becomes his portion.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>He now has a share in the Lord s breathing of the Spirit essentially into the Body and in His baptizing the Body in the Spirit economically.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>We should not think that there are two Spirits or that the Spirit can somehow be divided.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>On the contrary, there is one Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Yet there are the two aspects of the Spirit, one aspect for essence and another aspect for economy.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>The first aspect of the Spirit is essential; the second aspect is economical.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Today in our experience we have both aspects of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>We have both the essential Spirit and the economical Spirit.</S>
