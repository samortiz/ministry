   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>A Contrite Heart and a Contrite Spirit Being Related to the Conscience</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Psalm 51:17 speaks of a contrite heart, and Isaiah 57:15 and 66:2 speak of a contrite spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In what inner part are we contrite?</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>To be contrite is to exercise our conscience.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Both the contrite heart and the contrite spirit are related to the conscience.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>When we exercise our conscience to confess our sins, our heart is contrite and our spirit is also contrite.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>As we have seen, repentance is something in the mind; in Greek repentance means a change of mind.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>We have to have a change in mind and turn our mind to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Then after we repent, our confession follows.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Whereas repentance is in our mind, confession is a matter of our conscience.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Therefore, when we confess, we have both a contrite heart and a contrite spirit, because the conscience is a part both of the heart and of the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Our Conscience Being at the Gateway to Our Spirit</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>According to the Scriptures, the Lord comes into our spirit, but our spirit is enclosed within our heart.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The heart is the gateway the entrance and exit of the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Our heart must be open to the Lord in order for Him to come into our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>How can we open our heart?</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>We must repent and continue to repent in order to exercise our conscience.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Not only did we need to repent at the time we heard the gospel, but even after we are saved we have to repent continually.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>In the seven epistles in Revelation 2 and 3 the Lord demands that we repent 2:5, 16; 3:3, 19 .</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>To repent is to turn our mind, which is one door of the gateway of our heart.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>When we turn our mind and our mind is open, our confession follows.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>This is the exercise and opening of the conscience.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Then when we have true repentance and real confession, our emotion and will follow to make a decision for the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>In this way, the whole heart is exercised and open, and the Lord comes in through our heart into our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>However, many times after we are saved, we close our heart again and imprison the Lord in our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Therefore, we must repent again.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>We must exercise to turn our mind even more and then follow to exercise our conscience by confessing.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Then our emotion will be for the Lord, and our will follows to make a decision for the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>In this way the entire heart opens, and the way is paved for the Spirit to come in to fill us in our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>This shows us that the conscience is a very central matter, having very much to do with the heart and the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>According to the New Testament, a Christian's conscience is very important.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The apostle Paul said that he exercised himself to always have a conscience without offense toward God and men Acts 24:16 .</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>He lived in a good conscience before God all the time.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>He also said that the Christian life is a life of love out of a pure heart and out of a good conscience and out of unfeigned faith 1 Tim 1:5 .</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Both love and faith depend on a pure conscience.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Without a pure conscience it is hard to have love and faith.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Moreover, he said that if we thrust away a good conscience, we will become shipwrecked regarding the faith v. 19 . By this we can see how important the conscience is.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>THE GOVERNMENT OF THE CONSCIENCE</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Before the fall man lived in the presence of God and was directly under the government of God, so there was no need for the conscience.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>After the fall, however, man fell out of the presence of God into himself, and in losing the presence of God, he lost the government of God Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Therefore, man began to need his conscience as a government, a control.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>This is why the conscience came into function so manifestly after the fall.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>By the fall the conscience was developed very much, and it stepped in to govern human beings.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>This is why Bible students say that after the fall the second dispensation, the dispensation of the conscience, began.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>After the fall man was under the control, the government, the rule, of the conscience.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>This was a self-government.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>This, however, was not the end of the fall of man.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Following this was a second step, in which man fell from self-government.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Genesis 9:6 says, "Whoever sheds man's blood, / By man shall his blood be shed."</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>This indicates that since man was lawless, God put man under human government.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>After the second fall humans needed to be governed by others.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Consider today's Los Angeles; if we were to take the police and courts away, what kind of city would this be?</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>The entire fallen race of man is under human government.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>In school and at home there is a human government.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>I am ashamed to say that many in the church today still need a kind of human government.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>This is because man has fallen again and again.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>After the third dispensation, the dispensation of human government, came the dispensation of promise.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>God promised to come in to deliver people back.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>At that time, however, men could not understand what God meant by His promise, so He gave them the law.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Therefore, this was the dispensation of the law, which proved to man how much he needed God's salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>After this came the dispensation of grace.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Grace came to fulfill the promise.</S>
