   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>RELIGION OR THE SPIRIT?</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The book of Galatians starts negatively with the evil age of religion, and it closes positively with the human spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>We were formerly in the country of religion, but now we must remain in the new country of our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>We have been delivered out of religion, which was mostly in our mind, to the wonderful enjoyment of Christ in our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Religion has the doctrines, the regulations, the traditions, and the ordinances.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>But in our spirit we have the living Spirit as the reality of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>This is why, when a person stays in his spirit enjoying Christ as grace, he is in another country.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>He was in the mind, but now he is in his spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>He was in religion, but now he is enjoying Christ as his grace.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The book of Galatians clearly mentions these two countries of religion and our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>We may also call them two realms or two kinds of worlds.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>From the beginning of the Bible we can see these two sources in the garden.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>There were two trees: the tree of life, indicating God, and the tree of knowledge, signifying Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>We all know that religion came out of knowledge.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>It is an invention of the fallen mind.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Knowledge is in our mind.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>In Genesis 3, Satan got into the mind of man.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>This means that the tree of knowledge got into fallen man.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Later in Genesis we can see that many inventions came out of the fallen mind with the tree of knowledge.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The main invention that issued out of the fallen mind is religion.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>THE WORLD OF RELIGION</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Some may think that it is too much to say that the present evil age in Galatians 1:4 is religion.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>But if we understand this book according to the context, we see that the book itself defines this present evil age as religion.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The world in this book is religion.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Galatians 6:12-13 speaks clearly about circumcision, which is something religious.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Then verse 14 says, But God forbid that I should glory, save in the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ, by whom the world is crucified unto me, and I unto the world.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Many Christians quote this verse, but they have never realized that this verse is a continuation of the previous two verses.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Since the foregoing verses speak about religion, it is clear by the context that the world in verse 14 is religion.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Then verse 15 continues, For in Christ Jesus neither circumcision availeth any thing, nor uncircumcision, but a new creation.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>By the context of these verses, it is clear that in the book of Galatians both the present evil age and the world mean religion.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Religion to the Apostle Paul and to the early Christians was a strong world.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Therefore, they had to be delivered from that evil age.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>It is the same today.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Consider the Roman Catholic Church.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>It is very religious, yet it is so evil.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>It is an evil, religious world.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Many people need to be delivered from that evil religion, that evil world.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>THE MOST EVIL THING</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The most evil thing, according to Galatians, is to distract people from Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>God s will is to reveal Christ into us, to have Christ live in us, and to have Christ formed in us.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>This is God s purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Yet religion is something that distracts people from this purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>To human eyes it does not appear so evil, but to God s eyes it is the most evil thing.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>God s intention is to work Christ into us, but Satan s subtlety is to use religion to keep us away from Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>It appears good and cultured, yet religion severs more people from Christ than anything else.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>To visit the casinos in Las Vegas is undoubtedly to be severed from Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>But to be religious is considered as approved and commendable behavior.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Yet Paul says in Galatians 5 that to be religious is to be severed from Christ, to be fallen from grace.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>If we have God s point of view, we will see that anything that severs people from Christ is evil.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Even the most moral, ethical, and religious things are evil in the eyes of God, because they sever us from the indwelling Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Paul even tells us in this book that a certain kind of preaching is evil.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>But though we, or an angel from heaven, preach any other gospel unto you than that which we have preached unto you, let him be accursed Gal 1:8 .</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>This is not gambling, this is preaching.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Even the preaching of a certain kind of gospel is cursed in the eyes of God as a part of the present evil age.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>This is a part of the world to which Paul was crucified.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Paul had nothing to do with this kind of preaching, because now he had Christ revealed in him, living in him, and being formed in him.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>He only cared for the indwelling Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Praise the Lord that His grace is with our spirit!</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>If we stay in our mind, surely we will be religious, but when we turn to our spirit there is the rich enjoyment of Christ as grace.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>The tree of life is in our spirit, and the tree of knowledge is in our mind.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>This is the indwelling Christ in Galatians.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>He is now dwelling in our spirit to be our enjoyable grace.</S>
