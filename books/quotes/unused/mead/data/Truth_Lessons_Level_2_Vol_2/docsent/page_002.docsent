   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>TEXT</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The first group of historical figures in the Old Testament also forms the first group of figures in the Bible, God s entire holy Word.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The significance of this first group of historical figures is the essential significance of Genesis, the first book of the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The book of Genesis is the garden where every kind of seed of the divine revelation is sown.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>In this book the principal figures and historical events, whether positive or negative, all represent certain principles and pathways or have certain significances.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Therefore, they all have become allegories that have figurative meanings.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The first two figures are Adam and Eve.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>They were created by God as the first couple among the human race and as the first ancestors of all mankind; hence, in them the implications and significances are very profound and far-reaching.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>I. ADAM A. Declaring God</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Adam was created according to God s inward image and outward likeness Gen 1:26 .</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Therefore, he was God s image for the purpose of declaring God.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>God s image refers to the characteristics in His intrinsic nature.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The most prominent of the characteristics that are manifested in man are love, light, holiness, and righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>God created Adam according to His image, according to these virtues in His nature, that Adam might declare and express God through these virtues.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>God s likeness is the outward form in which He expressed Himself and was seen by men.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Even before God became flesh, He appeared to Abraham and to many others with such an outward form Gen 18:1-5; 32:24, 28-30; Josh 5:13-15; Judg.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>6:12, 14, 16-24; 13:9-10, 17-20 .</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>God created Adam s inward nature and outward body according to His own image and likeness, that Adam might have God s image and likeness.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>God did this in order that Adam might declare and express Him.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>However, what Adam had was only God s image and likeness; it was not God s intrinsic being.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Adam did not have God s life and nature within him.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>He was just like a man s photograph, which bears the image and likeness of a man but is without the life and nature of that man.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Therefore, Adam needed to receive God as his life and content so that his virtues could be filled with the very substance of God s love, light, holiness, and righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>In this way he would be able to reach the goal for which God created man; that is, he would be able to declare and express God.</S>
