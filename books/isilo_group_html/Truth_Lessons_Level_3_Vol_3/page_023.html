<h2 class="head1">TEXT</h2>
<p>We have seen how the believers experience and enjoy the divine dispensing of the Divine Trinity in the divine transformation for the divine conformation by being transformed, by being conformed to the image of God&rsquo;s firstborn Son, and by being conformed to Christ&rsquo;s death. In this lesson we will look at other aspects of the enjoyment of the divine dispensing.</p>
<h2 class="head1">IV. BY ENTERING THE HOLY OF HOLIES</h2>
<p>When the believers are conformed to the death of Christ, they are freed from many negative matters, including the old man, the flesh with its passions and its lusts, the practices of the body, the self, and the soul-life. The more the believers are freed from these things, the more they can go forward positively, passing through the outer veil and the inner veil to enter into the Holy of Holies.</p>
<p>Hebrews 10:19 says, &ldquo;Having therefore, brothers, boldness for entering the Holy of Holies in the blood of Jesus.&rdquo; The Holy of Holies today is in heaven, where the Lord Jesus is (9:12, 24). Although we are still on earth, we can enter into the Holy of Holies. The secret is our spirit, which is referred to in Hebrews 4:12. The very Christ who is in heaven is also in our spirit (2 Tim. 4:22). As the heavenly ladder (Gen. 28:12; John 1:51), He joins our spirit to heaven and brings heaven into our spirit. Hence, when we turn to our spirit, we enter into the Holy of Holies where we meet with God who is on the throne of grace.</p>
<p>After showing us the heavenly Christ who is within the veil, the book of Hebrews encourages us to enter within the veil (10:22; 6:19), where we can look away unto Him (12:2), consider Him (v. 3; 3:1), and enjoy direct contact with Him. Since He is within the veil, we need to enter within the veil so that we may see Him and consider Him to receive His infusion. When we turn to our spirit and exercise our spirit, we enter within the veil. There we participate in Christ&rsquo;s heavenly ministry and are saturated and permeated with the divine riches to make us the corporate reproduction of God&rsquo;s firstborn Son for His expression.</p>
<h2 class="head2">A. In the Blood of Jesus</h2>
<p>Hebrews 10:19 says us that we have boldness to enter into the Holy of Holies in the blood of Jesus. It is a tremendous thing to enter the Holy of Holies because the very God is sitting there on the throne of grace. In order to enter into such a place, we must have boldness, which we have by Christ&rsquo;s death and His blood. In the blood of Jesus we have boldness to enter into the Holy of Holies at any time, unlike the high priest in the Old Testament, who could enter only once a year.</p>
<h2 class="head2">B. Through a New and Living Way<br />
Initiated through the Rent Veil</h2>
<p>Hebrews 10:20 indicates that we enter into the Holy of Holies through &ldquo;a new and living way through the veil, that is, His flesh.&rdquo; The way into the Holy of Holies has been initiated. According to the Greek, the word <em>new</em> in this verse means &ldquo;recently opened.&rdquo; Through Christ&rsquo;s death on the cross, the way has been &ldquo;recently opened&rdquo; for us. The veil here is the second veil of the tabernacle (9:3). This veil, typifying the flesh of Christ, signifies the old creation, including us. On the veil were cherubim (Exo. 26:31), which signify the creatures (Ezek. 10:15). When the veil was rent, the cherubim were also rent, signifying that when the flesh of Christ, typified by the veil, was crucified, all the creatures also were crucified. According to Matthew 27:51, when the Lord Jesus died, the veil was rent from top to bottom, meaning that it was not rent by anyone on earth but by God above the heavens. The old creation has been slain, and a new and living way to enter into the Holy of Holies has been initiated. Through the rent veil of the flesh and in the blood of Jesus, we can enter into the Holy of Holies to contact God for our enjoyment. Not only so, the rent veil also implies that our old man was crucified with Christ (Rom. 6:6), giving us an open way to contact and enjoy God in our spirit as our life and life supply.</p>
<p>In the Old Testament age, only the high priest could enter into the Holy of Holies. He brought in the blood of the sin offering once a year and sprinkled it on the propitiation cover. That was the old way. Hebrews 10 indicates that in the New Testament age there is a new way into the Holy of Holies. This new way is not only for the high priest but for all believers; it is not by the blood of bulls and goats but through the blood of Jesus; it is not through a veil that has not been rent but through a veil that has been rent. Today we can go through the rent veil, enter the Holy of Holies, and come directly before the throne of grace.</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_022.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_024.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Truth Lessons, Level 3, Vol. 3 &nbsp; pg 23</div><br></body></html>
