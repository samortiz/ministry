   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>SERVICE THAT ISSUES</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>IN SACRIFICES OFFERED TO GOD</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Paul wrote Romans 12 in a marvelous way.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>First, he considered us as priests, then servants, and then slaves.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>If we could not be a slave, we could never be a good servant.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>And if we could not be a good servant, we could never be a proper priest.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>As a slave we know nothing concerning rank or position.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>We only know to labor.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>We labor not as a priest or a servant, but as a slave having no freedom and no rights.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>It is easy for us to think that a deacon or deaconess just serves people like the sisters who prepare the Lord s table.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>To make the bread and prepare the wine is wonderful and necessary, but that is not something that we could offer to God as a sacrifice.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Our service must result in a sacrifice offered to God.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>To clean the hall, vacuum the carpet, and arrange the chairs are all needed.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>But these things are not qualified in themselves to be a sacrifice we offer to God.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Our kind of chair arranging and vacuuming should be something that issues in some sacrifices for us to offer to God.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>If we come to arrange the chairs in a pure and humble spirit and others observe, they will sense Christ being ministered to them.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Although there are different ways to arrange the chairs, this kind of chair arranging results in a sacrifice offered to God.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>If we are such a person who arranges the chairs, we would pray for the Lord to bless this chair and whoever sits there that this one may contact Him.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Not only so, the deacons service is spoken of as helps by Paul.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>In 1 Corinthians 12:28 Paul says that God placed some in the church, including the universal church and all the local churches.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>In the church God placed apostles, prophets, teachers, and so forth.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Then Paul mentions helps and administrations.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Helps refer to the deacons and deaconesses service.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>When we serve, we render help to others.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Administrations refer to the elders management of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>We must realize that Paul purposely mentioned helps before administrations because there is no thought of rank here.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Such a thought of who is higher or lower, first or second, is devilish.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>This is a secular thought in the world.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>In the church, however, there is no rank, no first and no second.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>This word helps implies a great deal.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>We may help the saints in a hundred ways.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>To go and make a meal for the saints when they are sick is a help.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>To do something for the saints to fill up their lack is also a help.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>For example, when we go to make a meal for a family, and our spirit is right, pure, high, and living, the entire family will sense that we are ministering Christ to them.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>They receive more than just a meal.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>This is a spiritual life supply because we ministered Christ through our cooking.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>This kind of help surely results in a sacrifice because through cooking, Christ was ministered to this family.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Then we would surely begin to pray, Lord, gain the whole family.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Gain each one and gain more ground in the children.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Lord, make each one a young person loving You that their life would be for You during this entire age.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>We must realize that while we are praying this way, we are presenting the whole family as a sacrifice to God.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>In the Old Testament the priest s main function is to offer sacrifices from the flock or from the herd.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>But according to the New Testament, Christ must be the first sacrifice offered, then the members of Christ, the corporate Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>We minister Christ to others so that they may become living members of the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Then we may present these members to God as sacrifices.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Eventually in this way whatever we present to the Lord is a kind of New Testament sacrifice which is either Christ Himself or the members of His Body as a corporate Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>As a result, all kinds of helps will issue in the building up of the members of the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>This should be the fruit of our service.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>A number of years ago a dear brother offered to repair my car.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>How much Christ was ministered to me by that repair work!</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>He worked on that car, but I received Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>He was there not only for Christ but with Christ.</S>
