   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Such a believer tends to secretly feel sorry for others because he thinks they do not have his kind of experience.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>He considers his own happiness as an excellent thing and pities his brothers and sisters for not being able to comprehend it!</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>When he sees them calmly serving the Lord, he invariably concludes that their lives are boring.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Only a life like his, full of God's happiness, can truly be the highest life.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>It seems that the other believers are merely walking in the valley, while he alone soars on the mountain top.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>However, does this kind of experience last?</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Can a believer feel this way every day and be happy all his life?</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Many believers do not have this experience for long.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>What grieves the believer the most is that in less than a month or two generally speaking , the happiness which he most desires suddenly vanishes.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>One morning when he wakes up as usual to read the Bible, the former taste is gone.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>He may pray, but after uttering a few phrases he runs out of words.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>He feels that something is missing.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>In the past it seemed that other believers were lagging behind him spiritually; now he feels just like one of them.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>His heart seems to have cooled off considerably.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The feeling of a warm fire burning within has disappeared, and he has no idea where it has gone.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>He does not feel the Lord's presence or His nearness; the Lord seems very far from him.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>He does not even seem to know where the Lord is.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>When he suffers, he feels the suffering, not the happiness.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>When he preaches, it is no longer enjoyable.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>He utters a few sentences and finds himself with no desire to carry on.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>In short, everything seems dark, dry, cold, and dead.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>It appears as though the believer has been left by the Lord in the tomb with nothing to comfort his heart.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The lasting joy which he hoped to retain is now lost.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>During such a period, the believer will think that he has sinned, and that God has forsaken him.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>If he has not sinned, why is the Lord no longer with Him?</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>He may search his recent conduct to determine where he offended the Lord, hoping that upon confessing, the Lord will come back, fill him anew, and restore the intimacy and happiness.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>However, when he examines himself, he cannot find any particular sin; everything is generally the same as it was before.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>It seems that if his present condition caused the Lord to forsake him, why did his past condition not cause the Lord to forsake him?</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>If he has not sinned, why did the Lord depart from him?</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>He does not have the answer.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>He simply assumes that he has offended the Lord in some way and that the Lord has forsaken him.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Satan also accuses him, making him believe that he has sinned.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Hence, he cries for forgiveness before the Lord, hoping to recover what he has lost.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>This kind of prayer, however, is ineffective.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Not only is he unable to recover what he thinks is lost, but day by day he feels drier and colder.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Whatever he does is not enjoyable.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Sometimes his actions are even void of any taste.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Even his prayers are forced.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Previously, he could continuously pray for several hours; now he can pray only for a few minutes, and even they are a strain.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>As far as his feelings are concerned, his prayers are not even prayers at all.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>His Bible reading is just as dry.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Previously, the more he read the more enjoyable it was; now the Holy Book seems like a field of stones that yields nothing.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>He finds no pleasure in any of his dealings either with men or matters.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Although he obligingly does what is expected of him because he is a Christian, everything is dry and a strain.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Consequently, many Christians fall back.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>They often know that this is God's will, but they have fallen into such a grievous state that they do not care.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>They often neglect their duties because they have grown cold.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Their conduct, which changed when they were living in their feelings, reverts back to its former state.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Previously they felt sorry for those who did not behave as they did; now they are no different from them.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>They are just as talkative, frivolous, full of jest, and fun-loving as before.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Although they experienced a change once, it is gone.</S>
