   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>By Standing on the Unique Ground of Oneness Locally</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The living of the church life in a locality must be by standing on the unique ground of oneness locally.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Locally, we must stand firm on the unique ground of oneness.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The standing of the church should be the ground of genuine oneness.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>This oneness is on the ground of locality where we live.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Hence, there can be only one church in one locality Rev 1:11 .</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>This is our definite and firm standing, and we must hold to this firm standing.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>By Keeping the Unique Oneness of the Body of Christ Universally</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The living of the church life in a locality also includes the keeping of the unique oneness of the Body of Christ universally Eph 4:3 .</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>We are not only standing on the unique ground of oneness locally but also keeping the fellowship with all the churches around the globe.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>If we do not fellowship with all the churches universally, we are sectarian.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Some of the saints may feel that they cannot have the church life with other saints in a certain locality.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>They may realize that to form another group in that locality would be a division.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Therefore, they may go to another city in order to separate themselves from the other believers.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Actually, to go to another place in this way is still something of division, making themselves a local sect instead of a local church.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The reason such a meeting in another locality would be divisive is because the fellowship is not universal with all the churches on the globe.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The Body of Christ is one, universally expressed in every locality around the globe.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Locally, we need to stand on the local ground; universally, we need to maintain the universal fellowship in order to keep the unique oneness of the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>SAVED BY THE CRUSHING OF SATAN UNDER OUR FEET Satan Being Crushed under Our Feet That the Kingdom of God May Be Brought In</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>We are saved in the life of Christ from the aerial power of darkness, by destroying Satan Rom 16:20; Eph 6:12 .</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>We need to be saved from the power in the air; this power is Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Romans 16:20 says, "Now the God of peace will soon crush Satan under your feet.''</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Today, Satan should not be in the air above us; he should be under our feet Eph 1:22 .</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>When we are in the proper church life, Satan is under our feet.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>In Matthew 16:18 the Lord Jesus said, "And on this rock I will build My church, and the gates of Hades shall not prevail against it.''</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>If we would overcome the power of Satan, we must be built up, that is, we must have the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The built up church can overcome the power of Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>In the proper church life, Satan is crushed under our feet so that the kingdom of God may be brought in. The church life in a locality is the kingdom of God Rom 14:17 , even the kingdom life.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>This kingdom is in contrast with the power in the air, the power of Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>By the God of Peace Being Our Portion</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>In the church life Satan is crushed under our feet by the God of peace being our portion Rom 16:20 .</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>When we enjoy our God as the God of peace, He has the opportunity to destroy His enemy, Satan, and He crushes him under our feet that we may partake more of His fullness in abundance.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>With the Grace of Our Lord Jesus Being Our Enjoyment</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>When the enemy Satan is crushed under our feet in the church life, we enjoy Christ as our grace, our life supply.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Peace is God Himself for us to remain in, and grace is Christ Himself for us to enjoy.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>When we live a proper church life and Satan is crushed under our feet, we remain in God as peace and enjoy Christ as grace.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>What a wonderful life this is!</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>This is the blessed conclusion of the book of Romans, issuing from God's full salvation, consisting of His redemption through Christ's death and His saving in Christ's life.</S>
