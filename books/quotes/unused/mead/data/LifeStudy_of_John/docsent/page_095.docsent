   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>7.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Spotted by the False One</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>However, in the picture of the church life portrayed here, there is something negative the black spot of Judas 12:4 .</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Even among the twelve apostles chosen by the Lord Jesus, there was Judas, who was a black spot.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Throughout all the centuries, there has always been a black spot in the churches.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The glorious church life is always spotted by some false one.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Nevertheless, it is quite comforting that even in the little church established directly by the Lord Jesus Himself, there was such a black spot.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Judas cared for money; he loved money much more than he loved the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Therefore, he did not appreciate what Mary did to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>He thought that it was a waste.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Judas pretended that he cared for the poor.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Actually that was not true.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>He cared only for money.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>In the church life there is almost always such a black spot.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Mammon, the embodiment of the evil one, is the real rival of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The failure to overcome mammon is so often seen in the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Judas s love of mammon gave Satan the ground to enter into him and take him over 13:2 .</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Instead of loving the Lord, he betrayed Him!</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>It is a shame that this is often repeated in the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>8.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Persecuted by Religion</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The church life is persecuted by religion.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The Jewish priests took counsel that they might kill Lazarus 12:10 who testified to the resurrection power of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>He was an evident and strong testimony of the Lord s resurrection power.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>This stirred up the religious people s hatred and persecution.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>It is the same today.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The stronger we are in bearing testimony of the Lord as life to us, the more the religious people will be provoked to anger with us.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>9.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Being a Test and Exposing People</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The church life is a test.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>It exposes people 12:6, 10 .</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>It exposes where a person s heart is and what his attitude is toward the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Without the church people s heart and attitude toward the Lord could never be exposed.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>As long as there is a church, everything comes to the surface.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>If there were no church in your locality, the hearts and the attitudes of men toward the Lord would be hidden and concealed.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>However, in the church life every man s heart is exposed.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The church exposes the hidden thoughts of man s heart concerning the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>10.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Bringing In Many Believers</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>In verse 11 we see that many believed because of the testimony of Lazarus.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The living testimony of the church always causes people to believe in the Lord and brings people into the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The increase of the church must depend upon the church s living testimony, not only upon the preaching of the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The best preaching of the gospel that makes the church to increase is our living testimony of experiencing the Lord as our life.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>When we consider all of these aspects of the church life, it is not too much to say that the house at Bethany was an early figure of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>We do see the church life there.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>C. The Lord Being a Test to People</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Not only is the church a test and an exposure of people, but the Lord Himself is a test to all the people around Him.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The chief priests and the Pharisees conspired to kill Him 11:47, 53, 57 .</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>We see a different attitude in Simon the leper, for he prepared the house for Him Matt 26:6 .</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Martha served Him, Lazarus testified of Him, Mary loved Him, and Judas was about to betray Him.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Many others believed in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>All of these varying attitudes were shown toward the same Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Where are you?</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Are you trying to kill Him, or are you serving Him, testifying of Him, loving Him, or being seduced to betray Him?</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>You can never be neutral.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>You must do something.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>The very Lord in His church is a test to everyone around Him.</S>
