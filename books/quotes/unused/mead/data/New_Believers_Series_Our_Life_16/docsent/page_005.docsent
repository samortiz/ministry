   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Romans 6 says that God has crucified us with Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>But Romans 7 tells us of one person who is still trying to will.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Even though God has crucified him, he still wills to do good.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>He cannot die, yet he cannot do good either.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>If he would say, "Lord, I cannot make it, and I do not believe I will make it.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>I cannot do good, and I will not will to do good," everything would be fine.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>But Romans 7 tells us that man is not willing to die.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>God has already crucified our old man, but we are unwilling to die; we still exercise our will to do good.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Today many Christians are still trying when they know very well that they cannot make it.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Nothing can be done about these Christians.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Suppose there is a person who cannot be patient.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>What can he do?</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>He may try his best to be patient by himself.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Whenever he prays he asks for patience.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Even while he is working he thinks about patience.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>But the more he tries to be patient, the less patient he becomes.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Instead of trying to be patient, he should say, "Lord, You have already crucified this impatient person.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>I am impatient.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>I do not want to be patient and do not intend to be patient."</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>This is the way to victory.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The Lord has crucified you.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>You should say simply, "Amen."</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>He has crucified you, and it is futile for you to try to be patient by yourself.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>God knows you cannot make it.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>This is why He crucified you.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Even though you still try to be patient, God considers you hopeless.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>He has even crucified you.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>It is a great mistake to think you can make it.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>It is also a great mistake to try to live the Christian life.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>God already knows that you cannot make it; the only way He has for you is crucifixion.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Even though you think that you can make it, God says that you cannot make it and that you should die.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>How foolish it is to still make resolutions and to struggle!</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>God knows that you cannot make it, and it would be well with you if you agreed with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>God knows that you deserve to die.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>If you would say, "Amen, I will die," everything would be well.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The cross is God's assessment of us.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>In God's view we cannot make it.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>If we could make it, God would not have crucified us.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>He knows that the only way for us is death.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>This is why He crucified us.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>If we saw things the same way God sees them, everything would be settled.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Brothers and sisters, God must bring us to the point where we accept His verdict.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Here we see two aspects: First, Christ died, and we were crucified.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>This is something God has done.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Second, we have to acknowledge this fact; we need to say, "Amen."</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>These two sides must work together before God's work can take effect on us.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>If we constantly frustrate Him by trying to do good and be patient and humble, the work of Christ will have no effect on us.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Our resolution to be humble or to be patient only makes things worse.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Instead, we should bow down our head and say, "Lord, You have said that I am crucified, and I will say the same thing; You have said that I am useless, and I will say the same thing; You have said that I cannot be patient, and I will no longer try to be patient; You have said that I cannot be humble, and I will no longer try to be humble.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>This is what I am.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>It is useless for me to try to make any further resolutions.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>I am only fit to remain on the cross."</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>If we did this, Christ would live Himself out of us!</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>We should not think that this is a difficult thing to do.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Every brother and sister should learn this lesson after he or she is saved.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>From the beginning we must learn not to live.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Instead, we should let the Lord live.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>The basic problem is that many Christians have not given up on themselves.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>They still try to solve their problems themselves.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>The Lord Jesus has already given up on them, but they are still struggling and trying to come up with ways to live.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>They stumble again and again, only to rise up to try again and again.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>They sin again and again, only to make more and more resolutions.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>They have not given up on themselves.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>The day will come when God grants mercy to them and opens their eyes.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>On that day they will see that as God considered them hopeless, they should consider themselves hopeless as well.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Since God has pronounced death to be the only way, they also should pronounce death as the only way.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Only then will they come to God and confess, "You have crucified me, and I do not want to live anymore.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>I have been crucified with Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>From now on, it is no longer I who live, but it is Christ who lives in me."</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>For years we have been so wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>We have committed so many sins and have been bound by so much weakness, pride, and temper.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>It is about time that we give up on ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>We should come to the Lord and say, "I have done enough; nothing has worked.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>I give up.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>You take over!</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>I have been crucified on the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>From now on live in my place!"</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>This is the meaning of "it is no longer I who live, but it is Christ who lives in me."</S>
