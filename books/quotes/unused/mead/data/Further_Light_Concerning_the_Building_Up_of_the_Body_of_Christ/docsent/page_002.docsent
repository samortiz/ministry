   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Amen.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>The fellowship in this book is a continuation of the fellowship in recent books concerning the Body of Christ as an organism and concerning the building up of the Body of Christ organically see The Body of Christ, The Organism of the Triune God in the Organic Union of His Divine Trinity, and The Building Up of the Body of Christ published by Living Stream Ministry .</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Since I began to speak on this subject, the light has come continually.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>This is why I have entitled this book Further Light concerning the Building Up of the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Some of this further light is in 1 Corinthians.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>The Lord showed me the very striking, central, and crucial point of this book.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>The crucial point of this book is speaking for the Lord in chapter fourteen.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Chapter fourteen of 1 Corinthians is the issue of the entire book.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>It is wrong to think that only a pastor, a minister, or even a leading brother can speak for the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>All of the saints can speak for the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Paul says in 1 Corinthians 14:31 that we all can prophesy, that is, speak for the Lord, one by one.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>As long as you are a saved believer, you must be a speaker that speaks the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>THE DEFINITION OF PROPHESYING</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>IN 1 CORINTHIANS 14</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Prophesying in 1 Corinthians 14 is not predicting but speaking for the Lord, speaking forth the Lord, and speaking the Lord into others, ministering dispensing the Lord to others.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>What a precious and valuable thing it is to minister, to dispense, Christ into others.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>We need to learn to speak Christ, dispensing Him into others.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>This is proven by the words for building up, encouragement, and consolation in verse 3; by the words convicted and judged in verse 24; and by the words all may learn and all be encouraged in verse 31.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Speaking the Lord into people builds them up, encourages them, and consoles them.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>When we speak for the Lord, others are convicted and judged.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>The fact that all may learn and all be encouraged also shows that this is not predicting but speaking for the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Speaking the Lord forth into others enables them to learn something and be encouraged.</S>
