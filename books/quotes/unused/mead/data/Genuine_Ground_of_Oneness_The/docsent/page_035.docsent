   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>EXALTED, MINGLED, PLANTED,</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>AND FLOURISHING</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In Psalm 92 we see even more aspects of the enjoyment in the house of God.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Verse 10 says, "But my horn shalt thou exalt like the horn of a wild ox: I shall be anointed with fresh oil" Heb .</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>In the church life we can be as strong as a wild ox.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Furthermore, we have two horns that are exalted.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>This is possible only in the house of God.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Moreover, in God's house we are anointed, even mingled Heb , with fresh oil.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Outwardly we have two exalted horns, and inwardly we are mingled with fresh oil.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Every-one in the church life can have horns like a wild ox and be mingled with fresh oil.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Many who have come into the church life have experienced their horn being exalted.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Before we came to dwell in the church, we were low and frequently defeated.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>But when we came into God's dwelling place, we sensed that our horn was exalted over our enemy.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Furthermore, we sensed that we were mingled with fresh oil.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>In God's house we daily have the sense of being mingled with fresh oil.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Day by day we sense something very fresh this is the oil that is being mingled with us.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The reason we are fresh is that we are mingled with fresh oil.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Verse 13 says, "Those that be planted in the house of the Lord shall flourish in the courts of our God."</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>We should not simply dwell in the Lord's house; we should also be planted there.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Have you been planted in the church life?</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Those who leave the church have not been planted in the church.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Once you have been planted in the house of the Lord, you cannot leave it.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>If we have been planted in the house of the Lord, we shall flourish in the courts of God.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>This is a very meaningful expression.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>We are in both the house and the courts.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Our root is set in the house, but our branches reach out into the courts.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The flourishing is not mainly with the root; it is with the branches.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Verse 14 continues, "They shall still bring forth fruit in old age; they shall be full of sap and green" Heb .</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Although I am an elderly person, I am more fruitful today than I was years ago.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>As this verse says, I am still bringing forth fruit in old age, and I am full of sap and green.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>We may flourish to such an extent that even when we are old we bring forth fruit.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>This is possible only in the church as the house of God.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>If we are planted in the divine habitation, we shall flourish in the courts of our God, bring forth fruit even in old age, and be full of sap and green.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The longer we dwell here, the younger we become.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>This is the result of dwelling in the house of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>These verses from Psalm 92 indicate that the unique place of God's choice is not only the proper place to offer sacrifice and to worship God.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>It also is the proper place for the growth in life.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The proper Christian life is a life that is planted in the church and that flourishes in the courts of the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Here in the church life we have the genuine growth in life.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>As we grow, we are filled with sap and green.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>As a result, spontaneously we are holy, spiritual, and victorious.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Who is more holy, spiritual, and victorious than those who are planted in the house of God?</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>No one can surpass them in these respects.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Those who dwell in the Lord's house have no need to seek holiness, spirituality, or victory.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>These attributes spontaneously become theirs because they are planted in the church life and are flourishing in the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Because they are full of sap and green, they are automatically holy, spiritual, and victorious.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>This indicates that the proper way for us to have the Christian life is to be in the normal church life.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Apart from the proper church life, we cannot be holy, spiritual, or victorious.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>These attributes are found in the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>When we are planted in the church life, we shall flourish with holiness, spirituality, and victory.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>As a result, we shall worship God not merely in an objective way, but with a subjective, dispensational worship that comes out of the enjoyment of Christ in the presence of God.</S>
