   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>I am crucified with Christ; and it is no longer I who live, but it is Christ who lives in me; and the life which I now live in the flesh I live in faith, the faith of the Son of God Gal 2:20.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>I live, you also shall live John 14:19.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The God-allotted faith 2 Pet 1:1: Equally precious in quality, not in quantity to all the believers.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>In the righteousness of our God and Savior, Jesus Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Not to think more highly of himself than he ought to think, but to think so as to be sober-minded, as God has apportioned to each a measure of faith Rom 12:3.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>By grace you have been saved through faith, and this not of yourselves; it is the gift of God both salvation and faith are of the gift of God Eph 2:8.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>I with you may be encouraged among you through the faith which is in one another, both yours and mine Rom 1:12.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Now there abide faith, hope, love, these three faith ranks first 1 Cor 13:13.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>In this message we want to see six more crucial points related to the crystallization of the faith of the believers .</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>R. The Linking Faith</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The first crucial point is the linking faith.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>We have spoken about this to a certain extent, but we want to go into more depth here.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Actually, faith has different stages.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>In the first section of our crystallization-study on faith, we saw that faith comes from the hearing of the word Rom 10:17 .</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>That is the initial stage of faith.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>When we were sinners, one day under God s sovereignty we heard the preaching of the gospel, that is, the word of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Through that hearing of the word, faith came into us.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>This faith brought us into a life union with Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>This union is a kind of linking.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The electricity in a building is a very good illustration of linking.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The installment of the electricity into the building is the first stage.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Then from that day, this installed electricity continues in this building.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>In like manner, when we heard the gospel, we repented, and something happened to us.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>That was the installation of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>We had the Spirit installed into us through the hearing of the word.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>We all received the Spirit in this way.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Now this Spirit, or this faith, which has been installed into us, stays within us and grows.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>After electricity has been installed into a certain building, there is a current going on.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>You can either stop it or use it all the time.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Also, when we were saved, the linking faith entered into us, and it remains in us.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The faith through which we were saved became a linking faith within us.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>This is not just in the initial stage, but also in the progressing stage.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>In a building in which electricity has been installed in the initial stage, there is a current of electricity going on in the progressing stage.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>We are like the building.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>We have the faith, the initial faith, produced in us.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>It remains in us and goes on all the time, unless we stop it.</S>
