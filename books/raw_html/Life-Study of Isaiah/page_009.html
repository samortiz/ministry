<H2 CLASS=HEAD3>10. Some of the People of Israel<br>Rising Early in the Morning That They May Run<br>after Liquor and Lingering into the Evening<br>That Wine May Inflame Them</H2><P>Some of the people of Israel rose early in the morning that they might run after liquor and lingered into the evening that wine might inflame them. They amused themselves with lyre, lute, tambourine, flute, and wine in their banquets, not considering what had been done by Jehovah nor regarding the work of His hands (5:11-12). We should consider ourselves in the light of this word. How do we behave ourselves in the morning and in the evening?</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>11. Some among the People of Israel<br>Drawing Iniquity with Ropes<br>of Vanity and Sin as with Cart Ropes</H2><P>Some among the people of Israel drew iniquity with ropes of vanity and sin as with cart ropes (5:18). They went so far as to ridicule Jehovah by saying, "He should hurry up;/He should hasten His work,/So that we may see it;/And the counsel of the Holy One of Israel/Should draw near and happen,/So that we may know it!" (v. 19). These evil, insulting words indicate that these people did not have any fear of God. They did not even believe in God; they had become atheists.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>12. Some of the People of Israel<br>Calling Good Evil, and Evil Good</H2><P>Some of the people of Israel called good evil, and evil good (5:20). They made darkness light, and light darkness. They also made bitterness sweetness, and sweetness bitterness. They turned everything upside down.</P>
