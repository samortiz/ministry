   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER TEN PREACHING THE GOSPEL AS THE ISSUE OF LIFE IN THE CHURCH Scripture Reading: Phil 1:5-7, 18-21, 27; John 15:4-5, 8, 12; 17:21; 2:23 3:3</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The book of Philippians shows us that the church in Philippi was a church that always bore the gospel as their responsibility.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In the New Testament there are a number of Epistles, but only Philippians deals with the preaching of the gospel in such a clear way.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>We do not have such a clear mention of the gospel in Romans, 1 and 2 Corinthians, Galatians, Ephesians, Colossians, or any of the others.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>What is mentioned in 1 Timothy is not as clear as what is mentioned in Philippians.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In addition, all Bible students agree that the book of Philippians is a book on the experience of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>There is not another book that deals as much with the experience of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>If we read this book carefully, we will see that the first chapter tells us Christ is life within us that we may live by Him and live Him out.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The second chapter tells us that Christ is the example set up for us.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The third chapter tells us that Christ is the mark of the goal, and the fourth chapter tells us that Christ is the secret.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Such a short book is very profound and prevailing in the experience of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>PREACHING THE GOSPEL BY THE EXPERIENCE OF CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Although Philippians is mainly on the experience of Christ, it also deals with the gospel preaching of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>This shows us that the preaching of the gospel is related to the experience of Christ and is in the experience of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>At the beginning of chapter one Paul says that the preaching of the gospel is a good work begun by the Lord and that He will complete this work until the day of Christ Jesus vv.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>5-6 .</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>At the end of this chapter, he speaks of striving together fighting as one, not individually but shoulder to shoulder along with the faith of the gospel v. 27 . In verses 18 through 21 Paul says, "What then? Only that in every way, whether in pretense or in truthfulness, Christ is announced; and in this I rejoice; yes, and I will rejoice; for I know that for me this will turn out to salvation through your petition and the bountiful supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ, according to my earnest expectation and hope that in nothing I will be put to shame, but with all boldness, as always, even now Christ will be magnified in my body, whether through life or through death.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>For to me, to live is Christ and to die is gain."</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>According to the whole context, the proper way to preach the gospel is to live out Christ and magnify Christ in our body.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>This is not merely to preach by words, and not even to preach by miracles, but to preach by a life which is Christ Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Chapter fifteen of the Gospel of John is on life, while chapter seventeen indicates the building.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Verses 4 and 5 of chapter fifteen say, "Abide in Me and I in you.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>As the branch cannot bear fruit of itself unless it abides in the vine, so neither can you unless you abide in Me. I am the vine; you are the branches.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>He who abides in Me and I in him, he bears much fruit; for apart from Me you can do nothing."</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Verse 8 says "In this is My Father glorified, that you bear much fruit and so you will become My disciples," and verse 12 says, "This is My commandment, that you love one another even as I have loved you."</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>In chapter seventeen, verse 21 speaks of the building: "That they all may be one; even as You, Father, are in Me and I in You, that they also may be in Us."</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Then it speaks of the result, the issue: "That the world may believe that You have sent Me."</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Chapter fifteen speaks of fruit-bearing through abiding in Christ, and chapter seventeen speaks of the world believing through the oneness of the believers.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Our oneness in Christ is the strongest testimony.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>It is through this that the people in the world realize something of the salvation of Christ; then they believe that Christ is the very One sent by God.</S>
