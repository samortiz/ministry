[1]  CHAPTER ONE A PICTURE OF THE ENTIRE SCRIPTURES Scripture Reading: Gen 2:7-12, 16-17, 21-24; John 1:4; 4:10, 13-14; 7:38-39; Exo 28:9-11, 17-20; 26:29; 1 Cor 3:9, 12; 2 Cor 4:7; Eph 5:31-32; Rev 21:2-3, 9-12, 14, 21-23; 22:1-2
[2]  In this introductory chapter, with the help of the Lord s grace, I wish to point out a wonderful picture that is in the entire Scriptures.
[3]  To do this, we will consider all the Scriptures from the very beginning to the very end. This picture, which has been drawn by God Himself in His Word, reveals to us what is in His mind and what He is seeking.
[4]  The Scriptures also show us the significance of gold, bdellium, and onyx stone.
[5]  At a certain time, the Lord asked His people to build a dwelling place for Him and for His service.
[6]  Writing that the foundation of the church is Christ Himself v. 11 , Paul tells us that we, being the co-workers of God, are now working on the building of God v. 9 . The church, composed of the Lord s people, is the dwelling of God.
[7]  In the previous chapter we saw the picture that God has presented to us throughout the Scriptures.
[8]  According to the picture in the Scriptures, God is seeking for a group of men of clay to be transformed into His image, that is, transformed into something precious to Him, and to be built together as a living organism to be the Body of Christ 1 Cor 3:9, 12; 1 Pet 2:5; Eph 4:16 .
[9]  In the same way that we do not hesitate to say that this is tea, we who have Christ in us and Christ mingled with us should not hesitate to say that we are Christ cf.
[10]  Having a clearer understanding of the three parts of man, we can now consider into which of these three parts the Lord Jesus has come.
[11]  When the Lord Jesus entered into us at the time of our regeneration, He came into our spirit.
[12]  In this verse we see that the two spirits the divine Spirit and the human spirit work together and that the Spirit of God works in our spirit.
[13]  This is possible because although we have Christ indwelling our spirit, we do not have Christ in the organ of our soul, and the functions of our soul have not yet been transformed.
[14]  CHAPTER THREE THE TRANSFORMATION OF THE SOUL Scripture Reading: 2 Cor 3:17-18; Rom 12:2; Eph 4:23; Rom 8:6; 1 Cor 2:14-16; 2 Cor 4:16
[15]  In this chapter, we want to continue our fellowship concerning the Lord s transformation work within us.
[16]  But we all with unveiled face, beholding and reflecting like a mirror the glory of the Lord, are being transformed into the same image from glory to glory, even as from the Lord Spirit.
[17]  If we are transformed in our spirit but not in our soul, that means that although we have Christ as life in our spirit, we do not have much of Christ in our soul.
[18]  When we consider matters, we will consider them as the Lord does; when we love or hate, we will love or hate as Christ does; and when we choose, we will choose as the Lord does and give up and reject what the Lord gives up and rejects.
[19]  Regrettably, the typical Christian is transformed in his spirit but remains untransformed in his soul.
[20]  In a great many believers, there are scarcely any signs that Christ has entered into their mind, emotion, and will.
[21]  Although we can all say with assurance that at present we have the Spirit of Christ in our spirit, not many of us can say that we have the mind of Christ in our mind, the emotion of Christ in our emotion, and the will of Christ in our will.
[22]  We must all practice this fellowship and learn to apply Christ.
[23]  CHAPTER FOUR THE RENEWING OF THE MIND Scripture Reading: Gal 4:19; Rom 12:2; Eph 4:17-24
[24]  In this chapter we go on to consider the renewing of the mind.
[25]  In the previous chapters we saw that in our Christian life we are transformed gradually into the Lord s image 2 Cor 3:18 .
[26]  Until we have been regenerated by the Lord coming into our spirit to be our life, the image we share with God remains superficial.
[27]  Consequently, when we think, we will have the mind of Christ, when we love, we will have the love of Christ, and when we decide, we will have the will of Christ.
[28]  Whether or not Christ is formed in us and we are transformed in our soul depends on at least three things.
[29]  When we discover that our thinking is not the Lord s thinking and that our mind is not His mind, we will give up our thinking and be adjusted by the Lord s mind.
[30]  If this is the state of our relationship with the Lord, not only will we fail to be renewed in our mind; our mind will become increasingly independent of the Lord, and we will shut the Lord out of our mind.
[31]  Many of you have learned many Christian teachings and doctrines.
[32]  The burden in my heart in these messages, however, is to fellowship with you about definite ways in which you can experience the things you have learned.
[33]  To learn Christ does not mean that we imitate Him; it means that we, within whom Christ dwells, have Christ as our life in everything that we do.
[34]  But you did not so learn Christ, if indeed you have heard Him and have been taught in Him as the reality is in Jesus, that you put off, as regards your former manner of life, the old man, which is being corrupted according to the lusts of the deceit, and that you be renewed in the spirit of your mind and put on the new man, which was created according to God in righteousness and holiness of the reality.
[35]  In this chapter we come to Romans 7 and 8 to see a matter that is both basic and important to our spiritual life four laws and three lives.
[36]  For what I work out, I do not acknowledge; for what I will, this I do not practice; but what I hate, this I do.
[37]  For I delight in the law of God according to the inner man, but I see a different law in my members, warring against the law of my mind and making me a captive to the law of sin which is in my members.
[38]  Now we must go on to consider the three lives.
[39]  Let us consider the life of Satan and the law of sin in greater detail.
[40]  Implied in Paul s thought in Romans 7 and 8 is the thought that we should forget about the law of God, give up on the law of good within ourselves, and simply remain in fellowship with the Lord, for only our fellowship and contact with Him in our spirit will allow the strongest law, the law of life, to operate.
[41]  CHAPTER SIX GOD S DELIVERANCE IN THE SPIRIT Scripture Reading: Rom 5:18-19, 21; 6:3-11, 14; 7:4-6, 8-11, 14-24; 8:1-11, 26-30, 16
[42]  Paul s Epistle to the Romans can be divided into several parts.
[43]  When we heard these glad tidings, the Holy Spirit worked within us and imparted faith into us, causing us to believe in Christ s redeeming death and receive Christ as our Savior Rom 10:17, 14 .
[44]  When we believed into Christ, we were justified by God Acts 13:39 through faith in the Lord Jesus Christ, who died on the cross to redeem us from the condemnation of God s law.
[45]  In principle, if we simply live in the Holy Spirit, we will be conformed to the image of Christ and transformed into the likeness of Christ, and we will manifest Christ in our daily living Rom 8:29; 2 Cor 3:18; Phil 1:20 .
[46]  We are redeemed and justified by God, yet if there is the redemption and justification of God and nothing more, God remains outside of us.
[47]  This is why at the end of the second section of Romans, we find the phrases Christ is in you, the Spirit of God dwells in you, and the Spirit of the One who raised Jesus from the dead dwells in you 8:10, 9, 11 .
[48]  When Christ delivers us, the God who redeemed us is no longer only objective to us.
[49]  If we are going to realize the deliverance of God, we must be in the Spirit, know the law of the Spirit of life, know how to walk according to the mingled spirit, and know how to cooperate with the Spirit 8:2, 4-6, 14 .
[50]  Whereas in Adam we inherit sin, in Christ we inherit righteousness Rom 5:12, 19 ; and whereas in Adam we inherit death, in Christ we inherit life 1 Cor 15:22; Rom 5:18 .
[51]  It is a fact that we are no longer in Adam but in Christ.
[52]  However, we must realize that our history is very complicated.
[53]  In our history, in addition to the cross of Christ and the death and resurrection of Christ, there is the history of Moses.
[54]  I have the boldness to tell you to forget about the law of God because according to God s Word it has nothing to do with us and is in fact foreign to us as believers Rom 6:6; 7:4; Gal 2:19 .
[55]  TO THE IMAGE OF CHRIST BY COOPERATING WITH THE INDWELLING SPIRIT Scripture Reading: Rom 5:20; 6:14; 7:4-11; 8:2-11, 16, 26-30, 37
[56]  In this chapter, we continue the fellowship that we began in the previous chapter.
[57]  So then, my brothers, you also have been made dead to the law through the body of Christ so that you might be joined to another, to Him who has been raised from the dead, that we might bear fruit to God.
[58]  For that which the law could not do, in that it was weak through the flesh, God, sending His own Son in the likeness of the flesh of sin and concerning sin, condemned sin in the flesh, that the righteous requirement of the law might be fulfilled in us, who do not walk according to the flesh but according to the spirit.
[59]  In the previous chapter, we learned that in Romans chapters 5 through 8 there are four important figures: Adam, Christ, the flesh, and the Spirit.
[60]  We must realize that according to Romans 5:20, the law is something that came in alongside Adam and Christ.
[61]  Romans 8:2 says that the law of the Spirit of life has freed us in Christ Jesus from the law of sin and of death.
[62]  The only thing we have to do for the law of the Spirit of life within us to operate is to switch it on in much the same way that we would switch on a light.
[63]  God s goal, His ultimate aim, is to conform us to the image of Christ.
[64]  His goal is not simply that we go along with the Holy Spirit and sense life and peace; He desires that we be conformed gradually, and eventually completely, to the image of Christ.
[65]  Because we need to be conformed to the image of Christ, there is the need not only for the Spirit within us but also for many things outside of us.
[66]  Romans 8:28-29 tells us that all things work together so that those who love God and are called according to His purpose can be conformed to Christ s image.
