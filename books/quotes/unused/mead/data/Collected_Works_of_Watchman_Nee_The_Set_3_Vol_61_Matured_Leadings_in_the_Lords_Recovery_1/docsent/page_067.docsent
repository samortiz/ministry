   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER SIXTEEN CONSECRATION</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>AS REVEALED IN ROMANS 12 Date: Friday evening, February 10, 1950</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Place: Jordan Road, Kowloon, Hong Kong</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Scripture Reading: Rom 12:1-5 INTRODUCTION</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>In Paul's Epistle to the Romans, the first fifteen verses of chapter one are an introduction.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The first section of his letter begins from verse 16 and goes through the end of chapter eleven.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Chapter twelve begins the second section.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>In chapters one to eight of the first section, Paul shows us the riches we have obtained in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>In chapters nine through eleven, a contrast is made between the riches we have received and the riches the Israelites once received.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>From chapter twelve onward, Paul begins to exhort us to do something.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>In the first eight chapters, he repeatedly tells us what Christ has done for us and what the Spirit has done for us.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>He does not emphasize what we as Christians should do.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>In the first eleven chapters, Paul speaks of what the Triune God has accomplished for us.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Since God has done so much, we should do something also.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>If we do not do anything in return, we are being unreasonable and ungrateful.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>At the very beginning of chapter twelve, Paul uses the word therefore.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>This indicates that he is continuing his previous discussion and relating it to what a believer should do.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>He says that we should present our bodies a living sacrifice to God.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>We may not be able to do much, but the least we can do is present our bodies a living sacrifice.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>At the minimum, a Christian must see what Christ has done for him and what the Holy Spirit has done for him.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Chapters one through seven tell us what Christ has done for us.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Chapter eight tells us what the Holy Spirit has done for us.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Chapters nine through eleven tell us what God's sovereignty and authority have done for us.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>In chapter twelve Paul tells us that all these works are based on God's compassion.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The words compassion and mercy are the same word in the original language.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>God's compassion is the same as His love and mercy.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>PRESENTING OUR BODIES</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>THROUGH THE COMPASSIONS OF GOD</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Paul says that since God loves us so much and is so merciful and gracious to us, we should consecrate ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Anyone who wants to serve God must first touch His mercy and grace.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>If a man has not seen God's love and mercy, he will feel that it is a hard task to present his body to do something for God; he will feel that this is harder than making bricks for Pharaoh.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Once a man sees God's mercy, however, it is a reasonable thing for him to present his body.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The first reaction of a man who has obtained mercy from God is consecration.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Once a man touches God's love and mercy, he no longer can live for himself.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Before he receives mercy and light, his possessions, his life, and his self are most precious to him.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Once he touches God's love and mercy, however, he no longer treasures these things.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Once we experience God's mercy, we will look back at ourselves under God's great shining and ask Him, "What should I do?</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>What do You want from me?"</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>THE POWER OF CONSECRATION</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>COMES FROM GOD'S SHINING</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Before Paul believed in the Lord, he was a persecutor of the Lord's disciples.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>He obtained letters from the high priest to put into bondage those who called on the name of the Lord Acts 9:1-2, 14 .</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>How proud and arrogant he was when he was riding on his horse to Damascus!</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Just as he was about to enter Damascus, a light from heaven shone on him, and he was struck down.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Such a proud and arrogant person never would have consecrated himself if he had not touched God's great love and mercy.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>But as soon as the light shone, he no longer could sit comfortably; he had to come down from his throne.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Paul immediately asked, "What shall I do, Lord?"</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>22:10 .</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>If we have not touched God's mercy, consecration is the hardest thing on earth.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Everyone in the world loves himself; there is no one who does not treasure his own life and possessions.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>However, consecration is easy once we are brought before God's great love and compassion.</S>
