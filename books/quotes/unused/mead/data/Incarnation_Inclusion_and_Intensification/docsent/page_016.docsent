   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>C. The Body of Christ</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In its universal aspect the church is the universal Body of Christ to be His fullness.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In Ephesians 1:22-23 Paul speaks of "the church, which is His Body, the fullness of the One who fills all in all."</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>This is the church in its universal aspect, for Christ has only one Body, which is unique in the universe.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Christ's universal Body is His fullness, His expression.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>V. TO KNOW THE BODY OF CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>In addition to knowing the church, we need to know the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>A. The Mystery of Christ</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The Body of Christ is the mystery of Christ Eph 3:4 .</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The mystery of God in Colossians 2:2 is Christ; the mystery of Christ in Ephesians 3:4 is the church.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>God is a mystery, and Christ, as the embodiment of God to express Him, is the mystery of God.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Christ also is a mystery, and the church, as the Body of Christ, is the mystery of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>This mystery is God's economy, which is to dispense Christ, as the embodiment of God, into God's chosen people in order to produce a Body to be the increase of God's embodiment in Christ so that God may have a corporate expression.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>B. The Fullness of the One Who Fills All in All</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The Body of Christ is the fullness of Him who fills all in all Eph 1:23 .</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>It is the universal expression of the all-inclusive and all-extensive Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The Body as Christ's fullness is the fullness of Him who fills all in all.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Christ, who is the infinite God without limitation, is so great that He fills all things in all things.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Such a great Christ needs the Body to be His fullness for His complete expression.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>C. The Organism of the Triune God</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The Body of Christ is the organism of the Triune God, constituted with the Triune God and the believers Eph 4:4-6 .</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The divine life is a substance, the Triune God, and the organism of the Triune God is the visible expression of this substance.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Therefore, as the organism of the Triune God, the Body of Christ is altogether organic and is absolutely of life.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>An illustration of this organism is found in John 15 the vine with its branches.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The vine is developed and enlarged through its branches.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>This is a picture of the Body of Christ as the organism of the Triune God, an organism that grows with the riches of the Triune God and expresses the divine life.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The organism of the Triune God, the Body of Christ, is an issue of the Divine Trinity; it is an issue of the Father as the source, the Son as the course, and the Spirit as the flow.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Furthermore, the Body is constituted with the Triune God and the believers.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>In this constitution the Father is the source, the Son is the element, the Spirit is the essence, and the believers, God's redeemed and regenerated people, are the outward framework.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The Father as the source, the Son as the element, and the Spirit as the essence are all in the outward framework.</S>
