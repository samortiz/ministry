<H2 CLASS=HEAD1>I. OF THE THINGS CONCERNING HUMAN GOVERNMENT</H2><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>A. In the Book of Daniel</H2><P>In Daniel the great human image signifies the entire human government on earth as a skeleton (ch. 2). The four beasts from the Mediterranean Sea give a sketch of human government on earth (ch. 7). A ram and a male goat with its successors give a sketch of the Persian Empire and the Grecian Empire with its successors, ending with the one, Antiochus Epiphanes, who is the first type of Antichrist (ch. 8). The king of the south and the king of the north give a record of the wars between the successors of the Grecian Empire, ending with Antiochus Epiphanes, the first type of Antichrist (ch. 11). The seventy weeks give a sketch of the destiny of Israel, from the return from their captivity to the consummation of the present age, ending with Antichrist (ch. 9).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>B. In the Book of Zechariah</H2><P>In Zechariah the prophecy concerning the nations around Judah in relation to Israel gives some details of the Grecian Empire's invasion into the holy land and the defeat of its successor by the heroic Jews (ch. 9). The prophecy concerning the living of Israel under the oppression of the Roman Empire gives some details about the living under the tyranny of the Roman Empire (ch. 11). The prophecy concerning Israel's destiny in the great war of Armageddon gives the details of how human government, signified by the great human image in Daniel 2, will be destroyed in its final part, signified by the toes of the great human image (chs. 12, 14).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>II. OF THE THINGS CONCERNING CHRIST</H2><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>A. In the Book of Daniel</H2><P>The book of Daniel reveals certain crucial things concerning Christ. According to 9:26, the crucifixion of Christ, the Messiah, was the termination of the old creation and the germination of God's new creation in His resurrection. In 10:4-9 we see the appearing of the excellent Christ, the centrality and universality of God's move on earth, to Daniel for his appreciation, consolation, encouragement, expectation, and stabilization. Daniel 7:13-14 unveils the coming of Christ as the Son of Man with the eternal dominion, glory, and kingdom given to Him by the Ancient of Days, that all the peoples, nations, and languages might serve Him. Finally, Daniel speaks regarding the appearing of Christ as the stone cut out without hands to strike the great human image to terminate the entire human government on earth and become a great mountain, signifying the eternal kingdom of God filling the whole earth (2:34-35).</P>
