   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>V. THE DISPENSING OF THE TRIUNE GOD</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The final thing we need to stress in this message is the dispensing of the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>We need to say repeatedly that in Romans 8 there is the dispensing of the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In verses 8 through 10 four titles are interchangeably used: God, the Spirit of God, the Spirit of Christ, and Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>God is the Spirit of God, the Spirit of God is the Spirit of Christ, and the Spirit of Christ is Christ Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Without God being the Spirit, God cannot reach us.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>In order for electricity to reach a building, it has to become a current.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The current of electricity is the reaching of electricity.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>In like manner, the Spirit of God is God's reaching us.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Also, for God to reach us and for the Spirit of God to reach us, He has to be the Spirit of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>This is because with Christ there are two main things: humanity and redemption.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The Spirit of God has to be the Spirit of Christ because there is the need of humanity and redemption.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>His incarnation gave Him humanity, and His crucifixion accomplished redemption.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Through humanity and redemption the Spirit became the reaching Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The Spirit of God is now the Spirit of Christ with humanity and redemption for reaching us.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>We should not read all these verses and take them for granted.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>We must say, "Lord, open our eyes.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>We must see something."</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Romans 8 shows us the dispensing of the Triune God as the divine life into the three parts of man.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Eventually verse 11 says that the God who raised Christ Jesus from the dead gives life to our mortal body through the indwelling Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>This verse gives us a full picture of the Triune God dispensing life into our being from the center to the circumference.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>This dispensing comes from these four titles: God, the Spirit of God, the Spirit of Christ, and Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Romans 8:9-11 gives us a full picture of the dispensing of the Triune God for the purpose of imparting Himself into us as the divine life.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>First, He dispenses Himself into our spirit; then He spreads to our mind; and finally, He reaches our mortal body.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Then our whole being is saturated with the divine life.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Actually, this divine life is the dispensing Triune God Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>We must be very clear about what life is.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>In the previous lesson we saw the dispensing function of the Triune God issuing in the sense of life.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>In this lesson we have seen the divine life dispensed into the three parts of man.</S>
