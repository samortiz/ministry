Even if we had ten times or even one hundred times more, we still would not have enough to feed four or five thousand people
Perhaps we do not even have five loaves today, but our need is greater than four thousand or five thousand people
Without a miracle, even two hundred or five hundred denarii worth of bread are not enough to satisfy that many people
The Lord wants to bring us to a point where His blessing takes the first place, a point where we have never been
If the Lord does not bring us to this point, we will have to say that even two hundred denarii worth of bread is not enough
Sometimes it seems that we have made a serious mistake, but with God's blessing the result is not really an error
We must learn to believe in God's blessing, rely on it, and eliminate the barriers which prevent us from receiving it
The normal life of a Christian is a life of blessing, and the normal work of a Christian is a work of blessing
With the passing years it becomes more and more evident that some brothers receive God's blessing while others do not
If we do not receive God's blessing, we should not push the responsibility for it onto the situation or environment
It does not bother Him if you make these mistakes over and over again, but God cares about other weaknesses very much
We should say to the Lord, 'This vessel is weak, but forbid that it should be too shallow or too small to contain Your blessing'
Perhaps the salvation of a few score people in one place is a hindrance to the salvation of several thousand others
Immediately before us lies a work that is ten times greater, even one hundred times greater, than that which is behind us
Is it possible that the few people who have been saved and the meeting hall we have built have become the limits of our blessing?
If we who serve the Lord truly look for God's blessing when we gather together, the future results will be more than we can ask or think
The blessing is the result of receiving what we do not deserve, that is, the result of receiving beyond what our gift warrants us to receive
Since we only pay attention to the fact that we are laboring night and day, God cannot do anything beyond our expectation
We labor through the night and should obtain certain results, but if God withholds His blessing, we will obtain less than we should
David and Abraham both made mistakes, Isaac was not very useful, and Jacob was crafty, but God blessed them all
One time there was a meeting in which it seemed that we sang the wrong hymn, but we had a good result because we had God's blessing
Sometimes when we preach, it seems that we are speaking the wrong word to the wrong audience, but God still blesses some in the audience
If a person can be blessed by God, we do not know how much more fruit he will bear beyond just his gift and ability
We may have a better temper and a larger gift than a certain brother, but he bears fruit in his work, while we cannot bear fruit in ours
From now on we should not be those who stubbornly argue over right and wrong; we must be those who receive great blessings from God
