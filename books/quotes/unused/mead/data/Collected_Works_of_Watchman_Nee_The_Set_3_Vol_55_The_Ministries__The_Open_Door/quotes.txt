[3]  After Watchman Nee resumed his ministry in 1948, he worked with his co-workers to publish several magazines.
[4]  Many localities continued to invite us, and we were eager to visit the brothers and sisters whom we had not been able to see for many years; nevertheless, we felt that the Lord was not doing this, and we did not accept invitations from any locality.
[5]  I came to Nan-Ping two weeks ago to clear up some matters and to lead the brothers and sisters to know God in the way of inward life and outward service.
[6]  I saw God's presence, and the brothers and sisters were all moved to rise up to learn to serve.
[7]  A few days ago, we made some new arrangements for each area of work in the church.
[8]  We ask every person in the church to practice obedience.
[9]  They all miss you since you left, even though they do not know you because they are new believers.
[10]  I have not corresponded with you for several years.
[11]  I went to my office the day after arriving in Nanking and handed in my letter of resignation on Saturday.
[12]  Because I did not want my superiors to misunderstand, I asked a friend to explain for me.
[13]  I was surprised when my superior's secretary returned my letter of resignation the same day that I handed it in. Today is Monday, and I went in to personally ask to resign.
[14]  LEARNING TO SERVE IN ZHAN-JIANG Newly Arrived in Zhan-Jiang
[15]  Almost six months have gone by since the church in Shanghai sent me here to Zhan-Jiang.
[16]  The fruits which I have gained, however, are pitifully few, and the Lord is really dissatisfied.
[17]  Whenever I consider how I have failed in my responsibility, I have no peace in my heart.
[18]  However, by His grace I must report the situation of this locality and of myself for His sake and for the sake of His church.
[19]  When I was in Shanghai, I was not afraid when I met people because I could invite them to the meetings of the church, or I could ask older brothers and sisters to talk to them.
[20]  It has been almost half a year since I came to Zhan-Jiang!
[21]  God indeed has had mercy on me and entrusted me with the responsibility for His "recovery."
[22]  Some of the brothers and sisters in Siying were cold and backslidden, but they have received mercy from God and have gradually returned to the Lord.
[23]  In observing the children of God in Siying, I became conscious of the need to submit to the divine life and the importance of position and authority.
[24]  If this matter is not upheld, the church will be in confusion, and nothing will be proper or orderly.
[25]  When I was in Shanghai, often I was unwilling to submit to the older saints, and I was full of my own opinions.
[26]  When I first came here, I was too "democratic"; I allowed the brothers to touch the affairs of the church too loosely.
[27]  Although the number is smaller, all have come for the Lord.
[28]  I feel that I will allow the brothers to touch the affairs of the church only after they have been brought through the narrow gate of purging the leaven, and consecration to the Lord.
[29]  The church in Lan-chou has been especially blessed by the Lord recently.
[30]  The brothers and sisters are pursuing and growing in life.
[31]  Overall, the brothers and sisters among us have touched the real and living God and are in the process of coming out of Christianity and into Christ.
[32]  ..With regard to going to Shanghai, I have desperately sought the Lord for these past few days, and I hope that the Lord would give me an open door to get there in a timely manner, but my environment has not released me.
[33]  Greetings in the Lord to the most respectful Mr. Nee:
[34]  Please read this letter to the end and do not set it aside.
[35]  I fully admit that I am most poor and pitiful before God.
[36]  I have nothing, know nothing, and am worth less than a dead fly because I can only commit sin and come short of His glory.
[37]  Honorable Mr. Nee! I hope you will remember me, the most pitiful among the pitiful ones, before God often! May He completely gain this lowly, worthless person and strip off all that is not from God Himself.
[38]  Early this morning, my elder brother told me a little about the brothers and sisters in Shanghai and how they had handed over themselves and all they had to the church for God's use.
[39]  By the Lord's marvelous leading we were able to have two gospel meetings on campus.
[40]  The condition of the first meeting was very good, but some of my inward burden could not be released at the second meeting because there were too many people, and the word was not rich enough.
[41]  I do not know if God wants me to change my direction and stop going to the Frontier School to preach the gospel, and instead bring the more than thirty students who are willing to receive the Lord to a clear knowledge of salvation so that we will have a good foundation before continuing with the spread.
[42]  In recent years we have had an acute sense of the neglect of the publication work!
[43]  We have waited on the Lord time and again and have made some decisions.
[44]  2 September 1, 1948 A TALK CONCERNING THE FUTURE
[45]  If we want to keep up with God's work, we must pay attention to three matters concurrently.
[46]  If there is no gospel preaching in a place, there is surely no start to the work of God.
[47]  If we want God's work to spread and the kingdom of God to increase in any place, we must preach His gospel.
[48]  In addition to the above, we should also pay attention to some other matters.
[49]  We must know the sphere of our work, the object of our work, and the move of our work.
[50]  Whether we are preaching the gospel, bringing in a revival, or pursuing the knowledge of life, all three should be for the building up of the church, and all of them should be done in the church.
[51]  We should be deeply impressed and should recognize clearly that the service God wants is the church service, that is, a corporate service.
[52]  In every locality, the whole church should preach the gospel, the whole church should rise up to serve, and the whole church should work.
[53]  We should lead the young believers to be zealous for the gospel and to have a proper attitude toward it.
[54]  After the brothers and sisters in a local church have received a certain amount of edification, the church should encourage them to receive the Lord's leading to migrate to other localities and far away places for the sake of the gospel.
[55]  Finally, there are a few things we should guard against.
[56]  In every age and every place, there are always things that damage God's work.
[57]  For the sake of His testimony in Tangshan, the Lord has chosen some brothers and sisters here to meet to worship and serve Him.
[58]  In order to preserve and lead us, He has led us to fellowship often with His servants and all the churches.
[59]  This enables us to live in the supply of life in the Body, as well as preserves us in His will and grace.
[60]  During the past two months, Brother Sia came from Tientsin to fellowship with the brothers and sisters and to confirm that we are going on here in a proper condition.
[61]  Greetings in the Lord to my elder brother, Cheng-hua:
[62]  When I was preaching the gospel in Tsingtao, I felt that there was no need to pull in so many.
[63]  It would be a great blessing indeed for the brothers and sisters in Tsingtao to be graced by the Lord and be brought into the way of life.
[64]  Thank God for working in a small number of young brothers in the church in Shanghai.
[65]  Through their zeal for the gospel, many brothers and sisters have been stirred up.
[66]  If we want to preach the gospel but do not exercise love or grace in our living, or if we are not willing to sacrifice or suffer, turning "the other cheek," letting others "take our cloak," or going the "extra mile," we are not worthy of the gospel.
[67]  When my will was shaken to the point of falling and I was almost disappointed, the Lord said to me, "My son, do not regard lightly the discipline of the Lord, nor faint when reproved by Him."
[68]  I heard that God has blessed the local church in Shanghai in these days with a development never seen before.
[69]  The church in Dongsha has had very little growth in life in recent years.
[70]  We lack the experience of reality in our living, and we do not have enough light.
[71]  Furthermore, because we lack fellowship with your locality, you are not able to feed us, and there is a general spreading of spiritual famine.
[72]  I have not written for a long time, but I often remember you in the fellowship of prayer.
[73]  There are meetings three times a day in Kuling Mountain with the exception of prayer on the Lord's Day morning and rest on Wednesday .
[74]  NATURE:To show the way to serve, to help the serving ones and the churches in the different localities go on, and to solve the problems related to the ministry.
[75]  PRICES:A In order to prevent those who do not need this publication from carelessly disposing of it, we are forced to temporarily set the following prices: The three issues of this half year are temporarily priced at two gold dimes in national coinage.
[76]  3 November 1, 1948 THE WAY FOR THE WORK HEREAFTER
[77]  The second matter involves a center in each region.
[78]  Those who study the Bible know that churches are local and that a church in one locality cannot exercise control over a church in another locality.
[79]  The highest place a church can appeal to is its own locality; there is no district council or headquarters for the church.
[80]  You will remember that Peter went out to Caesarea and returned to Jerusalem.
[81]  Then Peter went to Samaria because the work of God was in Samaria and then returned to Jerusalem.
[82]  God used persecution to force the saints to migrate.
[83]  For the provinces of Kiangsu and Chekiang, the center of the work along the Nanking-Shanghai and Shanghai- Hangchow railways lines is in Shanghai.
[84]  Therefore, Shanghai must maintain a strong testimony, and Shanghai needs workers to maintain the work.
[85]  The responsibility of the rest of the localities in this region should be left to the brothers of their own locality.
[86]  Going out to preach the gospel is in the hand of the brothers and sisters; we are not sending people out to be pastors, but just to be emigrants.
[87]  Advise them that when they migrate to a place they should try their best to save souls in the locality where they live.
[88]  For this reason, during the conferences in both Shanghai and Foochow, we paid much attention to the matter of coordination.
[89]  If we do not see the principle of Jerusalem, we will feel that there is something in the Word of God which does not fit; it seems as if there is some problem.
[90]  Therefore, today there is a requirement not only for the co-workers to be coordinated but for the leading ones to be coordinated as well.
[91]  In this way the church will preach the gospel.
[92]  Thank the Lord that His work is done apart from the power of man.
[93]  The Lord has graciously taken care of me since school was disbanded, and I have been transferred to the general affairs department of a factory.
[94]  Among the churches in Nansha, a few brothers have recently had the desire to do some work for the Lord.
[95]  We were most troubled about this, but the Lord showed us that God sent Jesus Christ, the Lord sent the twelve apostles, and the Holy Spirit sent out Paul and Barnabas through the church.
[96]  4 April 5, 1950 SPECIAL GRACE AND RESERVE GRACE A Talk by Watchman Nee
[97]  Answer:In Revelation 3 the Lord said, "You are...poor" v. 17 . These words were addressed by Him to the church in Laodicea.
[98]  If we have just come to the Lord, it is understandable if we live by special grace; but if we are still dependent on such grace after we have believed in the Lord for a year or two, this indicates a state of poverty and sickness.
[99]  It is a great grief to me that I frequently meet brothers and sisters who are so dependent on special grace that between the periodic help these experiences bring, their words and state of mind lapse into that of a non-Christian.
[100]  I readily acknowledge that we all would be utterly destitute if God's grace were removed from us; but it is also true that something of God's grace can be constituted into our very being.
[101]  Spiritual trials are times when it seems that God has covered His face and shut His mouth, when it seems that He will not answer or make a sound, when it seems He is so quiet that there is no God in heaven at all.
[102]  Many people have spent much time before God, but they have not passed through many experiences before God.
[103]  If one wants to become rich, he must spend time before God, and he must pass through many experiences before God.
[104]  It is not enough to go through many experiences.
[105]  If we have spent the required amount of time and passed through the necessary experiences, we must ask if there has been a result.
[106]  Hopefully, the time we spend before God and the lessons we have learned before Him will have an end. The Lord put His Spirit inside us to enable us to learn the lessons and reach an end. Only then will the Lord be able to use us to supply others.
[107]  Seven or eight years ago, God released messages about "migration" through His servant.
[108]  Although some brothers and sisters have already migrated from Northern China to the Northwest, most still do not pay much attention to what migration really is.
[109]  A HYMN Hymns, #918 Christians, make haste, your mission high fulfilling,
[110]  To tell to all the world that God is Light,
[111]  The burden for the arrangement of migration is definitely in my heart.
[112]  ARRANGEMENT FOR THE HOUSEHOLD YIYANG Practicing Not Having Anything for Oneself
[113]  The locality of Yiyang has made the following arrangements:
[114]  We want to thank God for showing us the way of migration and for moving a group of brothers and sisters this way.
[115]  Some brothers and sisters migrated from here to Yiyang and Kueixi on the twenty-third of this month.
[116]  Before we parted, I felt a heavy burden to speak a word to the migrating brothers and sisters.
[117]  Brother Dao-sheng and I are responsible for preaching the gospel on the Lord's Day afternoon.
[118]  After God created man, He gave Adam and Eve the occupation of caring for the garden of Eden.
[119]  Question:The brothers and sisters who have been meeting with us for more than ten years all seem to know our ground and how it is different from that of others.
[120]  The brothers and sisters saved during the past seven or eight years especially those saved during the most recent six or seven years , however, do not know what our ground is.
[121]  Answer: I think this matter is very important, because the Lord has shown us explicitly in the Bible that the church has a definite ground.
[122]  I presume we all recognize that the blessing of God, the Holy Spirit of God, the light of God, and even the very life of the Lord Jesus Himself are all in the church.
[123]  Whether or not a so-called "church" is really the church is very important, because God has committed so many spiritual things to the church.
[124]  Today, let me bring out two matters; both must exist before there can be the church.
[125]  The New Testament clearly shows us two basic requirements: first, the authority of the Holy Spirit; and second, the boundary of locality.
[126]  We must realize that where there is not the Holy Spirit, there is not the church.
[127]  The church is absolutely not Witness Lee, Chang Yu-zhi, or Yu Cheng-hwa; the church must only be the Holy Spirit.
[128]  In other words, the church from beginning to end can only have one authority, one power, and one life, which is the Holy Spirit.
[129]  An Outlet for the Authority of the Holy Spirit
[130]  Recently, I saw what happened to a brother who had carried a very heavy object over a long distance several years ago.
[131]  His hand felt somewhat sore then, but now it has become so disabled that it can hardly move.
[132]  In Shanghai many people can establish an evangelistic mission, seminary, Bible institute, or Bible study class.
[133]  If we are not able to obey the Holy Spirit, and man's authority and man's things come in, there is no church.
[134]  Regardless of whether we are a believer or an unbeliever, whether we have the life of God or not, we cannot establish a church.
[135]  There is one thing we must all notice: The world does not have a church; therefore, the Roman Catholic Church is wrong.
[136]  A province does not have a church, nor does a race.
[137]  In the Bible only the smallest administrative unit is related to the church only a locality or a city has a church.
[138]  Even though I preach the gospel and start a meeting, bringing many to salvation, giving messages, and edifying the saints, I can never become the church because the qualification to take Shanghai as the ground of the church has already been taken.
[139]  Today in Bijie in Kweichow province, no one has taken the standing of establishing a church on the ground of locality.
[140]  If anyone desires to establish a church, it is all right for him to go to Bijie because in one locality there can only be one local church.
[141]  If an additional church appears there, God will say that is a division.
[142]  I hope that before God we understand these two points: First, God's church is established upon the authority of the Holy Spirit; second, God's church is established with the boundary of locality.
[143]  If they do, they will be clear about the standing of the so-called denominations, churches, groups, and organizations.
[144]  If any group is not built upon the ground of locality, we can see that it is not the church.
[145]  Some of us pray that the Lord would bless us as He blessed the church during Pentecost.
[146]  But if the Lord really answered our prayers, what would we do?
[147]  If the Lord really granted us the blessing of Pentecost, what would we do?
[148]  If the Lord gave us three thousand or five thousand people, what would we do?
[149]  Question: Concerning the ground of the church, we have said that there should be only one church in a city, because there is only one unit.
[150]  Some people, however, speak of "the church in a house," quoting the Scriptures as their basis, as being an additional unit to the locality.
[151]  If mentioning individual names in addition to greeting the church means that these individuals were not of this church and that there was another church in existence, then even Prisca and Aquila, whom Paul mentioned separately in his greeting, were not of the church which was in their own house!
[152]  Aquila and Prisca greet you much in the Lord with the church, which is in their house."
[153]  In verse 16 he spontaneously informs those at Colossae explicitly and without further explanation that the brothers in Laodicea whom he has greeted in verse 15 are the church that meets in Nymphas's house and that this church is the church in Laodicea.
[154]  If in Jerusalem, where there were many members and many houses, God did not use the house to be the sphere, the jurisdiction of the church, then we know it is not likely to find any factual basis for taking a house as the sphere of the church elsewhere in the Bible.
[155]  First, some people desire to have a church bigger than a city or a locality.
[156]  They want to unite many churches in different localities and make them one big church, that is, bigger than a locality.
[157]  They have never considered that there is not such a term like the church in China in the Scriptures.
[158]  In the province of Asia, if we add up the churches as one plus one plus one plus one plus one plus one plus one, the result is not one church, but seven churches.
[159]  In the Bible, when the house is equivalent to a locality or city, that house is called the church, like the church in Rome, the church in Colossae, the church in Laodicea, etc. But when the house is smaller than the locality or city, that house cannot be called the church, like the house meetings of the church in Jerusalem.
[160]  If the church in Nymphas's house Col 4:15 and the church in Laodicea v. 16 are not the same, then when we add them up they must be two churches, but after we add "them" together in this way, God speaks of "the church in Laodicea" in Revelation 3:14, not "the churches" or "the two churches in Laodicea." They are just one.
[161]  They agree that the boundary, the jurisdiction, of the church is locality, yet because they are unwilling to get out of the sects, they think that the house is also a boundary of the church.
[162]  When we search the Bible for judgment and settlement upon some teaching, we must not only check the intention of our heart, but we must also take heed to the direction in which this kind of teaching leads and the outcome it produces.
[163]  Likewise, if anyone says that there can be the church in a house besides the church in a locality, we will also ask, What will be the outcome of this kind of teaching?
[164]  In order to practically make the church singular become the churches plural , God has established the way for one individual church and another individual church to remain two churches instead of one.
[165]  Since the publication of the fourth issue of The Ministers, many of God's children seem to have a feeling concerning migration.
[166]  We have already received many letters asking about the matter of migration.
[167]  1 Because the migration of the church is for the gospel, the motive for migrating must match the goal.
[168]  In the fall of that year, the two brothers and Brother Chang sent a letter of invitation to Brother Chai Ji-ching with Brother Mao Ching-shi from Taishun, and more than ten brothers from Pumen including Brother Su Ti-sheng, Brother Chin Zhi-fang, and Brother Su Jie-min came in one accord to Chiaotunmen for a ten-day conference.
[169]  As we are gathered today, I think I have something to say.
[170]  When we appear before the Lord one day, I hope that all the young brothers will be together and will examine the calendar of 1930, 1935, or 1949.
[171]  Granting that we will know all things as the Lord knows them, we will see that on January 1, 1930, the Lord had ordained an opportunity for us to go to North Szechuan Road to save twenty souls.
[172]  Perhaps the Lord wanted to use such a person to save tens of thousands of souls, but on that day I did not go because I was afraid the weather was too hot, and I was too lazy.
[173]  It is a terrible mistake and a great loss to the church to bury the one talented ones in the ground, thinking that they are useless and unqualified for the service, not giving them the opportunity to produce.
[174]  We must put out the capital before we will have the chance to earn money.
[175]  If we bury the one talented ones in the ground, we take away the opportunity for such spiritual gifts to be employed and we stop their function.
[176]  I have no other intention than to exhort the brothers and sisters to not miss our special opportunity.
[177]  There have never been as many wonderful and numerous opportunities as those that we are facing today.
[178]  If we but open our eyes a little, we will see these opportunities.
[179]  As Sian is a door to the Northwest, may the Lord have a clear way through here so that the gospel work in all of the Northwest would be brought into oneness and would combine forces with the brothers in the coastal regions.
[180]  There are approximately twenty young brothers and sisters who are all engineering and agricultural graduates of Northwest University.
[181]  We stayed in Meixian for ten days and preached the gospel on three days.
[182]  The atmosphere of the gospel is very burning, and the brothers are all doing very well.
[183]  The number of those meeting in Peking has increased gradually, and our meeting hall cannot contain everyone.
[184]  Due to the desperate situation, we intend to tear down our old meeting hall at Kuanjie next spring and build a new, bigger meeting hall that will be able to hold eight hundred to a thousand people.
[185]  We want to report to you the good news that the meetings in Kweiyang have been resumed.
[186]  In order to not grieve the Holy Spirit and to serve Him according to His will, we started home meetings on November 21 of this year, and we began to break bread to remember the Lord on December 4.
[187]  As a result of this, the church in Nanking sent someone here, and we held our first baptism meeting on June 4.
[188]  Brother Guang-tao is here and is still able to mingle with the brothers in the service.
[189]  After leaving Shanghai and returning to Hunan, I visited the brothers and sisters in Xiangtan and Yiyang.
[190]  I also went to Wuhan and preached the gospel with the brothers and sisters there.
[191]  The Lord arranged a teaching job for me, and I have been learning how to serve Him with the brothers and sisters.
[192]  There have never been many brothers and sisters in the church in C'hang-sha.
[193]  At the beginning the Lord really had mercy on me, but later I saw that I could not make it....Thank the Lord for giving me some deeper dealings.
[194]  Our reason for writing this letter is to have the fellowship in life with the churches in other localities and to ask the brothers and sisters to remember to pray for this young and weak church.
[195]  While I was staying in Zhenjiang, I received a letter from the brothers in Huaian in northern Kiangsu province, saying that they had several brothers with a heart to serve the Lord.
[196]  They invited me to visit and give them instruction concerning the way to serve the Lord and the kind of responsibility they should bear.
[197]  I mentioned their request to Brother Ji and elderly Brother Wu, and they also felt that I should see the situation of the brothers in northern Kiangsu.
[198]  God arranged all the circumstances, and the brothers in Huaian gathered all the brothers who had a heart and who were already bearing responsibility in the localities around Huaian.
[199]  You have no way of knowing our situation because communication is so difficult.
[200]  We would like to tell you how the Lord has progressively led us.
[201]  HISTORY: In the spring of 1949, Brother Chen Fa-guang and his wife returned from Shanghai to Szechuan after the church laid hands on them and prayed.
[202]  They brought the fire of the gospel with them and scattered the seeds of the gospel all over Wanxian.
[203]  There Is a Way When We Meet the Lord Ch'ang-ch'un
[204]  Brother Zuo-xin and I have received some light; we are serving God in one accord with Brother Xun-tian and Brother Xi-nian, and there is not the slightest problem among us.
[205]  The more we go on, the clearer the way becomes.
[206]  We have such a great responsibility because we hold the spiritual future of so many brothers and sisters who are pursuing the Lord in our hands!
[207]  There are many matters related to the work in Manchuria, and we are waiting for your instructions and arrangement.
[208]  We hope that you will come to Manchuria soon because there are some matters in which we cannot proceed with full assurance.
[209]  In the Lord's work, I think that there must be a few praying in one accord before something spiritual can be realized.
[210]  A small number of people have to wrestle in prayer, bring about some changes through prayer, and touch the things that the Lord wants to tear down and the things that He wants to establish, before they can say that they are co-laboring with Him.
[211]  We, the meeting at Huangtze Town, have never belonged to any denomination, nor do we have much fellowship with brothers and sisters of other groups.
[212]  Thank God for having mercy on us, His ignorant sheep, and for constantly giving us grace.
[213]  I have wanted to write about how God led us to migrate from Chekiang to Kiangsi and something of what we learned before Him, in order to have fellowship with the brothers and sisters in the Lord, but I have not dared to write lightly.
[214]  The boat arrived in Xiaoshan around 5:00 in the morning.
[215]  We walked to the train station and saw many passengers sleeping there.
[216]  We planned to spend the night in the meeting hall there.
[217]  We had just gone to bed when a brother suddenly came from Shi-Er-Dai to tell us that there had been a phone call from Xiaoshan and the train was ready, so we had to start quickly.
[218]  We felt that we should not wait any longer and that we could not look at our circumstances, so we left as planned.
[219]  We passed through the first two stages, but the third stage lay before us.
[220]  When we came to search out the area, it seemed that our goal should be Zhaobintien.
[221]  But the fields there were few and very expensive; furthermore, the people there thought we were lawless refugees and were not willing to let us live there.
[222]  Only a few people are raised up every ten to twenty years in the history of the church who have the gift of the gospel.
[223]  I particularly love this book Seen and Heard because we can say that Brother James M'Kendrick did not have the gift of preaching the gospel, but only the spirit of preaching the gospel.
[224]  22 October 30, 1950 THE FLOW OF THE SPIRIT
[225]  In reading the Bible, we find that God's revelation is always progressive and advancing.
[226]  If we only pay attention to ultimate absolutes when reading the Bible and fail to see that revelation is progressive, we will not be able to keep up with God's way.
[227]  Physically, I still need to rest another week, according to Brother Deh-bao's word; it is still too early to move around.
[228]  If you think I need to go to Yungkang, I believe the Lord will protect and support me.
[229]  Sometimes I wonder if my spiritual pathway has reached its end. Do I still have a hope of rising up again? I do not know why I feel as if I have committed some great sin.
[230]  Thank the Lord that the first baptism meeting in Jiaxing received the blessing of peace.
[231]  There were seventeen brothers and sisters who were baptized into the Lord's church.
[232]  God had mercy on me, one who is lazy, weak, and fearful, and who has unprofitably occupied a place in Jiaxing for many years.
[233]  We have recently learned something about how to discern the Body of Christ.
[234]  There are many brothers who have seen the importance of serving God, consecration, and the church preaching the gospel.
[235]  We began to have prayer meetings in November 1948.
[236]  However, we were unable to start regular meetings because we did not have enough light.
[237]  By the mercy of the God of love, we were introduced to the fellowship of two brothers from Sheng county, and we received help from them.
