   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE ULTIMATE CONSUMMATION</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>OF THE PROCESSED TRIUNE GOD</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The precious ointment in Psalm 133 is the ointment described in Exodus 30.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>This ointment is a picture of the compound, all-inclusive, life-giving Spirit with the elements of divinity, humanity, human living, the effectiveness of Christ's death, and the power of Christ's resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>This all-inclusive Spirit is the expression of the processed God.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>I am burdened of the Lord to speak about this matter again and again until we are all deeply impressed with it.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>In the first chapter of the Gospel of John, we are told that the Word, which was in the beginning with God and which was God, became flesh and tabernacled among us, full of grace and truth 1:1, 14 .</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>This Word, Christ, lived on earth for thirty-three and a half years.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Then He passed through crucifixion and in resurrection became the life-giving Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The life-giving Spirit is the ultimate consummation of the processed God.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>In John 14 through 16 we see that the Lord Jesus was one with the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>To see Him was to see the Father 14:9 .</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>In 14:10 the Lord Jesus said, "Do you not believe that I am in the Father, and the Father is in Me?</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The words which I speak to you, I do not speak from Myself; but the Father Who abides in Me, He does His works."</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>As the Lord spoke, the Father worked.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>In this chapter the Lord went on to tell the disciples that the Spirit of reality actually was He Himself realized.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>This means that when the Spirit indwelt the disciples, the Lord Himself was indwelling them.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Hence, the Father, the Son, and the Spirit are the unique Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Passing through the various steps of a process, this very Triune God has become the all-inclusive Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>John 7:39 says, "The Spirit was not yet, because Jesus was not yet glorified."</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The Spirit promised in chapters fourteen through sixteen is the Spirit referred to in 7:39.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>By receiving the Spirit as the ultimate consummation of the processed Triune God, we are one with the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>For this reason, after speaking of the Spirit in chapter fourteen, the Lord goes on to say in chapter fifteen that if we abide in Him, He will abide in us.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>According to 14:23, if we love the Lord, the Father and the Son will come to us and make an abode with us.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>This abode is a mutual abode for the Triune God to abide in the believers and for the believers to abide in the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>This mutual abiding is a matter of mingling.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>After speaking the words recorded in John 14 through 16, the Lord Jesus offered the prayer to the Father recorded in chapter seventeen.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The language of this prayer is altogether divine.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>In this prayer the Lord refers to the wonderful and mysterious mingling of the processed Triune God with the believers.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Once again we point out that this mingling is the oneness.</S>
