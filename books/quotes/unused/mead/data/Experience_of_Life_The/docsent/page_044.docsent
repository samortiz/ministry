   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>K. The Feeling of the Conscience and Spiritual Knowledge</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Another strong basis for the feeling of the conscience is spiritual knowledge.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Spiritual knowledge does not mean mental understanding and comprehension of Bible truths or spiritual things, but denotes the understanding and realization of God and all the things of God through divine revelation and enlightenment.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>This kind of knowledge is both in life and in the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>If a certain kind of knowledge is not derived from life and the Holy Spirit, it is not spiritual knowledge.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Real spiritual knowledge must come from life and the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Since it is derived from life, our spiritual knowledge is attained by the degree of life.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>If a certain kind of knowledge precedes our growth in life, it is premature and intellectual; it is not real spiritual knowledge.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Hence, it cannot afford us the supply of life and is of no profit to us.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>If, however, our growth of life increases to a certain extent, a certain kind of knowledge will be produced.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>This is the proper and normal spiritual knowledge.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>It can supply us with life and is beneficial to us.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Why is spiritual knowledge in proportion to the growth in life?</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Because real spiritual knowledge is derived from the enlightenment of the Holy Spirit, and this enlightenment is in proportion to the growth of life.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>If there is no enlightenment when we listen to messages, read the Bible, study books, and hear the testimonies of others, we merely accumulate much knowledge.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>This is not real spiritual knowledge.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>From this we can see the absolute relatedness of real spiritual knowledge, growth of life, and the enlightening of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>What then is the real spiritual knowledge, which results from the enlightening of the Holy Spirit?</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>First, it is a feeling in our spirit, the deepest part of our being, whereby we sense by inner revelation what needs to be dealt with.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Second, this feeling brings with it the manifestation of God, causing us to feel that it is God who has spoken to us in His presence.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>For example, a sister testifies that during prayer she was enlightened by the Lord not to wear many of her fashionable dresses.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Another sister, upon hearing her testimony, says in her heart, "If she cannot wear her style of dress, how can I wear my dress, which is more fashionable?"</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The fact is that the concept of this second sister concerning modern dress is merely the result of mental knowledge mixed with emotion.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>This is not spiritual knowledge, resulting from the enlightening of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>But she could also possibly have another condition; that is, she not only comprehends the matter with her mind, but is touched within by the testimony.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>She senses the finger of the Lord pointing to her stylish dress and giving her a feeling that she can never wear that dress again.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>This is the light of the Holy Spirit shining upon her.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>In the former situation she can merely nod her head and agree, but she cannot kneel down and pray.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>In the latter situation, even before she arrives home, she prays, "Lord, forgive me, and deliver me from this stylish dress."</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>In this case, God through this testimony not only moves her, but speaks and manifests Himself to her.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Hence, she knows for certain that she can no longer wear her stylish dress.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>This is real spiritual knowledge, knowledge which originates from the enlightening of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Each time God gives us spiritual knowledge, He desires us to meet the shining light of His face and to sense the revealing of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>This shining and revealing rebukes us in certain matters, makes us humble ourselves before God, and causes us to seek His forgiveness and deliverance as well as His supply and power of life to deal with whatever is being rebuked.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Take, for example, the messages which have been delivered in the church.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Because of the different degrees of growth in life among the brothers and sisters, the enlightening of the Holy Spirit also differs.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Therefore, the spiritual knowledge gained by each one varies greatly.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>A deeper growth in life gives the Holy Spirit more ground to enlighten some.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Consequently, the spiritual knowledge they obtain is greater and deeper.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>With those whose spiritual growth is shallow, the revealing light of the Holy Spirit is limited, even though they sit in the same meeting and hear the same message.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Hence, the spiritual knowledge within them is restricted and shallow.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Therefore, these three spiritual knowledge, the degree of growth in life, and the enlightening of the Holy Spirit are related and mingled together.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Real spiritual knowledge is derived through our growth in life and the enlightenment of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>This knowledge not only includes the comprehension of the mind, but much more.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>It is a feeling in the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>After it touches our conscience, this feeling in the spirit becomes a feeling in the conscience.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>A lack of spiritual knowledge means no feeling in the conscience.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Almost all normal feelings in the conscience come from real spiritual knowledge.</S>
