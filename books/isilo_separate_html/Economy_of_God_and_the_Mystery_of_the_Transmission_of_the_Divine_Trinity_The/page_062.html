We absolutely believe in the matter of regeneration and confess that Christians have two natures-the nature of the new man and the nature of the old man. This is the orthodox truth concerning life. In the matter of truth we have received a great deal of help from the Brethren-in particular, concerning the interpretation of prophecies. G. H. Pember, Robert Govett, and D. M. Panton were very thorough and precise in their studies, always interpreting the Bible according to the accurate meaning of the words. Hardly any mistakes can be found in their works. Based on their interpretations, and standing on their shoulders, we have examined and pursued the truth and have gone on to see deeper things.<p>On the final day of depositions for the lawsuit against the book The Mindbenders, its chief editor and those involved in its publication all capitulated. They had no way to continue debating with the Lord&#8217;s recovery. Since they could not understand what we were saying, they had no way to fight the battle. In the book The Four Major Steps of Christ, I refer to the three successive steps taken by the Triune God in His work and in His move. This refers to something economical, something related to His move. Yet the author of The Mindbenders wrongly accused me of saying that there are three successive steps taken by God in His existence. What they did was very subtle.<p>In terms of the existence of God, we use the term coexistence. In God&#8217;s existence, the Father, the Son, and the Spirit co-exist in the way of coinhering. This is according to the Lord Jesus&#8217; speaking: &#8220;I am in the Father and the Father is in Me&#8221; (John 14:10); &#8220;I and the Father who sent Me&#8221; (8:16); and &#8220;Yet I am not alone, because the Father is with Me&#8221; (16:32). We also said clearly that the Father, the Son, and the Spirit co-existed in the Old Testament. In terms of God&#8217;s move, the Old Testament age was the age of the Father. Nevertheless, the Son and the Spirit were also there. In terms of God&#8217;s move, it was the Son who moved and was processed. Yet when the Son moved, the Father was with Him. At the same time, the Spirit was also present as the essence within Him and the power upon Him. It was by the Spirit that He cast out demons and preached the gospel. Thus, all three were there. In the Epistles, it is the age of the Spirit, and it is the Spirit who is moving. Yet when the Spirit moves, He moves as the realization of Christ, and He also moves with the Father. Hence, in terms of Their existence and essence, regardless of which age it is, the three of the Divine Trinity always take the way of coexistence and coinherence. In terms of Their move, however, They are in succession: first the Father, then the Son, and then the Spirit.<p>The reason we initiated the lawsuit was to fight for the reputation of the Lord&#8217;s recovery. The changes made by the slanderers turned our teaching into the heresy of modalism. I have said repeatedly that we are not modalists. Although we say that the Son is the Father (Isa. 9:6) and that the Son became the Spirit (1 Cor. 15:45b), this is the teaching concerning the Trinity, not the teaching of modalism. In America, some teach modalism while others teach tritheism. But the Lord&#8217;s recovery is very balanced; we advocate neither modalism nor tritheism but emphasize the Trinity and speak in great detail about the essential Trinity and the economical Trinity. This may be quite new to the average theologian and professor in seminaries in America. In order to get a deeper understanding of this truth, some young brothers purposely have dived into all the theology from the age of the church fathers to the present time and found out all the truths related to the Divine Trinity.<p>Christianity has already been on the earth for two thousand years. Perhaps one day many of our young people will go to the West, especially to America, for propagation. We know that in America there is a lot of trouble when it comes to truth. It is a place where truth easily gives rise to debate. Therefore, every one of us has to study the truth in depth so that when the time comes, we can show our real aptitude.<br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_061.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_063.html">Next</a> </body></html>
