   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>After some days, we brought some to salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>When they needed to be baptized, the practical problem came.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Should they be baptized in the sea?</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Should they be baptized in the river?</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Or should they be baptized in a tub in a house?</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>If only a dozen people in the meeting were to express their opinions, the discussion would go on until the end of the world.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>If some were given the opportunity to express their opinion, they would propose baptizing them in the river.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Yet others would say that this is too troublesome, and that it is not a matter of form but a matter of spiritual reality, and as such, sprinkling is good enough.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>I do not have to go on.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>All of you brothers can realize that even with this small matter, if every brother and sister has a say, there will be no end of all the different kinds of discussion.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>What shall we do?</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Here again you see a practical problem.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>How should we solve these practical problems?</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Among the people of the world, they can solve problems by councils, but in the church, we cannot do what they do.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The people of the world can vote and contend with one another, but in the church we can never do this.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>It is unfortunate that in today's so-called Christianity, this is actually being practiced.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>This is indeed a disgrace!</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Some Christian organizations elect directors, deacons, and officials.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Those who wish to be elected would then privately run for their office.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Let me ask the brothers, "In God's church, can we tolerate such activity?"</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Absolutely not!</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Please remember, if we had an election, Paul, James, and John would all withdraw.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Only Judas would come out to run.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>If that were the case, the church would be administered by a group of people like Judas.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The more spiritual a person is and the more he knows the Lord, the more he is unwilling to win something for himself with his own hand.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Therefore, the system of councils will not work in the church.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Not only will elections be objectionable, but when brothers come together to discuss matters and there is a dispute, those who know God more will not want to contend; the more they know God, the more they will try to hold back their words.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Not until others have finished talking will they give God a chance to speak.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Therefore, it is clear that this way of election will not work.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Not only can we not find such an example in the Bible, but our spirit senses no peace in doing this.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>How then can we solve this problem?</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Spontaneously, the matter of authority comes in.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Praise the Lord, though such leading and teaching was not among us at the very beginning, yet in fact the matter of authority was there.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>This was the way we began in North China and in South China.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>In the North, during the early days, I did see such a condition.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>There was neither a council nor a discussion; spontaneously, authority was there.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>For instance, with the arrangement of chairs, when the brothers and sisters came together, there was no discussion or contention; spontaneously some would begin to share their feeling about the matter.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>After this, one or two brothers who were the authority would say, "Good.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>We will arrange our chairs this way."</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Once they spoke, no one would say anything more.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>When it was time for a baptism, another opportunity was given to brothers and sisters to share their feeling.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Some would say, "It is best to go to the river."</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Others would say, "The sea would be even better."</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Still others would say, "It is better to do it in a home."</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>However, in the end, a brother would finally stand up to speak, "According to our present condition, we only need a pool at someone's home."</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>By this time those who wanted to go to the sea would have nothing to say, and those who wanted to go to the river would also have nothing to say.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Everyone would serve happily together in the baptismal service.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>You can see authority here.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>I mention these few examples to show you that without authority, everything would be in disorder.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>With authority, everything will be on the track.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Consider the church in Taipei.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>There are more than eight thousand brothers and sisters on our list.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Regular attendance averages between two to three thousand.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>What is the way to manage such a large church?</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Here is fully the question of authority.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>I wish the brothers and sisters to see that to oversee a church, there is no way to avoid the question of authority.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Once we reject authority, it is better to have no church at all; it is better for you to be a Christian by yourself and for me to be one by myself.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>If the time is convenient, we can be acquainted with one another as friends.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>You can share with me what you read from the Scriptures one day, and I can share with you what I read from the Scriptures another day.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>You can invite me for dinner, and I can invite you to lunch.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>We can have this kind of so-called fellowship.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Without authority, our relationship can only come this far.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>If you want the church, however, there is no other way but to have administration.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Once there is administration, immediately there is the matter of authority.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>By this time, we should be clear that apart from the church, God's purpose can never be accomplished on earth.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Apart from the church, it would be difficult for God's children to receive God's grace and enjoy His riches.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>In order to fulfill these matters, there must be the church; otherwise, all will come to nothing.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>I believe the brothers and sisters can realize this without my speaking further.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>We must have the church; hence, we must have administration.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Certainly, what follows is that we must have authority.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>In order for the elders to administrate the church, there is no way to avoid authority.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Once they forsake authority, immediately there is no administration, and hence no church.</S>
