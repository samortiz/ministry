[1]  The Governing and Controlling Vision in the Bible the Economy of God
[2]  The Crystallized Significances of the Steps of God s Economy and of the Body of Christ
[3]  The Need of the Teaching Concerning God s Economy for the Shepherding of the Saints
[4]  The Bible has two big sections: the Old Testament and the New Testament.
[5]  The Old Testament includes types and prophecies, both of which are concerned with God s economy.
[6]  The first chapter of the New Testament shows God s incarnation, God becoming a man, and the last chapter shows the New Jerusalem.
[7]  The economy of God is of two sections: The first section begins with God becoming flesh, and the second section begins with this flesh, the last Adam, becoming the life-giving Spirit.
[8]  He said that the Lord Jesus became a man and was a man only until His resurrection, that at His resurrection He put off the man which He had put on in His incarnation, and that today in heaven He is not man but God only.
[9]  Christ as the only begotten Son of God has only divinity but no human element; however, in His second coming Christ is the firstborn Son of God who possesses both divinity and humanity as a God-man and who still has a human body.
[10]  Therefore, Romans 8:9-11 shows us that the Spirit of God, the Spirit of Christ, Christ, and the indwelling Spirit all four are one.
[11]  God s economy is that God became flesh, passed through human living, died, and resurrected; then He became the Spirit and entered into men to dispense God into them for their regeneration, issuing in the church.
[12]  Lord, without the Spirit we have no hope or deliverance; the One whom we look to is the Spirit.
[13]  After He experienced human living, Christ went to the cross and was crucified.
[14]  In general, most Christians would say that because Jesus loved us, He bore our sins and died on our behalf to redeem us.
[15]  On the negative side, His death terminated the old creation Rom 6:6 , including all persons and things related to the old creation: Satan Heb 2:14 , sin Rom 8:3b; John 1:29; Heb 9:26b, 28a , the world, John 12:31; Gal 6:14b , man s flesh Gal 5:24; Rom 8:3b , the law of the commandments in ordinances Eph 2:15a , and everything outside of God.
[16]  On the positive side, Christ s death released the divine life in Him as a basic factor of God s new creation.
[17]  In this resurrection the firstborn Son of God was produced, the many sons of God were simultaneously produced, and Christ Himself was made the life-giving Spirit.
[18]  We have seen that the vision in the Bible which governs and controls us is the economy of God.
[19]  The framework of the Body of Christ is the God-chosen and Christ-redeemed people, with whom the consummated Spirit of the Triune God mingles Himself to constitute the Body of Christ.
[20]  In the Body of Christ, in addition to the chosen and redeemed people, there is the transforming Spirit.
[21]  This transforming Spirit is the consummation of the Triune God, which is also the totality of the Triune God, comprising not only the Spirit Himself but also the elements of the Son and the Father.
[22]  Therefore, Ephesians 4:5, which is related to the Son, says, One Lord, one faith, one baptism.
[23]  Here in Ephesians, the Son is referred to as the Lord, as also in the book of Acts 2:36 ; the Lord is for His exercising of authority, for His headship.
[24]  The transforming Spirit transforms us gradually from within with Christ as the element that we, the redeemed, may become one with Christ and be mingled with Christ as one.
[25]  This Spirit, who is the consummation of the Triune God and who is also the pneumatic Christ, is in us 1 Cor 6:19 and is one with our spirit Rom 8:16 , transforming us with Christ as the element.
[26]  In the Body of Christ we have not only the transforming Spirit and Christ as the transforming element but also one God and Father.
[27]  OF THE BODY OF CHRIST The Oneness of the Body
[28]  The essential, crystallized significance of the Body of Christ is that the Triune God is constituted with His chosen and redeemed people to become a constitution, a constituted entity.
[29]  Unless we see this crystallized, essential significance of the Body of Christ, there will be no way to carry out what we are trying to do in the church today.
[30]  Prayer: O Lord, we thank You that because of Your grace we are here; we are gathered around You and by Your word.
[31]  The accomplishment of the economy of God is the New Jerusalem.
[32]  Luther saw only the truth concerning justification by faith; he did not have the revelation concerning God s economy.
[33]  Furthermore, Revelation 21 says that the light of the city is like a most precious stone, like a jasper stone v. 11 . It also says that the wall of the city is built with jasper v. 18 , having twelve foundations, and that the first foundation is also jasper v. 19 . According to Revelation 4, God is like a jasper stone and a sardius in appearance v. 3 . The red color of sardius signifies redemption and indicates that God is the God of redemption.
[34]  God s economy consummating in the New Jerusalem is the vision that the Lord has shown us in His Word, and it is also what we have been speaking throughout all these many years.
[35]  We may say that our speaking reached the peak of this vision in the Chinese New Year s conference last year, and it cannot go any higher because Revelation does not have chapter twenty-three, nor is there another book after Revelation.
[36]  In Ephesians chapter one he mentions the economy of God v. 10 , and again in chapter three he mentions the economy v. 9 . Today if you and I do not speak the economy of God and if we do not reach the peak of the economy of God, how can God achieve His purpose and accomplish His economy? Unless the work which you and I are doing is a part of the New Jerusalem, the New Jerusalem cannot be produced.
[37]  Let us come back to the economy of God.
[38]  In God s economy there are five great mysteries: first, the Triune God; second, Christ as the embodiment of God; third, the Spirit as the realization of Christ; fourth, the Body of Christ; and fifth, the New Jerusalem.
[39]  The first step of what the Triune God had passed through was His becoming flesh, the second step was His living the human life, the third step was His suffering of death, and the fourth step was His entering into resurrection.
[40]  Then the Lord said to Mary, Go to My brothers and say to them, I ascend to My Father and your Father, and My God and your God v. 17b . Previously, the most intimate term the Lord had used in reference to His disciples was friends 15:14-15 . But in the morning of His resurrection, the Lord regenerated all His disciples, including you and me, in His resurrection.
[41]  Rather, in the evening of His resurrection He came back to be with His disciples, and He appeared to them through a period of forty days and spoke the things concerning the kingdom of God John 20:19; Acts 1:3 to give them some private tutoring.
[42]  Today our Lord is God who became flesh and was transfigured into the Spirit.
[43]  In His resurrection He was transfigured to become the Spirit.
[44]  John chapter one says clearly that the Lord Jesus was the only Begotten of God v. 14 . Then, in the Epistles, Romans says that Christ is the firstborn Son of God among many brothers 8:29 . Hebrews says that when Christ comes again into the world, He will be sent by God as the Firstborn 1:6 . The process of the only begotten Son becoming the firstborn Son is not so simple; this process began with incarnation.
[45]  Paul points out clearly that this Son of God was One who came out of the seed of David according to the flesh and who was designated the Son of God in power according to the Spirit of holiness out of the resurrection of the dead.
[46]  The Spirit of holiness here does not refer to the person of the Holy Spirit of God but to the divine essence of Christ, the divinity of Christ.
[47]  After His resurrection Christ still possesses divinity and humanity, but His humanity has been uplifted and joined with His divinity through His resurrection.
[48]  When Christ was designated in His humanity to be the Son of God by the Spirit of holiness the divinity of Christ , we were also designated with Him as the many sons of God.
[49]  Brother Nee said that the reality of resurrection is the Holy Spirit, and the Holy Spirit is the reality of resurrection; without the Holy Spirit there is no resurrection.
[50]  Today, as God-men, we should live the God-man life, which is a life of the experience of death and resurrection, a life of the experience of the cross and the Spirit.
[51]  Prayer: Lord, You know that this meeting is both critical and crucial, so we need Your presence.
[52]  We must see that in order to have the church, the Body of Christ, the house of God, the kingdom of God, and the bride of Christ, death is necessary.
[53]  To be conformed to His death, as mentioned in Philippians 3:10, is to be made the same as the form of Christ s death, that is, to take Christ s death as the mold of our life.
[54]  In our daily living of the church life, the life of the Body of Christ, we need to be conformed to His death.
[55]  In order to experience death and resurrection we need to know the Spirit who is so wonderful.
[56]  He is the consummated Spirit, the Spirit compounded with God and man, with the person of Christ, divinity, humanity, death, resurrection, the effectiveness of death, and the power of resurrection.
[57]  Hence, this Spirit is the Spirit of Jesus Christ with a bountiful supply Phil 1:19 .
[58]  Furthermore, in Revelation, due to the church s desolation, God has intensified His Spirit sevenfold; therefore, the Spirit is also the sevenfold intensified Spirit.
[59]  Furthermore, in John 14 the Lord Jesus said, If anyone loves Me, he will keep My word, and My Father will love him, and We will come to him and make an abode with him v. 23 . Make an abode denotes building; this is to build God into man as man s dwelling place and to build man into God as God s dwelling place.
