   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Dear X:</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>I have received your letter of November 15, which was sent through Brother Yueh-chao.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Since you and Brother Nee have left Shanghai, I have been going on according to the principle of separation between the church and the work.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Last Lord's Day I delivered a message with much fear and trembling.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>I hope that Brother Tang Shou-ling and David Hsu will come to Shanghai, but they have not come, and I do not know where they are.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Letters take a long time, and communication is difficult.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>I hope that you will pray for us.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Please give my greetings to Brother Nee.</S>

   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Sister X:</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>I received your letter yesterday from Mr. Ho.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Presently, I am taking care of a women's meeting at the refugee camp in Jiao-Tung University.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The number is around forty, and the condition of the meeting is quite good.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>I spoke for three days and then had to stop because of a cold.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Some seminary students took my place and continued.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>We will see how the Lord leads us to go on.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>I have been using a series of hymns to teach the women to study the truth and to learn to read.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>I hope this series of meetings can last for a period of ten days.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>This is only the first attempt on my part to learn to do something.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>There are about twenty thousand refugees in the Jiao-Tung University refugee camp.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>They are all local people living in and around Shanghai.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The China Inland Mission workers have picked up part of the work from the International Relief Organization.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>They are preparing to have meetings for women and children, in addition to providing relief work.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>They expect me to render more help to the work there.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>This may be a good opportunity for me to do some work among the women.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Recently, I have been reading the biography of Mr. M ller and have received much help in the matter of guidance and trusting in God.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Since the Lord has put me on this frontline, I feel that I should follow those who are my seniors to go on in this one flow, even though I admit that I am far behind.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Sister Roh-chen wrote and told us that Sisters Yu and Lee are still in Hong Kong because they have had difficulty entering Yunnan.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>I wonder whether you already know about this?</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Sister Ding Shu-shin left for Singapore a few days ago, and Sister An-sin went to Hong Kong on the same steamer.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Peace to you in the Lord!</S>

   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>A Letter From James Chen, Swatow</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>My respected Brother X and Sister X in the Lord:</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>By the Lord's grace, I came to Swatow again on the nineteenth of last month and have been greatly encouraged through meeting the brothers and sisters here who are in tribulation.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Although many of the brothers and sisters have scattered into the inland regions, it is a comforting thought to realize that they are all preserved in the Lord's peace.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Recently, some heartbreaking events happened among us.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Brother Liu Liang-wei passed away, and a few days ago Sister Sun Pei-fang also went to be with the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Within a period of three months, we lost two precious believers, and our hearts were broken.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>It is surely excellent for those who have departed to be with the Lord, but the meeting in the Swatow cannot help but be affected by this.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>The door of the gospel around the Swatow and Chaochow regions is still open, and there is a calling from various places.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>I intend to go with a few brothers to labor in these places.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>But seeing the darkness all around and the coldness of man's heart, I wonder how a weak one like myself can meet the need.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>I ask you not to forget to pray for me so that the Lord can gain something, amen.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Peace to you in the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Brother James Chen</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>December 3</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Address omitted</S>
