<p>Sixth, we should not exercise control; that is, we should not hold things in our hands. Holding things in our hands is to control and rule. Everyone likes to control and hold things in his hands. The co-workers must learn to do a prevailing and effective work without holding the work in their hands. They must not hold the work in their hands. If someone wants to be a king, let him be a king, but we should not be kings; rather, we would only work. This is not easy. Even young people like to hold things in their hands. I have been doing the Lord&rsquo;s work for many years. Whether in China, Taiwan, the United States, or other places, very few people do not hold things in their hands. Nothing kills a person&rsquo;s work more than this kind of control. However, the more a person likes to hold things in his hands, the less authority he has and the less he gains, because holding things in one&rsquo;s hands violates the spiritual principle of being small. If we want to be great, we must first be small. We are great when we become small. A person who assumes to be great is never great. This is similar to the spiritual principle that we must give in order to gain. We cannot gain without giving. When we give, we gain.</p>
<p>Having the foolish desire to rule and to hold things in one&rsquo;s hands comes from our fallen human nature. In the work we ask only whether we have done our best. We do not want to rule or hold on to things. As soon as we desire to rule or to hold on to something, we have failed. The principles in the Bible are that we should give instead of receive, that we should be small instead of great, and that we should be humble rather than exalt ourselves (Acts 20:35; Luke 22:24-27; Matt. 11:29; James 4:6). Controlling and holding things in our hands involve seeking gain, being great, and exalting ourselves rather than giving, being small, and being humble. These violate the principle of the Lord&rsquo;s blessing in the Bible. Those who have left us because they wanted to be great and gain the world did not receive any blessing in their work; instead, their work quickly vanished. Therefore, we should not control, hold on to things, or exalt ourselves; instead, we should work in humility. I will never exalt myself in order to gain the respect of others. The more a person exalts himself, the less respect he will receive from others. The more a person humbles himself, the more respect he will receive from others.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Knowing Only to Work, to Minister Christ,<br />
and to Build Up the Church</h2>
<p>The last condition is that we know only to work, to minister Christ, and to build up the church, desiring nothing for ourselves.</p>
<p>If we diligently practice these seven points, our work will not be a failure; instead, it will be effective, and we will be preserved. Otherwise, our work will not be effective or last, and we will be damaged on our path of serving the Lord. A few among the first group of young people in Taiwan were very promising and hopeful. However, they were damaged along the way. This is not an outcome that we desired. These young ones did not have a goal or a definite vision; they were like troops fighting without a reasonable cause. As a result, they could not go on, and others did not see the Lord&rsquo;s blessing in them. We do not want to do a vain work; we want to be fruitful. Therefore, we must diligently practice having a vision, being purged, being broken, enjoying Christ, having insight without opinions, not exercising control, and knowing only to work, to minister Christ, and to build up the church. Such a practice will bring in the Lord&rsquo;s blessing. However, if we are loose in regard to any of these points, problems will arise.</p>
<h2 class="head1">QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS</h2>
<p><em>Question: I feel that these seven points are very hard. What should I do?</em></p>
<p>Answer: You feel that these points are hard because you have not practiced them. If you begin practicing them, you will no longer feel that they are hard. Do not focus on just a few points; practice all seven points. Then you will not feel that they are hard. The problems in our service to the Lord are due to a lack in practicing these seven points. If we see the vision of ministering Christ and building up the church, this vision will become our insight. However, we will bring problems into the service if we insist on our opinions instead of exercising and practicing these points. If we repent, confess to the Lord, and drop our insistence and opinions, the problems will disappear. The other serving ones and our environment are not the problem. Problems arise because we do not practice what we have heard. For example, a brother knows that he should not hold on to things in his hands or exercise control, but in the coordination he holds things and controls. His excuse is that he does not want others to mess things up. Those who take charge and hold things in their hands are likely to become like Uzzah, who reached out to hold up the Ark (2 Sam. 6:6-7). They will experience spiritual death. Often, others do not make a mess of things, but as soon as we take charge, things turn into a mess.</p>
<p><em>Question: I once rebuked a brother who handled a matter in a poor way, but he did not listen. What should I do?</em></p>
<p>Answer: Whether or not you should do anything depends on whether you are responsible for this matter. If someone else is responsible, you should let it go. Whether or not a brother listens, you should not insist. Instead, you need to consider whether you have overstepped. For example, because you think that it is better for the cover of our books to have rounded corners, you ask the serving ones why they do not print books with rounded corners. If you were in charge of printing our books, every book would have rounded corners. However, they are in charge of printing, so our books do not have rounded corners. We should not insist on our opinions. Whether or not our books have rounded corners, our purpose is to minister Christ. In general, we must not argue with others, and we must pray for the service and the serving ones. We should only minister life, minister Christ, and build up the church. If someone else is sitting behind the wheel, let him decide how to drive. Even if he constantly gets lost, you are not driving the car. When you drive the car, you can drive as you wish. If your passengers have opinions, you do not need to argue with them; just continue to drive according to your knowledge of the matter, not according to their opinions. When you arrive at the destination, they will shut their mouth. Ministering Christ and building up the church are our primary goal.</p>
<p>We should never argue. Even if we are right and others are wrong, we still must not argue. As long as we achieve the goal of ministering Christ and building up the church, others will have nothing to say. Hence, we must not be confused over what our goal is. The goal in our service is not to find out who is right or to win arguments. Consequently, we must learn the lesson of not arguing with others regarding right and wrong. We must not have opinions, but we need insight. We should stay focused on the goal of ministering Christ and building up the church. Then there will be no problems. When we are clear that our service is to minister Christ, we will not debate with others. Regardless of what others say, we can continue to preach the gospel, visit the saints, minister Christ, and bring the believers into the church in a solid way. We should not oppose the church, criticize the elders, or accuse the saints, nor should we stop our service. We should simply do our best.</p>
<p><em>Question: What does it mean to hold things in one&rsquo;s hands? Can you give an example?</em></p>
<p>Answer: Let us consider the printing service as an example. Suppose there is an arrangement for you to serve with others on printing. If you do not hold things in your hands, you will do your best to labor but not discourage others from participating. Often, however, when we do something, we put it in our pocket. This is a problem. When others want to participate, we push them away. This is what it means to hold things in our hands. The brothers may arrange for a few brothers to coordinate with you. Instead of coordinating, you blame the brothers for not knowing the situation and for sending too many people who do not know how to serve. You also claim that the brothers who have been asked to coordinate with you will only cause damage. These are excuses. The fact that you do not allow others to participate proves that you are holding things in your hands. Furthermore, when the brothers fellowship with you and express the desire for others to be involved, you say that you do not need any help. This is holding things in your hands. This is our condition as fallen men. When we take care of something, we want to keep it in our hands and under our control.</p>
<p>Many people can testify that I travel extensively and labor diligently throughout the year, but nothing is in my hands. By the Lord&rsquo;s mercy I realized in the beginning of my service that we should do our best in the work but refrain from controlling. The brothers who coordinated and served in the church in Chefoo know that I was strict in leading the church in Chefoo and that there was a prevailing work there. Every item related to the deacons&rsquo; office was neat and orderly. However, no matter how strict I was, no matters related to the church in Chefoo were held in my hands. When I later fell ill, I told the responsible brothers that I could no longer take care of the affairs of the church, but this did not create a problem for the church in Chefoo, because the brothers were responsible for everything; nothing was in my hands. I have served in many churches. The church in Taipei is another example. I have a deep relationship with the church in Taipei, but no matters related to the church in Taipei are in my hands. Even the Taiwan Gospel Book Room, which I set up, is not in my hands. This shows that I do not hold things in my hands and that I do not want to assert authority. As long as we do our best to minister Christ and build up the church, others will listen. The co-workers in some places do not fellowship with others and are secretive about what they are doing. They do not want to share the secrets of their work, because everything is in their hands. This is what it means to hold things in one&rsquo;s hands.</p>
<p>When we serve, we should both work and look for others to participate. If in Chefoo there had been some brothers or sisters who could have organized the deacons&rsquo; office, I would not have been involved. However, I had no choice, because initially no one could do it. Therefore, no one could say anything. If we know how to do something, we should do it in a way that shows others how to do it. If we do not know how to do something, we should learn from others. This is the way to be successful in whatever we do.</p>
<p>Someone who does not know how to conduct himself does not know how to do things and, therefore, does not know how to work. We must learn first how to conduct ourselves, then how to do things, and then how to work. This principle applies to everything. Those who are successful must be humble and willing to be taught; they must be willing to learn from others. Others often have superior methods, so we must learn from them. In the world people are afraid of competition, but in the Lord&rsquo;s work we should not be afraid of competition. If we fear that others will compete with us, our heart is not proper. The churches around the world can testify that nothing is in my hands. Hence, they welcome me, and I am very busy. If I held anything in my hands, no one would welcome me.</p>
<p><em>Question: When people are working together, how do they decide on a way through fellowship?</em></p>
<p>Answer: We often think that fellowship involves voting to follow the opinion of the majority. This is a wrong understanding of fellowship. Our work must be open. If others have better insight regarding the work, we should take their way. If our insight is better, there is no need to argue. When the work is accomplished, no one will say anything. Fellowship does not necessarily mean that we drop our way because no one agrees with our proposal. The Bible reveals that Paul insisted on certain things. For example, he did not want to take Mark, but Barnabas wanted to take him. Paul insisted on this matter (Acts 15:36-39), but his insistence was not a matter of opinion but rather of insight. Therefore, fellowship is not a matter of voting and following the opinion of the majority.</p>
<p>In the work there have been several important matters in which the brothers could not keep up with me, but I pressed forward. As a result, the church was blessed, and the brothers did not have anything to say. In another instance in 1959, however, I proposed to deal in a certain way with the brothers who caused the turmoil, but some co-workers did not have the same feeling. Therefore, I stopped. I later realized that if I had dealt with the matter forcefully, the result would not have been desirable.</p>
<p>If we have a clear view in our service and are able to determine that our actions will not result in serious problems or will not negatively affect the situation, we may continue. We must know the destination and know that we are taking the right way. We can continue driving if we know the goal and know that our actions will not complicate the issue or negatively affect the situation. If our actions will complicate the issue or negatively affect the situation, we should not insist on our way. Before operating on a patient, a surgeon first needs to know the patient&rsquo;s physical condition. If the surgery would lead to serious complications, the surgeon will cancel it immediately. Fellowship is not a means for finding the opinion of the majority; fellowship is a means for making things known to the members of the Body so that they can function according to their measure. If something needs to be done that the brothers cannot do, we can go ahead. Such an action would not be contrary to their fellowship, and no one should be offended. But if we disregard the feelings of others in our fellowship and do not allow them to participate, we will create conflicts.</p>
<p><em>Question: What should we do if someone insists on his opinion?</em></p>
<p>Answer: Whether we are younger or older, we need to avoid insisting on our opinions. The most harmful attitude is to love to be first, to want to be the head, and to disregard others&rsquo; suggestions. This is the principle of Diotrephes (3 John 9). In such a situation no one has a way, and the church is damaged. Furthermore, such ones are destroyed. Hence, we need to look to the Lord to keep us from becoming a Diotrephes.</p>
<h2 class="head1">CONCLUSION</h2>
<p>We need to help the brothers minister Christ and build up the church according to the vision. It is delightful to see that everyone&rsquo;s spirit is strong and that the meetings are full of mutual support and prayer. I hope that we will grow in the Lord. We are clear that the way to grow is to enter into the Lord&rsquo;s word. The Lord&rsquo;s word is living; His words are spirit and life (Heb. 4:12; John 6:63). We must enter into the Word by pray-reading. We must also exercise our spirit, blend in spirit, mingle in spirit, and live in our spirit. When we touch the Word and the Spirit, we will be living, joyful, and enriched, and we will grow. Furthermore, in the meetings we must speak and function so that the church may be built up.</p>
<p>Many older saints are not far behind the younger saints; they are endeavoring to exercise their spirit and to speak in the meetings. This is good. The current atmosphere of speaking and praying in the meetings in Taiwan has changed. There is no longer a long opening and a tedious closing. The opening and closing have been dropped so that everyone can eat and be satisfied. The more everyone speaks, the more the meeting is living and rich. A long testimony will bring the meeting down. Now we know that the way of life is for all the saints to enter into the Lord&rsquo;s word, to enjoy and experience the Lord in their spirit, and to speak in the meetings. This is the way for everyone to be living and perfected and for the church to be built up.</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_036.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_038.html">Next</a> </body></html>
