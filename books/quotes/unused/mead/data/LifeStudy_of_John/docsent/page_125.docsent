   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>D. The Branches, the Believers in the Son</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>No plant other than the vine tree can illustrate adequately the living relationship between us and the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>We are the branches of the vine.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>What kind of relationship does this suggest to you?</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The branches are good for nothing except to express the vine.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>All that the vine is and has is expressed through the branches.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Individually, the branches are the regenerated ones.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Corporately, they are the church, the Body of Christ Eph 1:22-23 .</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The branches, the believers in the Son, are for the expression of the Son with the Father through the fruit-bearing.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>E. The Fruit-bearing 1.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The Overflow of the Riches of the Inner Life</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>What is fruit-bearing?</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>It is the overflow of the riches of the inner life.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Do not try to bring people to Christ by your own effort.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Do not use schemes to win souls.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Bearing fruit is a matter of the overflow of your inner life.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>We need continuously to enjoy Christ as everything to us.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Then we shall have an abundance of inner life.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Out of this abundance of inner life there will be a flow that will reach others, penetrating into their lives.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>This flow will bear much fruit.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>It is not just preaching or soul-winning; it must be fruit-bearing by the overflow of the riches of the inner life.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>2.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>To Express the Father in the Son</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>This kind of fruit-bearing is the manifestation of the inner life.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The inner life of the vine is the riches of all that the Father is and has.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>This is to be manifested by the fruit-bearing of the vine.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Hence, the vine s fruit-bearing is to express the Father in the Son.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>3.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>To Satisfy Man s Thirst</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Fruit-bearing also satisfies man s thirst.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The vine tree bears fruit grapes.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Out of these grapes either wine or grape juice is made to quench people s thirst.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Today we must be so filled with the riches of Christ s life that we may be able to bear clusters of grapes that will produce either juice or wine to quench man s thirst.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>We all need to pray, Lord, may Your life flow out of me to quench others thirst.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>4.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>By Abiding in the Vine</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>and Letting the Vine Abide in the Branches</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The fruit-bearing comes about as the branches abide in the vine and let the vine abide in the branches.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>In John 15 abiding is a crucial matter.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Everything in this chapter depends upon the abiding.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The real abiding depends upon a clear vision, a clear seeing, that you are a branch.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Once you see that you are a branch, it will be difficult for you to stay away from the vine.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>You will want to remain in the vine.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>This remaining is the abiding.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Do not try to abide, for the more you try, the more you will fall away.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>We need to pray, Lord, show me clearly that I am one of the branches.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>I believe that one day the Lord will show you.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>You will see that you are one of the branches and you will say, Praise the Lord, I am one of the branches.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Then you will abide in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>As long as you abide in Him, He will abide in you.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>His abiding in us depends upon our abiding in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Our abiding is the condition of His abiding, but His abiding in us is not a condition of our abiding in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Nothing is conditional with Him, but with us, because we are so fluctuating, there is the need of a condition.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>If we do not abide in Him, there is no way for Him to abide in us.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Although He does not change, we have many changes.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>We may abide in Him today and run away from Him tomorrow.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Therefore, His abiding in us depends upon our abiding in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Our abiding in Him is the condition of His abiding in us.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>So the Lord says, Abide in Me and I in you.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>If we abide in Him, He will certainly abide in us.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>If we do not abide in Him, we fail to meet the condition of His abiding in us.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>His abiding depends upon our abiding.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>This mutual abiding will bring forth fruit.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>5.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>In a Corporate Way</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>All the branches that bear the fruit are related one to another.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>By their abiding in the vine, none of them bears fruit in the way of being separate from the tree.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>All of them bear fruit by the same life that circulates in them.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Apparently, each one of them bears fruit separately; actually, all of them bear fruit corporately in one tree and with one life.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Today our fruit-bearing must be like this, in one Body and with one life.</S>
