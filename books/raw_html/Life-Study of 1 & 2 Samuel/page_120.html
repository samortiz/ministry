<H2 CLASS=HEAD1>GOD'S DYNAMIC SALVATION<br>BEING THE TRIUNE GOD HIMSELF PROCESSED<br>TO BECOME THE CONDENSED, CONSUMMATED,<br>LIFE-GIVING, ALL-INCLUSIVE SPIRIT</H2><P>Being a Christian is not a matter of adjusting ourselves or improving ourselves. Such things are something of religion and have nothing to do with God's dynamic salvation. God's dynamic salvation is just the Triune God Himself passing through the processes to become the condensed, consummated, life-giving, all-inclusive Spirit. As such a One He can be contacted through our prayer from our spirit. When we pray even a little from our spirit, we contact this all-inclusive Spirit. He is real, genuine, living, fresh, and moving. He is God the Father, God the Son, and God the Spirit. He is the Redeemer and the Savior. He is life and everything to us. He is even us. He has become us in order to make us Him. This is God's dynamic salvation.</P><P>God's intention from eternity to eternity is to make Himself us, that we might become Him in life, in nature, and in constitution (but not in the Godhead). This is actually the prophecy in 2 Samuel 7 concerning the seed of David who is called the Son of God. He is divine as well as human; He is human as well as divine. He, the firstborn Son of God, is our elder Brother, and we, His many brothers, are the many sons of God. In God's dynamic salvation there is no need for us to adjust ourselves or improve ourselves. What we need is for this One to be wrought into us through the metabolic process of transformation. Through this process He will move in us and gradually transform us into His image (2 Cor. 3:18) until we are fully the same as He in life, in nature, and in constitution. This is God's salvation, and this is the revelation in the Bible.</P>
