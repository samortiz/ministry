   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>FURTHER DANGERS</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In the life of walking according to the spirit, spiritual believers should be aware of other dangers besides the disguise of Satan and his various attacks.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Many times our own soul, for reasons of its own without the counterfeiting of the evil spirit , initiates a certain feeling to prompt us to act.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>A believer must know that his body has feelings, his soul has feelings, and his spirit also has feelings.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Not all feelings are from the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Therefore, it is extremely important not to mistake the feelings from the soul or the body for the intuition of the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>In his daily experience, a believer must learn what really is his intuition and what is not.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>It is easy for a believer, after realizing the importance of following the intuition, to forget that other parts of his being besides his spirit have feelings, and thus he falls into error.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>A genuine spiritual living is not as difficult as some would think; in fact, it is rather simple.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>However, it is also not as easy as some may consider because it also has complex areas.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Here are two difficulties: first, we mistake other feelings as the intuition of the spirit; second, we misunderstand the meaning of the intuition.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Such difficulties are often encountered in our daily life.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Therefore, the teachings of the Bible not verses randomly picked are crucial.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>To prove whether the stirring within us and our intended actions are from the Holy Spirit, we need to check if this matter agrees with the teachings of the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>It is impossible for the Holy Spirit to inspire the prophets to write the Scriptures in one way, and then move in us in another way today.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>It is impossible that what the Holy Spirit has forbidden to others would be permissible to us today.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The intuition in our spirit must be confirmed by the teachings of the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>By simply following the intuition and not the Bible, one will definitely go wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The revelation of the Holy Spirit sensed in our spirit perfectly matches the revelation of the Holy Spirit in the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Our flesh likes to exercise its power everywhere.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Therefore, we must be watchful of its incursions even while we are following the teachings of the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>We know that the Bible completely reveals the mind of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Therefore, we think that if we absolutely follow the Bible, we surely must be in accordance with the desire of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Not so!</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Many times a believer can use his own natural mental ability to search the doctrines of the Bible and, having understood, can determine to act accordingly.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>In this situation, there is the danger of comprehending and executing through the fleshly power.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Although what was understood and carried out is completely according to the Bible, there was absolutely no reliance on the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Instead, it was totally in the realm of the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Not only should the intent of the Holy Spirit, as understood in our spirit, be confirmed by the Bible, but even the Scriptures, as understood by us, should be executed through the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>We should realize that even in the matter of following the Bible, the flesh desires to be first!</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The spirit has not only the intuition but also the power.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>If the doctrines that we understand in our minds are not executed through the power of the spirit, they have no spiritual value at all.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>One more matter requires our attention.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>There is a great danger for us to live excessively by our own spirit or walk excessively according to our own spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Although the Bible attaches great importance to the individual spirit of the believer, we may fall into the danger of being extreme.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The importance of a believer's spirit is due to its being indwellt by the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>We live and walk according to the spirit because this spirit is indwelt by the Holy Spirit, who makes known His will through our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The guidance and restriction we receive are the guidance and restriction of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Since the Holy Spirit moves through our spirit when we pay much attention it, we also pay considerable attention to our spirit, an organ usable by Him.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>But there is a danger, having understood the work and function of the human spirit, of relying solely on the spirit and forgetting that it is merely a servant of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The One that we directly look to for leading us into all truth is not our spirit but the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>We must realize that apart from the Holy Spirit, the human spirit is just as useless as the other parts of our being.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>We must never reverse the positions of the human spirit and the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>We have spoken in great detail of the human spirit only because believers today hardly know its functions.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>This does not mean that the position of the Holy Spirit within man is lower than that of the human spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>We need to understand the human spirit in order that we may better know how to obey and exalt the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>This is greatly related to receiving guidance.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>From the beginning, the imparting of the Holy Spirit is meant for the entire Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>The indwelling of the Holy Spirit in the individual believer is due to His indwelling in the entire Body of Christ, because a believer is a member in the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>The work of the Holy Spirit is of a corporate nature 1 Cor 12:12 .</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>He guides individuals because He guides the whole Body.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>The guidance of the individual is for the whole Body.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>The actions of a member affect the entire Body.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>The leading of the Holy Spirit in our spirit individually must be related to the other members.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>All spiritual leadings are the leading of the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Therefore, even though we may have the leading individually in our spirit, we still should seek the concurrence, the proof, and the sympathy from the spirit of "two or three" other members.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Such actions in the relatedness of the Body must never be neglected in a spiritual work.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Much of the failure, fighting, hatred, division, shame, and pain is due to believers with good intentions , who acted alone according to their own spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Hence, all the believers following the spirit ought to judge whether their guidance comes from the Holy Spirit according to the relatedness of the spiritual Body.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Our work, actions, faith, and teachings must be by the relatedness of the members.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>In his last journey to Jerusalem, the apostle Paul fell into this mistake.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>God allowed His best apostle to err in order to teach us.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>In Paul's mistake, God was especially merciful to cover him.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Only out of this mistake could he witness at Rome and have time to write so many Epistles.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Paul thought that he was "bound in the spirit" Acts 20:22 to go up, but the Bible says that the disciples at Tyre, who were moved by the Holy Spirit, told him not to go up Acts 21:4 .</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Although we know that God was especially merciful to cover the apostle in this failure, we should see the principle of God's leading not only is it of the individual but also of the corporate body.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>A spiritual believer should know when to go on alone, without regard to others' advice, and when to listen to his brothers.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>In summary, there are many traps along the roadside of the spiritual path.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>A little carelessness can defeat a believer.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>We have no shortcuts.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Learning a little knowledge cannot safeguard us forever.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>On the contrary, everything must be personally experienced by us.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Those who were before us can only point out the coming dangers to save us from falling.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>There is no such thing as expecting certain methods to help us bypass considerable travel on the spiritual path.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>Faithful followers of the Lord will always see fewer unnecessary failures.</S>
