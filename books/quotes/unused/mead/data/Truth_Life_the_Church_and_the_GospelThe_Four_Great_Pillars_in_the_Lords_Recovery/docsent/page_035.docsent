   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER TEN THE FOURTH GREAT PILLAR</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>IN THE LORD S RECOVERY THE GOSPEL Scripture Reading: Rom 1:14-15; 1 Cor 9:16-17; 2 Tim 4:2a; Acts 6:4; 5:42; 10:24 THE COMPLETE AND FULL GOSPEL OF GOD</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The four pillars in the Lord s recovery are the truth, life, the church, and the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The truth brings us life, life produces the church, and the church is responsible for the preaching of the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Christians today have a very superficial view of the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>They think that the gospel tells people that they are sinners and will perish after death but that God loved the world and gave His only begotten Son to save them He was crucified to bear the sin of the world so that if they repent and believe in Him, they will not perish but will have eternal life and enjoy peace in the future, and they will also enjoy prosperity and peace in this age.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>We cannot say that this kind of a gospel is wrong, but it is superficial and very poor.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The book of Romans, written by the apostle Paul, consists of sixteen chapters, and each chapter contains the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>In 1:14-15 Paul says that he is a debtor both to Greeks and to barbarians, both to wise and to foolish, and that, for his part, he is ready to announce the gospel to the Gentiles.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>In the gospel Paul preached, which is the whole book of Romans, there is no mention of perdition, heaven, or prosperity and peace.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Instead, Paul first speaks of justification, then sanctification, then the Body of Christ, and last of the local churches in every place.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>This means that even the local churches are a part of the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>We must see that if what we preach is merely about escaping perdition and going to heaven, then we are preaching the poorest gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>We must preach the gospel in a way that allows people to clearly see that once they believe in the Lord, their sins will be forgiven, and they will be redeemed and justified by God, reconciled to God, and accepted by God.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>They should also see that at the same time they will be regenerated in their spirit, have God s life and nature, and have God dwelling in their spirit to renew them day by day and transform them moment by moment.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>This is so that they may be conformed to the image of His Son and eventually reach the maturity in life and be fully glorified as the sons of God.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Furthermore, they should see that although they are sinners, they will become sons of God.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>At the same time, they are members of Christ, coordinating together to constitute the Body of Christ, which is the testimony, the riches, and the expression of Christ expressed practically on the earth as the local churches.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>This is the gospel in Romans.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>In the New Testament there are not only the four Gospels of Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John but also the gospels of Acts and Romans.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>In Romans 1 Paul tells us that he preached this book as the gospel to the Romans, the Gentiles.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>This book is concerning the complete gospel of God, beginning with forgiveness of sins, passing through sanctification, transformation, and the constitution of the Body of Christ, and eventually arriving at the living of the church life in the churches.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Romans 8 is the center of Paul s gospel, which is concerning the Triune God dispensing Himself into the tripartite man.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Hence, in this chapter Paul mentions the Father, the Son, and the Spirit vv.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>9-11 .</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>God is the Triune God the Father, the Son, and the Spirit for the purpose of dispensing Himself into man.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>We human beings are tripartite, having a spirit, soul, and body.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Our mind occupies a great part of our soul.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Romans 8 tells us that the Triune God first enters into our spirit v. 10 , then saturates our mind from our spirit, that is, enters into our soul v. 6 , and then enters into our body, giving life to our mortal bodies v. 11 . In this way, our tripartite being our spirit, soul, and body is filled with God.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>This is the center of Romans 8 and of the entire book of Romans as well.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>This is the gospel of God.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Do not think that the gospel is one thing and that the truth is another thing.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The truth is the gospel, and our preaching of the truth is the preaching of the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>To preach the gospel is not to tell people about escaping perdition and going to heaven nor to tell them about prosperity and peace.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>It is to tell people about God, about Christ Jesus, and about the church.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>In other words, to preach the gospel is to tell people that God wants to enter into man and make sinners sons of God, that these sons of God are living members of Christ for the constitution of the church, and that these ones are in the church, which is expressed in different localities, so that they can live the church life in the local churches.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>THE TRUTH BEING THE GOSPEL</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Unfortunately, today most Christians have a mistaken view concerning the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Their view of the gospel is too superficial and limited.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Sometimes we make a distinction between the meetings for gospel preaching and the meetings for preaching the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>When we are in a gospel meeting, we spontaneously preach the gospel, and when we are in an edification meeting, we preach the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Actually, this is altogether wrong, because the truth is the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Take the Gospel of John for example.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>This Gospel begins with God: In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God....In Him was life, and the life was the light of men....And the Word became flesh and tabernacled among us and we beheld His glory, glory as of the only Begotten from the Father , full of grace and reality....For of His fullness we have all received, and grace upon grace....No one has ever seen God; the only begotten Son, who is in the bosom of the Father, He has declared Him 1:1, 4, 14, 16, 18 .</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>This is the gospel we should preach.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>In their preaching of the gospel, many people do not have the boldness to preach In the beginning was the Word as John did, because they do not know the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>What is the meaning of the beginning ?</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Not only are those who listen to the gospel unable to understand this, even those who preach the gospel do not know what this means.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Moreover, in the Chinese Union Version, Word is rendered as truth.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Then what is truth?</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Confucius said, Truth is something so valuable that one is willing to die soon after learning it.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Is this truth the same as the Word mentioned in John?</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>If not, then what is the Word?</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>The Gospel of John begins with, In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God....In Him was life, and the life was the light of men....And the Word became flesh and tabernacled among us...full of grace and reality vv.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>1, 4, 14 .</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>It may seem that people will not be able to understand the truth, but we cannot say that they will not understand any of it.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>John knew a secret the secret that as long as he continued to speak, people would eventually understand.</S>
