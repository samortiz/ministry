To Moses, the first function of a rod was for shepherding the flock. Later, it was used for leading the Israelites on in their journey. At that time Moses was eighty years of age. The rod was his support, a necessity for his existence. Although we may not have an actual rod in our hands, we all have something upon which our livelihood depends. A merchant may have his business as a rod. A student may have his studies as a rod. A wife may have her husband as a rod. Our rod is what we depend upon. It is our very support. We have many rods. They may be our parents, education, business, or money. These can be very useful and can be of service to the Lord. But once we touch God, we will see that these rods upon which our livelihood depends must be cast to the ground.</p><p>From my own calling and from the calling of other useful servants of the Lord, I can see that in order for a man to be used by the Lord, he must first cast away the rod he holds in his hand. Once the rod is cast on the ground, the serpent hidden behind the rod is exposed. The serpent is hidden behind the rod all the time. By casting the rod on the ground, the true form of the serpent is exposed. This miracle shows us that under God's shining and the operation of His power, the rod of our support is exposed of its true serpentine nature. The serpent has been coming to us in disguise from the beginning. From the Old Testament until the time of Revelation, the serpent always disguises himself behind, below, or between certain things. His goal is to occupy and usurp the man created for God's own purpose. In Moses' eyes the rod was his support, but in God's eyes it was the embodiment of Satan. Its purpose was to occupy and usurp man.</p><p>When Moses cast the rod down and saw that it had become a serpent, he fled from it. He dared not touch it. God told him to take the serpent by the tail, and the serpent became a rod in his hand once again. Before this time, Moses had been holding that rod for many years. It was something very precious to him. But when he cast it on the ground, he discovered that it was a serpent, something that had occupied him for many years. This experience showed him that his past support was nothing but a serpent, something that was hurting him.</p><p>Please notice that God did not tell Moses to discard the rod, but to cast it on the ground. The purpose of this casting was to reveal the true nature of the rod. Then God told Moses to take the rod, which had become the serpent, by the tail. In Nanking one responsible brother was a businessman. Later he saw the danger of going into business, and he dared not touch it again. But God does not say to discard the rod, but to take it by the tail. We must still have the rod, but we have to take it by the tail. In the past the rod was our center. Today the Lord has to be our center. In the past we struggled for our living. Today we strive for the gospel.</p><p>In the province of Shangtung, an elderly brother once said that his wife, his lifelong companion, was an old serpent, and his children were little serpents. He was ensnared and could not serve the Lord or consecrate himself to the gospel freely. He became afraid of the serpents and dared not take them up by the tail. But the Lord does not tell us to discard the rod and give it up forever. It is easy to drop the rod. It is easy to migrate to northwest China for the gospel and to leave the wife, the children, and all the serpents, large and small, behind. But the Lord does not tell us to do this. Instead, He wants us to put forth our hand and take the serpent by the tail. After the true nature of the hidden serpent is exposed, we have to grab it by the tail. This is the best way to deal with the serpent. If we take a serpent by the head, it will bite us. But if we can turn it around and take it by the tail, it will lose its power and become limp. In the end it will become a channel through which we exercise our authority; it will control us no longer (Exo. 4:4, 17; Luke 10:19). If we cannot take it by the tail, we will not have any authority.</p><p>The four Gospels say that in order to follow the Lord, we have to forsake our parents, children, etc. (Matt. 19:29). In the Epistles, Paul says that we have to love our parents and honor them (Eph. 6:1-3). The forsaking in the Gospels is the casting down of the rod, while the teaching in Ephesians is the taking up of the rod by the tail. This rod becomes the rod of authority. Eventually, Moses performed all the miracles in Egypt and led the children of Israel out of Egypt with this rod.</p><p>Over two hundred brothers and sisters have handed themselves over in the church in Hong Kong. The first lesson you have to learn is to cast all that you have and all your support on the ground and then take it by the tail.</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_026.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_028.html">Next</a> </body></html>
