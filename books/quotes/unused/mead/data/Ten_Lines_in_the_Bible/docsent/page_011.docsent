   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The Red Sea typifies the death of the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Just as the blood of the lamb typifies the death of the Lord Jesus, the Red Sea also typifies the death of the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>In the shedding of the blood of the lamb, God s wrath passed over His people.</S>

   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>They were delivered from the judgment of God, the usurpation of the world, and the bondage of Satan, and they also had an inward supply of life.</S>

   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>After God s people were saved, they journeyed forward, yet no part of their journey was without hardship; everything was a trial.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>However, the Lord Jesus who died on a wooden cross, on a tree, is able to turn our bitter water and bitter situations sweet, like at Marah.</S>

   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>In our journey of following God, the Lord Jesus is the Intercessor and the Fighter for God s people.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>In Exodus 17, as Moses was praying on the hill, Joshua was fighting in the plains.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>In this way they defeated Amalek, the enemy of God s people.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>This tells us that as we follow God in our journey forward, the Lord Jesus is our Intercessor on the one hand, and on the other hand He is our Fighter, who overcomes the enemies for us, especially overcoming our flesh.</S>

   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>In our journey of following God, we God s people sin against God so frequently that we often bring ourselves into a death situation; therefore, we need a healing of deliverance.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>In Numbers 21, the children of Israel committed a sin worthy of death, but God caused them to receive healing and spared them from death through the bronze serpent lifted up on a pole.</S>

   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>As we go through trials and bitter sufferings, He causes us to sense His sweetness.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>In our need for daily supply, He is our manna.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>In our need for living water, He is our spiritual Rock.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>As we encounter enemies, He prays and fights for us.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>When we sin against God, committing a sin worthy of death, He becomes our healing.</S>
