<h2 class="head2">Our Need of Reference Books<br />
and the Proper Spiritual Writings</h2>
<p>Reading through the Word of God in this way does not mean that we should read without help from reference books. Without the proper references it is difficult to understand the Bible. We cannot understand the Bible through our own thought alone. Often we may find a word that we do not understand properly. Instead of relying on our own consideration in deciding on the correct denotation of the word, we should consult the proper reference books.</p>
<p>Colossians 3:16 says, &ldquo;Let the word of Christ dwell in you richly.&rdquo; We need to let the word of Christ, the Bible, dwell in us richly. At the same time we should also read the proper spiritual writings. In the Lord&rsquo;s recovery there are many worthwhile publications. A number of good books have been written by other writers also over the past nineteen centuries. Brother Nee took the lead to read many of these books and laid a good foundation for us in knowing the best ones. After Brother Nee, we continued to read the proper writings, and we now have an accurate understanding concerning which books are the most profitable.</p>
<p>To be a proper person in society, we must be educated for many years. We need to study for approximately seventeen years in order to receive a bachelor&rsquo;s degree. To receive one or more advanced degrees requires two to six more years of study. This is not a waste of our time. If we do not study for the required number of years, our education will be inadequate. It is the same in the spiritual life. My intention in setting up the full-time training is not to teach people a set of beliefs and practices as the seminaries of the denominations do; it is to help the saints to know life and to have the proper knowledge of the holy Word. In order to have the proper knowledge, we must read the Bible, the publications in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery, and the proper spiritual writings of others. By doing so we will be helped, built up, and equipped not only in life but also in truth. Then our presence in the group meetings will be a great benefit.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Answering Questions according to Our Learning</h2>
<p>During the teaching in a group meeting, someone may ask an important question, such as, &ldquo;What is the most crucial point in the Bible?&rdquo; We should all pay our full attention to a question of this nature and answer it in an all-inclusive way. One brother may say, &ldquo;The entire Bible unveils to us that the Triune God, after being processed, has become life to the tripartite man for the fulfillment of His eternal economy concerning the church.&rdquo; This answer covers the entire Bible. It requires much explanation, so a second brother can explain how the Triune God was processed, a third can speak regarding what it means for God to become life to man, and a fourth can give a word about the tripartite man. Then a fifth brother can speak something concerning God&rsquo;s eternal economy, a sixth can speak concerning the church as the Body of the One who fills all in all, and a seventh can speak a word concerning the fulfillment of God&rsquo;s eternal economy. In this way, the first answer can be followed by six or seven teachings. After that, there may be many other smaller portions given as part of such a combined teaching. If the teaching in a group meeting reaches this standard, the church in that locality will be strong and high. To answer a question in this way, however, requires much reading of the Scriptures and of the proper spiritual publications and the receiving of the divine revelations.</p>
<p>Other questions may be asked that restrict the fellowship in the meeting instead of releasing it. For example, in a group meeting a sister may ask what head covering is. This question should not be rejected, but it must be answered in a way that will turn a somewhat &ldquo;cold&rdquo; subject such as head covering into a &ldquo;warm&rdquo; one. How well we can do this depends on our ability, which comes out of our capacity. If we have studied the Bible and the proper publications, we can turn a &ldquo;hard&rdquo; subject into a &ldquo;soft&rdquo; one. In answering a question concerning head covering, we should not speak merely about the covering on a sister&rsquo;s head. Rather, we may begin by saying, &ldquo;Sister, this is a good question, because it touches God&rsquo;s headship.&rdquo; Such a word, spoken in a pleasant tone, will &ldquo;warm up&rdquo; the meeting. We can then go on to speak from several angles concerning our being subject to God.</p>
<h2 class="head1">OUR NEED OF PROGRESS AND ADVANCEMENT</h2>
<p>Regardless of how much we can do in the group meetings, we will often feel that we are inadequate. This indicates that we all need much learning. In the old way of meeting, we came together year-round with little improvement. The meetings were repetitious and uninteresting, and they were full of oldness and staleness. In the group meetings in the new way, it should not be like this. There should be something new in each meeting. However, we should not depend on all the attendants in the group meetings to produce something new. Out of ten attendants there may be only one or two who can cause the atmosphere to be uplifted and refreshing. We must be this kind of person. For this we need not only the proper knowledge but also the experience and the excelling way to present what we have. This means that we must learn.</p>
<p>I do not like to see the churches always remain the same. We need to progress, and we need to advance. We need to advance in knowledge, and we need to advance in the way in which we present what we have. We should not tell people that we have taken the new way, and yet we ourselves remain the same. Concerning life Paul said, &ldquo;We also should walk in newness of life&rdquo; (Rom. 6:4), and concerning service he said, &ldquo;We should serve as slaves in newness of spirit&rdquo; (Rom. 7:6).</p>
<p>It is easy to be a Christian in the old, traditional way. In the old way there is little requirement or demand, but in the new way there is a great demand. However, we should not be anxious about this. If we were not able to meet the demand, the Lord would not require it of us. The fact that He requires something of us and charges us to do it indicates that He will also carry it out (1 Thes. 5:24). We have seen the positive results of the new way, but there is still the need for greater improvement.</p>
