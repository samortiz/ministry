<H2 CLASS=HEAD5>10) God's Blessing</H2><P>Now we must consider God's blessing. God blessed Laban because of Jacob (30:27, 30). Through His blessing, God preserved Jacob from Laban's squeeze (31:7-12, 16, 42). We must bow down, worship God, and learn the lesson not to care for how much we are squeezed by others. As God's chosen people, we are under His blessing. Although others may squeeze us, we do not need to play tricks on them. The more tricks we play, the more squeezing we shall suffer. But whether or not we play tricks, the blessing will be ours because we are destined for it.</P><P>Jacob began to play tricks in his mother's womb and he did not stop until he was transformed. Only when we come to the last few chapters of Genesis do we see that Jacob had ceased playing tricks. After Jacob had been transformed into a prince of God, he no longer played any tricks. In like manner, only after we have been fully dealt with and transformed will we stop playing tricks.</P><P>As we have pointed out, in this record there are three main parties: the squeezing party, the trick-playing party, and the blessing party. God might have told Laban, "Laban, I shall use your squeeze as a means to transform Jacob, My chosen one. You cannot rob him of My blessing. The more you squeeze him, the more I shall bless him." Moreover, God might have said to Jacob, "Jacob, you did not become rich because of your tricks, but because of My sovereign blessing. You put the white cattle in front of the striped branches, but the dream indicates that the results did not come because of your tricks. In My eyes, the white cattle were actually speckled, spotted, and striped cattle. My sovereign blessing, not your tricks, has made you rich. We all must learn not to fear any environment or squeezing and not to play tricks. Although you may continue to play tricks on others, one day your trick-playing nature will be dealt with.</P><P>Although Jacob was tricky, God still blessed him. In the dream, God did not rebuke him; rather, He comforted him, saying, "I have seen all that Laban doeth unto thee" (31:12). God saw Jacob's suffering and affliction under Laban's hand and seemed to say, "I am the God of Bethel, the God of your father. I shall take care of you." As we read this record, we see that God did not care for what Jacob did; He only cared for His purpose. All that God did was for Jacob's building up and transformation.</P>
