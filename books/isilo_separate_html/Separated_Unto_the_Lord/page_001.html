Whether or not a person consecrates himself depends on whether he has a healthy salvation experience. If he views his faith in the Lord Jesus as being a favor to the Lord and his faith in God as a courtesy to Him, it will be impossible to talk to him about consecration. It is equally futile to talk about consecration to a person who feels that he is promoting the cause of Christianity and that his conversion is a great honor to it. Such a one does not have a good start in his Christian faith; he does not have a good beginning. It is impossible to expect him to consecrate himself. We must realize that it is the Lord who has graced us and granted mercy to us. It is the Lord who loves us and has saved us. This is why we consecrate our all to Him.<h2 class=head1>THE BASIS OF CONSECRATION</h2><p>Second Corinthians 5:14-15 clearly shows us that the constraining power of the Lord&#8217;s love is the basis for God&#8217;s children to live unto Him who died for them and has been raised. A man lives unto the Lord because he is constrained by the Lord&#8217;s love. According to the original language, the word constrained can be translated &#8220;pressed on from all sides,&#8221; that is, tightly confined on all sides. It means to be tightly bound and wrapped up. Love has bound us up, and we cannot run away. When a person is in love, he will have a sense of bondage. We are bound by Him; we have no way out. He has died for us, and we should live unto Him today. Hence, love is the basis of consecration. A man consecrates himself to the Lord because of the Lord&#8217;s love. No one can consecrate himself unless he first touches the Lord&#8217;s love. A man must touch the Lord&#8217;s love before he can consecrate himself to Him. When one touches the Lord&#8217;s love, consecration spontaneously follows.<p>Consecration is based on the Lord&#8217;s love. But it is also based on the Lord&#8217;s right. This is the truth revealed in 1 Corinthians 6:19-20: &#8220;You are not your own...For you have been bought with a price.&#8221; Our Lord gave His own life for us; He even became the ransom to purchase us back to Himself. We are those who are purchased by the Lord. Because the Lord has redeemed us, we willingly lose our own freedom for Him. We are no longer our own; we are the Lord&#8217;s. We must glorify God in our bodies because we are not our own; we have been bought by the Lord with a price. The blood which the Lord shed on the cross is the price He paid. Therefore, as far as the Lord&#8217;s right is concerned, we belong to the Lord.<p>We must be clear that we are those purchased by the Lord. He has purchased us with the highest price. He bought us, not with silver or gold, but with His own blood. Here we see the Lord&#8217;s love as well as His right. We serve the Lord because He loves us, and we follow Him because He has a right over us. The right secured through redemption constrains us to give ourselves to the Lord. The love that results from redemption also constrains us to give ourselves to Him. The basis of consecration is His right as well as His love. It is a legal right, and it is beyond all human sentimental love. These are the two reasons that we have to give ourselves to the Lord.<h2 class=head1>THE MEANING OF CONSECRATION</h2><p>Merely being constrained by love or acknowledging His legal right does not constitute consecration. After a person has been constrained by the Lord&#8217;s love and has acknowledged His right, there is a further step that he should take. This step will bring him on to a new position. Through the Lord&#8217;s constraining and based on His purchase, we separate ourselves from every other thing. Henceforth, we live for and unto the Lord. This is consecration. In some instances in the Old Testament, the Chinese Union Version translates the word consecration as &#8220;the receiving of the holy service.&#8221; To receive the holy service is to receive the ministry of service to God. This is a holy service. This is consecration. Consecration is receiving the ministry of serving God. It is to say to the Lord, &#8220;Today I will separate myself from everything to serve You, because You have loved me.&#8221;<br>Home | Prev | <a href="page_002.html">Next</a> </body></html>
