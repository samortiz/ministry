   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>He Was Begotten with His Humanity in Resurrection to Be the Firstborn Son of God with Many Brothers</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Christ was begotten with His humanity in resurrection to be the firstborn Son of God with many brothers.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Is not the Lord Jesus the only begotten Son of God?</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Why then is He also the firstborn Son of God?</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>How can this be?</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>If you ask Christian teachers, you can hardly find one who is able to answer these questions.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Most likely they will tell you not to be too particular about this matter and that nevertheless He is the Son of God.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>I asked my pastor about this when I was young.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>He said, "Don't ask anymore; your head is too big.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Anyway, it is too hard to explain what is meant by the firstborn Son of God and the only begotten Son of God."</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Actually, the light in the Scriptures concerning this matter is very clear.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Quoting from Psalm 2, Acts 13:33 says, "You are My Son; this day have I begotten You."</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Begotten here does not refer to the birth of the Lord Jesus in the manger; rather, it refers to His birth when He came out of the tomb, the birth of the man Jesus when He was raised up by God.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>By death and resurrection, the humanity which the man Jesus had put on was uplifted into divinity.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>When His humanity entered divinity, He became the Son of God also in His humanity.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>This is to be "sonized."</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Before His resurrection Christ was the Son of God only in His divinity; in His humanity He was not yet the Son of God but was the Son of Man.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>However, through His resurrection His humanity was brought into divinity; thus, He was begotten to be the Son of God in His humanity.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Therefore, after His resurrection His being the Son of God was a different situation.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>In His divinity He was the only begotten Son of God from eternity past John 1:18; 3:16 , but in His humanity He became the firstborn Son of God through resurrection Rom 8:29; Heb 1:6 .</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>As the Son of God in His divinity, He is uniquely one; but after He was begotten as the Son of God in resurrection with His humanity, He is not uniquely one.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>In His resurrection He regenerated all His believers 1 Pet 1:3 as His many brothers and as the many sons of God.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Therefore, Romans 8:29 says that the Lord Jesus is the Firstborn among many brothers.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>John 20:17 tells us that in the morning of His resurrection the Lord said to Mary, "Go to My brothers and say to them, I ascend to My Father and your Father, and My God and your God."</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Prior to that morning, He did not have brothers, but now His brothers were born with Him at the same time.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Then, Hebrews 2:11-12 tells us that after His resurrection the Lord came into the midst of the disciples and declared the Father's name to His brothers.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>At this time His brothers had become the church, in the midst of which He came to praise the Father's name. i.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>He Was Made Both Lord and Christ in Ascension</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>In His humanity Christ was made both Lord and Christ in ascension.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Acts 2:36 says that after His resurrection and ascension Christ was made both Lord and Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>As God, the Lord was the Lord all the time Luke 1:43; John 11:21; 20:28 .</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>But as man, He was made the Lord in His ascension after He brought His humanity into divinity in His resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>As God's sent and anointed One, He was Christ from the time that He was born Matt 1:16; Luke 2:11; Matt 16:16 .</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>But as such a One, He was also officially made the very Christ of God in His ascension.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>As God, Christ was the Lord from eternity.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Then by incarnation He became Jesus, a Nazarene.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>This man was neither the Lord nor the Son of God in His humanity.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>But when He entered into resurrection, this man became the Son of God, and in His ascension this man was made the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Before His resurrection, in His divinity He was the Lord from eternity.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>But after His ascension, He was made the Lord in His humanity.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Thus, He is the Lord both in His divinity and in His humanity.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Therefore, today there is a Man in heaven who is the Lord of all.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>In the same principle, He was also made Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>He was made Lord, the Lord of all Acts 10:36 , to possess all; He was also made Christ, God's Anointed Heb 1:9 , to carry out God's commission. j.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>He Is the Heir of All Things</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Hebrews 1:2 says that God has appointed the Son to be the Heir of all things.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>We know that, at the beginning of Hebrews 1, verses 2 and 3 unfold to us both the person and work of the Son.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>In His person He is the effulgence of God's glory and the impress of God's substance.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>In His work He created the universe and upholds and bears all things; He also made purification of our sins and accomplished redemption.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Now He is sitting down on the right hand of God until His enemies become a footstool for His feet.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>In the past He was the Creator of all things Heb 1:2, 10; John 1:3; Col 1:16; 1 Cor 8:6 ; in the present He is the Upholder of all things and the One who bears all things Heb 1:3 ; in the future He will be the Heir who inherits all things.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>All things belong to Him, are for Him, and will be inherited by Him.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Therefore, Romans 11:36 says, "Out from Him and through Him and to Him are all things."</S>
