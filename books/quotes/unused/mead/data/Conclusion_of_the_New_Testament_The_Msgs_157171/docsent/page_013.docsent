   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>But in 14:17 Paul does not say that the kingdom of God shall be; he uses the present tense and says that the kingdom of God is.</S>

   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Toward ourselves we must be strict and righteous in everything we do. b Peacefully toward Others</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Furthermore, to live the kingdom life in the church means that we live peacefully toward others.</S>

   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>If we do not have righteousness, we cannot have peace.</S>
