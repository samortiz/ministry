<H1 CLASS=MSG>CHAPTER ONE</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>WHAT IS THE CHURCH<br>TO GOD AND CHRIST?<br>AND<br>HOW SHOULD THE ELDERS<br>BE TO THE CHURCHES?</H1><H1 CLASS=SCRIPTURE>Scripture Reading: Eph. 3:9-10; 1:9-10; James 1:18; Acts 20:28; 1 Pet. 5:2-3; Eph. 5:2, 25-29; 3:4-6; Col. 2:2b; Eph. 5:32; Rev. 1:11-12, 20; Eph. 4:3-6; 1 Cor. 1:10-13a; Matt. 16:16-18; Eph. 5:32; Acts 20:29, 17, 28; Phil 1:1; 1 Tim. 3:1-2, 6-7; 1 Pet. 5:3; 1 Tim. 5:17; Rom. 12:8; 1 Thes. 5:12; Rev. 2:1, 8, 12, 18; 3:1, 7, 14; 1 Pet. 5:2b, 4</H1><P>Our intention in this training is to fellowship not merely doctrinal matters but practical matters, matters which we need to practice, live, and carry out. In this chapter we want to see what the church is to God and Christ and how the elders should be to the churches. The church and the eldership may be very familiar to us, yet we need some basic realization and understanding concerning them.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>WHAT THE CHURCH IS TO GOD AND CHRIST</H2><P>The church is familiar to all of us, but not many Christians can speak adequately concerning what the church is to God and to Christ. The New Testament, especially the most critical books of the New Testament, the heart of the divine revelation, reveal what the church is to God and to Christ. Much of the speaking concerning the church is very shallow. To be sure, it is too shallow to say that the church is a physical building. The Brethren taught that the church is not a physical building but a gathering of God's called-out people. This is good, but even this is somewhat shallow.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>The Church Being the Goal<br>of God's Eternal Economy</H2><P>First, the church is the goal of God's eternal economy (Eph. 3:9-10). Our God has a desire, His good pleasure, so He needed an economy, which He made within Himself in eternity past before the foundation of the world. Before time began, God in His divine trinity made an economy. Every economy has a goal. It is even the more so with God's economy. He has a goal, which is the church. In His economy He planned in His wisdom to have a church to accomplish and fulfill His heart's desire. The church is God's goal. If we are not clear concerning this, we must spend some time in the books of Ephesians and Colossians to see the church as the goal of God's economy and His heart's desire.</P>
