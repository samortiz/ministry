   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Verses 7 and 8: "We will go into his tabernacles: we will worship at his footstool.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Arise, O Lord, into thy rest; thou, and the ark of thy strength."</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>This is figurative of the recovery of the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The ark was separated from the tabernacle, which signifies Christ separated from the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Christ was with the church, but Christ has been separated from the church.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>This is the time when we must all say, "Lord, arise; return into Your resting place, the local churches."</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Verse 13: "For the Lord hath chosen Zion; he hath desired it for his habitation."</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Zion, which represents the local churches, is the choice of God, the desire of God.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>This word in verse 13 is the word of the Psalmist, but when we continue into verse 14, we see that it is also the word of the Lord Himself: "This is my rest for ever: here will I dwell; for I have desired it."</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>While the Psalmist was speaking in verse 13, the Lord suddenly intervened to speak Himself in verse 14.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>David had said, "For the Lord hath chosen Zion; he hath desired it for his habitation."</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Then the Lord immediately continued, "This is my rest for ever: here will I dwell; for I have desired it."</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>This is the wonderful way in which the Psalms were written.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The Lord Himself spoke further concerning Zion, "I will enrich her food supplies: I will satisfy her needy ones with bread" v. 15 . This word exactly fits our present situation.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>When we come into the local churches, we sense that here we have an abundant food supply.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>We are enriched.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>We are the needy ones, yet we have found bread.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Are you still hungry?</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>If you come into the local churches, you will be satisfied.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Hallelujah, there is a place today where the hungry and needy ones may be fed and fully satisfied!</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Here in Zion the Lord not only satisfies us with food, but also supplies us with clothing: "I will also clothe her priests with salvation: and her saints shall shout aloud for joy" v. 16 . This salvation is not just a salvation from hell, but a salvation to the uttermost, a salvation of life.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>"Much more, being reconciled, we shall be saved by his life" Rom 5:10 .</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The Lord today is still clothing us with this wonderful life-salvation of His.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>He is satisfying us with the bread, and He is clothing us with the salvation of life.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Day by day we are being saved.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>What then shall we do?</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>We can do nought else but shout aloud for joy.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>We have a rich supply of food and glorious clothing.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Hallelujah!</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The Lord continues: "There will I make the horn of David to bud: I have ordained a lamp for mine anointed" v. 17 . We not only have food and clothing, but also a horn, the figure of strength, power and victory.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Furthermore, we have a lamp; we are not in darkness.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>And there is yet more: "His enemies will I clothe with shame: but upon himself shall his crown flourish" v. 18 . The word "flourish" here may be translated "shine." "Upon himself shall his crown shine." Many times in the church life I have the sense of a shining crown upon me.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>I have rich food, I have glorious clothing, I have a horn, a lamp, and a shining crown.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Then what about the enemies?</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The Lord clothes us with salvation, but He clothes the enemies with shame.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>All this occurs in the house and in the city.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The house is God's choice, God's desire, and God's satisfaction.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>In the house God satisfies us and clothes us; so we have both satisfaction and beautification.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>In the local churches we have the horn, the lamp, and the crown; and here we see the enemies put to shame day by day.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>It is really good!</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Therefore, as typified in this Psalm, there is so much in the local churches: the desire and choice of God, the rest and satisfaction of God, the Christ the ark of God's strength, the throne of the Anointed Christ , the rich food supply, the clothing of the priests, the worship and joyful shout of the saints, the horn, the lamp, the crown of God's Anointed Christ , and the defeat and shame of the enemies.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Here Christ, the house, and the city are joined together.</S>
