   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>III.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>THE CONDITION OF THE NATIONS A. Ammon and Moab</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Ammon and Moab were brothers who were born of Lot by his daughters.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Their origin was ugly and evil.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Yet Lot was a relative of Abraham, the first forefather of the people of Israel.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Hence, by blood Ammon and Moab were somewhat close to Israel.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Although Ammon and Moab were brothers, what they each did toward Israel was very different.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>1.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Ammon</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>According to the record in Ezekiel, the Ammonites offended God 25:2-3 .</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>When the sanctuary of God was desecrated, they were happy.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>When the Holy Land of God was made desolate, they were happy.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>When the house of Judah was carried away into exile, they were also happy.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The Ammonites were happy about three things: the sanctuary being desecrated, the land of Israel being desolated, and the house of Judah being carried away into exile.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>This indicates that they hated the sanctuary, the Holy Land, and the house of Judah.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>2.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Moab</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The Moabites said, Look, the house of Judah is just like all the other nations! v. 8 . The Moabites were happy to see that Jerusalem was no longer separated, different, from the nations.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The Moabites signify persons who like to bring God s people into an association with the world and who like to make God s people the same as the nations.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>B. Edom and Philistia 1.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Edom</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Like Ammon and Moab, Edom was closely related to Israel.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Edom was the son of Esau, the brother of Jacob.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Therefore, according to blood Edom and the sons of Israel were cousins.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>However, Edom was full of hatred toward Israel and was continually seeking vengeance v. 12 .</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>2.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Philistia</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Philistia and Edom were in the second pair.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>According to Judges and 1 Samuel, the Philistines were even closer to the Israelites than the Edomites.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The Philistines lived very close to the good land and even mingled with the Israelites.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>A number of times the Philistines came to the people of Israel and intervened in their worship to God.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Once, the Ark was captured by the Philistines and was kept by them for a period of time 1 Sam 5:1; 6:1 .</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Therefore, when referring to the Philistines, Ezekiel said that they acted in vengeance against the people of Judah and were full of vengeance to destroy them with a perpetual enmity Ezek.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>25:15 .</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>C. Tyre and Sidon 1.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Tyre</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The people of Tyre were occupied with business dealings, silver and gold, and enjoyment.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>They cared only for pleasure.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>According to Ezekiel, the people of Tyre declared that Jerusalem would fall and that they were happy about it.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Furthermore, they were also proud.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The king of Tyre exalted himself to such an extent that he even made himself a god.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Hence, the Bible considers the king of Tyre as a figure of Satan 26:1-6; 28:1-19 .</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>2.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Sidon</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Sidon forms a pair with Tyre.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Ezekiel said that Sidon was a pricking briar or a painful thorn to the house of Israel v. 24 . Sidon signifies people who damage the life of God s people.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>D. Egypt</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>According to the Bible, Egypt is a nation that depends on its own resources, not on God.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Egypt has the Nile River as the resource of its riches.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>The Egyptians did not depend on the rains from heaven but on the water from the Nile.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>In addition, they exercised their wisdom to develop their natural resources in order to become rich and have an abundant supply.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Whenever the children of Israel were short of food, they went down to Egypt for the supply.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Hence, Egypt represents persons who exercise their natural wisdom and develop their natural resources in order to be rich and have a supply.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>At the time of Ezekiel, Israel turned to Egypt and leaned on Egypt, trusting in Egypt as their staff.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>However, God said that Egypt was a staff made of reeds that broke easily 29:2-9 .</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>When Ezekiel speaks about Tyre and Egypt, he also speaks of Eden, the garden of God 28:13; 31:9, 16 .</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>With their riches and resources, Tyre and Egypt made their contemporary world a garden of Eden.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>This was not the garden of Eden made by God; it was a garden of Eden made by those who cared only for their rich enjoyment on earth, not for God.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>However, God said that He would send Egypt, with its garden of Eden, to Hades, to the pit, to the depths of the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>This reveals that God will judge the people who care only for earthly happiness and enjoyment but do not need God.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>IV.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>GOD S JUDGMENT UPON THE NATIONS</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>God came to execute judgment and destroy the nations 25:7, 16; 28:16; 30:10 , by making them desolate 25:13; 26:19; 29:9-12; 30:7 , bringing them very low 29:14; 30:6 , consuming them 28:18; 30:8 , and delivering them to the lower parts of the earth, to the pit 26:20; 31:14, 16-18; 32:18-30 .</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Eventually, all those who hate God s people will be in the lower parts of the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>This is the place where every persecutor of God s people will eventually go.</S>
