   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Today there are thousands of "Christs."</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>These Christs are called Christians.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The word Christian means "a person who belongs to Christ."</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>As Christians, we belong to Christ and are His counterpart.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>As those who belong to Christ, we are Christ 1 Cor 12:12 .</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>He is the mingling of divinity with humanity, and we are too.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>We are exactly the same as He is in life and nature.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>We are copies of Christ, and these copies are the mingling of the Trinity with humanity.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>He is the model, the mold, and we are His mass production.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The second and fourth stanzas of Hymns, #203 express the thought that we are Christ's duplication and reproduction:</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>By Thy death and resurrection,</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Thou wast made God's firstborn Son;</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>By Thy life to us imparting,</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Was Thy duplication done.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>We, in Thee regenerated,</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Many sons to God became;</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Truly as Thy many brethren,</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>We are as Thyself the same.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>We're Thy total reproduction,</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Thy dear Body and Thy Bride,</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Thine expression and Thy fulness,</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>For Thee ever to abide.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>We are Thy continuation,</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Thy life-increase and Thy spread,</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Thy full growth and Thy rich surplus,</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>One with Thee, our glorious Head.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>With the Lord Jesus, the mingling of divinity with humanity began at the time of His incarnation, but with us as His mass production, this mingling began at the time of His resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>In resurrection we all were mingled with God and began to have a life of mingling.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>This was the beginning of the mingling in reality.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>But this mingling began in a practical way when we were regenerated.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>At that time God was born into us.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Because God has been born into us, we are wonderful people!</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Every proper Christian is a wonderful person.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>We are not wonderful in material possessions, but we are wonderful in God.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Regardless of who we are, as long as we are a proper Christian, we are a wonderful person.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Our being wonderful is in the fact that we are being mingled with the Divine Trinity by His divine dispensing.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The mingling by the divine dispensing at the time of the Lord's incarnation was consummated in nine months.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>But the Christian life may cover a period of many years; therefore, the divine dispensing in our Christian life continues within us every day, from morning until evening.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>From the time of our regeneration we have been enjoying the divine dispensing.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>From that time onward the whole course of our Christian life is a period of God's dispensing.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>This divine dispensing mingles God with us.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>If we need sanctification, we need this mingling.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>If we need victory, we need this mingling.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>If we need transformation, we need this mingling.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Regeneration, renewing, sanctification, transformation, conformation, and glorification are all the issue of the divine dispensing.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Although we have been regenerated, in another sense we have not yet been born.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Revelation 12:1-5 reveals that a woman, who signifies the totality of God's people on earth, brings forth a man-child.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>This man-child is a symbol of the corporate overcomers Rev 2:26-27 .</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>These overcomers today have been conceived within the woman, but they have not yet been born.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Regeneration was the beginning of their conception, but the consummation of this conception will be their birth as the corporate overcomers, the man-child.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Today they are still in the process of conception, because there is still the need of more dispensing.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>We all need much more dispensing.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>With more dispensing, we will be matured.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Maturity will be the real birth, and this birth will be the result of the divine dispensing.</S>
