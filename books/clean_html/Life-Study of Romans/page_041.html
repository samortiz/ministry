<h2 class="head4">b. Many Were Constituted Righteous</h2><p>Romans 5:19 tells us, &ldquo;through the obedience of the One shall the many be constituted righteous.&rdquo; We are not only righteous; we are constituted righteous. If you paint my skin green, that will not affect my inward constitution. However, if you inject green paint into my blood, my whole being eventually will be constituted with green paint. This would not be outward painting, but inward constituting. When the living God comes into our being as grace, we are constituted righteous.</p><h2 class="head4">c. Many Were Justified unto Life</h2><p>A further result of Christ&rsquo;s obedience is that we have been justified unto life (5:18). Since we have been constituted righteous, we have come up to the standard of God&rsquo;s righteousness and now correspond to it. Thus, we are justified unto life spontaneously. In Adam, through his one offense, we were condemned unto death; in Christ, through His one righteous act, we are justified unto life. Justification is for life. First we have justification, then we have life. Justification changes our outward position, and life changes our inward disposition. Now we have both justification outwardly for our position and life inwardly for our disposition.</p><h2 class="head4">d. Grace Reigned through Righteousness<br />unto Life Eternal</h2><p>Romans 5:21 says, &ldquo;grace might reign through righteousness unto eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord.&rdquo; Grace reigns. We have another king because now we are in another kingdom. Once we were in the kingdom of death, and sin was our king through death. Now we are in the kingdom of life, and grace is our king. &ldquo;Grace reigns through righteousness unto life eternal.&rdquo; This thought is very deep. Why must grace reign through righteousness? Because we were sinners. If we had not been constituted sinners, we would have been clean and righteous, with nothing in our being contradicting God&rsquo;s character. If such had been the case, we would not have needed righteousness. However, we were constituted sinners. How can grace, which is God Himself, reign over such unrighteous people? Grace needs an instrument, a means to reign. This instrument, this means, is God&rsquo;s righteousness. Thus, grace reigns through God&rsquo;s righteousness unto life eternal. Because Christ has died on the cross to accomplish redemption for us and because God&rsquo;s righteousness has been revealed to us, we have a position to enjoy God as grace. We even have the position to claim God as our grace. Therefore, grace can reign through righteousness unto life eternal.</p><p>Let us apply this to our experience. Suppose I am a sinful, dying man. I am condemned to death, and death reigns over me. One day I realize that Christ died for me on the cross to accomplish God&rsquo;s redemption, and God&rsquo;s righteousness is revealed to me. As a sinner, I come to God under the redeeming blood of Christ. Immediately, the righteousness of God binds Him to justify me, and He becomes my portion. I can claim Him as my portion because the redemption of Christ has fulfilled all the requirements of His righteousness. I now have the position to claim Him as my portion. He has no choice. Because of His righteousness, He has to come to me as grace for my enjoyment. Grace means that I receive a gift which I do not deserve. If I work for you, you owe me my wages as a debt, not as a grace. However, if you present me five hundred dollars as a gift, that is grace, for I do not deserve it. Through God&rsquo;s righteousness I receive grace, which I do not deserve.</p><p>God has given Himself to us as a grace that we do not deserve. We never worked for it and we cannot pay for it. The price is too high. God simply gives Himself to us as grace through righteousness. This grace becomes our portion for our enjoyment and reigns through righteousness, resulting in life eternal. This does not refer to eternal blessing, but to eternal life, which we may enjoy today. It is not the human life or the created life; it is the divine, eternal and uncreated life.</p><p>Under the blood of Christ, we claim God as our portion, and we receive from God a measure which we do not deserve. This measure is grace as our enjoyment. The issue of this enjoyment is life eternal, a life which will transform our whole being. It will sanctify us completely and deal thoroughly with our disposition. Thus, we will become sanctified, transformed, conformed and glorified persons.</p><h2 class="head4">e. In Christ All Shall Be Made Alive</h2><p>In Adam all die, but in Christ all shall be made alive (1 Cor. 15:22). Adam&rsquo;s transgression caused and still causes all his descendants to die, but Christ&rsquo;s obedience causes all men to live. In Adam all are dying; in Christ all are living. The result of Adam&rsquo;s transgression is death unto all. The result of Christ&rsquo;s obedience is life unto all.</p>
