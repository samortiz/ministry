   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER EIGHT LIFE Scripture Reading: John 3:14-15; 1 John 5:12; 2 Pet 1:3; Rom 5:10; 8:2, 6, 10-11; John 6:63b; Rev 2:7; 22:14a, 17 THE ESSENCE OF THE BIBLE BEING CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The first mysterious matter in the Bible is Christ, who is God and also man.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Therefore, the extract, the essence, of the entire Bible, from the Old Testament through the New Testament, is Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Matthew, as the first book of the New Testament, speaks of Christ's coming, and at its very beginning it gives a genealogy to show us His origin.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>A genealogy is a brief introduction to a person's origin.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Therefore, if we want to understand the genealogy of Christ, we need to know the entire Old Testament, because the genealogy of Christ is a miniature of the entire Old Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Following this, the second mysterious matter in the Bible is that this Christ as the God-man passed through death and resurrection to become the life-giving Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>CHRIST BEING ONE WHO IS GOD YET MAN</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The Bible's record of the Christ in the Gospels is altogether a story of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>His conception was of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>We may say that the Holy Spirit who entered into the womb of the virgin Mary was the "gene," the life factor, of Christ's conception.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The Holy Spirit was the "gene" that came out from God, entered into the womb of the virgin, and became the factor of Christ's conception.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>On the other hand, Christ still had the factor of humanity, which came from His fleshly mother.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>These two factors mingled together to produce a marvelous One, Jesus Christ, who is God yet man.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>When He was thirty years old and about to come out for His ministry, the Holy Spirit was poured upon Him so that He was completely anointed by the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Thus, He as a man was born of the Holy Spirit and anointed by the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>He was saturated by the Holy Spirit inwardly, and He also had the Holy Spirit poured upon Him outwardly.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Therefore, He had the Spirit within and without.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>During the three and a half years of His ministry, this was how He lived, how He moved, and even the more how He worked.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>He was saturated with the Spirit inwardly and had the outpouring of the Spirit outwardly.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>This One is our Savior, who is God and also man.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>THE CHRIST WHO PASSED THROUGH DEATH AND RESURRECTION</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Since Christ is One who is God yet man, He has not only divinity but also humanity.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>When He was born, He put on humanity, the virgin's factor, but this humanity had not yet been uplifted into divinity.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>It was for this reason that He still needed to pass through death and resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>When 1 Corinthians 15 speaks of the definition of resurrection, it uses a seed, in particular, a grain of wheat, as an example to describe what it is to die and be resurrected.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>In 1936 I was in Peking working for the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>One day I went to National Tsing Hua University to preach the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>After I had preached there, a person whom I knew and who was studying there came to see me in the evening and said, "Brother Lee, I was born into a Christian family, but until now I cannot believe in resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>When someone dies, how can he be resurrected?</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>This is superstitious.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Today everything is scientific, and to be scientific, we must have proof.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>However, you simply tell people that Jesus died, was buried, and rose again.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>How can you prove this?"</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>At that time we two were standing by the window of the faculty lounge in the university.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>As we looked out the window, we could see a green wheat field.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>In northern China, wheat is planted in the fall, and it passes through the winter buried under much snow.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Then it grows until April or May of the following year before it is harvested.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>I pointed to that field of green wheat and said to him, "Can you see?</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>That wheat field outside the window is a matter of resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>How can you say resurrection is superstition?</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Grain after grain of yellow wheat seeds are planted into the earth, and after a few months the wheat grows up.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Isn't this resurrection?</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The seed of wheat dies to bring forth the seedlings, then the seedlings grow to produce many grains as fruit.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>This is a picture of resurrection."</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Because of this word, he immediately became clear.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>He believed in the Lord and was saved.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The first stanza of Hymns, #482 says, "I am crucified with Christ, / And the cross hath set me free; / I have ris'n again with Christ, / And He lives and reigns in me."</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>We have been crucified with Christ, and now it is Christ living out of us.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>The third stanza says, "This the secret nature hideth,/Harvest grows from buried grain."</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>This refers to resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>A living seed does not have any glory at first; it is neither green nor gold, but once it is planted into the field, it grows up and becomes green.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Then as it matures, it becomes rich with golden grains.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>This is a picture of resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>In John 12:24 the Lord Jesus refers to Himself as a grain of wheat, saying "Unless the grain of wheat falls into the ground and dies, it abides alone; but if it dies, it bears much fruit."</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>This refers to the Lord Jesus' death and resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>When the Lord died, Satan was happy, thinking that the Lord Jesus would be finished after His death and burial.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>However, Satan did not know that the death of the Lord Jesus as a grain of wheat gave Him the opportunity to enter into resurrection to produce many grains.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Even if a grain of wheat remained on a table for one thousand years, it would still abide alone, but if you plant that grain of wheat into the ground, you give it a great opportunity to resurrect and bring forth many grains.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>It is the same with the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Even if He had lived on the earth in His physical body for one thousand years, He would have remained alone.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>When He was "sown" into the ground by being killed and buried, apparently He was finished.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Who could have guessed that this actually gave Him a great opportunity to be able to resurrect?</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Nothing could be better for Him as a grain of wheat than to be sown into the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Therefore, when He spoke the word in John 12, on the one hand, He was sorrowful, but on the other hand, He was happy.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Apparently a grain of wheat that is sown into the ground is broken, but in actuality it is given a great opportunity to resurrect.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Concerning the definition of resurrection, 1 Corinthians 15 reveals to us that the body which is sown is different from the body in resurrection vv.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>35-44 .</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Once it passes through resurrection, it is transfigured.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>When a grain of wheat is sown, it is a bare seed, but what grows up is a green sprout with no trace or shape of the original seed.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Christ as One who is God yet man is glorious and divine, but He had the outward shell of His body.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>He was like a grain of wheat which has life inside but is enclosed by the shell outside.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>It is only when the shell is broken that the life within the seed can be released in resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>Christ's crucifixion was to break the shell of His body to release the glorious, divine life within Him so He could enter into resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>When He came out of death, His original body, His original shell had changed forever.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>With the grain of wheat, what comes out is a sprout; with Christ, what came out is the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>A grain of wheat grows into a sprout and then produces many grains with an increase of thirtyfold, sixtyfold, and even a hundredfold.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>Likewise, when Christ was resurrected as the Spirit, He also produced the believers as the many grains to be His increase.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>This is the resurrection of Christ and the Christ in resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>The revelation of the Bible is very mysterious and is not something we can understand simply by reading it two or three times according to our natural mind.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>We thank the Lord that although what is revealed is a mystery, it is a fact.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>In the universe, there is the fact of resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>We may not understand it, but we must remember this fact, which is entirely scientific.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>Do not think that the teachings of the Bible are not scientific.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>No philosophy or doctrine is more scientific than the biblical teachings.</S>
