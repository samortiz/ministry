        <h2 class="head1">TURNING TO OUR SPIRIT TO CONTACT GOD</h2>
<p>There is only one way to contact God, which is to turn to our spirit. People in the world cannot understand this, but we should be very clear about this. God has accomplished redemption, and our spirit is His dwelling place, the Holy of Holies with the throne of grace. The only way to contact God is to turn to our spirit. We must enter the Holy of Holies, that is, turn to our spirit, in order to fellowship with God.</p>
<p>In the world people use their minds to consider God and analyze Him. They attempt to use a part of their soul to contact God. The soul cannot contact God. Some Christians long for a physical feeling when they enter God&rsquo;s presence. This is a mistake. We must realize that God is Spirit and that the Lord is the Spirit (John 4:24; 2 Cor. 3:17). God does not dwell in our body or in our soul but in our spirit.</p>
<p>This mystery of mysteries surpasses our comprehension. God is infinite and great, and man is finite and small. But the infinite and great God desires to dwell in the finite and small man. This is almost incomprehensible and even impossible. But according to our experience, this is an undeniable fact: God dwells in our spirit. For this reason, whenever and wherever we would like to contact Him, we need only to turn to our spirit.</p>
<p>Entering into the Holy of Holies (Heb. 10:19) and coming forward to the throne of grace (4:16) both refer to turning to our spirit. When we turn to our spirit, we enter into the Holy of Holies and touch the throne of grace. Some believers have been saved for many years, but they do not know that the Holy of Holies is in their spirit and that the throne of grace is also in their spirit. If we desire to carry out the priestly service, receive grace, accomplish God&rsquo;s plan, and complete His building, we must enter the Holy of Holies in our spirit and touch the throne of grace. This is the only way.</p>
<h2 class="head1">PRAYING IN SPIRIT TO RECEIVE GOD</h2>
<p>When we turn to our spirit and touch the throne of grace, we are praying in a genuine way. Turning to our spirit and praying are the same thing; they cannot be separated. If we do not pray, we will not turn to our spirit, and if we do not turn to our spirit, we will not have genuine prayer. When we say that we should turn to our spirit, the emphasis is on prayer. Praying is not a matter of using our mind to remember certain matters. Prayer involves utterances that express the sense in our spirit. Sometimes we sense something within, but we cannot find the utterance to express it. It seems as if human words are inadequate. At such times, we can groan (Rom. 8:26). Whether we use words to express the sense in our spirit or we groan, God can flow through us.</p>
<p>Sometimes God will lead us to petition for certain things. However, the purpose of our prayer is not merely to obtain things but to obtain God. Obtaining God far exceeds obtaining outward things. The fact that God grants us the things that we need can only be regarded as a supplementary result. Hence, the focus of our prayer should not be on things to receive but on God Himself, even though He often gives us what we need when He gives Himself to us. Unbelievers do not see this. They think that believers pray in order to ask God for things. Every believer should be clear that the emphasis of prayer is to let God flow through his spirit and to be anointed with God so that He becomes his enjoyment, supply, and timely help.</p>
<h2 class="head1">RECEIVING MERCY AND<br />
FINDING GRACE FOR TIMELY HELP</h2>
<p>When we pray in our spirit, God will flow through us. Hebrews 4:16 speaks of receiving mercy and finding grace. Mercy and grace are God. Mercy indicates that we are not worthy to receive God; hence, He reaches us as mercy and places us in a situation that qualifies us to receive Him as grace. To give a beggar one dollar is mercy, but to give a dollar to one&rsquo;s child is grace. Since we are not worthy to receive God, He gives us mercy, and then, when we are in a situation that matches Him, He takes a further step and gives us grace.</p>
<p>Mercy and grace in Hebrews 4 are the river of water of life that flows out of the throne in Revelation 22:1. In referring to the same thing, Hebrews uses plain words, and Revelation uses signs. These two portions show that mercy and grace are God Himself flowing out from the throne as the river of water of life for our enjoyment.</p>
<p>Hebrews 10:19-20 says that by the blood we have boldness to enter through the veil into the Holy of Holies. The blood and the split veil both speak of the work of redemption accomplished by Christ on the cross. The river of water of life flows out from the throne of God and of the Lamb. The Lamb is for redemption. The work accomplished by the Lamb includes the shedding of blood and the splitting of the veil, which enables God to flow out as the water of life (John 19:34). Without redemption, God cannot flow out as the water of life for our enjoyment; He cannot reach us as mercy and grace. God is in the Lamb; hence, we can contact Him, and He can flow out freely as the water of life. He can reach us as mercy and grace for our enjoyment and timely help.</p>
<p>When we draw near to God with our needs, He will flow through us and give us mercy and grace, which then become our timely help. We have all experienced this. For example, a brother may be under pressure, but when he contacts God, the Spirit moves within him, and immediately he feels released. Another brother may be unable to handle his situation, but when he contacts God, he is strengthened inwardly. A sister may sense that she is in darkness and that there is no way for her to go on, but when she contacts God, she is enlightened and has a way to go on. Some saints suffer afflictions or are misunderstood, but when they fellowship with God and contact Him, their situation no longer bothers them. These are examples of receiving timely help.</p>
<p>The timely help that God gives us will not necessarily change our outward environment or solve our problems. Sometimes our environment may become even worse, or our problems may increase. As long as we contact God, He will supply us so that we may overcome in our environment; this is the timely help that we receive from God. A car that is having difficulty going up a steep hill does not need the hill to be leveled. The car needs more power. God may not let us always take a way that is smooth and straight. He often allows us to take a way that is crooked and difficult. Sometimes we may find ourselves climbing a high mountain, and other times we may be going into a deep valley. Nevertheless, if we keep ourselves in fellowship with God, His mercy and grace will flow through us like living water to be our supply and timely help for us to deal with any situation.</p>

 	<h2>Noise Words</h2>
 	<p>Common words, such as "and", "is", "but", and "the", also known as noise words, are bypassed in a search. The search string, the Spirit &amp; who, would result in an error since who, which stands by itself, is a noise word. The following is a list of noise words:</p>
	<p>$, a, also, an, and, another, any, are, as, at, be, because, been, being, both, but, by, came, can, did, do, each, for, has, had, he, have, her, here, him, himself, his, how, if, in, into, is, it, like, make, me, might, much, my, of, on, or, our, out, over, said, should, since, some, still, such, take, than, that, the, their, them, then, there, these, they, this, those, to, too, very, was, way, we, well, were, what, where, which, while, who, with, would, you, your</p>

<div id="myModalRanking" class="reveal-modal">
  	<h2>Ranking</h2>
  	<p>Rank is a value from <strong>0</strong> to <strong>1000</strong> indicating how closely a match scored or ranked against the original search string. Rank values are affected by the following factors:</p>
		<ol>
            <li><span>The total number of occurrences of the original search words/phrases in a portion of a book.</span></li>
            <li><span>Content that includes the search words in close proximity to each other are ranked above those that do not. Therefore, a portion of a book that has the search words in close proximity may have a higher ranking than another portion of a book that has a higher hit count but the words are not in close proximity to one another. Therefore, we also include a search word hit count for reference.</span></li>
            <li><span>The rank values are relative to each other. Therefore, it is not possible to interpret the RANK value as a percentage or group the rank values into high/medium/low ranges. Think of rank as a method to order the results for a specific search.</span></li>

 	<h2>Search Scope</h2>
 	<h3>Include All Word Forms</h3>
	<p>This option breaks out the search string into its individual words and generates all conjugations and declensions for each word in the search phrase. A search on the word, dwell, would search for dwell, dwelling, dwelling's, dwells, dwelt, and dwelled.</p>
	<p>There is no need to use ^ (inflectional search) or * (prefix search) when using the Include all word forms search scope.</p> 
	<h3>Specified Word Forms</h3>
	<p>This option searches for exact matches of the specified words or phrases used in the search string. Use of ^ (inflectional search) with a particular word in the search string will broaden the search for that given word in that all conjugations and declensions for that word will be searched. Similarly, use of * (prefix search) with a particular word in the search string will broaden the search for that given word in that all words with that prefix will be searched as well.</p> 
	<h3>Note</h3>
	<p>Common words, such as "and", "is", "but", and "the", also known as noise words, are bypassed in a search. A list of all noise words is as follows:</p>
	<p>$, about, after, all, also, an,and, another, any, are, as, at, be, because, been, before, being, between, both, but, by, came, can, come, could, did, do, each, for, from, get, got, has, had, he, have, her, here, him, himself, his, how, if, in, into, is, it, like, make, many, me, might, more, most, much, must, my, never, now, of, on, only, or, other, our, out, over, said, same, see, should, since, some, still, such, take, than, that, the, their, them, then, there, these, they, this, those, through, to, too, under, up, very, was, way, we, well, were, what, where, which, while, who, with, would, you, your</p>
