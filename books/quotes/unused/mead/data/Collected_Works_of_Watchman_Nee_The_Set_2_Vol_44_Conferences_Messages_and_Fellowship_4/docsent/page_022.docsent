   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>CONFERENCE ON</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>THE MYSTERY OF CHRIST CHAPTER NINETY-SIX THE MYSTERY OF CHRIST Scripture Reading: Eph 3:4-6; John 12:32; Luke 12:50-52 THE MYSTERY HIDDEN IN THE AGES</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In Ephesians 3:4-6 Paul speaks of his understanding of the mystery of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>This mystery was not made known to the sons of men in other generations.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The men of old did not know of the mystery that God spoke through Paul, which involves the Jews and Gentiles becoming one new man in Christ Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>This is the corporate Christ, which is the church.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Verse 6 of chapter three is a precious verse.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The words "fellow members" refer to the new man in Ephesians 2:15.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The new man stands in contrast to the old man.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>There are many individual men in this world, but there is only one old man.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>In the same way, there are many Christians, but there is only one new man the church.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>ONE NEW MAN</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>In order to understand what the new man is, we must first understand what the old man is.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The old man is the God-created man who fell through sin.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Every person in Adam is not only a sinner before God, but also an old man.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>When such a sinner, the old man, hears the gospel and believes in Christ and is saved, he becomes a new man.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Not only has he become a new man individually; he is joined to all other Christians to become one corporate new man as well.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Ephesians 1 speaks of the church as the Body of Christ; chapter two speaks of the church as the new man; chapter three speaks of the mystery of Christ; chapter four speaks of the way to build up the Body of Christ; chapter five speaks of the responsibility of the church; and chapter six speaks of the warfare of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The peak of God's work is the church, which is the new man.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>God saves us so that we will become a new man in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>A great lack among Christians today is that everyone wants to be an individual Christian.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Everyone wants to be good and zealous; everyone wants to sit and listen to good sermons.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>In short, everyone wants to be a Christian in an individual way.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>But God does not just want us to be good on an individual basis.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>He is after a corporate vessel that will destroy Satan and accomplish His plan.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>God does not want to see Christians scattered like a pan of sand.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>He wants Christians to be joined together to become a corporate new man.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>WHAT IS THE NEW MAN?</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Ephesians 2 speaks of Christ creating one new man out of two groups of people, but it does not tell us what the new man is like.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>According to Colossians 3:10-12, the new man is renewed unto full knowledge according to the image of Him who created him.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>In the new man there is no Greek or Jew, circumcision or uncircumcision, barbarian or Scythian, slave or free man, but Christ is all and in all.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The new man is not a matter of having or not having distinctions; it is a matter of either being the new man or being nothing.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The new man is not in the realm of being a Greek or a Jew.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The new man is simply Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The nature of the new man is Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>In the new man Christ is all and in all.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>We can even venture to say that Christ is the church and the church is Christ, because everything in the new man the church is simply Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The constitution of the new man is nothing less than Christ Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>THE CHURCH BEING CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Since the nature of the new man the church is Christ, we can say that the church is Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Let us read two passages.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>In Luke 12:50-52 the Lord said, "I have a baptism to be baptized with,...Do you think that I have come to give peace on the earth?</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>No, I tell you, but rather division."</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Why did the Lord say this?</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>He said this because He had said that He would cast fire on the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>This fire is the fire of God's life.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>This means He would release His life on the earth to all those who would believe in Him so that they would be regenerated and receive God's life.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>This matter, however, could only be accomplished after His baptism, which refers to His crucifixion.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>John 12 reveals that the church is produced out of Christ's death and resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>He is the grain of wheat that fell into the earth, died, and brought forth many grains the church in resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>From these two passages we can see that the church is produced by the life of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Through His death and resurrection, Christ released His life and dispensed it into the believers.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>These believers are then joined together to become the church.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>THE CHURCH BEING THE CORPORATE CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>In the New Testament there are two ways to look at Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>On the one hand, He is Jesus Christ the Nazarene this is the individual Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>On the other hand, He is Christ plus the church the corporate Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>First Corinthians 12:12 refers to the second aspect when it says, "All the members of the body, being many, are one body, so also is the Christ."</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Anything apart from Christ is not the church.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>There is only one thing in a Christian that forms a part of the church Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>The church is the corporate Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>In the church there is only Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>During the bread-breaking meeting, the portion that we break off from the whole still signifies the Body of Christ, the church.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>The church is not what is added to Christ but what issues out from Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Today there are divisions among God's children because there are differences in organizations, personal views, concepts, choices, preferences, and doctrines.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>But in God's eyes the church is inseparable.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>All these differences are merely outward differences; they are not differences in the intrinsic reality of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>The church is the composition of all the believers with Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>The church is the corporate Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>When all the saints are joined together in Christ, we have the church.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Since there is only one Christ, there can be only one church.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Hence, it is indivisible and inseparable.</S>
