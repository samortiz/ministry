        <h1 class="msg">CHAPTER THREE</h1>
<h1 class="title">GOD&rsquo;S DESIRE BEING TO BRING MAN<br />
BACK TO THE TREE OF LIFE</h1>
<p>In this chapter we will consider the vision in the first two chapters of Genesis and the last two chapters of Revelation. We will also consider the tree of the knowledge of good and evil.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE TREE OF LIFE AND<br />
THE TREE OF THE KNOWLEDGE OF GOOD AND EVIL<br />
HAVING A SPECIAL PLACE IN THE BIBLE</h2>
<p>The tree of life and the tree of the knowledge of good and evil have a very important place in the Bible. After man was created, the first things he encountered were these two trees (Gen. 2:7-9). Whether man has life or death depends on these two trees, and the kind of person that he becomes also depends on these two trees. Everything related to man depends on these two trees. In Genesis 2 God wanted man to pay attention to two trees: the tree of life and the tree of the knowledge of good and evil (vv. 9, 16-17). God wanted man to receive the tree of life; He did not want man to take of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil. The first tree is of life; hence, man receives life when he contacts it. Concerning the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, God said, &ldquo;Of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, of it you shall not eat; for in the day that you eat of it you shall surely die&rdquo; (v. 17). Therefore, one tree issues in life, and the other tree issues in death.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE TREE OF LIFE SIGNIFYING<br />
THE GOD WHO IS MINGLED WITH MAN</h2>
<p>If we read the Bible carefully, we will see that the tree of life signifies God coming to be mingled with man, or God mingled with man. God is life, but His being life is not for Himself; His being life is for man. In relation to Himself, God does not need to say that He is life. It is only in relation to man that He says He is life. God&rsquo;s being life does not refer to His existence but to His having a relationship with man. God&rsquo;s relationship with man is a relationship of life; God wants to be man&rsquo;s life. The important point in God&rsquo;s being life is not that He is His own life but that He would be man&rsquo;s life. God wants to be mingled with man to become man&rsquo;s life, because life is an indispensable element within man. To man, God should be his life. God wants to work Himself in a definite and thorough way into man; He wants to enter into man and be assimilated by man to become man&rsquo;s inward element.</p>
<p>From Genesis 2 to Revelation 21 there are many portions on the orthodox relationship between God and man. These portions emphasize God&rsquo;s entering into man to be man&rsquo;s enjoyment and becoming man&rsquo;s inward element, man&rsquo;s life. For example, Psalm 36:8-9 says, &ldquo;They are saturated with the fatness of Your house, / And You cause them to drink of the river of Your pleasures. / For with You is the fountain of life.&rdquo; In these verses the fountain and the river of pleasures are the same. With God, it is the fountain, but when it flows out, it is the river of pleasures. As believers, we drink of the water of life, which has its source in God. This shows how God becomes the intrinsic element of life within man.</p>
<p>The New Testament is clearer concerning the orthodox relationship between God and man. The Gospel of Matthew concerns the mystery of the kingdom; in chapter 1 it says, &ldquo;&lsquo;Behold, the virgin shall be with child and shall bear a son, and they shall call His name Emmanuel&rsquo; (which is translated, God with us)&rdquo; (v. 23). The word <em>with</em> in the phrase <em>God with us</em> is not merely objective; it is not a matter of God being among man. Rather, <em>with</em> is subjective; it is a matter of God being within man. In chapter 18 the Lord said, &ldquo;Where there are two or three gathered into My name, there am I in their midst&rdquo; (v. 20), and at the end of chapter 28 He said, &ldquo;I am with you all the days until the consummation of the age&rdquo; (v. 20). The Gospel of Matthew speaks three times of God&rsquo;s being with man: at the beginning, in the middle, and at the end. God&rsquo;s being with man is His mingling with man.</p>
<p>The Gospel of John is even clearer concerning God being mingled with man. Chapter 1 says, &ldquo;In Him was life&rdquo; (v. 4). In chapter 6 the Lord said, &ldquo;I am the living bread which came down out of heaven; if anyone eats of this bread, he shall live forever; and the bread which I will give is My flesh, given for the life of the world...so he who eats Me, he also shall live because of Me&rdquo; (vv. 51, 57). In chapter 10 He said, &ldquo;I have come that they may have life&rdquo; (v. 10). In chapter 15 He said, &ldquo;I am the true vine&rdquo; (v. 1). This verse speaks of the vine, which is linked to the tree of life in Genesis 2:9. The Lord is the vine. We have become branches in the Lord because we have been joined to Him. The Lord said, &ldquo;I am the vine; you are the branches. He who abides in Me and I in him...&rdquo; (John 15:5). This indicates that we are abiding in the Lord and that the Lord is abiding in us, just as the branches are in the vine and the vine is in the branches. In other words, the life of the vine becomes the life of the branches, and everything of the vine becomes everything to the branches.</p>
<p>In the Epistles the apostle Paul speaks of &ldquo;Christ our life&rdquo; (Col. 3:4), and he says, &ldquo;It is no longer I who live, but it is Christ who lives in me&rdquo; (Gal. 2:20). The Epistles contain many such expressions. At the end of Revelation the river of water of life proceeds out of the throne of God and of the Lamb, and the tree of life grows on both sides of the river (22:1-2). Thus, the thought of the tree of life runs throughout the Bible.</p>

 	<h2>Noise Words</h2>
 	<p>Common words, such as "and", "is", "but", and "the", also known as noise words, are bypassed in a search. The search string, the Spirit &amp; who, would result in an error since who, which stands by itself, is a noise word. The following is a list of noise words:</p>
	<p>$, a, also, an, and, another, any, are, as, at, be, because, been, being, both, but, by, came, can, did, do, each, for, has, had, he, have, her, here, him, himself, his, how, if, in, into, is, it, like, make, me, might, much, my, of, on, or, our, out, over, said, should, since, some, still, such, take, than, that, the, their, them, then, there, these, they, this, those, to, too, very, was, way, we, well, were, what, where, which, while, who, with, would, you, your</p>

  	<h2>Ranking</h2>
  	<p>Rank is a value from <strong>0</strong> to <strong>1000</strong> indicating how closely a match scored or ranked against the original search string. Rank values are affected by the following factors:</p>
		<ol>
            <li><span>The total number of occurrences of the original search words/phrases in a portion of a book.</span></li>
            <li><span>Content that includes the search words in close proximity to each other are ranked above those that do not. Therefore, a portion of a book that has the search words in close proximity may have a higher ranking than another portion of a book that has a higher hit count but the words are not in close proximity to one another. Therefore, we also include a search word hit count for reference.</span></li>
            <li><span>The rank values are relative to each other. Therefore, it is not possible to interpret the RANK value as a percentage or group the rank values into high/medium/low ranges. Think of rank as a method to order the results for a specific search.</span></li>

 	<h2>Search Scope</h2>
 	<h3>Include All Word Forms</h3>
	<p>This option breaks out the search string into its individual words and generates all conjugations and declensions for each word in the search phrase. A search on the word, dwell, would search for dwell, dwelling, dwelling's, dwells, dwelt, and dwelled.</p>
	<p>There is no need to use ^ (inflectional search) or * (prefix search) when using the Include all word forms search scope.</p> 
	<h3>Specified Word Forms</h3>
	<p>This option searches for exact matches of the specified words or phrases used in the search string. Use of ^ (inflectional search) with a particular word in the search string will broaden the search for that given word in that all conjugations and declensions for that word will be searched. Similarly, use of * (prefix search) with a particular word in the search string will broaden the search for that given word in that all words with that prefix will be searched as well.</p> 
	<h3>Note</h3>
	<p>Common words, such as "and", "is", "but", and "the", also known as noise words, are bypassed in a search. A list of all noise words is as follows:</p>
