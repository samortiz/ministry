   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>In the previous chapter, we saw the constitution of the Body of Christ under the enemy Satan's frustration, damage, and corruption as revealed in Matthew 13.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>We need to be impressed with all these negative things.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Satan's frustrating work is seen within the human heart vv.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>1-23 .</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The first kind of heart is as the wayside, hardened by the heavy traffic of the world.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The word of life cannot penetrate the hardened heart, giving the evil spirits the opportunity to snatch the word of life away.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>There is a war raging between God and His enemy, Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>God has myriads of angels, but a number of His angels followed Satan in his rebellion see Rev 12:4 and note 1 .</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Thus, Satan has his evil angels, the evil spirits.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The Lord Jesus in Matthew 13 likened these evil spirits to the birds snatching away the seed sown on the hardened earth.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The second kind of heart is the shallow heart which is like the shallow earth with hidden rocks.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>These rocks are items such as hidden sins, personal desires, self-seeking, and self-pity.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The third kind of heart is likened to the earth with thorns which choke the life seed.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>These thorns are the anxiety of this age, this life, and the deceitfulness of riches.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Matthew 13 also reveals the enemy Satan's damage with his sowing tares in the midst of the wheat and his changing the nature of the mustard seed into a big tree vv.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>24-32 .</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The tares are the false believers, the sons of the evil one, and the big tree is big Christendom in confusion.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Finally, Satan works to corrupt the church by leavening it vv.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>33-35 .</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The leaven is the greatest negative thing.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>All the different aspects of leaven which we pointed out in the previous chapter have been greatly used by God's enemy, Satan, throughout the past twenty centuries.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>This is why today's Christianity has nearly lost its impact.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Half of the United States population is supposed to be Christian, but where is the Christian influence today?</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>There is hardly any influence.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Everywhere there is darkness, with very little light.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Everywhere there is corruption, and many believers have lost their function as the salt of the earth Matt 5:13 .</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Leaven can be seen throughout today's Christianity in every aspect.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>According to the parable in Matthew 13 the entire life element in Christianity has been fully leavened.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>To be full of leaven is to be fully corrupted.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>We need to remember all these negative things, from the heart like the wayside to the corrupting leaven.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>If we remember these negative things, our eyes will be opened.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>We will see a vision like a heavenly video before our eyes.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Then we will know what today's age really is.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>It is truly a terrible age.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Where is the church that is full of impact, influence, and power from the heavens?</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>There is not such a thing.</S>
