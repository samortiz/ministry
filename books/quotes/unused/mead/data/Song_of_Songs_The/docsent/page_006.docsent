   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>PURSUIT 1:4</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Verse 4 says, "Draw me, we will run after thee."</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Although we have the desire and the willingness to pursue after Him, we cannot help but feel a lack of strength for the pursuit.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>This strength for the pursuit is not a mighty power from the Spirit that is given to us once for all.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Rather, the Lord's own beauty and glory draw us.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>His drawing power is our pursuing power.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>If the Lord has truly drawn us, it is very easy for us to pursue after Him.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>If You draw us, "we will run after thee."</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Running after is pursuing something continuously.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The power to run after the Lord comes from the drawing of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>We must realize that no one can come before the Lord by himself.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>When we were sinners, we needed God's drawing before we could come to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Similarly, after becoming believers, we need the Lord's drawing before we can run after Him.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Here we see the relationship between an individual believer and other believers.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>"Me" is drawn, but "we" are running after the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>"Me" has been brought into the chambers, but "we" will rejoice and be glad.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>If a man receives grace before the Lord, others will surely be affected by him.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>III.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>FELLOWSHIP 1:4</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Verse 4 continues, "The King hath brought me into his chambers."</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>After the maiden prays, we see her prayer being answered: "The King hath brought me into his chambers."</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The "chambers" are the "secret place" Psa 91:1 , which are the bedrooms.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Unless we have very deep friendship with a person, we will not bring him into our chambers.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Therefore, when the King brings her into the chambers, it signifies the beginning of fellowship and revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>In the chambers she tastes of a fellowship that was previously unknown.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>But more than this, she sees something that she has not seen before.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The word "King" indicates that before we know the Lord as our Beloved, we must first know Him as our King.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>A life of consecration always comes before a life of love, and a satisfying experience always comes after an act of consecration.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>"The King hath brought me into his chambers."</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>She has previously known Him as her King.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>But now the King will show her the experience of the chambers.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Those who are with the maiden can now lift up their heads as their future unfolds before them.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>There is no limit to their future.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Once the experience of the chambers begins, hope abounds in a life of love.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>They know that since God has begun the work, He will surely complete it Phil 1:6 .</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Therefore, they say, "We will be glad and rejoice in thee, we will remember thy love more than wine."</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>These are words for the future.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Their present experience fills them with hope for the future cf.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Prov 23:35 for an example of seeking associated with wine .</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>"The upright love thee" should be translated, "They love thee in uprightness."</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>This means that their love comes out of a good conscience 1 Tim 1:5 .</S>
