<H1 CLASS=MSG>CHAPTER TWENTY-ONE</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>THE SUFFERINGS OF WATCHMAN NEE</H1><P>Watchman Nee endured much suffering for the sake of his ministry. He was absolute in following the Lord and faithful in fulfilling his commission. Because of his faithfulness and absoluteness, he was continually mistreated and underwent many hardships. Because he continually fought the battle for the Lord's recovery, he was continually under attack from the enemy. At the same time, he was also under God's sovereign hand. The sovereign arrangements of God in his environment were also a source of trouble and a means by which God dealt with him. For these two reasons, he lived a life of suffering. For the most part his sufferings came from the following sources:</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>I. POVERTY</H2><P>In the early years of Watchman Nee's ministry, the economic situation in China was very difficult. Still, he was enlightened to the extent that he was able to fulfill the Lord's calling by serving Him entirely by faith. The light he received made it impossible for him to work as an employee for anyone: not for a mission, denomination, so-called church, or individual. Because of what he saw, he was exercised to live purely and singly by faith in God. In those days, this was not an easy way. In that kind of financial situation, he came to learn what poverty was. In the early days of his ministry in Shanghai, there were times when he had nothing to eat but a little bread.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>II. ILL HEALTH</H2><P>Brother Nee also suffered frequent ill health. He began his ministry before 1923 and was not married until 1934. There was a period of eleven years when he had no wife to help him. During those years he lived by himself. It was during this period that he became afflicted with tuberculosis of the lungs and suffered for several years from this disease.</P><P>He was also afflicted with a stomach illness and with a heart ailment called angina pectoris. He was never cured of the heart disease. He told me that a number of times before a conference meeting he was forced to lie on his bed until the time arrived to minister. Only then would he rise up. Immediately after speaking, he would return to bed.</P><P>Because of his ill health, Watchman learned how to be greatly dependent upon the Lord. He learned how to live by resurrection life in order to meet his physical needs. Many times he ministered not by physical strength but by resurrection life.</P>
