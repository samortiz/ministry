<h2 class="head1">HEARING NEWS AND PRAYING</h2><p>Respectful greetings:</p><p>I heard that God has blessed the local church in Shanghai in these days with a development never seen before. More than four hundred brothers and sisters have completely consecrated themselves. Thank the Lord, He has also begun the work of raising up prayer here. We still need God to raise up leaders or we will have no way to go on. Brother Miao sent a letter saying that the earliest he could come would be the end of the year. May His will be done. Amen.</p><p>If the Lord wills and leads, I will take a trip to Shanghai. I hope to wait for the Lord's leading there. I hope you will pray for me. I know that you are very busy with the work, but if you could take some time from your busy schedule to briefly tell me the latest messages from God, I would be very grateful. Praise God for His abounding grace!</p><p>A weak member in the Lord,<br />So Lin-tiok</p><p>Mailing Address: Mr. So Lin-tiok, Dr. H. S. Huang, 882 Reina Regente St., Manila, P. I.</p><h2 class="head1">MEETING EVEN WITHOUT A FIXED PLACE</h2><p>Peace to the responsible brothers:</p><p>Brother Yu Dao-sheng boarded a boat on July 22 to pass through Canton on his way to Shanghai. Has he arrived?</p><p>We do not have a fixed place for our meetings. We no longer meet at the old address on Jie-Shi Road. Our temporary mailing address is as follows: Chen Ming-zhi, Lai-Zhan Section, Canton Regional Engineering Office, Siying, Zhanjiang.</p><p>I believe the church in Shanghai is remembering the church here. Finally, we hope you will pray for us much.</p><p>Your brother in the Lord,<br />Chen Qi-shou<br />July 30, 1948</p><p>Brother Yu Dao-sheng arrived safely in Shanghai on August 9. He constantly thinks of you brothers and sisters in Zhanjiang. What he is learning will be beneficial to you. We should thank God together.&mdash;Editor</p><p>August 17, 1948<br />Shanghai</p><h2 class="head1">AN ANSWER CONCERNING TAKING A JOB TO SERVE GOD</h2><p>Brother Yu-xian:</p><p>With regard to your question in your letter of April 24 (see Issue No. 1 of this publication), the answer is as follows:</p><p>A saved person should be a serving one. Furthermore, his service should be in coordination with the local church. If he receives grace to serve in a way which occupies his time and strength, of course he cannot, and should not, take a job. If he receives grace to serve, but all his time and energy are not completely consumed, he should use the rest of his time and energy to do a job. (But this job is just a second job; his true profession is serving God.)</p><p>A person should not idly wait on God and look for His arrangement. He should always serve God in the church in the place where he is. If he has extra time and energy, he should take a job. May you have peace in the Lord!</p><p>Your brother,<br />Witness Lee<br />August 16, 1948</p>
