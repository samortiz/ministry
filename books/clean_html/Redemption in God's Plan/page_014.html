<h2 class="head2">The Efficacy of His Death</h2>
<p>In chapter 53, Isaiah prophesied concerning the efficacy of Christ&rsquo;s death: &ldquo;He will see the fruit of the travail of His soul, / And He will be satisfied; / By the knowledge of Him, the righteous One, My Servant, will make the many righteous&rdquo; (v. 11). When we believed in Christ&rsquo;s death on our behalf, we turned to Him and were justified. Christ gained us through His death, and we gained righteousness. Hence, Christ saw the fruit of the travail of His soul and was satisfied.</p>
<h2 class="head2">His Resurrection</h2>
<p>Both Isaiah&rsquo;s and David&rsquo;s prophecies speak of Christ&rsquo;s resurrection. Isaiah 53:10 says, &ldquo;He will see a seed, He will extend His days, / And the pleasure of Jehovah will prosper in His hand.&rdquo; This means that Christ would be resurrected and live forever to give man His life and make man His seed so that through him He might fulfill God&rsquo;s pleasure. Christ&rsquo;s resurrection extended His days and enabled Him to live in those who are of His seed for the accomplishing of God&rsquo;s good pleasure.</p>
<p>In Psalm 22:22 David took on the voice of Christ, saying, &ldquo;I will declare Your name to my brothers; / In the midst of the assembly I will praise You.&rdquo; This indicates that Christ in resurrection caused men to have His life and become His brothers so that He might declare God&rsquo;s name to them and praise God in their midst. Christ&rsquo;s resurrection gained men as His brothers, His church. Then He could reveal God and praise God in their midst.</p>
<p>These aspects concerning God&rsquo;s redemption were presented in the Old Testament. He was born a man, lived on the earth as a man, bore man&rsquo;s sins, endured death on the cross, and resurrected from the dead so that man could have His life and be His brothers. All these aspects were promised to us in prophecies.</p>
<h2 class="head1">TYPES OF GOD&rsquo;S REDEMPTION</h2>
<p>In addition to the plain prophetic words in the Old Testament, God also used many persons, matters, and things in the Old Testament as types to declare, describe, reveal, and speak forth the mysterious and glorious redemption that He had planned and ordained. These types, in contrast to plain words, are pictures that reveal and make known His mysterious redemption. God uses both &ldquo;text&rdquo; and &ldquo;illustrations&rdquo; to reveal His mysterious redemption.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Coats of Skin with Which<br />
Adam and Eve Were Clothed</h2>
<p>The coats of skin that were used as a covering for Adam and Eve are the first indication in type of God&rsquo;s promised redemption. When man fell, God not only spoke of the promise of the seed of the woman (Gen. 3:15), but He also clothed Adam and Eve with coats of skin (v. 21). Initially, Adam and Eve were sinless and not ashamed of their nakedness (2:25). However, after they sinned and fell, they were ashamed of their nakedness. Although they sewed fig leaves together and made loincloths for themselves (3:7), this could not cover their shame and sinfulness. Therefore, God made coats of skin to clothe and cover them.</p>
<p>The coats of skin must have involved the shedding of the blood of a slain sacrifice. Adam and Eve had both eaten the fruit of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, and according to God&rsquo;s commandment, they should have died that day (2:17). However, a sacrifice was killed, and its blood was shed in their place for the forgiveness of sins (Heb. 9:22). Thus, the skin of this sacrifice became a covering for their sin so that they could live before God.</p>
<p>God&rsquo;s making coats of skin typifies His making the Lord Jesus our righteousness so that in Him we could be justified before God (1 Cor. 1:30; Rom. 3:24; Phil. 3:9). In the fulfillment of this type the Lord Jesus was slain, and His blood was shed for us. Then He became our righteousness so that we might become the righteousness of God in Him (2 Cor. 5:21).</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Offerings of the Forefathers</h2>
<p>God also used the offerings of the forefathers to indicate that He would make it possible for fallen sinners to draw near to Him and be accepted by Him through His foreordained redemption. Abel (Gen. 4:4), Noah (8:20-22), Abraham (12:7-8; 22:13), Isaac (26:25), and Jacob (35:6-7) all communed with God and were acceptable to God through their offerings. They were sinful and alienated from God, but they were able to draw near to God because their sacrifices, involving the shedding of blood, covered their sins. These offerings typify Christ drawing those who believe in Him near to God through His redemption so that they may serve God and be acceptable to God. The forefathers had a foretaste of Christ and His redemption through their offerings.</p>
