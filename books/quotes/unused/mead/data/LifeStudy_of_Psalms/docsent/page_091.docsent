   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The Lord's table is a feast.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Every Lord's Day when we come to His table to take the feast, it is always in the presence of our adversaries.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Every day is a fighting day to us.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>We Christians have to fight.</S>

   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>There may be adversaries in our business, in our home, and even in the church.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>On the one hand, we enjoy the feast of the Lord, and on the other hand, we should fight for the victory.</S>

   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>In the fourth stage of the deeper and higher enjoyment of the resurrected Christ, the Lord anoints our head with oil of exultant joy Heb 1:9 ; our cup of blessing 1 Cor 10:16a runs over.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>To anoint the head is to anoint the whole body.</S>

   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>No doubt, this is the anointing of the compound, life-giving Spirit in Christ's resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>All the riches of Christ's being and doing are compounded together in this anointing compound ointment.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The Bible uses the word cup to indicate blessing.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The cup of blessing runs over.</S>

   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Then there is the anointing oil, which is the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Then there is the cup of blessing, which refers to the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The Father is the blessing, even the source of blessing.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Thus, in verse five there is the Triune God the Son as the feast, the Spirit as the anointing oil, and the Father as the source of blessing.</S>
