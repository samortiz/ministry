   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>That the Ark Was Captured</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Eli had been sitting on his seat by the roadside watching; "for his heart trembled for the ark of God" v. 13a . When the news came to him that the ark had been captured, he fell off his seat backward, broke his neck, and died vv.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>17-18 .</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>5.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The Glory of God Departing from Israel</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>When the wife of Phinehas, who was pregnant and about to deliver, learned that the ark had been captured and that her husband and her father-in-law had died, she bowed down and gave birth to a son vv.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>19-20 .</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>She named the child Ichabod v. 21 , meaning "No glory," indicating that the glory had departed from Israel.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Glory is God Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>When God departed, the glory departed from Israel.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Samuel observed all these tragedies, and they became lessons to him, warning him and reminding him throughout his service to God.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Thus, his being placed by God in His wisdom under the custody of the old Eli was very profitable, for he learned certain things positively and observed other things negatively.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>This helped Samuel to remain pure in his service to God his entire life.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>When he was about to die, he could remind the people of Israel that he had never defrauded them, oppressed them, or taken anything from them 12:3-4 .</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>While Samuel was under Eli's custody, God taught him in a very fine way, built him up, and established him as His proper priest.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>As such a priest, Samuel became a judge to judge Israel, a prophet to prophesy for God, and the one to bring forth the kingship.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>By this kingship the kingdom of God was established on earth.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>This is a picture of what our situation should be today.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>We need to be, first, a Samuel, and then, a David, enjoying Christ to such a degree that what we have enjoyed of Christ will become a kingdom, which is the church.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>According to Matthew 16:18-19 the church and the kingdom are identical.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The kingdom today is the church, and within the church there is the intrinsic essence the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The church is visible, but the Body of Christ, as the intrinsic essence, is invisible.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>In the visible church there is the kingdom, the reigning, of God.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>In this visible church there is also the intrinsic essence as the very content, the reality, of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Our human body is visible, but the life within the body is invisible.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The principle is the same with the church and the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The Body is the intrinsic life of the church.</S>
