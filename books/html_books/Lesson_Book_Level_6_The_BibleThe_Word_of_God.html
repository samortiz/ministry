<h2 class="head2">Text</h2>
<p>This is the sixth and the last lesson book of this series of six lesson books for the summer school of the truth. The first lesson book showed us God&rsquo;s full salvation concerning how God saved us, the tripartite beings, in three stages for His purpose, the church. The second lesson book showed us Christ&rsquo;s person and work and the Triune God. The third lesson book showed us the Holy Spirit and the human spirit, how the two are mingled, and how to live by the mingled spirit. The fourth book showed us the eternal life that we have received and how to experience it. The fifth book showed us the church universally and locally and how the church is to be built. This book explains what the Bible is, who wrote it, how it was written, the subject, the central thought, and the key sections. It also shows us that the Bible is proven to be the Word of God. The major portion of this lesson book reveals the Bible&rsquo;s content, including the main topics and the content of each book. Finally, this book shows us what our proper attitude toward the Bible should be and how we may enjoy the Bible for our Christian life. We pray and hope that you will be helped to know the Bible and to know how to enjoy it.</p>
<h2 class="head1">I. THE SPIRIT WITHIN AND<br />
THE BIBLE WITHOUT MUST BE BALANCED</h2>
<p>[To edify a person spiritually, we must help him to know the Bible. In the past two thousand years, Christians all acknowledge that no one can truly know the Lord without knowing the Bible. We human beings are not merely a spirit. Although we have a spirit, we are not merely a spirit, but a human being. If we were a spirit only, then God would need to give us only His Spirit and not the Bible; however, since we are not a spirit only, He must also give us the Bible.</p>
<p>The spiritual inheritances God has given us are the Spirit which cannot be seen and the Bible which can be seen. Inside of us is the Spirit, and outside of us is the Bible. Christians throughout the ages can testify by experience that a proper Christian must be fully balanced in both respects&mdash;the Bible without and the Spirit within. These two aspects must be absolutely balanced. Any bias towards one side will result in serious problems. Among Christians throughout the ages, some have leaned toward the Spirit within which has resulted in great errors. Still more lean toward the Bible without. Seemingly they have not erred as much, yet among them there is a very serious condition of death. In other words, if there were only the Spirit within and not the Bible without, man would easily commit errors. Conversely, if there were only the Bible without while lacking the Spirit within, man would become extremely dead, altogether lifeless, and without any vitality.</p>
<p>Christians can be likened to a train. There needs to be the fuel inside as its energizing power. But a train needs to have tracks outside as well. If there is fuel within but no tracks without, the train would not be able to run. Even if it runs, problems will arise. However, if there are only the tracks without, but not the fuel within, the train may be on the right track, but it cannot move. Therefore, for a train to run, and to do so smoothly, there must be the coordination of two aspects: the inner aspect and the outer aspect. Outwardly, there must be the regulation of the tracks; inwardly, there must be the energizing of the fuel.]</p>
<p>[Therefore, we must put equal emphasis on the Spirit and the Bible; we must not neglect either matter. We must not overlook the Spirit within, neither can we despise the Bible without.]</p><h2 class="head1">II. TO KNOW THE BIBLE<br />
REQUIRING THE EXERCISE OF THE SPIRIT<br />
AND THE TRAINING IN THE MIND</h2>
<p>[The Spirit and the Bible are two sides of one matter. Similarly, in knowing the Bible, there are also two sides. Almost everything God ordained in the universe has two sides. For example, there is the heaven and the earth; there is male and female; there are two sides, the inside and the outside; there is the top and there is the bottom&mdash;these are all two-sided. For a person to know the Bible, it is the same. There is the need for the mind, and there is the need for the spirit. No one can know the Bible properly by neglecting either aspect of this. To know the Bible, one must be trained in the mind; he must also be exercised in the spirit.]</p>
<p>[Therefore, brothers and sisters, if we really want to know the Bible, we must be balanced. We must understand properly the letter of the Bible and must properly use our spirit to sense the spiritual meaning in the Bible. To read the Bible well, we must train our mind for this and, perhaps even the more, exercise our spirit for this. To train the mind is for the purpose of understanding the Bible. To exercise the spirit is for the purpose of touching and contacting the Bible. One is a matter of the mind; the mind has to understand the Bible. The other is a matter of the spirit; the spirit has to contact the Bible.</p>
<p>With the matter of electricity, to understand it is one thing, and to contact it is quite another. Understanding electricity is a matter of the mind, whereas contacting electricity is a matter of the body. Many times there is electricity, but a board insulates the body from it. Under such a circumstance, although a person&rsquo;s mind may understand electricity, his body cannot contact it. In contrast, some people do not understand electricity at all, yet their bodies have actually contacted electricity. They are able to contact electricity because electricity is there, and because their bodies are not insulated from it. Once they touch it, they come into contact with it. This is a good illustration. Our relationship with the Bible is the same. For our mind to understand the Bible is one thing, and for our spirit to touch it, to contact it, is quite another. Perhaps your mind understands the Bible, but your spirit has not yet contacted or touched it. We must not only use our mind to understand the Bible; we must also use our spirit to contact it. It is not sufficient merely to understand the Bible with the mind; we must also contact and touch the Bible with the spirit.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, while we need to touch and contact the Bible with the spirit, it is also necessary to have the understanding in the mind. We must realize that the reason we want the mind to understand the Bible is so that our spirit can contact and touch its words. One thing is sure: it is difficult for our spirit to touch the words in the Bible without the words first passing through the understanding of the mind. This is true with the words in the Bible; it is also true with the word that is preached. Even the words in this chapter cannot touch your spirit without first passing through the understanding of the mind. Suppose I am here preaching in Chinese, and there is one sitting here who cannot understand Chinese. Nothing will get into this person&rsquo;s mind. How can his spirit be touched? The truth must be grasped by the mind first before it will reach the spirit and touch the person. If there is a person here who is illiterate, and he opens up the Bible to read it, how can his spirit be touched? For his spirit to be touched by the Bible, he must put in some effort to first learn to read with his mind. He must at least be able to identify the words in the Bible before he can read it and be touched by it in his spirit. If we do not understand the words in the Bible, even if we pray for three hours with much inspiration, it will still be impossible for us to understand or be touched when we read the Bible, because its words cannot get through our mind. We must spend much time to learn the language with our mind before we can come to read the Bible. Only then will the words be able to get through our mind to touch our spirit.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the Bible itself is not that simple. One may know every word in the Bible but still not be able to understand its meaning. There are passages in the Bible that cannot be apprehended just by mere reading. The Bible has its own distinctive features and its own background knowledge. Many people with doctorate degrees and much learning open up the Bible to read it, only to find that, though they know every word, they cannot understand some of the passages because they do not comprehend the background knowledge or the special terms of the Bible. Since they do not understand them, it is difficult for them to be touched. Of course, there are certain passages, such as John 3:16, which present no technical difficulty in their wording. As long as one understands the words, a mere reading will be sufficient for the mind to grasp. However, there are many other places in the Bible that contain special problems in their wording. For example, there are specific names of people and places, there is the problem of the dispensation, the types, and the prophecies. In addition to these, there are numerous other matters such as numbers, allegories, and symbols. The ability to understand these specific expressions and terms definitely does not belong to someone who is merely literate or learned in worldly education.</p>
<p>This can be likened to the fact that though I am literate, I am entirely lost when presented with a book on electricity. I can read the words, but I do not understand their meaning because of the many specific terms. To understand a book on electricity, we must first study some of its special terms.</p>
<p>In the same principle, the words in the Bible may be quite common, yet they are very specific and contain many particular terms. If we have not been properly trained in these specific terms and technical matters, we will have a hard time understanding as we read. For example, John 1:17 says that the law was given through Moses. &ldquo;The law&rdquo; is a special term, and &ldquo;Moses&rdquo; is also a special name. Without a background for these two terms, even a hundred Ph.D.s put together would not be able to understand their meaning.</p>
<p>Hence, in order for a saved person to understand the Bible properly, he must spend time in the specific terms and wording and must be trained in his mind. With the training, the reading would be much facilitated. There would not be any difficulty when one encounters words such as &ldquo;the law,&rdquo; &ldquo;Moses,&rdquo; or &ldquo;the shedding of blood for the remission of sins,&rdquo; because one would already know these special terms. As soon as one reads them, they will be readily understood. The words of the Bible will immediately pass through the mind and will be touched by the spirit. Therefore, this time we will spend much time to look into the specific terms and wordings of the Bible. This aspect of training the mind is a preparation in helping us to use our spirit to contact and touch the Bible.]</p><h2 class="head1">III. THE ORIGIN OF THE BIBLE</h2>
<h2 class="head2">A. The Bible Being God-breathed</h2>
<p>[The Scripture is God-breathed (2 Tim. 3:16). This tells us that the Scripture did not come out of man&rsquo;s thought, man&rsquo;s mind, but rather, it is God&rsquo;s breathing His thought and His word through His Spirit into and out of the writers. Hence, the Bible contains God&rsquo;s elements and carries His flavor. As Christians, our greatest joy, or shall we say, our greatest blessing, is to be able to contact God and taste Him daily through the word of His breath.]</p>
<h2 class="head2">B. The Bible Being the Speaking<br />
from God by Men Borne<br />
by the Holy Spirit</h2>
<p>[Since the Scripture is God&rsquo;s breathing His word out from men through His Spirit, no word of the Scripture can be of man&rsquo;s will; rather, men were borne by the Spirit and spoke out of God. The word, &ldquo;men spoke from God, being borne by the Holy Spirit&rdquo; (2 Pet. 1:21), has a twofold meaning: first, men were borne by the Spirit; second, men spoke from God. In the original Greek, being borne by the Holy Spirit means being carried along as a ship by the wind. The writers of the Bible received God&rsquo;s inspiration, and they were under the power of the Holy Spirit, being borne and carried along by Him to speak out God&rsquo;s word. Furthermore, when they spoke, they spoke from within God. It was the Spirit of God carrying men along to speak, and it was also men speaking from within God. In other words, it was God speaking His own word from within men through their mouths.</p>
<p>Second Samuel 23:2 says, &ldquo;The Spirit of the Lord spake by me, and his word was in my tongue.&rdquo; This word was spoken by David. He told us that the words he spoke were the speaking of the Spirit of God through him, and that it was God&rsquo;s word that was in his tongue. Not only the Holy Spirit spoke through him, but also God&rsquo;s word was in his tongue and was spoken from his mouth. This is the Bible.]</p>
<h2 class="head2">C. The Bible Being God&rsquo;s Speaking<br />
in the Prophets and in the Son</h2>
<p>[The Old Testament is God&rsquo;s speaking in the prophets; the New Testament is God&rsquo;s speaking in the Son, our Lord Jesus (Heb. 1:1-2). Hence, whether it is the speaking of the prophets in the Old Testament or the speaking of the Lord Jesus in the New Testament, both are God&rsquo;s speaking and both are of God.]</p>
<h2 class="head2">D. The Bible Being the Holy Spirit&rsquo;s Revelation</h2>
<p>[John 16:13 says, &ldquo;But when He, the Spirit of reality, comes, He will guide you into all the reality; for He will not speak from Himself, but whatever He hears He will speak; and He will disclose to you what is to come&rdquo; (John 16:13). The Lord&rsquo;s word here also proves that after the Spirit&rsquo;s descension, what His disciples spoke and wrote was disclosed to them by the Spirit. Hence, the Lord&rsquo;s word here proves that after His ascension, all the books of the New Testament, written by His disciples, were of the Spirit&rsquo;s revelation and their divine authority was acknowledged by Him. The Scripture, therefore, is the word written by men under God&rsquo;s command (Exo. 34:27), the word of the Spirit of God spoken through men, the word of God spoken through man&rsquo;s mouth (2 Sam. 23:2), and the word spoken by men who were moved by the Spirit (Mark 12:36). The Old Testament is the word spoken by the prophets under God&rsquo;s command (Jer. 1:7), the word of God coming upon the prophet (Ezek. 1:3), and the word of the Spirit of God spoken through the prophets (Zech. 7:7; Acts 3:18; 28:25; Rom. 1:2; 1 Pet. 1:10-12). Some portions of the New Testament are God&rsquo;s speaking in the Lord Jesus (John 14:10), while other portions are words written by the apostles as taught by the Spirit (1 Cor. 2:13). The words written by the apostles as taught by the Spirit are as sacred as the Old Testament Scriptures (2 Pet. 3:15-16). Hence, the entire Bible originates from God; every word and every sentence, every iota and every tittle (Matt. 5:18), are God-inspired. Hence, men should neither add to or take away anything from the Holy Scriptures (Rev. 22:18-19).]</p><h2 class="head1">IV. THE BIBLE BEING THE EMBODIMENT<br />
OF GOD THE SPIRIT</h2>
<p>[God is Spirit. The Spirit, however, is very abstract. It is as abstract as the radio waves in the air. It is hard for man to touch Him or to understand Him. But the Bible is the embodiment of this Spirit. The Lord Jesus said in John 6:63 that the words He speaks are spirit. This shows us that God&rsquo;s word is the embodiment of God&rsquo;s Spirit. This is like a radio receiver capturing the radio waves in the air; the radio receiver becomes the embodiment of the radio waves. When the radio waves are in the air, we neither hear, touch, nor understand them. As soon as they are captured by the receiver, the radio waves become manifested before us. What was abstract becomes real. We can feel it, hear it, and understand it. Thus, we can say that the radio receiver is the embodiment of the radio waves.</p>
<p>In the same principle, if there were only God the Spirit in the universe and there were no Bible, God to us would be the same as the radio waves; we would not be able to grasp Him or find Him. But thank God that His word is here. This word is the embodiment of Himself. God the Spirit is contained in the word. This is why the Lord Jesus said that His word is spirit. In the same way, we can say the word in the Bible is the Spirit. To put this in a clearer way, we can say that the Bible is the embodiment of the Spirit.]</p>
<h2 class="head2">A. The Expression of God the Spirit</h2>
<p>[First, the Bible is the embodiment of God the Spirit; it is also the expression of God the Spirit. God the Spirit is expressed through the Bible as the embodiment. Since the day you heard the gospel until now, how many times have you been moved by the Holy Spirit apart from God&rsquo;s word? Probably very little. Almost every time we are moved by the Holy Spirit, it is through God&rsquo;s word. Never does the Holy Spirit urge us apart from the word. Sometimes, it is through a verse you have read in the Bible. Sometimes, it is through your remembrance of a verse you have read. Sometimes, it is through some words that match the Bible in principle. These are all words. Although you are moved by the Holy Spirit, it is hard to separate the Holy Spirit from the word in these cases. It is hard for you to say whether you are moved by the word or by the Holy Spirit, because at such times the Holy Spirit is in the word. The word is the embodiment and the expression of the Holy Spirit.</p>
<p>Of course, we admit that many times we can have the word without the Spirit. It is like having a radio receiver without the radio waves. Surely, this is vain. We admit that many people read God&rsquo;s Word in vain. But there are also many times when we just open up the Lord&rsquo;s Word a little and the Holy Spirit comes. The Holy Spirit is in the word, and the word is the expression of the Holy Spirit.</p>
<p>At any rate, it is hard for us to be moved by the Holy Spirit without God&rsquo;s word. To put it in another way, seldom are we moved by the word without the moving of the Holy Spirit within. Under normal circumstances, one cannot separate God the Spirit from the Bible, since the Bible is the embodiment and the expression of God the Spirit.]</p>
<h2 class="head2">B. The Dwelling Place of God the Spirit</h2>
<p>[The Bible as the embodiment of God the Spirit is not only His expression, but also His dwelling place. God the Spirit resides in His word. From our experience, we know this is true. Many times, when we read the Bible, we touch God the Spirit. This is because the Bible is the dwelling place of God the Spirit. It is the place where God the Spirit resides.]</p>
<h2 class="head2">C. The Means of God the Spirit</h2>
<p>[There is another point. The Bible is the means of God the Spirit. God is Spirit. Whatever He does to us is through the Bible. Whatever God does toward us and whatever God wants us to do are done through His word. The word is the embodiment of God the Spirit. Hence, it is also the expression, the dwelling place, and the means of God the Spirit. Under normal circumstances, whenever we touch the word in the Bible, we should receive, touch, and feel the moving of God the Spirit and should contact God Himself.</p>
<p>This is the Bible. What is the Bible? The Bible is God&rsquo;s word, God&rsquo;s revelation, God&rsquo;s breathing out, and the embodiment of God the Spirit.]</p>
<h2 class="head1">V. THE FUNCTIONS OF THE BIBLE</h2>
<h2 class="head2">A. Testifying Concerning the Lord Jesus</h2>
<p>[The first function of the Bible is to testify concerning the Lord Jesus (John 5:39). The Lord Jesus is the subject and contents of the Bible; the Bible is the explanation and expression of the Lord Jesus. The Lord Jesus is God&rsquo;s living Word; the Bible is God&rsquo;s written Word. The Bible, God&rsquo;s written Word, must have the Lord Jesus, the living Word, as its reality; otherwise, it is but mere doctrines and empty letters. The Lord Jesus, the living Word, must have the Bible, the written Word, as His expression; otherwise, He is mysterious and difficult to know, vague and hard to grasp. However, since there is the clear, definite explanation and plain revelation of the Scriptures, the Lord Jesus can be known practically and comprehended definitely by men. Not only every book of the New Testament reveals the Lord Jesus, but every part of the Old Testament, whether (1) the Law of Moses, (2) the Prophets, or (3) the Psalms (these are the three major parts of the Old Testament), testifies and speaks concerning the Lord Jesus. Hence, if we want to know the Lord Jesus, we must read and understand the Bible.]</p><h2 class="head2">B. Making Men Wise unto Salvation</h2>
<p>[The functions of the Bible are of two aspects: one aspect is to serve the Lord, and the other aspect is to serve us. On the one hand, it testifies of the Lord Jesus and, on the other hand, it causes us to receive grace and be built up. The first function of the Bible toward us is to make us wise unto salvation (2 Tim. 3:15); it reveals to us how God saves men in Christ, and how men may be saved by faith, so that we may know the way of salvation.]</p>
<h2 class="head2">C. Causing Men to Be Regenerated</h2>
<p>[The first practical function of the Bible in us is to cause us to be regenerated (1 Pet. 1:23). The Bible is the Word of the living God, and it contains the life of the living God. When we receive the word of the Scriptures into us by faith, it comes into us like a seed of life, sowing God&rsquo;s life into us; thus, we have God&rsquo;s life and are regenerated.]</p>
<h2 class="head2">D. Being the Believers&rsquo; Spiritual Milk</h2>
<p>[When we first get saved, we do not have a strong enough comprehension concerning spiritual things. Some portions of the Scriptures are like milk that can nourish us and make us grow in our spiritual life (1 Pet. 2:2). Hence, a newly regenerated believer must long for the word of the Bible, like newborn babes longing for the guileless milk of the word. Otherwise, his spiritual life cannot grow, and he will continue to be one who is an infant in Christ (1 Cor. 3:1-2).]</p>
<h2 class="head2">E. Being the Believers&rsquo; Bread of Life</h2>
<p>[The word of the Scriptures is also our spiritual bread of life (Matt. 4:4). Just as our physical life needs nourishment, so also our spiritual life needs nourishment. The nourishment of our spiritual life can only be supplied by the word of the Bible. In order to be living and strong before God, we cannot depend on bread alone, but on every word, that is, the word of the Bible, that proceeds out through the mouth of God. We must take the word of God as food and eat it (Jer. 15:16), even regarding the word of the Bible as more important than our food (Job 23:12b). Otherwise, our spiritual life cannot grow. We must practice to have our faculties exercised in apprehending the word of the Bible so that we may be able to understand the words that are hard to interpret; that is, like those who are mature, we can eat the solid food (Heb. 5:13-14). Otherwise, our spiritual life cannot be strong.]</p>
<h2 class="head2">F. Making the Believers Complete</h2>
<p>[The teachings of the Bible can give us endurance, encouragement, and hope (Rom. 15:4). Many Christians have fallen into tribulation and sickness. Being unable to bear it, they feel sorrowful and hopeless, but when they read a portion or a sentence of the Bible, they have the enduring strength in their hearts, or they receive unspeakable comfort, and thus obtain hope that is beyond their expectation. The Bible also records many things as warnings to us that we may be admonished, be on the alert, and not repeat the former mistakes (1 Cor. 10:11). Hence, after our regeneration, the Bible is profitable for teaching, for reproof, for correction, for instruction in righteousness, that we, the men of God, may be complete (2 Tim. 3:16-17).]</p>
<h2 class="head2">SUMMARY</h2>
<p>The two greatest gifts of God for our enjoyment are the Spirit inside of us and the Bible outside of us. The Spirit gives us life and the Bible gives us stability; we need both to be proper Christians and to grow in life. The Bible is composed of words; therefore we need our mind. The Bible embodies the Triune God; therefore we need to use our spirit to receive the Spirit and life. Reading the Bible requires a balance between the use of our mind and of our spirit. We need to use both our mind and our spirit in order to apprehend what is revealed and conveyed in the Bible. The Bible testifies concerning the Lord Jesus. It also makes us wise unto salvation, thus causing us to be regenerated. After we begin our Christian life through regeneration, the Bible becomes our spiritual milk and bread of life for us to grow in the Lord. Finally, we will be full grown, made complete, fully equipped for every good work of God. Praise the Lord for giving us both the Spirit and the Bible! We need to spend time every day in the Bible exercising our spirit to enjoy all of its benefits.</p>

</ol><h2 class="head2">Text</h2>
<p>We know that the Bible is the word of God. We also know that God did not write a book in heaven and then send an angel to bring it down to earth. How did God write the Bible? Who did He use to write the Bible? Why do we recognize the writings of those who wrote the Bible as God&rsquo;s word? This lesson will answer these questions and give us additional background concerning the Bible and its completion. It is necessary for us to know the background of the book we love.</p>
<h2 class="head1">I. BEFORE THE BIBLE WAS WRITTEN</h2>
<h2 class="head2">A. Without the Written Revelation of God</h2>
<p>[In the first 2500 years of human history, there were no written revelations of God. There were only His verbal instructions, such as His instructions to the forefathers, including Adam, Abel, Noah, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. In Genesis we see that before the Bible was written, God often appeared to the forefathers and gave them verbal instructions.]</p>
<h2 class="head2">B. There Being Instructions Handed Down<br />
through Oral Tradition</h2>
<p>[Before the Bible was written, although there were no written revelations of God, there were verbal instructions handed down from generation to generation by the fathers. This fact can be proved from inscribed stone tablets discovered in Egypt and Babylon. In 1901, a black pillar was discovered in Persia on which were inscribed some of the laws of the ancient times. Some of them were similar to the Law of Moses, yet it was inscribed five to six hundred years before the time of Moses. This proves that before the Bible was written, among ancient civilizations, there were verbal instructions of God handed down through their forefathers.]</p>
<h2 class="head1">II. THE LANGUAGES USED IN THE ANCIENT TIME</h2>
<h2 class="head2">A. The Ancient Languages</h2>
<p>[If we want to know how the Bible was written, we need to know about the alphabets and languages used by the ancient civilizations.]</p>
<h2 class="head3">1. Akkadian</h2>
<p>[Before the flood, it is not known what language man used. According to historical research, the earliest language spoken by man after the flood came from Akkad in the northwest region of ancient Babylon and is called Akkadian. The three terms, &ldquo;Adam,&rdquo; &ldquo;Eden,&rdquo; and &ldquo;Sabbath&rdquo; in the book of Genesis chapter two are probably Akkadian and not Hebrew. Akkadian was originally made of lines. These lines were drawn into wedge shapes. Eventually the writing developed into the cuneiform script. This script was used until approximately two thousand years before Christ, about the time of Abraham.]</p>
<h2 class="head3">2. The Babylonian Writing of the Tribe of Shem</h2>
<p>[From about two thousand years before Christ, the Babylonian writing of the tribe of Shem replaced Akkadian. We believe that this is the origin of the Aramaic language that came later. This kind of writing was used until approximately six hundred years before Christ, at the time Nebuchadnezzar ruled in Babylon.]</p>
<h2 class="head3">3. The Language of Canaan and<br />
the Hebrew Language</h2>
<p>[Ur of the Chaldees was the original dwelling place of Abraham (Gen. 11:31); it was in Babylon. The people there were descendants of the tribe of Shem, and the language they used was the Babylonian language just mentioned. When Abraham was called by God into Canaan, historians all agree that he would naturally have given up his native Babylonian language of Shem and would have taken up the local language of Canaan. This language of Canaan probably became the later Hebrew language, or a part of it. Some have taken the &ldquo;language of Canaan&rdquo; in Isaiah 19:18 to mean the language used by the Israelites, the descendants of Abraham. Historians have postulated that a large portion of the subsequent Hebrew language was developed from such a language of Canaan.]</p>
<h2 class="head3">4. Aramaic</h2>
<p>[About six hundred years before Christ, the Israelites were taken captive by the Babylonians to Babylon. They stayed there for a long time. Spontaneously, they gave up Hebrew and adopted the local Aramaic language, which was the Chaldean language. After their return from their captivity, history tells us that they were still using this Aramaic language. At the time of the Lord Jesus, the Romans had already occupied the land of Israel. Although Greek was commonly used throughout the Roman Empire, the Jews nevertheless still used Aramaic among themselves. Only the rabbis spoke and read the Scriptures in Hebrew in the synagogues. If there were some in the synagogues who did not understand Hebrew, there would be someone to translate it into Aramaic.</p>
<p>Many historians have postulated that the language used by the Lord Jesus to speak with the people daily was probably Aramaic, not Hebrew. The words that He spoke in Mark 5:41, &ldquo;Talitha koum,&rdquo; and in Mark 15:34, &ldquo;Eloi, Eloi, lama sabachthani,&rdquo; were all Aramaic.]</p>
<h2 class="head3">5. Greek</h2>
<p>[After the Roman Empire conquered the lands surrounding the Mediterranean Sea and spread the Greek culture everywhere, Greek became the common vernacular language used by all the people in the Roman Empire at that time.</p>
<p>All of these languages are directly or indirectly related to the completion of the Bible.]</p>
<h2 class="head2">B. The Languages Used in the Bible</h2>
<h2 class="head3">1. Hebrew</h2>
<p>[The main body of the Old Testament was written in Hebrew.]</p>
<h2 class="head3">2. Aramaic</h2>
<p>[In the Old Testament, there are four portions which were written in Aramaic. They are Jeremiah 10:11, Daniel 2:4&mdash;7:28, Ezra 4:8&mdash;6:18, and 7:12-26. These four portions are absolutely related to the Aramaic people (that is, the Babylonians). That is why the Bible used Aramaic there instead of Hebrew.]</p>
<h2 class="head3">3. Greek</h2>
<p>[The whole New Testament was written in Greek. A few sentences in it were written in Aramaic. They are those already mentioned, &ldquo;Talitha koum,&rdquo; and &ldquo;Eloi, Eloi, lama sabachthani.&rdquo;]</p><h2 class="head1">III. THE AUTHORS OF THE BIBLE<br />
AND THE PLACES IN WHICH IT WAS WRITTEN</h2>
<h2 class="head2">A. The Old Testament</h2>
<p>[The Pentateuch of Moses&mdash;Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers, and Deuteronomy&mdash;was written by Moses. Moses was raised in the palace. He was a scholar, a politician, and a military leader. According to the world, he was also a religious leader. The Pentateuch was written by him at Mount Sinai and in the wilderness.</p>
<p>The book of Joshua was written by Joshua. He was a military leader and a politician. He wrote most of this book in Canaan and a smaller portion in the plains of Moab.</p>
<p>There are a lot of contentions about the authorship of Judges, and they are hard to verify. However, many authorities have postulated that it was written by Samuel.</p>
<p>The book of Ruth is connected to the preceding book of Judges and the following books of Samuel in history and in time. Therefore, it was most probably written by Samuel.</p>
<p>The first twenty-four chapters of 1 Samuel were probably written by Samuel. Chapter twenty-five, verse 1 says that Samuel died. Therefore, from chapter twenty-five on, the rest of 1 Samuel and the whole book of 2 Samuel were surely not written by him. First Chronicles 29:29 says that regarding the things of David, there was not only the recording of Samuel, but also the recordings of the prophets Nathan and Gad. Bible scholars have concluded from this verse that the recordings in the books of Samuel after the death of Samuel must have been continued by the prophets Nathan and Gad.</p>
<p>Why was 2 Samuel called by that name even though it was not written by Samuel? This is because these two books form one group in history. Therefore, the author or authors continued to write from chapter twenty-five of 1 Samuel until the end of 2 Samuel. Moreover, in the original Hebrew Old Testament, the two books of Samuel were a single book, not two. It was only when the Old Testament was translated into Greek in the Septuagint that Samuel was divided into the first and second books, because it was too long and difficult to roll up into one scroll.</p>
<p>Samuel was a Nazarite consecrated to God. He became a priest, and he also became a judge and a prophet. In addition, he brought in the kingship. It is certain that his book was written in Canaan.</p>
<p>Both Nathan and Gad were seers. It is also certain that their records were written in Canaan.</p>
<p>The books of 1 and 2 Kings were one book in the Hebrew Old Testament. They were divided by the Septuagint. It is hard for Bible scholars to ascertain who was the author of Kings, but some think that Jeremiah was the author.</p>
<p>The books of 1 and 2 Chronicles were also one book in the Hebrew Old Testament. It was also divided by the Septuagint. This book has been generally ascertained by many authorities to have been written by Ezra. If we compare the ending of Chronicles and the beginning of Ezra, we can see that the style, the grammar, and the phrases are all very similar and have to be from the same author. Therefore it has been proposed that Chronicles was written by Ezra.</p>
<p>The book of Ezra was certainly written by Ezra. Ezra was a very learned scribe and priest. He knew the laws of God very well and therefore was also a lawyer. His books were written in Jerusalem.</p>
<p>The book of Nehemiah was certainly written by Nehemiah. Ezra was a descendant of Levi, the tribe of the priests. Nehemiah was a descendant of Judah, the tribe of the kings. One attended to religion, and the other attended to politics. At that time, the Persian Empire treated Judea as a province, and Nehemiah became the governor of Judea. His book was also written in Jerusalem.</p>
<p>It is hard to ascertain the authorship of the book of Esther. Probably Mordecai was the author, because in 9:20 and 23 it is mentioned that Mordecai recorded the happenings then. He was one who loved God and loved the Jews. If it was written by him, it was written in the heathen city of Shushan.</p>
<p>There is a greater contention about the authorship of the book of Job. The things recorded in this book took place before the time of Moses and may have been concurrent with Abraham, which is about two thousand years before Christ. Some have said it was written by Elihu, and some have said that Moses was probably the author.</p>
<p>Among the Psalms there are some that do not mention any author, but the authorship of most of them is identified. Among the one hundred fifty psalms, at least seventy-three are designated clearly as the Psalms of David. In addition to these, there are quite a few that were clearly written by David, even though the author was not clearly stated. Therefore, David wrote the largest number, nearly one hundred psalms. In addition, there were Asaph, Heman, Ethan, the sons of Korah, Solomon, and Moses. Therefore, at least seven authors were clearly indicated. The sons of Korah are plural in number in the manuscript, and this may therefore refer to more than one person. All the psalms of these people were probably written in the land of Israel. David was first a shepherd and then a king. Quite a number of his psalms were written while he was being persecuted in the wilderness. Some were written while he was reigning in the palace. We are not very clear about Asaph, Heman, and Ethan. It may be that they were common people. The sons of Korah were the descendants of Korah. Bible scholars admit that this Korah is the Korah recorded in Numbers 16 as the one leading the rebellion against God. However, from the descendants of this rebellious one, there came out such godly and God-loving people. They did not want to divulge their own names. They would rather show forth the greatness of the grace of God by acknowledging that they were the descendants of the rebellious one against God.</p>
<p>Most of the book of Proverbs was written by Solomon. There were a few words by Agur and Lemuel. Hence, Proverbs was written by at least three persons. Solomon was the most glorious king and the wisest one in human history. All his books were written in Jerusalem. Agur may have been a common person, and Lemuel was a king.</p>
<p>The book of Ecclesiastes was written by Solomon.</p>
<p>The Song of Solomon was also written by Solomon.</p>
<p>There are seventeen books of the prophets from Isaiah to Malachi. They are written by sixteen prophets, with Jeremiah and Lamentations both written by Jeremiah.</p>
<p>Isaiah was a minister serving the king and was also a historian (2 Chron. 26:22; 32:32). His book was written in Jerusalem, the capital city.</p>
<p>Jeremiah was born a priest and became a prophet. He spent most of his time in Judea and the last period in Egypt.</p>
<p>Ezekiel was a priest turned prophet. He wrote the book of Ezekiel in the land of captivity in Babylon.</p>
<p>Daniel was of the tribe of Judah. His book should have been written in the land of captivity in Babylon and Ulai.</p>
<p>Amos was the most peculiar among the sixteen prophets. He was a shepherd, a caretaker of mulberry trees, and probably would not have received much education. His book should have been written in the land of Israel.</p>
<p>Jonah probably wrote his book in Nineveh.</p>
<p>Zephaniah was a royal descendant turned prophet. His book was written in the land of Judea.</p>
<p>Zechariah was also a priest turned prophet. His book was also written in the land of Judea.</p>
<p>In addition to these, Hosea, Joel, Obadiah, Micah, Nahum, Habakkuk, Haggai, and Malachi, eight altogether, were most probably common people who became prophets. Their books were written either in Judea or in the land of Israel.</p>
<p>Therefore, there were at least thirty-two authors of the Old Testament from Moses to Malachi. If Job was written by Elihu, and if more than one of the sons of Korah wrote, then there were more than thirty-two authors. Among them, all except Elihu, the probable Gentile author, and Agur and Lemuel, whose tribal sources are unknown, were Israelites. Among these authors of the Old Testament, there were people of various levels and backgrounds. There were scholars, religious persons, politicians, military leaders, kings, priests, prophets, common people, shepherds, and farmers. Some were highly educated, and some, without much education. Some were persecuted and oppressed, and some enjoyed glory and honor. Some were living in Israel, and some were in the land of the Gentiles in captivity.]</p><h2 class="head2">B. The New Testament</h2>
<p>[The Gospel of Matthew was written by Matthew. He was originally a tax collector, and his origin was not honorable. The Lord called him to be one of the twelve apostles. His Gospel was probably written in Judea.</p>
<p>The Gospel of Mark was written by Mark. He was a very ordinary disciple. His Gospel was probably written in Rome.</p>
<p>The Gospel of Luke was written by Luke. He was a Gentile doctor. His Gospel was probably written in a Gentile land.</p>
<p>The Gospel of John was written by John. John was a fisherman in Galilee and was not well educated. But he was also called by the Lord to be one of the twelve apostles. His Gospel was probably written in a Gentile land.</p>
<p>The Acts of the Apostles was also written by Luke, the doctor. This book was probably also written in a Gentile land.</p>
<p>The fourteen books from Romans to Hebrews were written by Paul. He was originally zealous for Judaism and was also a very learned person. He had capability, ability, and capacity and could accomplish things. He was specially called by the Lord early in life to become an apostle to the Gentile people. His books were all written in the Gentile lands, and some were written in a Roman jail.</p>
<p>The Epistle of James was written by James. He was the flesh brother of the Lord Jesus (Gal. 1:19) and was a devout Christian who became a pillar of the church (2:9), but he was rather full of Judaism from his background. His book was probably written in Jerusalem.</p>
<p>The first and second Epistles of Peter were written by Peter. Peter was also a fisherman without much education, but he was called by the Lord to become the first of the twelve apostles. His book was probably written in a Gentile land.</p>
<p>The first, second, and third Epistles of John were all written by the apostle John. These three books should have been written in a Gentile land.</p>
<p>The book of Jude was written by Jude. He was also a flesh brother of the Lord. He could have written this book in Judea.</p>
<p>The book of Revelation was also written by the apostle John. It was written in a Gentile land and probably on the island of Patmos.</p>
<p>Hence, there were eight authors of the New Testament. Among them, Paul was a Jewish scholar, and Luke was a Gentile physician. They were the only two who had received a high education. The rest were all common people and without much education.</p>
<p>The number of authors of the whole Bible was more than forty, and most of them were Jews. Luke was one who was a Gentile. This indicates that among the authors there were Jews and Gentiles, kings and common people, scribes and soldiers, scholars and uneducated ones. Some were in high places, and some were very lowly; some were rich, and some were poor. There were all kinds of people. As to the places where the books were written, some were written in the wilderness; some, in a palace; some, on an island; and some, in jail.]</p>
<h2 class="head1">IV. THE TIMES WHEN THE BIBLE WAS WRITTEN</h2>
<p>[The first few books in the Old Testament, the Pentateuch of Moses, were written about 1500 B.C. The last book, Malachi, was written about 400 B.C. Therefore, all thirty-nine books in the Old Testament were completed within eleven hundred years .</p>
<p>Matthew, the first book in the New Testament, was written between A.D. 37 and 40. Revelation, the last book, was written between A.D. 94 and 96. Therefore, the whole New Testament was finished within fifty or so years. Hence, the whole Bible spans about 1500 to 1600 years from beginning to end, from Genesis to Revelation.]</p><h2 class="head1">V. THE RECOGNITION OF THE AUTHORITY<br />
OF THE BIBLE</h2>
<h2 class="head2">A. The Old Testament</h2>
<h2 class="head3">1. The Pentateuch of Moses</h2>
<p>[Among the Old Testament writings, the Pentateuch has always been recognized by the Jews as being from God and having absolute and divine authority. This is because it was the written revelation of God to Moses, and was handed down through their ancestors. Although the Jews acknowledge that the whole Old Testament was from God, they gave the Pentateuch of Moses a very special position. In all the Jewish synagogues throughout the world today, there are at least two or three copies of the Pentateuch of Moses. They may not have the other books of the Old Testament, but they always have the Pentateuch. Incidentally, the Samaritans acknowledged only the Pentateuch of Moses. Of course the Samaritans&rsquo; religion is a distorted one, but this proves the authority of the Pentateuch of Moses among the ancient worshippers of God.]</p>
<h2 class="head3">2. The Other Books</h2>
<p>[The other books in the Old Testament were gradually acknowledged by the people of God to be from God by virtue of their own value and authority. One author put it very well by saying, &ldquo;There is no need to declare a tree by its name. It only needs to grow up gradually, to bloom, and to bear fruit; spontaneously men will recognize what kind of tree it is. In the same way, whether or not all the other books in the Old Testament were from God is best answered by the test of time; there is no need for any explicit declaration. The values and authority of the books spontaneously manifest themselves.&rdquo; This is surely true. All the inspired writers among God&rsquo;s people after the Pentateuch had their writings recognized as being from God through a long period of testing and through the identification of authority in them.</p>
<p>In approximately 457 B.C., the scribe Ezra compiled the Pentateuch of Moses and all the other authoritative writings commonly recognized among the people of God to become the various books in the Old Testament. (Nehemiah and Malachi were not included because they were not written yet.) The Jewish historian, Josephus, and other Gentile historians all verified this fact.</p>
<p>After Ezra there was a group of scribes among the Jews called &ldquo;The Great Synagogue&rdquo; who continued with this compiling and ascertaining work. In 400 B.C. they completed the compilation of all the books we have in the Old Testament today. However, in their work there were not thirty-nine books, but twenty-four books. We will speak about this later. Hence, by 400 B.C. the writing of the Old Testament was not only completed but was also acknowledged and recognized.</p>
<p>At any rate, by approximately 277 B.C. at the latest, when the Septuagint translation of the Old Testament into Greek was made, all the books of the Old Testament must have already been recognized.]</p>
<h2 class="head2">B. The New Testament</h2>
<h2 class="head3">1. The Gospels</h2>
<p>[The early churches frequently read the Gospels and the Old Testament during their meetings. Hence, the four Gospels were the earliest recognized books of the New Testament.]</p>
<h2 class="head3">2. The Other Books</h2>
<p>[After the apostles passed away, there was some confusion due to the fact that some people wrote books in the names of the apostles. Therefore the leaders of the early churches, the so-called Fathers, collected all the books written by the apostles and put them together with the Gospels. Not long after Polycarp was martyred, the New Testament was viewed basically the same way among all the different churches. However, there were still disagreements as to whether or not the seven books of Hebrews, James, 2 Peter, 2 and 3 John, Jude, and Revelation should be included. Since these books were truly inspired by the Holy Spirit and have spiritual authority and value, after a long time of testing, in a council of the leaders of all the churches, these seven books were acknowledged to be part of the New Testament in A.D. 397, at Carthage in North Africa. The New Testament was recognized as having the same twenty-seven books as we have it today. Hence, by A.D. 397 at the Council at Carthage, the whole Bible, including both the Old and the New Testaments, was recognized and acknowledged by God&rsquo;s people.]</p>
<h2 class="head1">SUMMARY</h2>
<p>[The entire Bible is God&rsquo;s breath. Each book of the Bible is God&rsquo;s revelation with every line and word coming from the inspiration of the Holy Spirit.] God used over forty men to write the Bible. Only the present 66 books are recognized as the word of God. These comprise the infallible word of God that we have today.</p>
<p>We treasure the Bible. We want to study and devour the contents of the Bible so that we will be filled with God. We want to inhale every line and eat every word so that we may become His corporate expression, having His authority to bring in His kingdom.</p>

<p>[If we want to know any book, we have to grasp its subject and central thought. In addition, we need a proper analysis of its structure and a clear understanding of its sections. The Bible has its own subject, its central thought, and its sections. Although there are sixty-six books in the Bible, it has its subject and central thought; there are also distinctive sections within its structure. If we want to know the Bible, we must clearly understand these three things.]</p>
<h2 class="head1">I. THE SUBJECT OF THE BIBLE</h2>
<p>[The subject of the Bible is contained in only four sentences: God planned and created, Satan rebelled and damaged, man fell and was lost, and Christ redeemed and built. Within this subject, there are four persons: the first is God, the second is Satan, the third is man, and the fourth is Christ. The whole Bible speaks almost exclusively of these four persons. For each of these four persons, we have two verbs. God planned and created. He planned in eternity past and created in time. Satan rebelled and damaged. God had His plan and created according to His plan, but Satan rebelled against God and damaged God&rsquo;s creation. All Satan did was to rebel and damage. These two verbs can include all of Satan&rsquo;s work in the universe. Man fell and was lost. Man fell, and as a result, was lost from God&rsquo;s hands and from being used by God. The story of man in the whole Bible can be summed up by these two verbs: man fell and was lost. Christ redeemed and built. In the past, when Christians spoke about Christ, they only spoke of redemption; the matter of building has always been overlooked or missed. But we must not forget that our Lord not only said that the Son of Man came to seek and save the lost, but He also said that Peter was a stone, and that He would build His church upon this rock. On the one hand, the Gospel of John says that Christ &ldquo;came that they may have life.&rdquo; On the other hand, it also says that though man may &ldquo;destroy this temple,&rdquo; Christ will &ldquo;raise it up&rdquo; in three days. Whether it be the Lord&rsquo;s accomplishment of redemption, or the Lord Jesus&rsquo; coming to be life to man, the result is for the building up of the church. For this reason, we must not see redemption only; we must see the building also.</p>
<p>At the beginning of the Bible, we see gold, bdellium, and precious stones, which are materials for building. At the end of the Bible, we see a completed building, built with gold, pearl, and precious stones. This indicates that God will eventually have a building, which is built up as a result of the redemption accomplished by His Son as the Lamb. Hence, when we speak of Christ, we should not merely see Him as the redeeming One, but we must also see Him as the building One. He came to redeem and He came also to build. The reason God created everything including man is to have a building in the universe.</p>
<p>We should remember these four persons very well, together with the two verbs associated with each. If we do this, we will understand the subject of the Bible. God created everything including man according to His plan. Satan was proud and rebelled against God; he maliciously damaged God&rsquo;s creation and caused man to fall and to be lost. Christ came to redeem man and to build him up as His glorious church and His mystical Body so that God can obtain a corporate vessel for His expression. This is the subject of the whole Bible. Now, let us see the subjects of the Old and New Testaments separately.]</p>
<h2 class="head2">A. The Subject of the Old Testament</h2>
<p>[The subject of the Old Testament is that God created, Satan damaged, man fell, and God promised the coming of Christ for redemption. Although there are thirty-nine books in the Old Testament, it mainly shows us that God created the universe, Satan came in to damage God&rsquo;s creation, man fell, and God promised the coming of Christ for the accomplishment of redemption. Hence, the Christ in the Old Testament was only a hope for man, because He was only promised by God to the fallen man as a Redeemer.]</p>
<h2 class="head2">B. The Subject of the New Testament</h2>
<p>[The subject of the New Testament is Christ coming to redeem sinners and to build up the church according to God&rsquo;s plan. In the Old Testament, we see how God created, Satan damaged, man fell, and God promised the coming of Christ to redeem man according to God&rsquo;s plan and promise. In the New Testament, we see how Christ redeemed the lost sinners according to God&rsquo;s plan and promise and how He builds up His glorious church as His mystical Body for God to have a corporate vessel to express Himself. When we put the subjects of the Old and New Testaments together, we have the subject of the whole Bible as presented earlier.]</p><h2 class="head1">II. THE CENTRAL THOUGHT OF THE BIBLE</h2>
<p>[In Christianity there are many books of Bible exposition. Most of them say that the central thought of the Bible is Christ. But today, according to the light we have received through His mercy, we feel it is insufficient merely to say that Christ is the central thought of the Bible. We should remember the words the apostle Paul spoke: &ldquo;This mystery is great, but I speak with regard to Christ and the church&rdquo; (Eph. 5:32). Hence, we must say that the central thought of the Bible is Christ and the church. The Bible not only reveals Christ Himself; it also reveals the bride and the Body of Christ, which is the church.</p>
<p>No doubt the whole Bible shows us Christ. But at the same time, it also shows us that Christ needs a church, in the same way that a man needs a wife. From the very beginning, the Bible reveals this in a type&mdash;that it was not good for Adam to live alone. We know from the New Testament that this typifies the fact that Christ needs a bride. Therefore, at the beginning of the Bible, not only does it reveal to us the one Adam, but it also reveals to us how Eve was produced from Adam to become his bride and how they two became one. There was Adam, and there was Eve. The apostle said that this is a great mystery, but that he was speaking with regard to Christ and the church. In the Bible one cannot just see Christ without seeing the church. Many talk about Isaac and forget about Rebecca. But there was Isaac and there was Rebecca. In the Bible there is the story of God contacting man through Christ, but there is also man occupying a very important position. The central characters in the Bible are not only God in Christ, but also man as the bride of God in Christ. The universal couple is God and man. In the universe God is the only male, and man is the counterpart of God. If man is without God, he is like a widow. If God is without man, He is like a bachelor. In the universe there has to be the matching of God with man.</p>
<p>For this reason, the first scene presented to us in the Old Testament is the story of a man seeking for a wife. This man typifies Christ, and Christ is the embodiment of God. This wife typifies the church, and the church is a group of men saved by God out of mankind to be built up by Him. Throughout the Old Testament, God was all the time standing in the position of a husband toward His people. God treated the Israelites as His wife. Later on, the Lord Jesus came. John, the forerunner of the Lord Jesus, not only proclaimed Him as the Lamb of God who takes away the sin of the world, but also testified that He who has the bride is the Bridegroom. Not only does John introduce the Lord Jesus as the redeeming Lamb, but he also introduces Him as the Bridegroom who has the bride. Then in the Epistles, the apostle Paul says, &ldquo;I betrothed you (the saved ones) to one Husband, to present a pure virgin to Christ.&rdquo; He also says that the church is to Christ as Eve is to Adam. In Revelation, at the end of the whole Bible, there is a proclamation that the marriage of the Lamb is come. When the New Jerusalem appears, it is said to be prepared as a bride adorned for her husband. That is the union of God and man. All the redeemed people and the Redeemer become one as the mystery of the universe, which is Christ and the church.</p>
<p>Therefore, the central character of the whole Bible is this mysterious couple. God and man become one in the same way that a man and a woman become one flesh. Man and woman becoming one flesh is a type of God and man becoming one. Christ is God becoming one with man, and the church is man becoming one with God. God comes in His Son Christ in order that He would become one with man. Man is built up inHis Son as His church, in order that he would become one with God. This oneness, this mysterious union, is Christ and the church, and is also the union of God and man. This is the central thought of the Bible.</p>
<p>We can speak of the central thought of the Bible another way. Christ is the living word of God, and the Bible is the written word of God. Christ is the living word, and the Bible is the written word. Christ is the content of the Bible, and the Bible is the explanation of Christ. If we take away Christ from the Bible, the Bible will become an empty book, like an empty vessel without its content. At the same time, no one can know Christ well without knowing the Bible, because the Bible is the explanation of Christ. Only when one reads the explanation in the Bible can he understand and know what Christ is. The Bible tells us that everything of Christ is put into the church and expressed through the church. Hence, the central thought of the Bible is Christ and the church. It is insufficient to know Christ only; we have to know the church as well. The Bible shows us that the universal central character has both a head and a body. The Head is Christ and the Body is the church. Hence, Christ and the church are the central thought of the Bible.]</p>
<h2 class="head2">A. The Central Thought of the Old Testament&mdash;<br />
Leading Man to Christ for Redemption</h2>
<p>[The Old Testament leads man to Christ that man would be redeemed by Him.]</p>
<h2 class="head2">B. The Central Thought of the New Testament&mdash;<br />
in Christ the Church Being Redeemed and Built Up</h2>
<p>[The New Testament shows us how the church is redeemed and built up in Christ.]</p><h2 class="head1">III. SUBDIVISION<br />
ACCORDING TO ITS STRUCTURE</h2>
<p>[There are many ways to subdivide the Bible into sections. We have selected four of the more important ways for our consideration.]</p>
<h2 class="head2">A. The Old Testament:</h2>
<h2 class="head3">1. The Pentateuch</h2>
<p>[These are the first five books of the Bible: Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers, and Deuteronomy. These five were written by Moses and therefore are known generally as the Pentateuch of Moses.]</p>
<h2 class="head3">2. History</h2>
<p>[After the Pentateuch are the books of history. There are twelve books from Joshua to Esther: Joshua, Judges, Ruth, 1 Samuel, 2 Samuel, 1 Kings, 2 Kings, 1 Chronicles, 2 Chronicles, Ezra, Nehemiah, and Esther.]</p>
<h2 class="head3">3. Psalms</h2>
<p>[There are six books, all in the style of poems. Five books&mdash;Job, Psalms, Proverbs, Ecclesiastes, and Song of Songs&mdash;are related. Lamentations is also added because it is in the style of poetry rather than prose. In some translated versions, one cannot identify these six books as poems, but in the original, these are clearly in poetic forms, with couplets and matching phrases. They are not at all in the style of prose.]</p>
<h2 class="head3">4. The Books of the Prophets</h2>
<p>[This is the last part of the Old Testament. It can be divided into three categories chronologically.]</p>
<h2 class="head4">a. The Books of the Prophets before the Captivity</h2>
<p>[There are a total of eleven books. If arranged in chronological order according to the time they were written, the earliest one is probably Obadiah, second is Joel, third is Jonah, fourth is Amos, fifth is Hosea, sixth is Isaiah, seventh is Micah, eighth is Nahum, ninth is Zephaniah, tenth is Jeremiah, and the eleventh is Habakkuk. Jeremiah was a little earlier than Habakkuk, but Jeremiah was extended into the captivity period. Jeremiah began as a prophet before the captivity and ended as one in the captivity. This is why some Bible expositors consider him as a prophet before the captivity while others consider him as one during the captivity. We suggest considering him as one before the captivity because he spent most of his time as a prophet before the captivity.]</p>
<h2 class="head4">b. The Books of the Prophets during the Captivity</h2>
<p>[There are a total of two books, which are Daniel and Ezekiel. Daniel and Ezekiel were both prophets during the captivity.]</p>
<h2 class="head4">c. The Books of the Prophets after the Captivity</h2>
<p>[There are a total of three books. The first is Haggai, then Zechariah, and the last one is Malachi.]</p>
<p>[By dividing the prophets according to the time of captivity, there are these three categories of books of the prophets. The earliest prophet, Obadiah, lived at about 800 B.C., close to 900 B.C. The last prophet, Malachi, lived at about 390 B.C., close to 400 B.C. Isaiah lived at about 760 B.C. If we also consider Lamentations a book of the prophets, there are seventeen books of the prophets from Isaiah to Malachi. If we take out Lamentations, we have sixteen books.</p>
<p>Some have grouped the longer books of the prophets as major prophets, and the shorter books of the prophets as the minor prophets. In that case, there are four books among the major prophets, which are Isaiah, Jeremiah, Ezekiel, and Daniel. The remaining twelve books are all the minor prophets.]</p>
<h2 class="head2">B. The New Testament</h2>
<p>[1. The four Gospels: There are four books of the Gospel. They are the first four books of the New Testament.</p>
<p>2. The Acts of the Apostles: There is only one book of Acts.</p>
<p>3. The Epistles: There are twenty-one books, from Romans to Jude.</p>
<p>4. The book of Prophecy: There is only one book, Revelation.</p>
<p>The four Gospels, Acts, the twenty-one Epistles, plus the last book of prophecy, add up to twenty-seven books. An easy way to memorize the number of books of the Bible is to remember that 3 times 9 equals 27, that is, 39 books in the Old Testament and 27 books in the New.]</p><h2 class="head1">VI. SUBDIVISION ACCORDING TO<br />
SPIRITUAL EXPERIENCE</h2>
<p>[This is the best way to subdivide the Bible and is the way we recommend. There are three categories in the Old Testament and three categories in the New. The nature of the three categories in both Testaments is the same.]</p>
<h2 class="head2">A. The Old Testament</h2>
<p>[1. History: From Genesis to Esther there are seventeen books on history. It begins from God&rsquo;s creation of the universe and continues until the Israelites were returned from captivity to rebuild the temple and the holy city. This is the history and journey of God&rsquo;s people before Him; it is everything that they have passed through before God.</p>
<p>2. Experience: There are the five books of poetry: Job, Psalms, Proverbs, Ecclesiastes, and Song of Songs. There may be some history records in these books, but they are not on history. There are also some prophecies in them, but their main emphasis is not prophecy. These five books emphasize the spiritual experiences of God&rsquo;s saints before Him. If there were only the history in the preceding category without the experience that followed, we could only see the historical facts without understanding the inward condition under those circumstances. These five books of poetry in the Bible precisely describe the inward condition of the chosen people before God under various circumstances and experiences. When we read these five books of poetry, we can find out the spiritual experiences of these people before God.</p>
<p>3. Prophecy: From Isaiah to Malachi there are seventeen books. There are seventeen books of history at the beginning, and seventeen books of prophecy at the end, with five books of experience in the middle, making up a total of thirty-nine books.]</p>
<h2 class="head2">B. The New Testament</h2>
<p>[1. History: The four Gospels plus the Acts are five books on history. The four Gospels cover the experiences of the Lord Jesus on earth together with the experiences of His disciples in following Him. The Acts shows us how the disciples testified for the Lord everywhere they went. These five books are all on historical facts.</p>
<p>2. Experience: These are the twenty-one Epistles from Romans to Jude. These twenty-one books speak of the Christian experiences. The Gospels and Acts show us what Christ and the Christians encountered. They show us their activities, their moves, and their works. The twenty-one Epistles explain to us the inward spiritual experiences of Christians.</p>
<p>3. Prophecy: There is only one book, the book of Revelation.</p>
<p>Whether it is the Old Testament or the New Testament, they both begin with the history, then proceed to tell of the experiences, and end with the prophecies. For the individual Christians, the order is the same. First, we have our history before the Lord. Next, we develop some spiritual experiences during the course of the history, and then there is the hope and the anticipation for the future. The Old Testament recounted much history and many spiritual experiences; then at the end, it spoke of the saints being filled with hope and anticipation of the coming of Christ. The New Testament is written the same way. There are many facts and experiences, and then at the end, there is an expectation and a hope, which is the return of the Lord Jesus. No Christian can avoid these three steps. There are the history, the experiences, and the expectation.]</p>
<h2 class="head1">V. SUBDIVISION OF THE OLD TESTAMENT<br />
ACCORDING TO THE JEWS OR THE RABBIS</h2>
<p>[The Old Testament was originally in the hands of the Jews. Some teachers among them were authoritative Bible expositors. The Jews called them rabbis. The word rabbi means teacher. In the ancient time, the subdivision of the Old Testament among the rabbis was like what the Lord Jesus said in Luke 24:44. In other words, the Lord&rsquo;s word in Luke 24:44 was based on the subdivision of the Old Testament into three categories by the rabbis.]</p>
<h2 class="head2">A. The Law of Moses</h2>
<p>[These refer to the Pentateuch. Sometimes the Jews abbreviated the Pentateuch as Moses. When the Jews mention Moses, sometimes they are not referring to the person Moses, but to the five books of the Law written by him. These five books are sometimes simply called the Law. When the Jews refer to the Law, they mean the Pentateuch. Therefore, among the Christians and the Jews, there are five different ways of referring to the first five books of the Old Testament. They are referred to as the Pentateuch of Moses, as the Pentateuch, as the Law of Moses, as the Law, and as Moses.]</p><h2 class="head2">B. The Prophets:<br />
Divided into the Former Prophets<br />
and the Latter Prophets</h2>
<p>[1. The Former Prophets: There are four books. The first one is Joshua. The Jews treat the book of Joshua as one of the books of the prophets, instead of as history as we see it. The second book is Judges, which is also treated as a book of the prophets. The third book is Samuel. First and 2 Samuel were one book in the original Hebrew Bible. There was no distinction of 1 and 2 and it was called the book of Samuel. The fourth book is Kings. First and 2 Kings were also one book in the Hebrew Old Testament, having no distinction between 1 and 2 either.</p>
<p>Samuel, Kings, and Chronicles were divided up into first and second books in the Septuagint when the Old Testament was translated, because these books were too long and it was not convenient to roll them up into one sheepskin. In the original Hebrew Old Testament, these books were together as entire books without the distinctions of first and second books.</p>
<p>The Jewish rabbis call these four books, Joshua, Judges, Samuel, and Kings, the Former Prophets.</p>
<p>2. The Latter Prophets: There are also four books, which are Isaiah, Jeremiah, Ezekiel, and the minor prophets. The minor prophets mentioned here include the twelve books which the Jewish rabbis take as one.</p>
<p>Historically, the order of the minor prophets is not always the same. Sometimes they place this one at the front, and sometimes they place another one at the front. The usual order is as follows: Hosea, Joel, Amos, Obadiah, Jonah, Micah, Nahum, Habakkuk, Zephaniah, Haggai, Zechariah, and Malachi. This is the usual order of these twelve books. Sometimes the order is changed slightly. The Jewish rabbis treat the books after the Pentateuch generally as the books of the prophets, with the four books of the earlier period and four books of the later period totalling eight altogether.]</p>
<h2 class="head2">C. The Other Books</h2>
<p>[These include Psalms, Proverbs, Job, Song of Songs, Ruth, Lamentations, Ecclesiastes, Esther, Daniel, Ezra and Nehemiah, 1 and 2 Chronicles, totalling eleven books. The Jews consider Ezra and Nehemiah as one book and 1 and 2 Chronicles as one book. These eleven books plus the eight books of the prophets add up to nineteen books. With the five books of the Law of Moses, there are altogether twenty-four books. The ancient church fathers combined these into twenty-two books to match the twenty-two letters of the Hebrew alphabet. This is why during the first, second, and third centuries they were called the twenty-two books of the Old Testament. Josephus, who was the most authoritative historian among the Jews, also called these the twenty-two books of the Old Testament when he spoke of it.]</p>
<h2 class="head1">IV. SUBDIVISION OF THE OLD TESTAMENT<br />
BY THE LORD JESUS</h2>
<p>[Our Lord Jesus also had a way of subdividing the Old Testament. This is mentioned in Luke 24:44. This way is very similar to that of the Jewish rabbis; there is not much difference between the two. He also divided it into three categories:</p>
<ol class="upper-alpha">
<li>The Law of Moses: the first five books of the Old Testament.</li>
<li>The Prophets: including the history books.</li>

<h2 class="head1">I. THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN<br />
THE NEW TESTAMENT AND THE OLD TESTAMENT</h2>
<p>Many Christians do not fully understand the difference between the New Testament and the Old Testament. It is good to spend some time to study this matter.</p>
<p>[As we come to study the new and old testaments, we must first know the difference between these terms: a promise, an oath, a covenant, and a testament. A promise is an ordinary word spoken by God, promising you that He will do something for you. An oath is a confirmation of God&rsquo;s word of promise. God confirmed His word of promise by means of His oath (Heb. 6:13, 17). When a promise is confirmed by an oath, it immediately becomes a covenant. What we have received from God is not merely an ordinary word of promise but a covenant confirmed by God&rsquo;s oath and sealed with His faithfulness. When the One who made the covenant died, the covenant became a bequeathed will, that is, a testament. Today the covenant is no longer merely a covenant but a testament bequeathed by the One who enacted the covenant.]</p>
<h2 class="head2">A. The New Testament and the Old Testament&mdash;<br />
the Two Covenants God Made with Man</h2>
<p>[The new testament and the old testament are the two covenants which God made with man as the two conditions upon which man may have a relationship with Him. The new testament is a continuation of the covenant God made with Abraham. In Genesis chapter twelve, God gave a promise to Abraham and later also swore to him (Gen. 22:16). Hence, the promise became a covenant made by God with Abraham (Gal. 3:15-17). Two thousand years later, God sent His Son Jesus Christ to the world, who shed His blood on the cross and enacted the new covenant (Luke 22:20). At that point the new covenant was accomplished; moreover, it became a testament because of the Lord&rsquo;s death.</p>
<p>The old covenant, which came four hundred and thirty years after God made the covenant with Abraham, was enacted at Mount Sinai, where God gave the law to the children of Israel. Strictly speaking, the old covenant does not cover the entire period of the Old Testament, from Genesis to Malachi. It actually began from Exodus 19 and continued until the time of John the Baptist (Matt. 11:12-13). The time of John the Baptist to the time before the death and resurrection of the Lord Jesus is a transitional period between the Old and the New Testament times. Whereas God dealt with man in the Old Testament according to the old covenant&mdash;the law, He deals with man in the New Testament according to the new covenant&mdash;grace.]</p>
<h2 class="head3">1. The Old Testament&mdash;<br />
a Covenant Which Was Added and Abolished</h2>
<p>[Romans 5:20 says that &ldquo;the law entered.&rdquo; This word means that the law was not in God&rsquo;s original intention, nor was it God&rsquo;s original ordination for man. Rather, it entered later; it was added along the way.] Due to man&rsquo;s fall and corruption, God added the law for the following reasons: 1) the law expresses God, in His person and attributes, to fallen man; 2) the law makes manifest man&rsquo;s transgressions; 3) the law exposes man&rsquo;s real condition of being unable to express God according to God&rsquo;s holiness, righteousness, and glory; 4) the law guards man as a child-conductor unto Christ; and 5) the law drives man to believe and receive Christ as grace that he may live and express God according to the demand of the law (Gal. 3:19, 22-26). [Since the old covenant was something added and was not God&rsquo;s original intention for man, it could not remain permanently. Rather, it became old, grew decrepit, and disappeared (Heb. 8:13).]</p>
<h2 class="head4">a. Ordained in the Hand of Moses</h2>
<p>[Galatians 3:19 says that the law was &ldquo;ordained through angels in the hand of a mediator.&rdquo; The mediator here refers to Moses (John 1:17; Exo. 24:3). Hence, the law was ordained in the hand of Moses. This indicates that it was not a pleasant and sweet matter for God to give the law to man; otherwise, He would have done it Himself.]</p>
<h2 class="head4">b. Dedicated with the Blood of Bulls and Goats</h2>
<p>[Man is sinful, and without shedding of blood there is no forgiveness (Heb. 9:22). Without forgiveness of sin there is no way to fulfill the requirement of God&rsquo;s righteousness that by it the covenant may be enacted. Therefore, the old covenant was dedicated with the blood of bulls and goats (Heb. 9:18-20; Exo. 24:6-8).]</p><h2 class="head4">c. Based upon the Law, Which Cannot Give Life,<br />
as Its Condition</h2>
<p>[In the Old Testament God dealt with man according to the law. Everyone who kept the law would be blessed (Deut. 6:1-3), and everyone who did not abide by all the things written in the book of the law to do them would be cursed (Gal. 3:10). The law was able only to demand and condemn; it could not give life. Galatians 3:21 says, &ldquo;If a law was given which was able to give life, righteousness would have indeed been of the law.&rdquo; But actually man cannot be justified by law, for the law only demands and condemns; it cannot give life, nor can it give man the power to be justified by God.]</p>
<h2 class="head4">d. Requiring Man Only to Work, Not to Believe</h2>
<p>[Galatians 3:12 says, &ldquo;And the law is not of faith, but he who does them shall live by them.&rdquo; The law is not of faith; it is of works. The law is not based on the principle of faith; it is based on the principle of works. Man must do the law in order to live. Therefore, Moses spoke many times to all Israel in this way: &ldquo;Now therefore hearken, O Israel, unto the statutes and unto the judgments, which I teach you, for to do them, that ye may live&rdquo; (Deut. 4:1; 5:1; 6:1, 25).]</p>
<h2 class="head4">e. Applying Only to the Old Testament Age</h2>
<p>[Referring to the old covenant, Hebrews 8:13 says, &ldquo;In saying new, He has made the first old. Now that which is becoming old and growing decrepit is near to disappearing.&rdquo; The prophecy in Jeremiah 31:31-34 concerning the coming new covenant indicated that the first covenant had become old and decrepit. It might have been that Jeremiah realized the weakness and unprofitableness of the old covenant and was deeply burdened about this matter. Therefore, God had an opportunity to come in to say through him, &ldquo;Behold, the days are coming, says the Lord, and I will consummate a new covenant with the house of Israel and with the house of Judah&rdquo; (Heb. 8:8). Not only was the old covenant decrepit, but it was also near to disappearing. Therefore, it could only be applied to the Old Testament age.]</p>
<h2 class="head3">2. The New Testament&mdash;a Covenant<br />
Which Is Better and Eternal</h2>
<p>[The new testament, or the new covenant, is a better covenant (Heb. 8:6). The new covenant is better than the old one, just as the reality of a person is better than his photograph. The old covenant, like a photograph, had only the outward form, but the new covenant, like the real person, has the inward life with all its reality. The old covenant was lifeless; the new covenant is constituted with the indestructible life (Heb. 7:16). Everything in the new covenant is much better than the things in the old covenant because everything in the new covenant is the reality constituted with life. Therefore, it is a better covenant.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the new covenant is an eternal covenant (Heb. 13:20). Unlike the old covenant, which became old and decrepit and was abolished (Heb. 8:13), the new covenant is eternally effective.]</p>
<h2 class="head4">a. Accomplished by Jesus Christ</h2>
<p>[The new covenant was accomplished by Jesus Christ Himself. When the Lord Jesus was crucified on the cross and shed the precious blood, He made the way for God to enact a new covenant with us (Matt. 26:28). Unlike the old covenant which was ordained in the hand of Moses, the new covenant was accomplished by the Lord Jesus Christ Himself, God&rsquo;s beloved Son.]</p>
<h2 class="head4">b. Established with the Blood of Jesus,<br />
the Son of God</h2>
<p>[After eating the Passover with the disciples, the Lord established His table with the bread and the cup. He took the cup, saying, &ldquo;This cup is the new covenant in My blood&rdquo; (Luke 22:20). The new covenant was established with the blood of the Lord Jesus Christ. First John 1:7 also says that the blood of Jesus, the Son of God, cleanses us from all sin. Because His blood satisfied the requirement of God&rsquo;s righteousness, it opened the way for God to enact a new covenant with us. Therefore, the new covenant was enacted through the blood of Jesus, the Son of God; it is not like the old covenant which was enacted with the blood of bulls and goats.]</p>
<h2 class="head4">c. Based upon Grace, Which Gives Life, as Its Condition</h2>
<p>[Now that we are in the new covenant, we are not under the law but under grace (Rom. 6:14). Grace is the Triune God processed through incarnation, human living, crucifixion, resurrection, and ascension to become everything to us. He is our redemption, salvation, life, and sanctification.</p>
<p>The new covenant is based upon grace, which gives life, as its condition. This means that in the new covenant the processed Triune God intends to be our all. Hence, the new covenant does not require man to keep the law; rather, it deals with man according to grace, which is God as everything to man.]</p>
<h2 class="head4">d. Requiring Man Only to Believe, Not to Work</h2>
<p>[Romans 11:6 says, &ldquo;But if by grace, it is no longer out of works; otherwise grace is no longer grace.&rdquo; Whereas the law is altogether out of works, grace is absolutely not of works. Anything that is out of works is not grace but law. John 3:15 says, &ldquo;That everyone who believes in Him may have eternal life.&rdquo; Thus, the New Testament shows us very clearly that God does not require man to work; God requires man only to believe. In the New Testament age, the unique cause of God&rsquo;s judgment on man is man&rsquo;s unbelief, his not believing in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ, the Son of God (John 3:18).</p>
<p>In the New Testament, the meaning of the word faith has two aspects. Objectively, faith is what we believe. Subjectively, faith is our believing. Therefore, faith denotes both the act of believing and that in which we believe. The things in which we believe include God&rsquo;s sending His Son into the world, the Son&rsquo;s human living, His death on the cross to accomplish redemption, His burial, His resurrection, His becoming the life-giving Spirit, His ascension, and His pouring out of the Holy Spirit. When we hear of all these divine matters, we will be stirred up and filled with appreciation. This is our faith and this is our believing act. In the new covenant man only needs to have such a faith; man does not need to strive to keep the law.]</p>
<h2 class="head4">e. Applying to the New Testament Age and Eternity</h2>
<p>[The new covenant was established when the Lord Jesus died on the cross and shed His blood. Hence, to those who believe in Him, that was the beginning of the new covenant. But as far as the Israelites are concerned, the prophecy in Jeremiah 31 will not be fulfilled until Christ&rsquo;s second coming. The new covenant will be applied unto eternity, because it is an eternal covenant (Heb. 13:20).]</p>
<h2 class="head2">Summary</h2>
<p>[The new and the old testaments first refer to the two covenants which God made with man as the two conditions for man to have a relationship with Him. The old covenant was ordained in the hand of Moses, dedicated with the blood of bulls and goats, and based upon the law, which could not give life, as its condition, requiring man only to work, not to believe. It was not God&rsquo;s original intention but was added later and eventually was done away. Thus, it was applied only to the Old Testament age. The new covenant, the better and eternal covenant, was accomplished by Jesus Christ, was established with the blood of Jesus, the Son of God, and is based upon grace, which gives life, as its condition, requiring man only to believe, not to work. It is of God&rsquo;s original intention and is applied to the New Testament age and eternity.]</p><h2 class="head1">II. THE APOCRYPHA</h2>
<h2 class="head2">A. Not Being in the Bible in the Beginning</h2>
<p>[There were fourteen books of the Apocrypha which were not included in the Bible. Some have thought that these fourteen books were included in the Old Testament before the Septuagint translation of the Old Testament into Greek in 277 B.C. But we can find out from verified historical information that such a postulate is wrong.]</p>
<h2 class="head3">1. The Proof of Josephus</h2>
<p>[The authoritative Jewish historian Josephus (born in A.D. 37) said: &ldquo;We [the Jews] are not like the Greeks, having a lot of books that do not agree and are contradicting. We have only twenty-two books, including all the past writings, as recognized correctly to be divine. After such a long time, no one has ever dared to add to, delete from, or alter them.&rdquo; This proves that even at the time of Josephus (first century A.D.), the Old Testament had only the original twenty-two books without the additional fourteen books from the Apocrypha. Therefore, to assume that the Old Testament contained the Apocrypha before 277 B.C. is not correct.] The Old Testament today has thirty-nine books. Originally, there were only twenty-two. Judges and Ruth were one book. Samuel, Kings, and Chronicles did not have first and second books. Ezra and Nehemiah were one book. Jeremiah and Lamentations were one book. Hosea to Malachi, twelve books in all, were one book. These twenty-two books were divided into the present thirty-nine when the Old Testament was translated from Hebrew into the Greek Septuagint Version.</p>
<h2 class="head3">2. The Proof of Cyril</h2>
<p>[There was a scholar in Jerusalem called Cyril, born in A.D. 315, who said, &ldquo;Please read the Holy Scripture, the twenty-two books of the Old Testament, which were translated by the Seventy-Two.&rdquo; This shows that even as late as A.D. 315, the authoritative Jewish scholars still recognized their Old Testament to have only twenty-two books. His words also clearly prove that in the translation of the Septuagint (Cyril referred to the Seventy-Two, the number of scholars who translated the Septuagint. The historians are unclear whether it was seventy or seventy-two people there.), there were no fourteen apocryphal books in the Old Testament.]</p>
<h2 class="head3">3. The Proof of the Lord Jesus and the Apostles</h2>
<p>[The Lord Jesus and the apostles quoted the Old Testament frequently. If the fourteen books of the Apocrypha were already among the Old Testament books, the Lord and the apostles should have quoted them. However, we cannot find them quoting from the Apocrypha once. This proves that at the time of the Lord Jesus and the apostles, these books of the Apocrypha were not there in the Old Testament.]</p>
<h2 class="head2">B. Having Been Added<br />
into the Vatican Manuscript</h2>
<p>[Among three manuscripts of the Bible which are considered some of the oldest in the world, one is kept in the Vatican, the place where the Roman Catholic Pope resides. It is called the Codex Vaticanus, or the Vatican Manuscript. According to the historians, this manuscript was finished in the fourth century A.D., and in the Old Testament part, which was a Septuagint translation, it included the fourteen books of the Apocrypha. This must have been added after A.D. 315. It might have been the objection to this move that caused the Eastern Greek Orthodox Church to call a council at Laodicea in A.D. 361 to officially denounce these fourteen books of the Apocrypha. They also forbade the use of these apocryphal books in the church. This proves that up until A.D. 361 there was a big question whether or not these apocryphal books should be included in the canon of Scripture.]</p>
<h2 class="head2">C. The Recognition<br />
by the Roman Catholic Church</h2>
<p>[It was not until April 8, 1546 that the Roman Catholic Church called a council in Trent directly under the Pope to affirm the authority of these fourteen books of the Apocrypha. From that time on, these apocryphal books remained in the Roman Catholic Bible. This proves that until the sixteenth century A.D., even the Roman Catholic Church did not officially acknowledge these apocryphal books as canonical. Although this matter was affirmed at the Council of Trent by the Roman Catholic Church, the Lutherans solemnly denounced that these apocryphal books were divinely inspired. In 1646 more than one hundred fifty Protestant Bible scholars put together the &ldquo;Westminster Confession,&rdquo; which also declared that the Apocrypha has no divine authority and is the same as any other human composition.</p>
<p>By now we should be clear that the whole Bible consists of the present thirty-nine books of the Old Testament and the twenty-seven books of the New Testament. The fourteen books of the Apocrypha were added in by the Roman Catholic Church arbitrarily and cannot be trusted. Moreover, the contents of the Apocrypha include many ridiculous historical anecdotes. There is no way to trace some of the authors or the time and place they were written. For this reason, they do not have any canonical value.]</p><h2 class="head1">III. SOME FALSE REVELATIONS</h2>
<p>The Lord Jesus Christ said, &ldquo;I testify to everyone who hears the words of the prophecy of this book: If anyone adds to them, God shall add to him the plagues which are written in this book; and if anyone takes away from the words of the book of this prophecy, God shall take away his part from the tree of life and out of the holy city, which are written in this book&rdquo; (Rev. 22:18-19). The end of Revelation is the completion of all God&rsquo;s revelations to man. Any addition or deletion resulting in any changes to the complete revelation of God&mdash;the Bible&mdash;is wrong. Since the completion of the Bible, there have been some false revelations written by men trying to deceive the people of God.</p>
<h2 class="head2">A. The Koran of Islam</h2>
<p>The Koran is a counterfeit of the Bible. It contains many names of biblical people and places, yet it is mixed with human concepts, mainly of Mohammed. He pronounced himself to be the prophet of the one God. He wrote the Koran and claimed that it was the word of God. The moral standard of the Koran is very low. It talks about lust in its &ldquo;heaven.&rdquo; We definitely do not accept the Koran as part of the revelation of God.</p>
<h2 class="head2">B. The Book of Mormon</h2>
<p>The Book of Mormon is another false revelation. Joseph Smith, the founder of the Mormon Church, wrote the Book of Mormon. He claimed to have discovered some gold leaves inscribed with heavenly script containing God&rsquo;s revelation. After he translated the inscription into the Book of Mormon, the gold leaves were taken back to heaven. No one else ever saw them. The Book of Mormon is full of errors and contradictions. Many portions have been removed because scientific discoveries proved them wrong. For example, the Book of Mormon originally said that the moon was inhabited. That portion was removed after man landed on the moon in 1969. [The claim of Joseph Smith to have had a revelation in addition to what is in the Bible is nonsensical and heretical. Revelation 22:18 and 19 indicate that the entire revelation of God has been completed and that no one should add anything or take away anything. Therefore, we should not think that we can receive a new revelation in addition to what is recorded in the sixty-six books of the Bible.]</p>
<h2 class="head2">C. The &ldquo;Bible&rdquo; of the Jehovah&rsquo;s Witnesses</h2>
<p>Although the Jehovah&rsquo;s Witnesses use a version of the Bible, they have modified some parts to agree with their heretical teachings. They do not believe that Jesus Christ is God Himself. They consider Him to be a separate God and a lesser God. John 1:1 tells us, &ldquo;In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.&rdquo; Their version says, &ldquo;...and the Word was <em>a</em> God.&rdquo; They added an &ldquo;a&rdquo; to modify the meaning of the verse so it would coincide with their heretical teaching. Therefore, we do not regard their version as the true Bible.</p>
<h2 class="head1">IV. THE TRANSLATIONS OF THE BIBLE</h2>
<p>Most of the Old Testament was written in Hebrew. Only Jeremiah 10:11, Daniel 2:4&mdash;7:28, and Ezra 4:8&mdash;6:18 were written in Aramaic. Most of the New Testament was written in Greek. However, there were some portions written in Aramaic, such as Mark 5:41 and 15:34. There are some Latin words as well.</p>
<p>The written content of the Bible is crucial to us. The translation of the Bible is also important to us. Without the proper translations, the Bible can neither be correctly presented to us nor properly understood by us. God inspired approximately forty men to write the Bible. He also inspired many more to translate the Bible throughout the ages. The following are several of the most popular translations.</p>
<h2 class="head2">A. The Septuagint Version</h2>
<p>Seventy scholars in Alexandria of Egypt translated the whole Old Testament into Greek around 277 B.C. This is the oldest translation of the Old Testament. Because there were seventy translators, this translation is called the Septuagint. It is also called the Alexandria Version because it was translated in Alexandria.</p>
<h2 class="head2">B. The Vulgate Version</h2>
<p>The Vulgate Version was translated during the fourth century in North Africa. It is a Latin version translated from the Septuagint Version of the Old Testament and the original Greek manuscript of the New Testament. Vulgate means popular or common. This was the first Bible that was brought to England.</p>
<h2 class="head2">C. The Authorized (King James) Version</h2>
<p>In A.D. 1611, fifty-four scholars translated the Old Testament and New Testament into the best English version of that time. Because this version was directed by King James I, it was called the Authorized Version. This is the most popular version among English readers.</p><h2 class="head2">D. The Revised Version</h2>
<p>From 1870 to 1885, about one hundred scholars from England and America revised the Authorized Version and called it the Revised Version.</p>
<h2 class="head2">E. The American Standard Version</h2>
<p>When these scholars were revising the Authorized Version, some of the suggested revisions by the American scholars were not accepted. Later, in America, the American scholars revised the Revised Version, incorporating their suggestions, and called it the American Standard Version. Most of this version is the same as the Revised Version.</p>
<h2 class="head2">F. Many Other Versions</h2>
<p>The Bible has been translated into many languages, and many versions have been written. According to the 1990 Scripture Language Report published by the United Bible Societies (UBS), the Bible has been translated into 1,946 languages. There are about fifty English versions.</p>
<h2 class="head2">G. Paraphrased Versions of the Bible</h2>
<p>There are some versions of the Bible that are mostly paraphrased. The Living New Testament Version is a paraphrased version. John 1:1 of the Living New Testament version says, &ldquo;Before anything else existed, there was Christ, with God. He has always been alive and is Himself God.&rdquo; Most versions say, &ldquo;In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.&rdquo; You can see that the paraphrase is not exactly like the original. Paraphrased versions include many concepts of the writers concerning the Bible. Serious students of the Bible use properly translated versions.</p>
<h2 class="head2">H. The Recovery Versions of the New Testament</h2>
<p>The Recovery Version is translated into English, Chinese, and Spanish. The Chinese Recovery Version was published in 1988. The English Recovery Version will be published in the Fall of 1991. The Spanish Recovery Version will follow. Brother Witness Lee and his co-workers condensed the best of the Bible studies from the past two thousand years and integrated them into the Recovery Version. The Recovery Version has many advantages over the other versions and study Bibles.</p>
<h2 class="head3">1. Accuracy</h2>
<p>The Recovery Version is the most accurate translation. It is an improvement based on the existing acceptable versions and the most recently recovered truths. The translators did not compromise the true understanding for traditional teachings or for cultural preferences. They endeavored to provide the most accurate translation so that man may know the truth according to God&rsquo;s divine revelation.</p>
<h2 class="head3">2. Readability</h2>
<p>The Recovery Version is one of the most readable translations. The style and word usage of many versions are old and hard to understand. As a result, many people do not like to read the Bible. Some translators have tried to please the readers by publishing paraphrased Bibles, yet they compromise the truth. The Recovery Version is both accurate and easy to read.</p>
<h2 class="head3">3. Outlines</h2>
<p>The Recovery Version provides an outline for every book of the New Testament. Many readers of the Bible, even though they have faithfully read the Bible for years, do not know the subjects, outlines, or backgrounds of the twenty-seven books of the New Testament. The outlines help the readers to better understand each book.</p>
<h2 class="head3">4. Footnotes</h2>
<p>The Recovery Version also includes footnotes. Footnotes explain many hard-to-understand portions. There are four types of footnotes: 1) the literal meaning of a word or words in Greek; 2) a brief definition of a word or a verse; 3) an introduction or conclusion to a book or a section of the Word; and 4) a thorough study of a word or a topic. These footnotes open the Word to the readers to enlighten them, causing them to know the truth and to experience life.</p>
<h2 class="head3">5. References</h2>
<p>The Recovery Version gives many references in the margins to help readers find supporting verses for their study. Unlike an exhaustive concordance, the references list only the related verses.</p>
<h2 class="head3">6. Life-study Messages of the New Testament</h2>
<p>The Life-study messages are an accompanying set of study aids for the New Testament. This set of messages opens up every verse of the New Testament. If readers still desire to further research a verse or subject matter after studying it in the Recovery Version, they can receive additional help from the Life-study messages. They will not only get the knowledge of the Word, they will also get nourished with the Word to experience life and grow in life.</p><h2 class="head1">CONCLUSION</h2>
<p>The Bible is still the &ldquo;best seller.&rdquo; It is translated into more languages than any other book written by man. More than six hundred million Bibles were sent out in 1989.</p>
<p>The Bible is most definitely the precious gift of God for man. God did not write a book in heaven and send it down by an angel to man. He did not just inspire one well-known man of God to write a book for Him. First, there was the speaking of God to many godly men for nearly 2,500 years. Then Moses took the lead to write down God&rsquo;s revelations. After having been written by more than forty men over a period of 1,600 years, and after having been tested by being read and experienced by God&rsquo;s people for over one thousand years, the final sixty-six books were at last canonized to be the Word of God. But shortly thereafter, the Bible was locked up by the Roman Catholic Church. Many faithful believers were put to death for having the Bible in their possession. After a thousand years, Martin Luther and his co-workers liberated the Bible from the unlawful custody of the Roman Catholic Church and made it available to the common people. However, most people received very little revelation in reading the Bible. Finally, after another five hundred years of extensive study and research, most of the Bible has been opened to us in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery. We did not receive all the revelations direct from God, but gathered many of them from an accumulation of revelations recorded over the past six thousand years. What we have in the recovery today is the cream of the revelation of God and the rich experiences of the saints and the churches throughout church history. We should treasure the Bible and all the recovery books that unveil the Bible to us! How much we need to study the Word with the help of the ministry! &ldquo;O Lord Jesus, I want to give myself to devour Your Word until I am full of You and come to the full knowledge of the truth.&rdquo;</p>

</ol><h2 class="head2">Text</h2>
<p>As Christians, we believe that the Bible is the Word of God given to man. The entire Bible does three things: it manifests God, exposes man, and unveils Christ. First, it shows us that the God who blesses us is loving, righteous, and faithful. Second, it shows us that man is nothing, has nothing, and can do nothing. Man is filled with sin; thus, he is only good to be crucified and nullified. Third, it reveals Christ, the hidden mystery, as the Savior, the life, the life supply, and everything to fallen man. By believing and receiving Christ, man may come back to God to be filled up with God and express God as one corporate man.</p>
<p>We believe not because of outward proof but because of a living touch with God the Spirit by praying in our spirit with the Word. Although we do not need any outward proof to believe, it is still good to know a few crucial facts. It is good for us and for our friends. But never forget that people believe by the spirit, not by the mind. Doubt is in the mind; faith is in the spirit (see note 2 of 2 Cor. 4:13).</p>
<p>This lesson and the following lesson are based on a Chinese book entitled <em>Is the Bible Inspired by God?</em> by Y. L. Chang, published by the Taiwan Gospel Book Room in 1982.</p>
<h2 class="head1">I. THE PROOF BY LOGIC</h2>
<p>Since there is a God in this universe, and since He created man, He must want to reveal Himself to man. He is very great and man is very small. What is the best way for Him to reveal Himself to man? He must use the way man communicates&mdash;speaking and writing. Thus, there must exist on this earth a book through which God can communicate with man. There are so many books on the face of the earth; which one is God&rsquo;s book to man? How do we know? We can expect God&rsquo;s book to meet the following suppositions:</p>
<ol class="upper-alpha">
<li>It should say that the author is God.</li>
<li>It should have the highest standard of morality.</li>
<li>It should talk about God, His purpose, His reason for creation, man, man&rsquo;s problem, solutions to man&rsquo;s problem, and the destiny of creation and man.</li>
<li>It should be available to all men, of all races and tongues, whether they be rich or poor, well-born or low-born, educated or uneducated.</li>
</ol>
<h2 class="head2">A. Authorship</h2>
<p>Let us consider all the books in this world. There are only three books that claim divine authorship&mdash;the Bible, the Koran, and the Book of Mormon. The Bible states more than two thousand times that it is spoken by the Lord God. Immediately, we eliminate all the other books.</p>
<h2 class="head2">B. Moral Tone</h2>
<p>What about the moral tone of these three books? The moral tone of the Koran is too low. Its heaven is full of lusts and flesh. God could never write a book with such licentiousness and immorality. The Book of Mormon is also substandard in moral tone. It tells men that they will have many wives when they go to heaven, and it promotes bigamy on the earth. Only the Bible has the highest standard of morality. It disallows divorce. Marriages of divorced people are considered adultery (Matt. 19:3-9). The Bible further states that even lusting in the heart is equivalent to committing adultery (Matt. 5:28). This standard exceeds that of any other book on earth. It also teaches people not only to forgive from their heart (Matt. 18:35) but also to love their enemies (Matt. 5:44). It condemns hatred as murder (Matt. 5:22; 1 John 3:15). All books on ethics deal with outward behavior; only the Bible deals with the heart to produce a moral living.</p>
<h2 class="head2">C. Content</h2>
<p>Only the Bible tells us about God, His purpose, His reason for creation, man, man&rsquo;s problem, solutions to man&rsquo;s problem, and the destiny of creation and man. We will talk about these matters in subsequent lessons.</p>
<h2 class="head2">D. Availability</h2>
<p>The Bible is readily available to man. It has been translated into approximately two thousand languages. In 1989, six hundred million Bibles were sent out to a world population of 5.5 billion. Within ten years, the number of Bibles sent out will surpass the population of the world. This means that most of the people on the face of this earth will have an opportunity to read a Bible.</p>
<p>As you can see, there is only one book that is qualified to be God&rsquo;s book to man, and that is the Bible. All other books on earth do not pass the test because they are not written by God to reveal Himself to man. How we praise Him for giving us the Bible and letting us find the Bible. How much we need to treasure the Bible and see God revealed in the Bible!</p><h2 class="head1">II. THE PROOF BY ITS COMPLETION</h2>
<h2 class="head2">A. The Writers</h2>
<p>The way the Bible was completed proves that the Bible is the Word of God. The Bible was not written by God in heaven and sent down to man, nor was it written by one man. The Bible took nearly 1,600 years to complete, and it was written by over forty people.</p>
<p>The many writers of the Bible had diverse backgrounds. David and Solomon were kings. Daniel was a governor. Ezra was a priest. Moses was a general, architect, and ruler turned shepherd. Paul was a lawyer. Matthew was a tax collector. Peter and John were fishermen.</p>
<p>The writers&rsquo; professions, knowledge, personalities, perspectives, cultures, and habits were all different. They wrote in the wilderness of Sinai, on the hill of the good land, in the temple of Jerusalem, in jail in Rome, in a school in Bethlehem, by the river of Babylon, on the Island of Patmos, in the palace of Persia, and in many other places.</p>
<p>How can more than forty people, in various places, with different backgrounds, take 1,600 years to write one book without it being disjointed and inconclusive? Is there another book written like this? Webster&rsquo;s dictionary took thirty-six years. That may be the second-longest time required to complete a book. It must be the Spirit of God who led these forty writers to write one book in 1,600 years that has a central thought, a beginning, a development, and a conclusion. This has to be the book of God.</p>
<p>Imagine asking forty doctors from different countries to take 1,600 years to write a book on medicine. The later writers would discard the former parts. It would be difficult to find a cohesive theme or to derive some practical benefit. What about a computer book?</p>
<h2 class="head2">B. The Number &ldquo;Seven&rdquo;</h2>
<p>The number seven in the Bible is frequently used to signify completion in God&rsquo;s move; e.g., seven Spirits, seven churches. Ivinpanin, a famous mathematician in Russia, knew that every character in Hebrew represents a number. He added up the numbers of every word in the Old Testament and discovered that the sum of every word is divisible by seven. Consider the probability of this; it is beyond the likelihood of occurrence and humanly impossible. Only God could have caused the Bible to be written in such a way.</p>
<h2 class="head2">C. Truthfulness</h2>
<p>The truthfulness of the Bible also proves that the Bible is the Word of God. The Bible contains a record of human history, especially of the children of Israel. If the Bible was written by man, they would never have recorded the sinful acts of their forefathers (Judg. 19:1-30; Matt. 1:6). People may talk about the sinful acts of others but not of their own forefathers.</p>
<h2 class="head2">D. The Perfect Law</h2>
<p>The perfectness of the law also proves that the Bible is the Word of God. There is no country throughout human history that has ever had a set of laws as good as the set given in the Bible. Which country has a law against coveting (Exo. 20:17; Rom. 7:7)? Whose law states that people should not collect interest when they lend money to others (Lev. 25:37; Luke 6:34-35)? It is also said in the law of the Bible that people should not pick up what is left in the field from the harvest, but that they should leave it so that the poor will have food to eat (Deut. 24:19). Biblical law establishes every fiftieth year as the year of Jubilee, when slaves are freed and purchased land is returned to the original owner (Lev. 25:8-17). Only the law in the Bible is given out of a loving heart and is fair to all the people. The laws of most countries are not impartial to class, so the poor usually suffer. Today, most western countries have used biblical law as a base to develop their own set of laws. Because their heart is not like God&rsquo;s, their law is much inferior. The perfectness of the law of God proves that the Bible was written by God.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Conclusion</h2>
<p>The Bible is not written by man. The Bible is the breathing out of God (2 Tim. 3:16). It is the speaking from God through men borne by the Holy Spirit. It does not convey to us human concepts; rather, it reveals to us the loving and righteous God. It exposes our shortcomings and unveils our Savior Jesus Christ. What a marvelous book!</p><h2 class="head1">III. THE PROOF BY ITS PROPHECIES</h2>
<p>Prophecies are the strongest proof of the authenticity of the Bible as the Word of God. To prophesy is risky. Once a prophecy is not fulfilled, its source is discredited. There is a prophetic word in every four verses of the Bible. There are more than one thousand individual prophecies. The fulfillment of the prophecies proves the existence of God and the Bible to be God&rsquo;s Word.</p>
<p>People may not believe the miracles recorded in the Bible. They may say that they were merely myths and legends. It is indeed hard to prove that the miracles happened. Prophecies, on the other hand, are great miracles that can be substantiated and therefore cannot be denied. God knew man&rsquo;s inclination to doubt and disbelieve; that is why He put so many prophecies in the Bible.</p>
<p>A prophecy should meet the following five criteria: 1) it should be announced before things happen; 2) it should be beyond human foresight; 3) it should explain in detail; 4) the duration of time between prophecy and fulfillment should be long enough so that the fulfillment cannot be of human manufacture; and 5) the fulfillment should be clearly manifested. Let us proceed to see some of the biblical prophecies that have been fulfilled.</p>
<h2 class="head2">A. Concerning Christ</h2>
<p>There were many prophecies concerning Christ: His person in His divinity (Isa. 4:2a; 6:1, 3; Micah 5:2), His person in His humanity (Isa. 4:2b; Psa. 45:7), His incarnation (Isa. 7:14; 9:6), His youth (Isa. 53:2a; Hos. 11:1), His appearance (Isa. 52:14; 53:2), His suffering (Isa. 53:3, 8, 10), His living (Isa. 42:1-4), His death (Isa. 53:5-10, 12; Dan. 9:26), His burial (Isa. 53:9), His resurrection (Psa. 2:6-7), His ascension (Isa. 52:13), and His second coming (Isa. 62:11-12; 64:1-5; 66:15; Dan. 7:13-14; Zech. 14:3-5). All these prophecies were spoken between 700 and 4,000 years before Christ. The earliest prophecy of Christ&rsquo;s coming was spoken by God to Adam in Genesis 3:15 immediately after the fall of man. That was recorded about 1,500 years before Christ came. Except for His second coming, all the other prophecies concerning Christ were fulfilled about two thousand years ago.</p>
<h2 class="head2">B. Concerning Israel</h2>
<p>There were many prophecies concerning the children of Israel and the nation of Israel: the formation of the nation (Gen. 15:5; 18:18), the slavery of the people (Gen. 15:13-14; Exo. 3:8-10), the exodus (Gen. 15:13-14), the possession of the good land (Gen. 12:7; 15:18; Deut. 11:8, 24), the building of the temple (2 Sam. 7:12-13), the falling away (Deut. 31:29), the destruction of the temple and the city of Jerusalem (Jer. 26:6; 27:11-22), the captivity in Babylon (Jer. 25:8-11), the rebuilding of the temple and the city of Jerusalem (Dan. 9:25a), the destruction of the temple and the city again (Matt. 24:2; Luke 19:41-44), the restoration of the nation (Matt. 24:32), the repossession of the city (Jer. 16:14-15; 23:3; 29:10; 30:1-3; Luke 21:24), the rebuilding of the temple (Dan. 11:31), the deception of the Antichrist (Dan. 9:27; Rev. 19:20), the salvation of Immanuel (Gen. 3:15; Isa. 7:14), and the age of the restored kingdom of Israel (Isa. 65:17-20; Zech. 14:16-19; Rom. 11:26).</p>
<p>The prophecy about the nation of Israel was first spoken around 2000 B.C. It was recorded in Genesis 12:2. God prophesied to Abraham that a nation would come out of him even though he did not have a son. This prophecy was fulfilled about five hundred years later when the children of Israel came out of Egypt, where they had been enslaved.</p>
<p>The prophecies concerning the possession of the good land and the rebuilding of Jerusalem and the temple were first fulfilled between 1500 and 500 B.C.</p>
<p>The nation of Israel was reformed in 1948, about 2,600 years after she had been conquered by the Babylonian army. Jerusalem was returned to Israel in 1967.</p>
<p>The Jewish people currently have all the material ready to rebuild the temple. This prophecy should be fulfilled soon. Following the rebuilding of the temple, the Antichrist will break his covenant with Israel, the nation of Israel will be besieged, and the Lord will come back to save His people. Finally, the restored kingdom of Israel will begin.</p>
<h2 class="head2">C. Concerning Tyre</h2>
<p>The Lord prophesied at around 600 B.C. in Ezekiel 26:3-5, 12, 14, &ldquo;Behold, I am against thee, O Tyre, and will cause many nations to come up against thee as the sea causeth its waves to come up. And they shall destroy the walls of Tyre, and break down her towers: I will also scrape her dust from her, and make her a bare rock.&rdquo; &ldquo;...and they shall lay thy stones and thy timber and thy dust in the midst of the waters.&rdquo; &ldquo;And I will make thee a bare rock; thou shalt be a place for the spreading of nets; thou shalt be built no more: for I Jehovah have spoken it, saith the Lord Jehovah.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tyre was an ancient city near the east coast of the Mediterranean Sea. The inhabitants were Phoenicians. They were famous for sailing, trading, and exploration. The city wall was very thick. It was strategically located in the ancient world. At a time when the city seemed invincible, the Bible prophesied concerning its destruction because of the sinful practices of its inhabitants.</p>
<p>The fulfillment of this prophecy took place in three different stages. First, the Babylonian army besieged Tyre for thirteen years beginning in 587 B.C. The city was totally destroyed. The new city of Tyre was built on an island one mile from its former site. Second, 240 years after the Babylonian siege, Alexander&rsquo;s army laid the stone, timber, and dust from the ruins of the old city of Tyre into the water, constructed a road to the island, and attacked the new Tyre. Third, after years of being washed by rain, the bare rock appeared and fishermen used it as a place for spreading their nets.</p><h2 class="head2">D. Concerning Sidon</h2>
<p>The Lord prophesied in Ezekiel 28:22-23, &ldquo;Behold, I am against thee, O Sidon; and I will be glorified in the midst of thee; and they shall know that I am Jehovah, when I shall have executed judgments in her, and shall be sanctified in her. For I will send pestilence into her, and blood into her streets; and the wounded shall fall in the midst of her, with the sword upon her on every side; and they shall know that I am Jehovah.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sidon was surrounded by the Persian army in 35 B.C., and forty thousand inhabitants chose to die rather than to surrender. They burned their own houses and died in the fire. Hundreds of years later, Sidon was caught in the middle of a struggle between the Crusaders and the Muslims. She was also the battleground in the conflicts between the Druses and the Turks and between Turkey and France. In 1840, she was bombarded by the armies of England, France, and Turkey. Sidon has historically been a war-torn city; thus, the prophecy in Ezekiel was fulfilled.</p>
<p>Although Sidon was only fifty miles from Tyre, its treatment was different. Tyre was completely eliminated from the face of the earth; yet, after passing through much affliction, as prophesied, Sidon still exists. Only God could have predicted that two such similar cities would have such dissimilar fates. This, again, is strong proof that the Bible is divinely inspired.</p>
<h2 class="head2">E. Concerning Babylon</h2>
<p>The Lord prophesied in Isaiah 13:19-22, &ldquo;And Babylon, the beauty of kingdoms, the glory of the Chaldeans&rsquo; majesty, will be as when God overthrew Sodom and Gomorrah: it will no more be inhabited forever; it will not be dwelt in from generation to generation. And the Arab will not set up his tent there, nor will the shepherd make his flocks lie down there. But desert animals will lie down there, and their houses will be full of wild dogs; there ostriches will dwell, and wild goats will prance there; hyenas will respond in their citadels, and jackals in their exquisite palaces. Her time is about to come, and her days will not be prolonged.&rdquo; This prophecy was fulfilled soon after it was spoken.</p>
<p>The limited space of this lesson does not allow us to enumerate the many biblical prophecies which have been fulfilled. There are also many unfulfilled prophecies that remain to be fulfilled one by one. God&rsquo;s word will not pass away until every one is fulfilled.</p>
<h2 class="head1"><br />
IV. THE PROOF BY ITS POWER</h2>
<p>There is no other book on earth that can positively change people as dramatically as the Bible can. Scientific books cannot improve a person&rsquo;s disposition; on the contrary, some scientific advancements, such as the manufacture of modern weaponry, make it easier to destroy rather than improve humanity. Language books, instead of uplifting the readers&rsquo; character, may just make them proud. Only the Bible dispositionally changes people in a positive way.</p>
<h2 class="head2">A. In Gospel Preaching</h2>
<p>The Bible exhorts Christians to disciple all nations. The gospel needs to be preached to the uttermost parts of the earth. Many Christians defy all odds to fulfill this commission. Christians have brought the gospel from Jerusalem, to Judea, to Samaria, to Asia Minor, to Europe, to Africa, to America, to Asia, and to remote islands. Wherever the gospel went, the broken-hearted were healed, drunkards became sober, prodigal sons and daughters returned home, and evil people turned to God. Some did not regard their lives and were martyred for the Lord. What other book has such power to affect the lives of men?</p>
<h2 class="head2">B. In Changing Behavior</h2>
<p>One time, an American merchant in Africa saw a native reading a Bible under a tree. He said to the native, &ldquo;This book is not popular in America. It is not worth anything.&rdquo; The native pointed to his stomach and said, &ldquo;If it were not because of this book, you would be in here by now.&rdquo; The native had been a cannibal.</p>
<h2 class="head2">C. In Sensitizing the Conscience</h2>
<p>Another time, a person believed in the Lord after hearing the gospel. Later in the day, he stole a bun and ate it. That night, he felt so bad that he could not sleep. The next day, he came back to the brother who had preached to him and said, &ldquo;I did not get saved yesterday, because I stole something.&rdquo; The brother said, &ldquo;Before you received the Lord, did you feel bad when you stole?&rdquo; The new believer said, &ldquo;Before I received the Lord, the more I stole, the better I could sleep.&rdquo; Then the brother said, &ldquo;You are really saved, because the Lord in you bothered you when you stole. You need to repent to the Lord and to the store owner.&rdquo;</p>
<p>These are only a few of the millions of stories of people who have been changed by the gospel in the Bible. The Bible has the power to change people&rsquo;s lives.</p><h2 class="head1">V. THE PROOF BY PEOPLE&rsquo;S LOVE<br />
TOWARD THE BIBLE</h2>
<h2 class="head2">A. Persecution by the Roman Empire</h2>
<p>Christians love the Bible. Some love it so much that they would even die for it. In the secular world, governments usually ban evil books and promote good ones. The Bible is definitely a book of love, a book of salvation, yet there has been much opposition to the Bible and persecution of its readers. Within three hundred years of the Lord&rsquo;s walk on this earth, the emperors of the Roman Empire tried their best to destroy the Bible and everyone who read and believed the Bible. In one instance, 150,000 Christians were killed. Some were burned to death, some were bound together and thrown into the sea, and some were devoured by lions in the Coliseum in Rome as entertainment for twenty thousand spectators.</p>
<h2 class="head2">B. Persecution by the Roman Catholic Church</h2>
<p>After a few hundred years, the Roman Catholic Church also persecuted the readers of the Bible. The so-called Christian church opposed the reading of the Bible by Christians. What a pity! The Pope was afraid that, by reading the Bible, the Christians would find out that the teachings and practices of the Roman Catholic Church were not biblical. Bible-loving Christians were thrown into prisons. Some were hung and some were burned; this was done in order to force them to stop reading the Bible and to reveal the names of others who also loved the Bible. The ones who did not yield to these demands were tortured and killed. Some were sawn in two; others were covered with wax and burned like candles.</p>
<p>People loved the Bible more than their own lives. How much we should treasure the Bible while we can read it freely!</p>
<h2 class="head1">VI. THE SCIENTIFIC PROOF</h2>
<p>The Bible is scientifically correct. Scientific theories are not always correct. Theories are updated when new discoveries are made. When theories are modified to match what the Bible says, they become correct, and there is no need to improve them any further.</p>
<h2 class="head2">A. The Round and Rotating Earth</h2>
<p>Just over five hundred years ago, it was generally believed that the earth was flat. Some thought that ships would fall off the edge of the ocean somewhere beyond the Strait of Gibraltar. Some even thought that the earth was held up by four big turtles; others thought that it was held up by a giant called Atlas. You may laugh at these theories, but they were very real to people at that time. They took these theories so seriously that anyone who insisted that the earth was round was considered a heretic and burned at the stake. We all know that the earth is round, but they, strangely, believed otherwise. About five hundred years ago, explorers of the oceans proved that the earth is indeed round.</p>
<p>The Bible revealed that the earth was round over 2,500 years ago. If man had carefully read the Word of God, they might have discovered the truth much earlier. Job 26:7 says, &ldquo;He (God) stretcheth out the north over empty space, and hangeth the earth upon nothing.&rdquo; Isaiah 40:22 says, &ldquo;It is He (God) who sits above the circle of the earth.&rdquo; The word <em>circle</em> here in Hebrew denotes a sphere. You can see that the Bible clearly stated that the earth was a sphere in space. Job 38:14 says, &ldquo;It (the earth) is changed as clay under the seal.&rdquo; The word <em>changed</em> here in Hebrew means revolved. The <em>clay</em> here is talking about the printing clay roller of Mesopotamia. It has an axle in the middle to turn it around. This is exactly what people discovered thousands of years later&mdash;that the earth is revolving around its own axis.</p>
<h2 class="head2">B. The Unlimited Number of Stars</h2>
<p>Jeremiah 33:22 says, &ldquo;The host of heaven (stars) cannot be numbered.&rdquo; Before the telescope was invented, Kepler, a famous astronomer from Germany, said that there were a total of 1,005 stars. With the invention and continual improvement of the telescope, this number keeps climbing. The most recent figure that scientists have calculated is 20,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 stars. The number will go up again as soon as a better telescope is developed. Remember, the Bible says that the stars cannot be numbered.</p>
<h2 class="head1">SUMMARY</h2>
<p>Scientific books are updated all the time. The books of the Bible have remained the same since they were written. Why? Science is merely man&rsquo;s study of what has been created by God. Man&rsquo;s theories need to be updated; God&rsquo;s word is eternal. Matthew 24:35 says, &ldquo;The heaven and the earth shall pass away, but My words shall by no means pass away.&rdquo; Praise the Lord! We need to be filled up with His living and abiding word (1 Pet. 1:23).</p>

<h2 class="head1">I. THE PROOF BY THE HISTORY<br />
OF THE JEWISH PEOPLE</h2>
<h2 class="head2">A. Chosen by God</h2>
<p>The history of the Jewish people also proves that the Bible is the Word of God. The Jewish people are a special people. They are the chosen people of God. Their forefather is Abraham, chosen and called by God to be the head of the chosen race. Nearly all of the Old Testament is their history (Gen. 12:1&mdash;Malachi).</p>
<h2 class="head2">B. Becoming a Great Nation</h2>
<p>Abraham&rsquo;s grandchild, Israel, with his descendants, seventy in all, went down to Egypt in search of food and eventually grew into a nation. They were enslaved and persecuted in Egypt for hundreds of years. God sent Moses to deliver them from the tyranny of Pharaoh and to bring them out of Egypt. After escaping Pharaoh&rsquo;s army by crossing the Red Sea, they wandered in the wilderness for forty years. Finally, under the leading of Joshua and the assistance of Caleb, they entered into the good land that God had promised Abraham. They divided up the land into portions for each tribe and family. Every one had a portion of the good land as their inheritance from God (Gen. 46:1&mdash;Joshua).</p>
<h2 class="head2">C. Being Led by the Judges</h2>
<p>Not long after the children of Israel settled in the good land, they began to turn away from God. God allowed their enemies to attack them. They cried to God to save them, and He gave them a judge who delivered them from their enemies. This cycle continued for several hundred years (Judges).</p>
<h2 class="head2">D. The Height of Their Experience</h2>
<p>God raised up Samuel to be His prophet, and Samuel anointed David the king. David conquered all their enemies and brought peace to the people of God. In addition, David secured the site and collected the wealth and material needed to build the house of God. Solomon, his son, built the house of God in Jerusalem. That was the height of the experience of the children of Israel&mdash;they had God dwelling among them; they had peace and prosperity in the good land that God had promised Abraham (1 Sam. 3&mdash;2 Chron. 9:28).</p>
<h2 class="head2">E. Degradation</h2>
<p>Degradation began after the temple was built. First, the children of Israel left God and worshipped idols. Second, they set up two other worshipping centers, Dan and Bethel, outside of God&rsquo;s chosen place for worship, Jerusalem. These two actions were very evil in God&rsquo;s eyes and offended Him, causing Him to temporarily give the people up (1 Kings 11:5&mdash;13:34).</p>
<h2 class="head2">F. Being Tossed To and Fro</h2>
<p>The Lord prophesied in Jeremiah 24:9-10, &ldquo;I will even give them up to be tossed to and fro among all the kingdoms of the earth for evil; to be a reproach, and a proverb, a taunt and a curse, in all places whither I shall drive them. And I will send the sword, the famine, and the pestilence, among them, till they be consumed from off the land that I gave unto them and to their fathers.&rdquo; The army of Babylon came up against them and killed many, destroyed the temple and the city, and carried many of the remaining ones away to Babylon. The army even took away the vessels from the temple and placed them in their own idol-filled temple (Jer. 6&mdash;27).</p>
<h2 class="head2">G. The Recovery of the Temple<br />
and the City of Jerusalem</h2>
<p>After seventy years in captivity, as prophesied by Jeremiah (Jer. 29:10-14), the Lord stirred up Cyrus the king of Persia to allow the people to go back to rebuild the temple and the city of Jerusalem. The children of Israel returned and, after much struggle, finished the work (2 Chron. 36:23&mdash;Ezra 6; Neh. 2:9&mdash;7).</p>
<h2 class="head2">H. The Lord&rsquo;s First Coming to Them</h2>
<p>After a few hundred years, the Lord came to His people, fulfilling the prophecies in the Old Testament. He was born of a virgin (Matt. 1:23), lived a perfect, genuine human life (2 Cor. 5:21), was rejected by His own people (John 1:11), then was delivered up to the chief priest and the scribes and was put to death on the cross (Matt. 20:18-19), and was resurrected on the third day according to the Scripture (1 Cor. 15:4; Matt.&mdash;John).</p><h2 class="head2">I. The Destruction of the Temple and the City;<br />
Their Being Scattered Again</h2>
<p>Before the Lord was crucified, He prophesied in Matthew 24:2 that not one stone of the temple would be left upon another. This indicated that the temple would be destroyed and the people would be scattered again. This prophecy was fulfilled in A.D. 70 when a Roman prince, called Titus, came and destroyed the city and the temple. When the people crucified the Lord, they said, &ldquo;His blood be on us and on our children&rdquo; (Matt. 27:25). Since then they have been suffering from evil treatment, the edge of the sword, famine, and pestilence. They have been consumed from generation to generation.</p>
<p>The Roman army, in A.D. 70, killed approximately two million people. Over half of the remaining ones died of starvation. The rest were sold off to be slaves. Fifty years later, another fifty thousand were killed because they rebelled against the Roman Empire. Every one was scattered throughout the earth to suffer for centuries. Before the second world war, tens of thousands were killed in Russia. They were driven to an open area and massacred by machine guns and grenades. During the second world war, six million people were killed by the German army. Various devious means were used to execute them. They were like sheep led to the slaughterhouse (Psa. 44:22; Jer. 12:3).</p>
<h2 class="head2">J. Their Being Kept as a People</h2>
<p>Numbers 23:9 says, &ldquo;Lo, it is a people that dwelleth alone, and shall not be reckoned among the nations.&rdquo; They were not like any other people. The culture, food, and living habits of all other people were dirty. Only the Jewish people were clean. Therefore, to them, the other people were considered to be swine and dogs. They would not live and eat with other people, so they dwelt by themselves. They were without a country for 2,500 years, but they were preserved as a nation. It usually takes about five hundred years for a people to lose their identity after their country is destroyed. However, because of God&rsquo;s prophecies in the Bible concerning Israel, He kept them separated from the different nations among whom they dwelt, so that they would remain a distinct people.</p>
<h2 class="head2">K. The Restoration of the Nation of Israel</h2>
<p>The Lord kept them as a people so that, after 2,500 years, they could restore their nation. According to the Bible, the nation of Israel had to be restored before the end of the world could come (Rom. 11:26-27). The restoration of the nation of Israel took place in 1948. According to human concepts and experience, this is impossible. With man it is impossible, but with God all things are possible (Luke 18:27). The Bible also prophesied that &ldquo;Jerusalem will be trampled by the nations until the times of the Gentiles are fulfilled&rdquo; (Luke 21:24). Jerusalem was returned to God&rsquo;s people in 1967. This fact also confirms the Lord&rsquo;s word that His second coming is near (Matt. 24:33-34).</p>
<h2 class="head2">Conclusion</h2>
<p>Because the Bible and the people of God are tied together, their history and existence today proves to us that the Bible is truly the Word of God.</p>
<h2 class="head1">II. THE PROOF BY ITS INDESTRUCTIBILITY</h2>
<p>During the course of human history, there has not been a book that has been attacked as much as the Bible. Every attack has failed; the Bible has never been destroyed. People can easily destroy a car or a building. Almost everything that exists can be destroyed. However, the Bible, the Word of the eternal God, is indestructible. It is indestructible because the Author is eternal and needs a book to speak for Him eternally. The people who attack the Bible wither away, but the Bible has remained from the beginning until now. Finite people existing in time can never destroy something that is infinite and eternal. Conversely, the more people try to destroy the Bible, the more people read it.</p>
<p>Around A.D. 300, Caesar Diocletian of the Roman Empire used many cruel methods to try to do away with the Bible. He almost destroyed every copy of the Bible that existed at that time. He also killed tens of thousands of believers. He erected a monument with an inscription that claimed that the Christian faith had been exterminated (Extincto Naminechristionorum). Twenty years later, the Bible reappeared in public again.</p>
<p>There was a high official in England called Engersol. He vigorously opposed the Bible. He sought out every copy of the Bible and burned it. But after he died, his residence was bought by the Bible Society for printing Bibles. Engersol died, but the Bible lived on. No one can outlast the Bible. No one can destroy the Bible.</p><h2 class="head1">III. THE PROOF BY ITS SPREAD<br />
DURING PERSECUTION</h2>
<p>The spreading of the Bible under persecution proves that the Bible is the Word of God. Most people will give up something if they are persecuted for possessing it, but not the Bible. When people in Europe were persecuted for having Bibles, they refused to give them up. Many copies were confiscated and burned. It was dangerous to have a Bible around; nevertheless, people would not part with their Bibles even at the risk of severe persecution.</p>
<h2 class="head2">A. A Bible Hidden Inside a Chair</h2>
<p>At that time, a Bible-loving family in France had a Bible. They would have given up anything but their Bible. If the Catholic Church found out that they kept a Bible in their house, they would have been prosecuted. They did not want to bury their Bible in the ground; they wanted to read it every day. They figured out a way to hide the Bible inside a hollow part of a chair. They would use the chair for sitting until it was time to read the Bible. Then they would flip the chair over and open up the secret compartment to take out the Bible. This is how they protected themselves and continued to read the Bible every day.</p>
<p>One day, a &ldquo;Father&rdquo; of the Catholic Church came to search their house. Try as he may, he could not find the hiding place of the Bible. As the whole family watched nervously, he sat down on that very chair to think about where it could possibly be hidden. Everyone was relieved when he finally gave up and left, disappointed.</p>
<p>Due to persecution, this family later immigrated to America, where they could read the Bible freely.</p>
<h2 class="head2">B. A Bible Baked Inside a Loaf of Bread</h2>
<p>A sister in Europe kept a Bible against the will of the Pope of the Roman Catholic Church. He had &ldquo;decreed&rdquo; that anyone found hiding a Bible would be executed. One day the &ldquo;Fathers,&rdquo; carrying out the decree of the Pope, came to search her house. It happened that she was baking bread. When she heard that the &ldquo;Fathers&rdquo; were at the door, she wrapped her Bible with the dough that she was kneading. Her Bible was baked inside a loaf of bread. The &ldquo;Fathers&rdquo; left empty-handed; the sister and her Bible remained safe and secure. She, too, due to persecution, moved to America, where she was free to read the Bible.</p>
<p>There are many testimonies of this sort. It is impossible to record them all here. These testimonies prove to us that the Bible is the Word of God. People do not risk their lives for other books like they do for the Bible.</p>
<h2 class="head1">IV. THE PROOF BY THE WORD OF THE LORD<br />
AND OTHER WRITERS OF THE BIBLE</h2>
<p>The Lord Jesus said to the Jews, &ldquo;For if you believed Moses, you would believe Me; for he wrote concerning Me. But if you do not believe his writings, how shall you believe My words?&rdquo; (John 5:46-47). The Lord often quoted and referred to the Bible. This shows that He believed that the Old Testament was the Word of God. He referenced the Old Testament forty-nine times in the Gospel of Matthew. Here are a few crucial references He used in the four Gospels:</p>
<ol class="decimal">
<li>The Lord said in Mark 10:6, &ldquo;But from the beginning of creation, He made them male and female.&rdquo; He referred to Genesis 1:27.</li>
<li>The Lord said in Luke 17:26-27, &ldquo;And even as it was in the days of Noah, so will it be also in the days of the Son of Man: they were eating, they were drinking, they were marrying, they were being given in marriage, until the day in which Noah entered into the ark, and the flood came and destroyed them all.&rdquo; He referred to Genesis 7:21-23.</li>
<li>The Lord said in Luke 11:51, &ldquo;From the blood of Abel to the blood of Zechariah, who perished between the altar and the house; yes, I tell you, it will be required of this generation.&rdquo; He referred to Genesis 4:8-11.</li>
<li>The Lord said in Luke 17:29, &ldquo;But on the day in which Lot went out from Sodom, it rained fire and brimstone from heaven and destroyed them all.&rdquo; He referred to Genesis 19:24-25.</li>
<li>The Lord said in John 3:14-15, &ldquo;And as Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness, even so must the Son of Man be lifted up; that everyone who believes in Him may have eternal life.&rdquo; He referred to Numbers 21:8-9.</li>
</ol>
<p>The Lord said in Matthew 5:17-18, &ldquo;Do not think that I came to abolish the law or the prophets; I did not come to abolish, but to fulfill. For truly I say to you, Until the heaven and the earth pass away, one iota or one tittle shall by no means pass away from the law until all come to pass.&rdquo; He not only believed that the Old Testament was the Word of God, He was on the earth to fulfill what was written.</p>
<p>Can we use what was written in the New Testament to prove that the Old Testament is the Word of God? Yes, we can. The Bible was not written by one man; the Bible was written by approximately forty people. People might not believe the author of a book if he were to say in the last chapter of his book that the foregoing chapters were true. However, when a series of writers profess belief that the foregoing books are the word of God, which is the case with those who wrote the Bible, it is very believable. Time after time, the writers of the Bible would quote the previous books and then record additional revelation from God. When King David wrote some of the Psalms, he quoted the previous books of the Old Testament, such as the Pentateuch, and then added further revelation (Psa. 119:135&mdash;Num. 6:25; Psa. 119:166&mdash;Gen. 49:18). Other writers, such as Peter, Paul, and John, also quoted verses from the Old Testament in their writings (1 Pet. 2:6&mdash;Isa. 28:16; John 1:23&mdash;Isa. 40:3; John 2:22&mdash;Psa. 16:10; Rom. 9:17&mdash;Exo. 9:16). The Lord and the New Testament writers quoted from the Old Testament hundreds of times. Forty writers taking almost 1,600 years to write the Bible while at different times quoting earlier writers is strong proof that the Bible is inspired by God.</p><h2 class="head1">V. THE PROOF BY ANCIENT DOCUMENTS</h2>
<p>Some people who doubt that the Bible is the Word of God may not be able to argue with the previously mentioned proof, but they may argue that the Bible we have today is not necessarily the same as the original Bible. It is true that there is not one single copy of the Bible&rsquo;s original manuscripts left today. But there are manuscripts, documents, and letters from ancient times that tell us that the Bible we have today is accurate.</p>
<h2 class="head2">A. Three Main Ancient Manuscripts</h2>
<p>There are over 2,300 manuscripts of the Bible. Manuscripts are ancient copies of the Bible. None of them are complete. There are three main ancient manuscripts.</p>
<p>The Codex Vaticanus, or the Vatican Manuscript, is stored in the Vatican Library, Vatican City, Italy. The Vatican is the headquarters of the Roman Catholic Church where the Pope resides. The Roman Catholic Church has possessed this manuscript for over five hundred years. This manuscript was copied during the mid fourth century A.D. It is very large in size, about one square foot and 759 pages. Although it is missing some pages, it is the most complete manuscript.</p>
<p>The Codex Sinaiticus, or Sinaitic Manuscript, was copied on over one hundred sheep skins, probably in the fourth century. It was discovered accidentally by Dr. Tischendorf of Germany in 1844 in a monastery at the foot of Mount Sinai. It had been placed among waste paper and was just about to be burned. He rescued it, and it was later stored in the National Library in Saint Petersburg, Russia. It was sold to England in 1934 for five hundred thousand dollars, and it is now kept in the London Museum.</p>
<p>The Codex Alexandrinicus, or Alexandrian Manuscript, is kept in the National Library of the British Museum. This manuscript has four volumes. There are some missing pages. It is believed to have been copied by a martyr named Thekla during the fifth century. It was presented to the Patriarch of Alexandria in 1078.</p>
<p>It is good that we have so many different manuscripts, so that scholars can compare them and produce the most accurate and complete set of the books of the Bible. When we read the Bible, we can be sure that it is correct.</p>
<h2 class="head2">B. Books and Letters of Early Believers</h2>
<p>Today&rsquo;s Bible is the same as it was in the first few centuries.</p>
<p>The apostle Paul&rsquo;s co-worker Clement (Phil. 4:3) wrote a letter to the church in Corinth. In his letter, he referenced the words of Peter, James, John and Luke. He also quoted from Acts, Romans, Corinthians, Thessalonians, Titus, James, Peter, and Hebrews. Similar letters have been discovered that quoted verses from the New Testament.</p>
<p>One believer during the end of the second century quoted over 2,500 verses from the New Testament in his books. Another believer wrote several books at the beginning of the third century. His books quoted two thirds of the New Testament. Other books from the first centuries include hundreds of quotes from the New Testament.</p>
<p>By comparing the ancient manuscripts, the letters, and the books of the ancient believers, we can see that today&rsquo;s Bible is the same as the ancient Bible. How we praise the Lord that He has preserved the Bible for us until now.</p>
<h2 class="head1">VI. THE PROOF BY ARCHAEOLOGY</h2>
<h2 class="head2">A. The Discovery of the Dead Sea Scrolls</h2>
<p>The Dead Sea Scrolls were discovered in 1947. They were stored in eleven caves northwest of the Dead Sea, fifteen miles from Jerusalem. They were copied on sheep skins. It is estimated that the Dead Sea Scrolls were copied in 100 B.C. They did not contain the complete Bible. Isaiah was complete, but other books were only partially complete. These scrolls serve the purpose of confirming that the Old Testament we have is authentic.</p>
<p>According to history, there were believers who had moved to those caves to escape the sinfulness of the cities. They most likely stored the scrolls in the caves when they fled from a war in that area. How sovereign of God to arrange such an event to preserve this valuable proof!</p>
<h2 class="head2">B. The Discovery of Clay Tablets</h2>
<p>Seventeen thousand clay tablets, dated from 2300 to 2500 B.C., were discovered in the northern part of Syria. These clay tablets recorded human history as far back as 2900 B.C. They tell about Abraham&rsquo;s sixth great-grandfather Heber, Noah&rsquo;s ark during the flood, the destruction of Sodom and Gomorrah, and Jerusalem. These clay tablets prove to us that what was recorded in the Bible is not fictitious.</p>
<h2 class="head2">C. The Discovery of Nineveh</h2>
<p>The Bible talks about a city called Nineveh, the capital of Assyria. It was a sinful city. Jonah was sent to preach the gospel there. He refused to go and was swallowed by a great fish. After he repented, the fish spit him out. He then went to Nineveh and brought the city to repentance (Jonah).</p>
<p>Nineveh was destroyed during a war. It was buried under sand for thousands of years and eventually discovered last century. The archaeologists found writings concerning many things recorded in the Bible that had not yet been recorded in history books.</p>
<h2 class="head1">CONCLUSION</h2>
<p>In the writing, canonization, and preservation of the Bible, we can definitely see the sovereign hand of God. For example, when the Codex Sinaiticus was about to be burned, a scholar &ldquo;just happened&rdquo; to be passing by who could recognize its value and rescue it. Because of this, we now have three manuscripts that can be compared so that we can know with assurance that the Bible we have today is accurate. The preservation of the Dead Sea Scrolls was sovereignly arranged by God for us. If it weren&rsquo;t for the war, the believers living in caves near Jerusalem would not have hidden them in the caves. The manuscripts would have become worn out from much use and we would not have them today. As it was, these precious manuscripts were stored so well that they could be preserved until their discovery almost two thousand years later.</p>
<p>We praise the Lord for giving us such a great gift&mdash;the Bible. The proof in these two lessons increases our faith in and appreciation for the Bible. The Lord and His lovers suffered much to preserve the Bible for thousands of years so that we, the lovers of the Lord, may have this great gift. We need to treasure the Bible and study it as the most precious thing we have.</p>

<p>In the next four lessons, we will talk about fourteen key topics of the Bible. Because the Bible is so long, it is helpful to know the key topics of the Bible in order to better understand what you are reading. Some of these topics were covered in earlier lesson books. The topics addressed in these lessons are not covered in detail. If you wish to know more about salvation, God, Christ, the Spirit, the human spirit, eternal life, and the church, you may study the previous lesson books in this series.</p>
<h2 class="head1">I. GOD</h2>
<p>[God is the foremost item revealed in the Bible because He is the beginning of all things. Everything in the universe originated from Him and began with Him. God is also the main content of the Bible from its first book to the last. He created us and regenerated us and has everything to do with our life and our being. Thus, we should know Him first.]</p>
<h2 class="head2">A. The Unique True God</h2>
<p>[The Scriptures in many instances and in many ways tell us that God is uniquely one. Both in the Old Testament and in the New, there are many passages which clearly and definitely tell us that God is only one. First Corinthians 8:4 says, &ldquo;There is no God but one,&rdquo; and Isaiah 45:5 says, &ldquo;I am the Lord, and there is none else, there is no God besides Me.&rdquo;]</p>
<h2 class="head2">B. Elohim&mdash;the Faithful Mighty One</h2>
<p>Genesis 1:1 says, &ldquo;In the beginning God created the heaven and the earth.&rdquo; [Here in Hebrew, the word for God is Elohim. This is the first divine title used in the Bible to reveal God, and it means the faithful mighty One. It shows that the true God, whom we worship according to the Bible, is not only mighty but also faithful. He is the mighty One; so He could create the heavens, the earth, all things, and mankind, calling what is not being as being. He is faithful; therefore, He is dependable, ever unchanging, and immovable. His works according to His faithfulness are as enduring as the sun and as established as the moon (Psa. 89:33-37).]</p>
<h2 class="head2">C. Jehovah&mdash;<br />
the Self-existing and Ever-existing I Am</h2>
<p>In Exodus 3:14, God said that He is the &ldquo;I Am that I Am.&rdquo; [Here God told Moses in plain words that His name is Jehovah. The name Jehovah is the second main divine title used by the Bible in revealing God. It means the self-existing and ever-existing I Am, the I Am who was, who is and who is to come. It indicates that He is the I Am, and besides Him nothing is. Only He is, and He is the self-existing and ever-existing I Am, who was, who is, and who is coming. Thus, everything in the entire universe is vain and is not; only He is, only He exists forever, and only He is reality. He is everything to the people whom He created and who belong to Him. Whatever they need, He is.]</p>
<h2 class="head2">D. The Triune God</h2>
<p>[The Bible reveals that God is triune. This is a revelation of great importance. God is uniquely one, and His name is Jehovah; yet this God is also triune&mdash;He is the Father, Son, and Spirit. This is a mystery; in fact, it is a mystery of mysteries.]</p>
<h2 class="head3">1. The Matter of<br />
the Father, the Son, and the Spirit</h2>
<p>[The Lord says in Matthew 28:19, &ldquo;Baptizing them into the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit.&rdquo; The Lord here clearly speaks of Three&mdash;the Father, Son, and Spirit. But when He speaks here of the name of the Father, Son, and Spirit, the name which is used is in the singular number in the original text. This means that though the Father, the Son, and the Spirit are three, yet the name is one. It is really mysterious&mdash;one name for Three. This, of course, is what is meant by the expression three-one or triune.]</p>
<h2 class="head3">2. The Father, the Son, and the Spirit<br />
All Being God</h2>
<p>The Father is God (1 Pet. 1:2; Eph. 1:17). The Son is God (Heb. 1:8; John 1:1; Rom. 9:5). The Spirit is God (Acts 5:3-4). [The Scriptures clearly reveal to us that all Three&mdash;the Father, the Son, and the Spirit&mdash;are God. This does not mean, however, that they are three Gods. We have already seen that the Scriptures tell us clearly and definitely that God is only one. Although there are three&mdash;the Father, Son, and Spirit&mdash;yet the Three are not three Gods, but one. This is really a mystery! It is unsearchable! But praise the Lord, we can simply receive and enjoy this mysterious One according to what the Scriptures have said!&quot;]</p><h2 class="head3">3. The Father, the Son, and the Spirit<br />
All Being Eternal</h2>
<p>The Father is eternal (Isa. 9:6). The Son is eternal (Heb. 1:12; 7:3). The Spirit also is eternal (Heb. 9:14). Hence, all Three&mdash;the Father, the Son, and the Spirit&mdash;are eternal.</p>
<h2 class="head3">4. The Father, the Son, and the Spirit<br />
Coexisting Simultaneously</h2>
<p>In John 14:16-17 the Son says that He will pray to the Father that the Father may send the Spirit. [In Ephesians 3:14-17 Paul says that he will pray to the Father that He would grant us to be strengthened with power through His Spirit into our inner man, that Christ may make His home in our hearts. Second Corinthians 13:14 says, &ldquo;The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ, and the love of God, and the fellowship of the Holy Spirit be with you all.&rdquo;] [Therefore, we do not believe that the Father ceased to exist and was replaced by the Son, then after another period of time the Son was replaced by the Spirit. We believe that the Three&mdash;Father, Son, and Spirit&mdash;are eternal and co-existent.]</p>
<h2 class="head3">5. The Father, the Son, and the Spirit<br />
Coinhering and Being Inseparable</h2>
<p>[The relationship among the Father, the Son, and the Spirit of the Trinity is not only that they simultaneously coexist, but, even more, that they indwell one another mutually. Coexistence means to exist together at the same time. Coinherence, as applied to the Trinity, means that the Father, the Son, and the Spirit are in one another and thus exist together.] John 5:43 tells us that the Son came in the name of the Father. This equals the Father&rsquo;s coming. John 14:10 says that the Son is in the Father and the Father is in the Son. Hence, the Son can testify saying, &ldquo;He who has seen Me has seen the Father&rdquo; (John 14:9). Other verses tell us of similar facts (John 6:46; 8:29; 14:26; 15:26; Luke 4:1). [The Triune God has never been separated. When One moves, the other Two also move with Him. When One is sent, the other Two also come with Him. When the Son comes, He comes in the name of the Father; when He comes, the Father comes. When the Spirit is sent, He is sent in the name of the Son; His being sent is the Son&rsquo;s being sent. Hence, the Son&rsquo;s coming is the Father&rsquo;s coming, and the Spirit&rsquo;s being sent is the Son&rsquo;s being sent. The Three&mdash;the Father, Son, and Spirit&mdash;are one. They cannot be separated for eternity.]</p>
<h2 class="head3">6. The Three&mdash;<br />
the Father, the Son, and the Spirit&mdash;<br />
Being One</h2>
<p>The Son is the Father. [Isaiah 9:6 says, &ldquo;Unto us a child is born, unto us a son is given...and his name shall be called...Mighty God, Eternal Father.&rdquo; In this verse, the mighty God matches the child, and the everlasting Father matches the Son. Yes, He is a child, yet He is the mighty God. The child who was born in the manger of Bethlehem was the mighty God. Just as the child and the mighty God are one, so also the Son and the eternal Father are one. The Son is the eternal Father.]</p>
<p>The Son became the life-giving Spirit. [First Corinthians 15:45 states, &ldquo;The last Adam became a life-giving Spirit.&rdquo; The last Adam, of course, is the incarnated Lord Jesus, and the life-giving Spirit, of course, is the Holy Spirit. There can never be another life-giving Spirit besides the Holy Spirit.]</p>
<h2 class="head2">E. The Reason for God Being Triune</h2>
<p>Second Corinthians 13:14 says, &ldquo;The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ, and the love of God, and the fellowship of the Holy Spirit be with you all.&rdquo; Here we see that the Triune God is dispensing Himself into us. By having the fellowship of the Holy Spirit, we are enjoying the grace of Christ coming out from the love of God. The whole Triune God is here for our enjoyment and experience.</p>
<p>[God is the Triune God. The one, unique God has the aspect of three&mdash;the Father, the Son, and the Spirit. The Father, the Son, and the Spirit are all God and are eternal, coexistent, coinherent, and inseparable. To the believers, the Father is the source, the Son is the manifestation, and the Spirit is God reaching and entering into them. Thus, the Triune God is dispensed into their being to be their life, enjoyment, and complete supply.]</p><h2 class="head1">II. CHRIST</h2>
<p>[Christ is the subject and center of the Bible and is the main content of the Bible from beginning to end. Even more He is the reality of our faith. We who have believed into Him and received grace must know Him in a thorough way.]</p>
<h2 class="head2">A. The Titles of Christ</h2>
<p>Matthew 1:21 says, &ldquo;And she will bring forth a Son, and you shall call His name Jesus, for He shall save His people from their sins.&rdquo; [When Christ was incarnated to be a man, He was given the name Jesus by an angel. Jesus is equivalent to Joshua in Hebrew (Num. 13:16), which means the salvation of Jehovah, or Jehovah the Savior. Thus, He is the Savior, who will save His people from their sins.] Matthew 1:16 says, &ldquo;Mary, of whom was born Jesus, who is called Christ.&rdquo; [The second name of Christ is Christ, the equivalent of Messiah in Hebrew (John 1:41), which means the anointed One. This name reveals that He is God&rsquo;s anointed One, being anointed by God with His Spirit to create and to redeem in order to fulfill God&rsquo;s eternal purpose.] Matthew 1:23 says, &ldquo;Behold, the virgin shall be with child and shall bring forth a Son, and they shall call His name Emmanuel, which being interpreted is, God with us.&rdquo; [Jesus and Christ were names given by God. When men discovered that He was God, they called Him Emmanuel, which means God with us. This name reveals that Jesus, who is our Savior, and Christ, who is God&rsquo;s Anointed, are actually God Himself coming to be with us.]</p>
<h2 class="head2">B. The Person of Christ</h2>
<h2 class="head3">1. God</h2>
<p>&ldquo;Christ, who is over all, God blessed forever&rdquo; (Rom. 9:5). [This word simply and strongly declares that Christ is God, who is over all, the complete God blessed forever.]</p>
<h2 class="head3">2. The Son of God</h2>
<p>&ldquo;But these have been written that you may believe that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God&rdquo; (John 20:31). Christ is also the Son of God, that is, God the Son.</p>
<h2 class="head3">3. Man</h2>
<p>&ldquo;The Man, Christ Jesus&rdquo; (1 Tim. 2:5). Christ is not only God, He is also man. He is the complete God who became a genuine and perfect man. This is a great mystery.</p>
<h2 class="head3">4. The Creator</h2>
<p>&ldquo;You in the beginning, Lord, have founded the earth, and the heavens are the works of Your hands&rdquo; ( Heb. 1:10). He is the Creator.</p>
<h2 class="head3">5. The Firstborn of All Creation</h2>
<p>&ldquo;The Son of His love...Firstborn of all creation&rdquo; (Col. 1:13, 15). [This tells us that Christ is also a creature, even the Firstborn among the creatures. As the Firstborn, He is the first. As God, He is the Creator of heaven and earth and all things; as man, He is the first among the creatures.]</p>
<h2 class="head2">C. The Work of Christ</h2>
<p>[In being anointed by God to be God&rsquo;s anointed One to fulfill His eternal plan, Christ accomplished and will accomplish the following great things:]</p>
<h2 class="head3">1. Creating</h2>
<p>&ldquo;You in the beginning, Lord, have founded the earth, and the heavens are the works of Your hands&rdquo; (Heb. 1:10). [The first great thing Christ did was to create the heavens and the earth, all things, and man. Hence, He is the Creator of all things.]</p>
<h2 class="head3">2. Becoming Flesh</h2>
<p>&ldquo;And the Word became flesh and tabernacled among us...full of grace and reality&rdquo; (John 1:14). [The second great thing accomplished by Christ, God&rsquo;s Anointed, was that He as God became flesh; that is, He came to be a man in the flesh to be the tabernacle of God among men, bringing God to men to be realized as reality and to be received as grace. Reality is God known and contacted by man, and grace is God received and enjoyed by man. In the fleshly tabernacle which He became, Christ lived with man for thirty-three and a half years, thus fully bringing God to man to be his reality and grace.]</p><h2 class="head3">3. Being Crucified on the Cross</h2>
<p>[After thirty-three and a half years, He went to the cross to be crucified to accomplish the redemption in God&rsquo;s eternal plan. This is the third great thing He did, solving, once and for all, the problem of everything that God had condemned in the universe, such as Satan, sin, the world, the flesh, the old man, and the old creation. He did this for God and for those who are chosen by God, who will eternally inherit His salvation.]</p>
<h2 class="head3">4. Being Resurrected from<br />
among the Dead</h2>
<p>Christ gave up His own life, and He Himself took it back by rising from among the dead (John 10:17-18). This is the fourth great thing He did, which accomplished justification, resurrection, and regeneration for us. &ldquo;Jesus...was raised because of our justification&rdquo; (Rom. 4:24-25). His resurrection is the proof of our justification. His resurrection is the receipt of our justification. We are raised up together with Him in His resurrection (Eph. 2:5-6). His resurrection also released His life into us, thus regenerating us to be the new man.</p>
<h2 class="head3">5. Ascending into the Heavens</h2>
<p>[After Christ rose from among the dead, He ascended into the heavens. This is the fifth great thing done by Him.] &ldquo;Having ascended to the height, He led captive those taken captive and gave gifts to men&rdquo; (Eph. 4:8). [Those taken captive refers to us, who were captured before by Satan and death. Now Christ, in His triumphant resurrection, has captured us from the hands of Satan and death, bringing us to the heavens to make us God&rsquo;s gift to Christ that Christ may give us as gifts to the church.] &ldquo;And seated us together in the heavenlies in Christ Jesus&rdquo; (Eph. 2:6). [The ascension of Christ also brought us, who have believed into Him and have been joined to Him to be one, to the heavenlies, that we may attain to a heavenly position and live in a heavenly atmosphere and state.] What wonderful things Christ has accomplished for us in His ascension!</p>
<h2 class="head3">6. Fulfilling His Heavenly Ministry</h2>
<p>[Upon His ascension into heaven, Christ proceeded to accomplish His heavenly ministry. He was anointed by God to do this sixth great thing, continually performing the following four matters on our behalf: After Christ enacted the new covenant (Matt. 26:28) through His death on the earth, He ascended to the heavens to be the Mediator of this new covenant, executing it upon those who believe in Him (Heb. 8:6). Christ is also the Minister of the true tabernacle in the heavens today, ministering to His believers the heavenly life and the divine, heavenly supply (Heb. 8:1-2). Today, Christ is also our great High Priest in the heavens, interceding before God on our behalf that we may be saved to the uttermost (Heb. 4:14; 7:24-26). Christ in the heavens today is also our Advocate before the righteous God. If we sin after we are saved, based upon His being our propitiation, He pleads for us in order to recover the broken fellowship between God and us (1 John 2:1-2).]</p>
<h2 class="head3">7. Coming Again</h2>
<p>[When Christ completes His heavenly ministry, He will come back to accomplish the seventh great thing as God&rsquo;s Anointed, which includes the following three matters: When Christ comes again, He will rapture all believers to the air, whether they are resurrected or living, to meet with Him, that they may always be together with Him. This is the first matter He will perform in His second coming (1 Thes. 4:16-17).] The second matter Christ will perform in His second coming is that He will save all of Israel (Rom. 11:26). The third matter the Lord will perform when He returns is that He will judge all the living unbelieving nations.</p>
<h2 class="head3">8. Establishing the Millennial Kingdom</h2>
<p>After Christ cleans up the earth at His coming, He will set up the millennial kingdom and will reign with His overcoming believers in it for a thousand years. This is the eighth great thing He will accomplish as God&rsquo;s Anointed (Rev. 20:4, 6).</p>
<h2 class="head3">9. Being the Center of the New Jerusalem<br />
in the New Heaven and the New Earth</h2>
<p>[At the end of the millennial kingdom, the old heaven and the old earth will be abolished. Christ will be the center of eternity in the New Jerusalem in the new heaven and new earth to come. This is the last great thing to be done by Christ as God&rsquo;s Anointed in fulfilling God&rsquo;s eternal plan. All those redeemed by God throughout the ages will then be with Him, enjoying the bountiful issue of God&rsquo;s work throughout the ages in God&rsquo;s eternal life forever and ever] (Rev. 21:23).</p><h2 class="head1">III. THE HOLY SPIRIT</h2>
<p>[The Holy Spirit is the One who brings in the Triune God for our experience and enjoyment. Therefore, we should also know Him that we may richly experience Him.]</p>
<h2 class="head2">A. The Ultimate Expression of the Triune God</h2>
<p>[In the divine Trinity, the Holy Spirit, who is the Spirit of God, is listed last, showing that He is the ultimate expression of the Triune God (Matt. 28:19).]</p>
<h2 class="head2">B. The Triune God Reaching and Entering<br />
into the Believers</h2>
<p>The Lord said in John 14:16-17 [that the Holy Spirit is the Triune God reaching man, that is, the Triune God becoming the Spirit to reach man and be with him forever.]</p>
<p>He further revealed to us in John 14:17 and 20 [that the Holy Spirit, who reaches us with the Father and the Son, will also enter into us. This indicates that He is the Triune God entering into the believers. When He enters into us, the Father and the Son enter into us (John 14:23).]</p>
<h2 class="head2">C. What the Holy Spirit Is</h2>
<p>The &ldquo;Spirit of God&rdquo; (Gen. 1:2) participated in God&rsquo;s work of creation. The &ldquo;Spirit of Jehovah&rdquo; (2 Chron. 20:14) participated in God&rsquo;s relationship with man (Gen. 2:7). The &ldquo;Holy Spirit&rdquo; (Luke 1:35) participated in Christ&rsquo;s incarnation to sanctify man unto God. The &ldquo;Spirit of Jesus&rdquo; (Acts 16:7) participated in the birth, the living, and the sufferings of Jesus. The &ldquo;Spirit of Christ&rdquo; (Rom. 8:9) participated in the resurrection of Christ and the impartation of life. The &ldquo;Spirit of Jesus Christ&rdquo; (Phil. 1:19) participated in the birth, living, and death of Jesus, as well as in the resurrection of Christ and the impartation of life, with a bountiful supply that the believers may be saved in all things. The &ldquo;Spirit of life&rdquo; (Rom. 8:2), &ldquo;the life-giving Spirit&rdquo; (1 Cor. 15:45), participated in Christ being man&rsquo;s life and giving man life. &ldquo;The Spirit&rdquo;, which was not yet because Jesus was not yet glorified (John 7:39), [is the issue of the Holy Spirit having passed through all the items of what He is, mentioned above. Thus, He is the all-inclusive and consummated Spirit as the ultimate expression of the Triune God to reach and enter into those who believe into Christ.] The &ldquo;seven Spirits&rdquo; (Rev. 1:4) refers to the sevenfold intensified Holy Spirit, that the church in desolation may receive the sevenfold riches of grace and power.</p>
<h2 class="head2">D. The Two Aspects of the Holy Spirit</h2>
<p>[In the New Testament, there are two aspects of the Holy Spirit, who is the Spirit of God, related to the believers. On the one hand, He is the Spirit of life in us to be the essential Spirit of God that we may have the divine life to live and to exist. On the other hand, He is the Spirit of power upon us to be the economical Spirit of God that we may have the divine power and gift to work for God.] Jesus said in John 14:17, &ldquo;The Spirit of reality...shall be in you&rdquo;. [This is the Holy Spirit as the essential Spirit of God in the believers that they may have God&rsquo;s life to live for God.] Then He said in Acts 1:8, &ldquo;But you shall receive power when the Holy Spirit has come upon you, and you shall be My witnesses both in Jerusalem, and in all Judea and Samaria, and unto the remotest part of the earth.&rdquo; [This is the Holy Spirit as the economical Spirit of God upon the believers that they may receive God&rsquo;s power to work for the Lord.]</p>
<h2 class="head2">E. The Work of the Holy Spirit</h2>
<p>The Holy Spirit did and is still doing many wonderful things for us to bring us fully into God&rsquo;s economy. There are ten crucial things that help bring us fully into God&rsquo;s economy: 1) The Holy Spirit became the transfiguration and reality of Christ in His resurrection to testify concerning the reality of Christ in resurrection (John 15:26); 2) The Holy Spirit came to convict sinners of their sins that they may repent and believe into Christ to obtain eternal life (John 16:8); 3) The Holy Spirit, as God&rsquo;s essential Spirit of life, regenerates the repentant sinner in his spirit that he may have the life of God and become a child of God (John 3:6); 4) The Holy Spirit, as God&rsquo;s essential Spirit of life, also renews man through regeneration that man may receive God&rsquo;s salvation of life (Titus 3:5); 5) The Holy Spirit, as God&rsquo;s essential Spirit of life, abides in us to continually supply us with God&rsquo;s life and riches (2 Tim. 1:14); 6) The Holy Spirit, as the essential Spirit of God, anoints the essence (element) of God into the believers, thus producing a teaching for them that they may abide in the Lord according to the teaching of God&rsquo;s essence (1 John 2:27); 7) The Holy Spirit, as God&rsquo;s essential Spirit of life in the believers, also supplies them with God&rsquo;s holy nature, that is, the divine essence (Rom. 15:16); 8) The Holy Spirit, as the essential Spirit of God in the believers, transforms the believers metabolically with God&rsquo;s divine essence into the Lord&rsquo;s image from one degree of glory to a higher degree of glory (2 Cor. 3:18); 9) The Holy Spirit, as the economical Spirit of God, is the power upon the believers for them to work for God (Luke 24:49); and 10) The Holy Spirit is upon the believers, as the economical Spirit of God, giving them diverse gifts to work for God (1 Cor. 12:7-11).</p><h2 class="head1">IV. THE CROSS OF CHRIST</h2>
<p>[The cross of Christ accomplished God&rsquo;s eternal redemption for us according to the requirements of God&rsquo;s righteousness, holiness, and glory to become the basis of our eternal salvation. Hence, we must thoroughly know the cross.]</p>
<h2 class="head2">A. The Cross Being Prophesied by God</h2>
<p>Galatians 3:13 says, &ldquo;Christ has redeemed us out of the curse of the law, having become a curse on our behalf; because it is written, Cursed is everyone hanging on a tree.&rdquo; [&ldquo;Tree&rdquo; here signifies the cross, which was made of wood. In Deuteronomy 21:23 of the Old Testament, God prophesied in the judgments of the Law that Christ would be hung on a tree, that is, be hung on the cross.]</p>
<h2 class="head2">B. The Cross Being a Roman Form of Execution</h2>
<p>John 19:15 tells us, &ldquo;They cried out then, Away with him, away with him, crucify him! Pilate says to them, Shall I crucify your king? The chief priests answered, We have no king but Caesar.&rdquo; [The Jewish form of execution was to stone a criminal to death (Deut. 22:24). However, about sixty years before the Lord&rsquo;s birth, the Jewish nation fell to Rome. Not long before the Lord was put to death by the Roman governor, the Roman Empire had adopted crucifixion as the form of execution for the most evil persons. Thus, when the Jews sought to kill the Lord, they crucified Him through the hands of the Roman governor, fulfilling God&rsquo;s prophecy in Deuteronomy 21:23 concerning how the Lord would die. This was done by the sovereign hand of God.]</p>
<h2 class="head2">C. The Time When Christ Was Crucified</h2>
<p>According to Mark 15:25 and Matthew 27:45 Christ was crucified beginning at nine o&rsquo;clock in the morning until three o&rsquo;clock in the afternoon, a total of six hours. [In the first three hours, God did not punish Him in the sinners&rsquo; place; rather, men persecuted Him. In these three hours, He suffered for martyrdom, not redemption. At noon, the earth became dark. From this point until three o&rsquo;clock, men did not persecute Him, but God judged Him in the sinners&rsquo; place. In those three hours, He suffered for redemption, not martyrdom.]</p>
<h2 class="head2">D. The Accomplishments of the Cross</h2>
<p>Christ accomplished eleven matters on the cross. We can participate in God&rsquo;s economy because of His various accomplishments.</p>
<p>[The first thing Christ accomplished on the cross was to bear the various sins in our outward actions, that is, the sins committed by us personally, that we may be saved and pass from death into life (1 Pet. 2:24).</p>
<p>On the cross, at the same time, Christ removed the sin in our inward nature, that is, the sin inherited by birth, that we may be delivered from our sinful nature within (Heb. 9:26).</p>
<p>Christ bore our outward sins and removed our inward sin on the cross, receiving the curse which, according to God&rsquo;s law, we should have received because of our fall and our sin (Gal. 3:13).</p>
<p>Christ not only dealt with our twofold sin on the cross; He also crucified our sinful old man that the body of sin might be made of none effect, that we should no longer be slaves to sin (Rom. 6:6).</p>
<p>Since our old man has been crucified with Christ, our &ldquo;I&rdquo; is also crucified with Him (Gal. 2:20).</p>
<p>Not only did Christ crucify our old man on the cross; He also crucified our flesh with its passions and lusts. Here it says that we who are of Christ have crucified the flesh with the passions and the lusts. We can do this based on the fact that the Lord crucified our flesh on the cross (Gal. 5:24).</p>
<p>On the cross, Christ destroyed the Devil, who has the might of death, and released us from the slavery of death (Heb. 2:14-15).</p>
<p>Since Christ destroyed the Devil, who has the power of death, obviously He also judged and dealt with him, the old serpent who had poisoned mankind, that all who believe in Christ may have God&rsquo;s eternal life and pass from death into life. This is typified by Moses&rsquo; lifting up the serpent in the wilderness, which brought the Israelites from death to life (John 3:14-15).</p>
<p>On the cross, Christ destroyed Satan the Devil, and at the same time He crucified the world organized by Satan and hanging on Satan, causing the world to lose its usurping power on those who have believed into Christ (Gal. 6:14).</p>
<p>On the cross, Christ abolished the Old Testament law of the commandments in ordinances, which separated the Jews from the Gentiles, making them one and creating the two in Himself into one new man, which is the church (Eph. 2:14-15).</p>
<p>Christ not only dealt with all the above negative items for God and for us on the cross, but through His death on the cross He also released the divine life within Him into us so that we could become His many members which constitute His Body (John 12:24).]</p>
<h2 class="head2">E. Boasting in the Cross</h2>
<p>Galatians 6:14 says, &ldquo;But far be it from me to boast except in the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ.&rdquo; [Those zealous for the Jewish religion forced others to be circumcised in order to boast in others&rsquo; flesh (Gal. 6:12-13). However, the apostle Paul, being gained by Christ, did not boast in anything but the cross of Christ.]</p>
<h2 class="head1">SUMMARY</h2>
<p>God is the One who planned. Christ is the One who accomplished. The Spirit is the One who applies. The Spirit brings to us the reality of what God is, what Christ has accomplished on the cross, and what Christ went through, obtained, and attained. The person and the work of the Triune God has delivered us from all the negative things in the universe and dispenses into us the Triune God Himself. These are the four most crucial things revealed to us in the Bible. When we see, believe, and receive the truth concerning God, Christ, the Holy Spirit, and the cross of Christ, we are set free to enjoy Him. How wonderful!</p>

<h2 class="head1">I. MAN</h2>
<p>The Bible is not only a book about God; it is also about man. If you took away God, Christ, the Holy Spirit, and the cross of Christ from the Bible, the Bible would be an empty book. Likewise, without man, there is no one for God to speak to in the Bible. Therefore, just as God and the Lord Jesus have a special place in the Bible, so does man.</p>
<p>In the Bible, there is more written about man than about God. If we want to know man, we must study the Bible. No other book describes man as thoroughly as the Bible. Therefore, in order to know the Bible, we must know what it says concerning man.</p>
<h2 class="head2">A. The Creation of Man</h2>
<h2 class="head3">1. Man Being Created according to<br />
God&rsquo;s Image and Likeness</h2>
<p>[Man not only possesses the highest created life, but he is also made in God&rsquo;s image and after God&rsquo;s likeness (Gen. 1:26-27). Besides man, no other creature resembles God in image and in likeness. Man is the highest of God&rsquo;s created things, and he is created in God&rsquo;s image and after God&rsquo;s likeness. In God&rsquo;s creation, man is the best container prepared by God for His plan. In His plan God ordained that man would possess His life in order to be the brothers of His Son; therefore, in His creation, He caused man to have His image and likeness.</p>
<p>Image refers to the inward parts, such as the mind, emotion, and will. Man&rsquo;s mind, emotion, and will, which constitute the intangible man, were created in God&rsquo;s image. Therefore, human functions of thought, opinion, and love resemble those of God.</p>
<p>The image of God also refers to the characteristics of His attributes. The most prominent of God&rsquo;s attributes manifested in man are love, light, holiness, and righteousness. When God created man, He created him in His image, according to the attributes of His virtues, so that man can express Him through these virtues. Thus, man has the desire to have love, light, holiness, and righteousness, and these virtues are sometimes expressed in his behavior. What man has, however, is only the image and not the reality. Man must receive God as his life and content and then God&rsquo;s love, light, holiness, and righteousness will fill up and enrich the human virtues of love, light, holiness, and righteousness to become the reality.</p>
<p>Likeness refers to the outward body which constitutes the tangible man. Man&rsquo;s outward body was created after the likeness of God. God has His likeness. Before God was incarnated to be a man, He appeared frequently to people in the Old Testament in the form of a man (Gen. 18:2, 16-17; Judg. 13:9-10, 17-19). The form of man is the form of God, for man was created after the likeness of God.]</p>
<h2 class="head4">a. To Have Man to Express God</h2>
<p>The main purpose of God&rsquo;s creation of man, a corporate man, is to express God (Gen. 1:26-27). [God did not create many men. God created mankind collectively in one person, Adam.] [Therefore, in Genesis 1:26 God said, &ldquo;Let them&rdquo;&mdash;one man, but the pronoun is them. This proves that this man is a corporate man.] [God created such a corporate man in His own image and after His likeness so that man might express God Himself.]</p>
<h2 class="head4">b. To Have Man to Exercise God&rsquo;s Dominion</h2>
<p>[God said, &ldquo;Let us make man in our image, after our likeness; and let them have dominion.&rdquo; God created a corporate man to exercise His dominion (Gen. 1:26-28). The word dominion includes more than just authority. Dominion means having a kingdom as a sphere in which to exercise authority.] This corporate man is to use God&rsquo;s authority to deal with His enemy, to recover the earth by conquering it, and to bring in the kingdom of God to the earth (Gen. 1:26-28; 3:1; Rev. 12:9).</p>
<h2 class="head3">2. God Placing Man in Front of the Tree of Life<br />
in Order for Man to Receive Him as Life</h2>
<p>[After God created man, He did not put the divine life into man. Instead, He gave man a free will; He wanted man to exercise the free will to choose, to take in His life. Therefore, He placed man in front of the tree of life.</p>
<p>In order to give man an opportunity to choose, God put the tree of knowledge of good and evil beside the tree of life. The tree of life denotes God as the source of life; the tree of the knowledge of good and evil signifies Satan as the source of death. These two trees signify the two sources in the universe.] Because God is great, He allowed man to choose. [It was according to such a principle that, in the garden of Eden, God put Adam in front of two trees; He wanted man to choose Him, to take Him as life.]</p><h2 class="head2">B. The Fall of Man</h2>
<p>[After God made man, He placed man in front of the tree of life, that man might contact the tree of life and receive His life which is the uncreated life. But before man could contact the tree of life and join with God in life, Satan took the opportunity to come first. He tempted man to contact the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, and caused man to have an illegal union with him. This became the first step of man&rsquo;s fall.</p>
<p>According to the record in Genesis 3 through 11, mankind had four steps of the fall. The first step is the fall of Adam, which is recorded in chapter three; the second is the fall of Cain, recorded in chapter four; the third is the fall of the crooked and perverse generation before the deluge, recorded in chapter six; and the fourth is the fall of the whole human race rising up collectively to rebel against God, which is recorded in chapter eleven. These four steps of the fall continued one after another. In these four steps, Satan&rsquo;s subtlety was exposed to the uttermost.]</p>
<h2 class="head3">1. The First Step of the Fall</h2>
<h2 class="head4">a. The Cause</h2>
<h2 class="head5">1) The Serpent&rsquo;s Temptation</h2>
<p>Satan came to tempt man in the form of a serpent. He was crafty; he came in stealthily. [God clearly commanded man, saying, &ldquo;But of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, thou shalt not eat of it: for in the day that thou eatest thereof thou shalt surely die&rdquo; (Gen. 2:17). But Satan said to the woman, &ldquo;Hath God said?&rdquo; Again, he said, &ldquo;Ye shall not surely die.&rdquo;] Satan caused man to doubt God&rsquo;s word and His heart. However, the Bible tells us that heaven and earth shall pass away, but the Lord&rsquo;s words shall by no means pass away (Luke 21:33). The Bible also tells us that God loves man to the uttermost (John 13:1). We should never doubt God&rsquo;s word and His heart toward us.</p>
<h2 class="head5">2) The Woman&rsquo;s Assuming the Headship</h2>
<p>[Another cause of man&rsquo;s fall was the woman&rsquo;s assuming the headship (Gen. 3:2-3, 6). Originally, God created only one man. There was only one head, not two. Adam was the head; Eve was not. Eve was built out of the rib from Adam&rsquo;s side (Gen. 2:22). Eve&rsquo;s head was Adam. The reason Eve was tempted by the serpent was that she assumed the headship, made the decision on her own, and fell into Satan&rsquo;s snare. Even before she ate the fruit of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, she was already ensnared by the evil one. She passed over the man and assumed the headship to deal with the situation. This resulted in her being deceived. Thus, the Bible says that Adam was not deceived, but the woman being quite deceived was in transgression (1 Tim. 2:14).</p>
<p>Here we see a great principle. In the universe the unique Head is God Himself. Whenever we assume the headship in dealing with any situation, denying the headship of God and of Christ, we will surely be deceived.]</p>
<p>The best way to resist temptation is to call on the Lord Jesus, who is our Head, and pray-read His word whenever temptation comes. The Lord will defeat Satan and drive him away from us. We need to turn to Him all the time.</p>
<h2 class="head4">b. The Process</h2>
<p>[The first step in the process of the fall was man&rsquo;s failure to use his spirit. After man was created, he ought to have always used his spirit to contact God and live before Him. When man lives according to the spirit, he is preserved by God. But whenever man does not use his spirit to contact God, he bypasses God and puts God aside; consequently, he falls into the hand of the evil one.</p>
<p>The second step was the exercising of the soul (Gen. 3:2, 3, 6). When Eve spoke to the serpent, she firstly reasoned in her mind. Then she was tempted in her emotion and desired the fruit of the tree of knowledge. Eventually, she decided in her will to take the fruit and eat it.</p>
<p>The third step was the action of the body. When the soul is exercised, the body will naturally follow. The soul directs the body. When she was tempted this way, surely she would take and eat. Her taking the fruit to eat was the action of the body. First, the eye sees. Second, the hand takes. Third, the mouth eats.</p>
<p>In our daily living, we should use our spirit first, and then let our spirit direct our soul, which, in turn, directs our body. If we do not use our spirit but use our soul instead, we assume the headship and our soul takes the lead. Once the soul takes the lead, it will direct the body to do things that offend God.]</p><h2 class="head4">c. The Result</h2>
<p>[The first result of the fall was that the soul was polluted, corrupted, and occupied. Even before Eve partook of the tree of knowledge, her mind had been polluted already. While she was talking to the serpent, the serpent&rsquo;s concept penetrated her mind and defiled it. Hence, her mind was corrupted. Eventually, her mind was fully occupied by the evil one after she ate the fruit of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil.</p>
<p>The second result was that the body was changed in nature, having the element of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, the element of Satan, added to it, making it the flesh (Gen. 3:7). The human body originally created by God was pure. However, it now contains the evil element of Satan. This evil element is the indwelling sin which makes its home in man&rsquo;s flesh. In Romans 7:17 Paul says, &ldquo;So now it is no longer I that do it, but sin that dwells in me.&rdquo; This evil substance, the nature of sin, has contaminated our body, making it flesh, full of evil and lust.</p>
<p>The third result was that man&rsquo;s spirit was deadened, becoming insulated from God and losing its function toward God. Ephesians 2:5 tells us that before we were saved we were dead. We were not dead in our body or in our soul, but in our spirit. To be dead is to be without function or sensation. When man&rsquo;s spirit was deadened, man no longer possessed the ability to contact God and fellowship with Him.</p>
<p>The fourth result was that the fallen man was constituted a sinner (Rom. 5:19). Due to man&rsquo;s fall, a certain element has been injected into man, an element which the Bible calls sin. Romans 5:12 says, &ldquo;As through one man sin entered into the world.&rdquo; Thus, we all have been constituted sinners. Sin has already entered into us and become our subjective element within. Hence, we are not sinners because we sin; we sin because we have been constituted sinners.</p>
<p>The fifth result was that the fallen man was condemned (Rom. 5:18). We were all in Adam. The condemnation includes not only Adam but also the entire human race. The entire human race was condemned in Adam.</p>
<p>The sixth result was that the curse was brought in (Gen. 3:17-19). Because of one man&rsquo;s sin, all of creation is subjected to vanity, groaning and travailing under the slavery of corruption (Rom. 8:20). The earth was cursed and it brought forth thorns and thistles. Furthermore, by the sweat of his face man will eat bread throughout his lifetime. These are the items of the curse brought in through man&rsquo;s fall.</p>
<p>The seventh result was that man was cast out of paradise (Gen. 3:23-24). Paradise was the realm of life which included the tree of life and the sphere in which man may receive life. Thus, to be cast out of paradise means to be driven away from the sphere of life.</p>
<p>The eighth result was death (Gen. 3:19; Rom. 5:12). First, man&rsquo;s spirit was deadened, and eventually his body will die. Through Adam&rsquo;s transgression sin entered into the world and death through sin. Death reigns over all men (Rom. 5:14). Thus, in Adam all die (1 Cor. 15:22).]</p>
<h2 class="head3">2. The Second Step of the Fall</h2>
<p>The Devil caused man to fall further. Abel offered according to God&rsquo;s way, but Cain presented an offering to God according to his own concept, thus departing from God&rsquo;s way and creating his own religion. Cain became angry after God had no respect for his offering and, in his anger, killed Abel. Afterwards, he lied to God and became arrogant toward God. Apparently it was Cain who rejected God&rsquo;s glad tidings; actually it was Satan who kept him from God&rsquo;s way of salvation and caused him to fall further (Gen. 4:3-9).</p>
<p>[As a result of the second step of the fall, God pronounced a greater curse: man would till the ground, but the ground would not yield to him her strength. Furthermore, he will become a vagabond wandering on the earth, and he was cast out of the presence of God, unable to see God&rsquo;s face (Gen. 4:11b-12, 14).</p>
<p>Eventually, Cain and his descendants invented a culture without God. This culture included building a city for self-existence, inventing cattle-raising for making a living, inventing music for amusement, and inventing weapons for defense (Gen. 4:17, 20-22). The further man drifts away from God, the less he has His presence. Having lost God, man was forced to invent a godless culture. This is the result of the fall of man.]</p>
<h2 class="head3">3. The Third Step of the Fall</h2>
<p>[In the first step of the fall, the enemy of God was outside of man. In the second step of the fall, this enemy was inside of man. Now, the enemy took another step, causing man to fall even further.]</p>
<p>Genesis 6 tells us that the sons of God, the fallen angels, married the daughters of men. This illegal marriage produced the flesh. [In Job 1:6 and 2:1 we are told that the angels are called the sons of God. Also, the Syriac Version of the Old Testament renders &ldquo;the sons of God&rdquo; as &ldquo;the angels&rdquo; in Genesis 6. The angels that married the daughters of men were those who did not keep their principality, as recorded in Jude 6 and 7. Some of the fallen angels under Satan came down to the earth and took human bodies. They formed illegal marriages with the daughters of men. They committed fornication through the bodies of men, so that the human race was no longer pure but became a mixture of human nature with the fallen spirits. Hence, God decided to send the flood to exterminate the human race.]</p>
<p>This fall resulted in the withdrawal of the Holy Spirit from man (Gen. 6:3) and the total destruction of all flesh except Noah and his family (Gen. 7:21).</p>
<h2 class="head3">4. The Fourth Step of the Fall</h2>
<p>The fourth step of the fall of man instigated by Satan was the open rebellion against God and His authority collectively. First, man conspired to rebel against God (Gen. 11:3-4). Second, man made bricks with earth by human labor. [According to the whole revelation of the Bible, God&rsquo;s building has never been with any kind of bricks. God&rsquo;s building is with stones. Man built the tower of Babel with bricks instead of stones. This means that man uses the misused earth plus human labor to replace God&rsquo;s work.] Third, man built a city to have a man-made, godless life. Fourth, man built a tower to declare the renouncing of God, rejecting God and His authority. Finally, man made a name to deny God&rsquo;s name, thereby denying God Himself. This rebellion resulted in God scattering man and confounding his language; thus, confusion was brought in to alienate man one from another.</p>
<p>[When man reached the fourth step of the fall, he had fallen to the uttermost, so that even God could not do anything to recover the fallen race.] Although these four steps of the fall took place in Genesis, their effect remained throughout the Bible and is still with man today. As a result, man is completely useless to God, unable to fulfill the purpose for which he was created. Man does not have God&rsquo;s life to express Him; thus, man does not have God&rsquo;s authority to represent Him. Rather, man came under Satan&rsquo;s control. This is the condition of man. But God still loves man and wants to save man out of this pitiful condition.</p><h2 class="head1">II. SALVATION</h2>
<p>[In His eternal plan, God planned to create all things and to have man to fulfill His eternal purpose. Furthermore, according to His foreknowledge and foresight, that is, according to His foreknowledge of man&rsquo;s fall, He planned to redeem man after the fall. God&rsquo;s redemption was neither an addition to His original plan, nor an afterthought to remedy the problem, but was planned and prepared from the beginning. In God&rsquo;s eternal plan, He foreordained that after man&rsquo;s fall, Christ would accomplish redemption. Therefore, in God&rsquo;s view, Christ was slain from the foundation of the world (Rev. 13:8).]</p>
<h2 class="head2">A. God&rsquo;s Promise</h2>
<p>[Redemption was planned beforehand and foreordained by God. Hence, before redemption came, in the Old Testament God promised it many times, clearly foretelling the different aspects of His redemption.]</p>
<h2 class="head3">1. The Seed of the Woman</h2>
<p>[After man sinned and fell, God came in immediately to promise man that the seed of the woman would come. When He would come, He would bruise Satan&rsquo;s head (Gen. 3:15). To bruise his head is to cause his death.</p>
<p>The seed of the woman is the Lord Jesus. Among the entire human race, only He was come of a woman (Gal. 4:4). He came to earth to undo the works of the Devil (1 John 3:8), that through death He might destroy the Devil (Heb. 2:14).</p>
<p>Therefore, at the time of man&rsquo;s fall, God promised that Christ would come of a woman to destroy Satan, the one who deceived and damaged man.]</p>
<h2 class="head3">2. The Seed of Abraham</h2>
<p>[Christ is not only the seed of the woman, but also the seed of Abraham (Gen. 13:15; 17:8; Gal. 3:16), as typified by Isaac. First, He brings blessings to the nations. Whether Jews or Gentiles, all will be blessed in Him (Gen. 22:18a). The blessing is the Spirit. Through faith in Christ, we have received the Spirit (Gal. 3:14). Second, He was offered to God, put to death, and resurrected (cf. Gen. 22:1-12; Heb. 11:17, 19). Third, He will gain the bride (cf. Gen. 24:67). This portrays Christ, as the One promised by God, bringing blessings to the nations, being offered even unto death, and being resurrected. After resurrection, He gains those whom He redeemed to be His bride (John 3:29; Rev. 19:7).]</p>
<h2 class="head2">B. Salvation Being in Three Stages</h2>
<h2 class="head3">1. The Initial Stage</h2>
<p>[The full salvation of the Triune God comprises many items in three stages. The first stage, the initial stage, is the stage of regeneration. This stage is composed of redemption, sanctification (positional&mdash;1 Pet. 1:2; 1 Cor. 6:11), justification, reconciliation, and regeneration. In this stage, God has justified us through the redemption of Christ (Rom. 3:24-26) and regenerated us in our spirit with His life by His Spirit (John 3:3-6). Thus, we have received God&rsquo;s eternal salvation (Heb. 5:9) and His eternal life (John 3:15), and become His children (John 1:12-13), who shall not perish forever (John 10:28-29). This initial salvation has saved us from God&rsquo;s condemnation and from eternal perdition (John 3:18, 16).]</p>
<h2 class="head3">2. The Progressing Stage</h2>
<p>[The second stage of salvation, the progressing stage, is the stage of transformation. This stage is composed of freedom from sin, sanctification (mainly dispositional&mdash;Rom. 6:19, 22), growth in life, transformation, building up, and maturing. In this stage, God is freeing us from the dominion of indwelling sin&mdash;the law of sin and death&mdash;by the law of the Spirit of life, through the effectiveness of the death of Christ working subjectively in us (Rom. 6:6-7; 7:16-20; 8:2). He is sanctifying us by His Holy Spirit (Rom. 15:16), with His holy nature, through His discipline (Heb. 12:10) and His judgment in His own house (1 Pet. 4:17). He is causing us to grow in His life (1 Cor. 3:6-7) and transforming us by renewing the inward parts of our soul by the life-giving Spirit (2 Cor. 3:6, 17-18; Rom. 12:2; Eph. 4:23) through the working of all things (Rom. 8:28). He is building us together into a spiritual house for His dwelling (1 Pet. 2:5; Eph. 2:22) and maturing us in His life (Rev. 14:15) for the completion of His full salvation. Thus, we are being delivered from the power of sin, the world, the flesh, the self, the soul (the natural life), and individualism into maturity in the divine life for the fulfilling of God&rsquo;s eternal purpose.]</p>
<h2 class="head3">3. The Completing Stage</h2>
<p>[The third stage, the completing stage, is the stage of consummation. This stage is composed of the redemption (transfiguration) of our body, conformity to the Lord, glorification, inheritance of God&rsquo;s kingdom, participation in Christ&rsquo;s kingship, and the topmost enjoyment of the Lord. In this stage, God will redeem our fallen and corrupted body (Rom. 8:23) by transfiguring it into the body of Christ&rsquo;s glory (Phil. 3:21). He will conform us to the glorious image of His firstborn Son (Rom. 8:29), making us wholly and absolutely like Him in our regenerated spirit, transformed soul, and transfigured body. He will glorify us (Rom. 8:30), immersing us in His glory (Heb. 2:10) that we may enter into His heavenly kingdom (2 Tim. 4:18; 2 Pet. 1:11), into which He has called us (1 Thes. 2:12). He will cause us to inherit His kingdom as the topmost portion of His blessing (James 2:5; Gal. 5:21), even to reign with Christ, to be His co-kings, participating in His kingship over the nations (2 Tim. 2:12; Rev. 20:4, 6; 2:26-27; 12:5), and sharing His royal, kingly joy in His divine government (Matt. 25:21, 23). Thus, our body will be freed from the slavery of corruption of the old creation into the freedom of the glory of God&rsquo;s new creation (Rom. 8:21), and our soul will be delivered out of the realm of trials and sufferings (1 Pet. 1:6; 4:12; 3:14; 5:9) into a new realm, full of glory (1 Pet. 4:13; 5:10), sharing and enjoying all the Triune God is, has, and has accomplished, attained, and obtained. This is the salvation, the salvation of our souls, which is ready to be revealed to us at the last time, the grace to be brought to us at the unveiling of Christ in glory (1 Pet. 1:13; Matt. 16:27; 25:31). This is the end of our faith. The power of God is able to guard us unto this that we may obtain it (1 Pet. 1:9). We should eagerly expect such a marvelous salvation (Rom. 8:23) and prepare ourselves for its splendid revelation (Rom. 8:19).]</p><h2 class="head1">III. ETERNAL LIFE</h2>
<h2 class="head2">A. The Definition of Eternal Life</h2>
<p>[Many Christians hold the concept that eternal life is a blessing given to the believers, in which they merely go to a heavenly mansion to enjoy a better life. When I was in Christianity, no one told me that eternal life is not a blessing, but that it is simply life. In our physical body we have a biological life (<em>bios</em>), and in our soul we have a psychological life (<em>psuche</em>). We had these two kinds of life before we were saved. But when we were saved, we received another life, the eternal life (<em>zoe</em>).</p>
<p>The eternal life is the life that is not only everlasting but eternal both in time and in nature (John 3:16, 36; 1 John 1:2). This life is unlimited both in time and in nature; hence, it is eternal.</p>
<p>The eternal life is the uncreated life of God (Eph. 4:18), the indestructible life (Heb. 7:16), and the incorruptible life (2 Tim. 1:10). Concerning the definition of the eternal life, I received much help through the writings of Watchman Nee, Mary McDonough, Ruth Paxson, and T. Austin-Sparks. Through their writings I came to know that to be regenerated is simply to receive God into us as our life, to receive a life that is divine, a life other than our human life.</p>
 <p>The eternal life is the life that is in the Son of God and that is the Son of God (1 John 5:11-12; 1:2; John 14:6). This life is not only in the Son of God, but it is the Son of God Himself.</p>
<p>The eternal life is the life with which the believers are regenerated and which becomes the believers&rsquo; life (Col. 3:4a), making the believers the children of God (John 1:12-13) and the members of Christ (Eph. 5:30).]</p>
<h2 class="head2">B. Laying Hold of Eternal Life</h2>
<p>[In 1 Timothy 6:12 the apostle Paul charged us to lay hold on this eternal life.</p>
<p>The New Testament teaches us that the eternal life has three stages, and these three stages are in three ages&mdash;the present age, the church age; the coming age, the kingdom age; and the eternal age, in the new heaven and the new earth with the New Jerusalem as the center. In the first age, the church age, we receive the eternal life. Thus, it becomes our life, and we enjoy this life and live by it. In the church age it is a matter of receiving the eternal life, but in the next age, the age of the kingdom, the eternal life is not for people to receive, but for people to enter into. In Matthew 25:46, those among the nations who are judged by the Lord Jesus to be &ldquo;sheep&rdquo; will enter into eternal life in the kingdom age. Thus, in the coming age the eternal life will become a sphere for people to enter into. In that age the eternal life will be given as a reward. In this age the eternal life is for us to receive as a free gift (Rom. 6:23b), but in the coming age the eternal life will be for us to enter into, not as a free gift but as a reward. This reward will be given to both the overcoming believers and to the &ldquo;sheep&rdquo; in Matthew 25 who paid a price to take care of Christ&rsquo;s brothers during the great tribulation. Then, in the eternal age, that is, in the new heaven and the new earth with the New Jerusalem as the center, the eternal life will eventually be the consummated gift for all God&rsquo;s redeemed people to manifest the Triune God for eternity.]</p>
<p>[It is by this eternal life and in this eternal life that the believers have been brought forth. The eternal life is crucial for the producing of the believers and for the building up of the organic Body of Christ.]</p>
<h2 class="head1">IV. THE BELIEVERS</h2>
<h2 class="head2">A. The Baptism of the Believers</h2>
<p>[The believers are tripartite beings of spirit, soul, and body (1 Thes. 5:23). The believers are redeemed, justified, and reconciled to God in Christ (Rom. 3:24; 5:10a). We have not only been saved; we have been redeemed, justified, and reconciled to God in Christ. The believers have been baptized into the Triune God to have an organic union with the processed Triune God (Matt. 28:19). In his Word Studies in the New Testament, M. R. Vincent, writing on Matthew 28:19, said, &ldquo;Baptizing into the name of the Holy Trinity implies a spiritual and mystical union with Him.&rdquo; Such a thought, such a revelation, has been lost in Christianity. Baptism is to baptize us into the Triune God that we may have an organic union with the processed Triune God.]</p>
<h2 class="head2">B. The Regeneration of the Believers</h2>
<p>[The believers are regenerated in their spirit by the Spirit (John 3:5-6) with the divine life, which is Christ (Col. 3:4a), to be the children of God (John 1:12-13), having the divine nature (2 Pet. 1:4b), and to be the members of Christ (Rom. 12:5) in the union of the divine life. Regeneration takes place in our spirit. It is carried out by the Spirit with the divine life, and it makes us, first, the children of God, and then, the members of Christ.] The believers have been crucified with Christ, being terminated in their old man (Gal. 2:20; Rom. 6:6). [The believers have Christ living in them as the pneumatic Christ, the Spirit, indwelling them (Rom. 8:11).]</p><h2 class="head2">C. The Growth of the Believers</h2>
<p>[The believers have been sanctified positionally by the blood of Christ (Heb. 13:12) and are being sanctified dispositionally by the Spirit (Rom. 15:16; 6:19, 22), that they may be renewed, transformed in their soul (Rom. 12:2a; 2 Cor. 3:18), conformed to the image of the firstborn Son of God (Rom. 8:29), and glorified (redeemed) in their body (Rom. 8:23) in the glory of the processed Triune God (Rom. 8:30, 17-18). Although the believers have been regenerated in their spirit, their soul and body remain old. Thus, the believers need to be renewed, transformed in their soul, conformed to the image of the firstborn Son of God, and glorified in their body in the glory of the processed Triune God. The believers are tripartite beings composed of spirit, soul, and body. First, their spirit is regenerated, then their soul is transformed, and finally, their body will be glorified. Thus the believers&rsquo; whole being will be saturated with God&rsquo;s splendid life. God&rsquo;s life is a life of splendor, and that splendor is the glory of the divine life. When we are permeated, saturated, and soaked with the splendor of the divine life, we will be in glory. The believers are saturated with the dispensing of the divine Trinity in their tripartite being (Rom. 8:5-11), so that they are mingled with the processed Triune God. The believers are joined to the Lord as one spirit (1 Cor. 6:17).]</p>
<h2 class="head2">D. The Function of the Believers</h2>
<p>[The believers are the branches of Christ as the vine tree, the organism of the Triune God, to express the processed Triune God in bearing fruit for the increase of Christ (John 15:1-5, 8, 16). As the branches of Christ, the believers should live a fruit-bearing life for Christ&rsquo;s increase. The believers are God&rsquo;s New Testament priests of His gospel to offer the saved sinners as sacrifices to God (Rom. 15:16; 1 Pet. 2:5, 9). As the priests of God, the believers should have a sinner-saving service for offering sacrifices to God.]</p>

<h2 class="head1">I. THE CHURCH</h2>
<p>[The church is the goal God wants to obtain in His eternal economy. Each one of us who is saved participates in this goal, that God may obtain His heart&rsquo;s desire according to His good pleasure. Therefore, we must also know the church.]</p>
<h2 class="head2">A. What the Church is</h2>
<h2 class="head3">1. The Called Out Assembly</h2>
<p>The Lord Jesus Christ said that He will build His church (Matt. 16:18). [The church is what Christ will build through His death, resurrection, and ascension. The term &ldquo;church&rdquo; is <em>ekklesia</em> in Greek, which means the called out assembly. Thus, according to its literal meaning, the church is the congregation called out from the world by God. It is not a church building or any edifice for the worship of God.]</p>
<h2 class="head3">2. The Body of Christ</h2>
<p>The apostle Paul said, &ldquo;The church, which is His Body, the fullness of the One who fills all in all&rdquo; (Eph. 1:22-23). [The church is the Body with Christ as the Head; it is constituted for Christ in His life and Spirit with all those who have believed into Him. It is a living organism and not a lifeless organization like the clubs and associations in society.</p>
<p>The body of a man is the fullness of a man to be his expression. Likewise, the church is the fullness of Christ to be His expression. Since Christ is the One who is unlimited and extensive, and who fills all in all, He needs a great Body to be the fullness of Himself who fills all in all to express Him in all things.]</p>
<h2 class="head3">3. The Counterpart of Christ</h2>
<p>Ephesians 5:25 says, &ldquo;Husbands, love your wives even as Christ also loved the church and gave Himself up for her.&rdquo; [This word reveals that the church is also Christ&rsquo;s counterpart. As the Body of Christ, the church receives life from Him for His expression; this is a matter of life. As the counterpart of Christ, the church receives His love for the satisfaction of His heart&rsquo;s desire; this is a matter of love.]</p>
<h2 class="head3">4. The House of God</h2>
<p>The Bible also tells us, &ldquo;That you may know how one ought to conduct himself in the house of God, which is the church of the living God, the pillar and base of the truth&rdquo; (1 Tim. 3:15). [To Christ, the church is His Body and His counterpart, while to God, the church is His house. On the one hand, this house refers to God&rsquo;s dwelling place, and on the other hand, it refers to God&rsquo;s family, God&rsquo;s household. These two, God&rsquo;s household and God&rsquo;s dwelling place, are just one. God&rsquo;s household is the very house for God&rsquo;s dwelling (Eph. 2:19, 22). A person&rsquo;s house is his place of living, residing, and rest. The church, being God&rsquo;s house, is also such a place to God. Today, the living God is living, residing, and resting in the church on the earth.</p>
<p>God is living, and the church as His house is also living, having the life of God, living, residing, and resting with God. Thus, the living house of God is the pillar and base of all His reality, which is the reality (truth) of the universe. Everything of this living God is the reality in the universe. Without Him, the universe is vain and empty; yet all His reality is being supported and upheld by the church, which is His living house.]</p>
<h2 class="head3">5. The New Man</h2>
<p>Colossians 3:10-11 says, &ldquo;And having put on the new man, which is being renewed unto full knowledge according to the image of Him who created him; where there cannot be Greek and Jew, circumcision and uncircumcision, barbarian, Scythian, slave, freeman, but Christ is all and in all.&rdquo; [Just as all of mankind is a corporate old man created in Adam, the church is also a corporate new man. Christ, having abolished on the cross all the ordinances which caused discord among men, created this new man in Himself (Eph. 2:14-15). This new man bears the image of its Creator, Christ, who is its life and its content. In this new man, there are no persons of the old creation belonging to any race, religion, culture, or class. Only Christ is all the constituents of this new man and is in all its constituents. The church as the Body of Christ takes Christ as its life for His expression; the church as the new man takes Christ as its person for the fulfillment of God&rsquo;s will.]</p>
<h2 class="head2">B. The Constituents of the Church</h2>
<p>&ldquo;The church of God...those who have been sanctified in Christ Jesus, called saints&rdquo; (1 Cor. 1:2). [The church is constituted with all those who have believed into Christ and who possess His life. Any person who has not believed into Christ and has not been saved cannot become a constituent of the church. Without being saved, even our closest relatives are not constituents of the church. Only after they are saved and have the Lord&rsquo;s life to become saints are they constituents of the church.]</p><h2 class="head2">C. The Two Aspects of the Church</h2>
<h2 class="head3">1. The Universal Aspect</h2>
<p>&ldquo;On this rock I [Christ] will build My church&rdquo; (Matt. 16:18). [The church mentioned by the Lord in this verse is in the universal aspect. It is unique, including all who have believed into Him in the universe through all the ages and in every place.]</p>
<h2 class="head3">2. The Local Aspect</h2>
<p>&ldquo;If he refuses to hear them, tell it to the church&rdquo; (Matt. 18:17). [The church mentioned by the Lord in this verse is in the local aspect. It is numerous and its local believers can speak to it. According to the local aspect, the church appears in every locality. Each local church includes only those who have believed into Christ in that place.]</p>
<h2 class="head2">D. The Designation of the Church</h2>
<h2 class="head3">1. It Has No Special Name</h2>
<p>[The church is unique and has no need of special names. The church is the church; there should not be kinds of churches that are denominated according to their kind, such as the Presbyterian church, the Lutheran church, and the Baptist church. To denominate the church in this way is needless and not according to the biblical revelation.]</p>
<h2 class="head3">2. It May Be Designated<br />
by the Name of Its Locality</h2>
<p>[Although the church is unique in the universe, it is numerous in its local manifestation. The many local churches do not differ in nature; their difference is only in the different places where they are. Therefore, we may use the name of the locality in which a local church is to designate that church, such as the church in Jerusalem (Acts 8:1), the church in Antioch (Acts 13:1), and the seven local churches in the province of Asia (Rev. 1:4, 11).]</p>
<h2 class="head1">II. THE KINGDOM</h2>
<h2 class="head2">A. The Divine Image and the Divine Authority</h2>
<p>[Genesis 1 says that God created man in His own image and that He gave man the authority to rule all the created things (v. 26). In the creation of man the two vital things are the divine image and the divine authority. If we are to have the full image of God to express God and to realize the full authority to represent God, to subdue His enemy, to subdue this earth, God Himself must be our life.] [The divine life to be received by man is for two things: to express God on the positive side and to deal with God&rsquo;s enemy on the negative side. To express God, man needs the image of God. To deal with the enemy of God, man needs the authority of God. The divine authority, which is something of the kingdom, is revealed throughout the entire Scriptures.]</p>
<h2 class="head2">B. The Kingdom and the Chosen Race</h2>
<p>[After man became fallen, God chose the race of Abraham. The first race, the race of Adam, failed God. But after the great flood, God began again with a second race of mankind, the race of Noah. This second race also failed God. Then God chose the third race, the race of Abraham, after the time of Babel. The purpose of God&rsquo;s choosing of Abraham is revealed in Genesis 12:1-2. These two verses tell us that God chose Abraham with the intention of having a kingdom. The Lord told Abraham that He would make of him &ldquo;a great nation&rdquo; (v. 2). This great nation is a kingdom. The kingdom is a sphere, a realm, to exercise authority. Without the kingdom God can never exercise His authority. For God to accomplish His purpose, He must have a realm, a sphere, as a kingdom for Him to exercise His authority. This is why the Lord Jesus mentioned the kingdom when He taught the disciples to pray in Matthew 6. At the beginning of the Lord&rsquo;s prayer and at the end of it the kingdom is mentioned. The beginning of the Lord&rsquo;s prayer says, &ldquo;Let Your kingdom come&rdquo; (v. 10). The end of this prayer says, &ldquo;For Yours is the kingdom, and the power, and the glory forever. Amen&rdquo; (v. 13).]</p><h2 class="head2">C. The Kingdom in the New Testament</h2>
<p>[In the New Testament the first preacher was John the Baptist. The first word preached by him was &ldquo;Repent, for the kingdom of the heavens has drawn near&rdquo; (Matt. 3:2). When the Lord Jesus began to preach the gospel He said the same thing as John the Baptist: &ldquo;Repent, for the kingdom of the heavens has drawn near&rdquo; (Matt. 4:17). When the Lord sent the disciples to preach the gospel He charged them to say, &ldquo;The kingdom of the heavens has drawn near&rdquo; (Matt. 10:7). The book of Revelation tells us that at the Lord&rsquo;s coming back after His judgment upon the nations, the kingdom of the world will become the kingdom of Christ (11:15). Eventually, in the millennium the Lord will rule as a king with all His victorious saints (Rev. 20:4, 6). Revelation shows that in the accomplishment of His eternal purpose God eventually will have a kingdom in which He can exercise His authority to the fullest extent. The Scriptures clearly reveal this line of the kingdom of God in which or through which God can exercise His authority to accomplish His eternal purpose.]</p>
<h2 class="head2">D. The Kingdom of God</h2>
<p>[A kingdom is not a simple matter. For example, the United States as a nation, a kingdom, is not a simple matter. The kingdom of God includes many things that need to be understood. In the Old Testament there is the kingdom of Israel. In the New Testament there is the kingdom of the heavens. Then after the church age there will be a period of a thousand years known as the millennium. The millennium is a kingdom of a thousand years (Rev. 20:4, 6). If we read the Scriptures carefully, we will see that even in the millennium there are some further divisions. The kingdom of Israel in the Old Testament, the kingdom of the heavens in the New Testament, and the millennial kingdom after the church age are parts of the kingdom of God. The kingdom of God runs from eternity to eternity. It is a realm, a sphere, in which God can rule and exercise His authority. From eternity past to eternity future there is such a thing called the kingdom of God. In this kingdom, God exercises His authority to rule over all things.]</p>
<h2 class="head2">E. The Kingdom Not Being Suspended</h2>
<p>[Some Bible teachers claim that when the Lord Jesus came, He came with the kingdom and presented it to the Jewish people. When the Jewish people rejected Him, He received back the kingdom and the kingdom was suspended. According to these Bible teachers, the church age is not the time of the kingdom because the kingdom has been suspended. When the Lord comes back He will also bring back the kingdom. Even Dr. C. I. Scofield taught in such a way, but the Bible reveals that the kingdom of God has never been suspended. In Matthew 21:43 the Lord said clearly that the kingdom of God would be taken from the Jewish people and given to another people, that is, to the church. This indicates that the kingdom of God has never been suspended. Then after the Lord&rsquo;s resurrection and before His ascension to the heavens, He stayed with the disciples for forty days. In those forty days the Lord spoke concerning the things of the kingdom of God: &ldquo;To whom also He presented Himself alive after His suffering by many convincing proofs, through a period of forty days, appearing to them and speaking the things concerning the kingdom of God&rdquo; (Acts 1:3). This again indicates that the Lord has never suspended the kingdom of God. Acts 8:12 says, &ldquo;They believed Philip, bringing the good news concerning the kingdom of God.&rdquo; When the apostles preached the gospel, they preached the kingdom of God. The kingdom has never been suspended. The kingdom of God was preached by the apostles even after the ascension of the Lord and after Pentecost. Acts 14:22 says, &ldquo;Establishing the souls of the disciples, entreating them to continue in the faith, and saying that through many tribulations we must enter into the kingdom of God.&rdquo; Some Bible teachers say that the kingdom of God is merely a matter for the Jewish people, but here the apostles were exhorting the Gentile churches to continue in the faith so that they could enter into the kingdom of God. Romans 14:17 is another verse which shows us that the kingdom of God has not been suspended: &ldquo;For the kingdom of God is not eating and drinking, but righteousness and peace and joy in the Holy Spirit.&rdquo; With the period of the Holy Spirit, there is still the kingdom of God. Also, the context of this verse is dealing with the church life in the present age. Other verses which show us that the kingdom of God has not been suspended are 1 Corinthians 6:9-10, 1 Corinthians 15:50, Galatians 5:21, Ephesians 5:5, 2 Thessalonians 1:5, Revelation 11:15, 12:10, and 2 Timothy 4:18 which says, &ldquo;The Lord will deliver me from every evil work, and will save me unto His heavenly kingdom, to whom be the glory forever and ever. Amen.&rdquo; Near the end of Paul&rsquo;s journey as a Christian, as a servant of the Lord, he said that the Lord would save him unto His heavenly kingdom.]</p>
<h2 class="head2">F. The Three Aspects of the Kingdom of the Heavens</h2>
<p>[With the kingdom of the heavens there are three aspects: the external appearance of the kingdom of the heavens (Matt. 13), the reality of the kingdom of the heavens (Matt. 5&mdash;7), and the manifestation of the kingdom of the heavens (Matt. 24&mdash;25). If we are going to understand the kingdom of the heavens we must know these three aspects. On the day of Pentecost, the appearance of the kingdom of the heavens and the reality of the kingdom of the heavens began. The manifestation of the kingdom of the heavens begins with the coming back of the Lord Jesus. When the Lord comes back, the kingdom of the heavens will be manifested. On the one hand, we can say that the kingdom has started already, but this is just the appearance and the reality, not the manifestation of the kingdom of the heavens. The appearance of the kingdom of the heavens includes all of the false Christians, but only the victorious, overcoming Christians are in the reality of the kingdom of the heavens. When the Lord Jesus comes back, that will be the time of the manifestation of the kingdom of the heavens.]</p>
<p>We should exercise to be in the reality of the kingdom every day throughout the day so that we will be the ones to bring in the manifestation of the kingdom. The simple way to accomplish this is to get revived every morning by calling on His name and contacting Him through pray-reading two or three verses. We can overcome by pray-reading throughout the day. This type of exercise will prepare us for the kingdom as well as hasten the coming of the kingdom.</p><h2 class="head1">III. THE NEW JERUSALEM</h2>
<h2 class="head2">A. Not a Physical City</h2>
<p>[The New Jerusalem cannot be a physical city, as commonly believed by Christians, for the following reasons:</p>
<p>First, the New Jerusalem is the crystallized product of God&rsquo;s work in the old creation throughout the generations. If this crystallized product is merely a physical city, it would seem to be too low and would not have any spiritual value.</p>
<p>Second, the New Jerusalem is the consummation of the entire divine revelation in the Bible. If it is merely a physical city, it would make the divine revelation of mystery not so mysterious after all.</p>
<p>Third, the revelation of the entire book of Revelation is mainly made known to us by signs (Rev. 1:1) symbolizing the important persons and things, such as the golden lampstands in 1:12, signifying the churches bearing the shining testimony of Jesus Christ; the stars in 1:16, signifying the bright and shining messengers of the churches; the mysterious Babylon the Great in 17:5, signifying the religious Rome; and the bride in 19:7, signifying the overcoming saints as the spouse of Christ. Hence, the New Jerusalem also should be a sign signifying the dwelling place of God and man in eternity.]</p>
<h2 class="head2">B. The Crystallized Product and Masterpiece<br />
of God&rsquo;s Work of the New Creation<br />
throughout the Generations</h2>
<p>[After God finished the creation of all things and man, He used different ways in the different dispensations in the old heaven and old earth to carry out His work in the man of the old creation by choosing, redeeming, renewing, transforming, and glorifying them; thus, He perfects them according to His desire and builds them up to be His eternal habitation, which is the New Jerusalem of His heart&rsquo;s desire. This is the crystallized product and masterpiece of God&rsquo;s work of the new creation throughout the generations.]</p>
<h2 class="head2">C. A Composition of the Redeemed Saints throughout the Generations</h2>
<p>[The New Jerusalem is a composition of all the redeemed and perfected saints in both the Old and New Testaments throughout the generations.]</p>
<h2 class="head3">1. The Old Testament Saints</h2>
<p>[The names of the twelve tribes of the sons of Israel are inscribed on the gates of the New Jerusalem (Rev. 21:12). This indicates that the Old Testament saints are the components of the New Jerusalem. Gates as the entrance into the city indicate that the Old Testament is the child-conductor who will lead the believers to Christ (Gal. 3:24). The Old Testament history of the twelve tribes of the sons of Israel leads us into the New Jerusalem through the pearl gates, which signify Christ who has died and resurrected.]</p>
<h2 class="head3">2. The New Testament Believers</h2>
<p>[The names of the twelve apostles are on the foundations of the wall of the New Jerusalem (Rev. 21:14). This indicates that the New Testament believers are also the constituents of the New Jerusalem. All the New Testament saints who have been led into Christ are being built upon the foundation of the apostles (Eph. 2:20), that is, being built upon the revelation which the apostles received for the building of the church, to become the wall of the New Jerusalem.]</p>
<h2 class="head2">D. The Bride of the Lamb</h2>
<p>[Revelation 21:2 and 9 clearly tell us that the New Jerusalem is the bride, the wife of the Lamb. In the whole Bible God repeatedly likens His chosen people to a spouse (Isa. 54:6; Jer. 3:1; Ezek. 16:8; Hosea 2:19; 2 Cor. 11:2; Eph. 5:31-32) for His satisfaction in love. As the wife of Christ, the New Jerusalem comes out of Christ to be His spouse, just as Eve came out of Adam and became his counterpart (Gen. 2:21-24). The bride is mainly for the wedding day, while the wife is for the entire married life. The New Jerusalem will first be the bride of Christ in the millennium for one thousand years as one day (2 Pet. 3:8), and then His wife in the new heaven and new earth for eternity. The bride in the millennium will include only the overcoming saints (Rev. 3:12; 19:7-9), but the wife in the new heaven and new earth will include all the redeemed and regenerated sons of God (Rev. 21:7).]</p><h2 class="head2">E. The Consummation of the Bible</h2>
<p>[The Bible is a record and a revelation of God&rsquo;s two great works, the first being God&rsquo;s work of the old creation, and the second, God&rsquo;s work of the new creation. God&rsquo;s work of the old creation is a preparation for His work of the new creation. It is His work of the new creation that will accomplish His divine and eternal economy. The New Jerusalem is the ultimate consummation of His two great works; it is the masterpiece of His divine work and the crystallized product of His works of the old creation and the new creation. The New Jerusalem is mysterious, divine, glorious, and holy. Its revelation is the conclusion and consummation of the whole Bible, including both the Old and New Testaments.]</p>
<p>[The New Jerusalem revealed in the last two chapters of the New Testament is the conclusion of the whole Bible, as well as of the New Testament; it is also the consummation of the entire divine revelation. God&rsquo;s work in the universe is of two categories, the old creation and the new creation. The sphere of His work of the old creation was the old heaven and old earth; the sphere of His work of the new creation is the new heaven and new earth, which are the original God-created old heaven and old earth renewed through the burning of God&rsquo;s judging fire. Since the completion of the creation of the old heaven and old earth and everything therein, and since the fall of man, God has used four different dispensations&mdash;the dispensation of the Patriarchs, the dispensation of law, the dispensation of grace, and the dispensation of righteousness&mdash;to carry out the work of the new creation in man, who is of the Satan-ruined and God-judged old creation, by the Spirit and life of Himself as the Triune God who has been processed through incarnation, human living, death, resurrection, and ascension; by His heavenly ministry after His ascension; and by what He will accomplish in His second coming. God first used the dispensation of the Patriarchs to lead the created and fallen sinners to look to the coming Christ in whom all the families on earth would be blessed. Because they did not know their own weakness and wickedness, God further used the dispensation of law to expose their condition that they might be led to Christ. Following this, He uses the dispensation of grace to work the fallen sinners into Christ and to work Christ into them, thus producing the church. Finally, He will use the dispensation of righteousness to reward the perfected Old Testament saints and the overcoming New Testament believers in Christ; He will also perfect the immature New Testament believers in Christ that they may arrive at the maturity in His life. At the end of the dispensation of grace, He will use a short period of insertion to carry out His work of restoration in the remaining nations through His eternal gospel, that He may gain a group of righteous ones. His work of the new creation through the different dispensations in the old creation and His work of restoration in the short inserted period will have the following results: (1) all the redeemed people of the Old Testament and New Testament will be produced; (2) among the redeemed, a group of overcomers who are perfected and have arrived at the maturity in God&rsquo;s life will be obtained; (3) the overcomers will be constituted the New Jerusalem in the millennial kingdom and become the kings in the heavenly part of the millennium; (4) all Israel will be saved and serve as priests in the earthly part of the millennium; (5) at the end of the dispensation of grace, the remainder of the nations will be restored as the citizens in the earthly part of the millennium; (6) the redeemed but immature believers, who are unable to participate in the New Jerusalem of the millennium, will be perfected and become mature in God&rsquo;s life; (7) the nations, having been restored as the people in the millennium, will be purged and be brought into the new earth of the new heaven and new earth as God&rsquo;s people for eternity; (8) as a secondary result, all the creatures who rebel against God will be terminated and cast into the lake of fire; and (9) all the Old Testament and New Testament saints who have been redeemed and perfected and have reached the maturity in God&rsquo;s life will be constituted the New Jerusalem in the new heaven and new earth. After God completes all His work, the new heaven and new earth will be brought in, with the ultimately consummated New Jerusalem as the center. The New Jerusalem is the crystallized product and masterpiece of God&rsquo;s work in the old creation throughout the generations. It is not a physical city. Rather, it is a composition of all God&rsquo;s redeemed believers throughout the ages to be the bride of Christ and the mutual dwelling place of God and His redeemed for eternity. It is also a divine and glorious organism, a mingling of the processed Triune God in the elements of His divine Trinity&mdash;the Father&rsquo;s nature, the Son&rsquo;s life which has passed through death and resurrection, and the Spirit&rsquo;s regenerating and transforming element&mdash;with His redeemed and transformed tripartite man. The all-inclusive and unlimited Triune God, who is a constituent of such a mingling, is its temple, light, lamp, and the life saturation and supply, that it may be His full and consummated expression in eternity to express His unlimited Self from the center to the circumference fully, completely, and eternally!]</p>

<h2 class="head1">I. THE COVENANTS</h2>
<h2 class="head2">A. The Covenant Which God Made<br />
with the Created Man</h2>
<p>[In the entire Bible God made eight covenants with man: seven in the Old Testament and one in the New Testament. The first covenant which God made with man was a covenant that God made with the created man (Gen. 2:8-9, 15-17). The One who made this covenant was Jehovah God, the One who always is and the mighty One who is faithful. The one with whom the covenant was made was the created man who was without God&rsquo;s life and without sin, but who had a spirit and a free will and who was assigned to dress and guard the garden of God. God made a covenant with him that by eating he should receive the tree of life, which signifies God as the source of life, so that God might enter into him to be joined and mingled with him, thus fulfilling God&rsquo;s purpose in creating man. Furthermore, God wanted man to reject the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, which signifies Satan as the source of sin and death, lest Satan&rsquo;s evil, poisonous element should enter into man, thus damaging the upright and pure man whom God created for His eternal purpose. Eventually, man acted contrary to God&rsquo;s covenant and, having been deceived by the serpent (the Devil), ate of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, thus receiving Satan and having sin and death. Hence, man was driven out of the Garden of Eden and was kept away from the tree of life, that is, kept away by the cherubim, which signify God&rsquo;s glory, by the flame, which signifies God&rsquo;s holiness, and by the sword, which signifies God&rsquo;s righteousness. It was not until the accomplishment of Christ&rsquo;s redemption, which satisfied the requirements of God&rsquo;s glory, holiness, and righteousness, that the way to the tree of life was opened once again.]</p>
<h2 class="head2">B. The Covenant Which God Made<br />
with Fallen Man</h2>
<p>[In the Old Testament, after man&rsquo;s creation, God made the first covenant with man; after man&rsquo;s fall He came to the place of fallen man to seek and to call fallen man. It was with such a man who transgressed God&rsquo;s prohibition, who had sin and death, who had the knowledge of good and evil, and who knew his nakedness and made skirts of leaves to cover the shame, that God made the second covenant with man (Gen. 3:8-21). In this covenant God cursed the serpent, restricting it so that it would creep only on the earth and that it would eat dust during its entire life. He also promised that the seed of the woman, Christ, would come to bruise the serpent&rsquo;s head, that is, to cause Satan&rsquo;s death. Finally, He required the woman to suffer in childbearing and to be ruled by the husband, and He required the man to labor and sweat until he should return to the ground so that fallen man, being restricted by suffering, would have security and protection and would turn to God to receive deliverance through the seed of the woman. Eventually, Adam believed in what was promised in God&rsquo;s covenant and called his wife Eve, meaning &ldquo;living&rdquo; or &ldquo;life.&rdquo; By faith he also had the hope of life. Then God made coats of skins for them that fallen sinners, having been justified by God through Christ, might be accepted by God and have fellowship with Him. By faith Abel received God&rsquo;s way of redemption, offering the sacrifice with the shedding of blood and being accepted by God. However, Cain refused God&rsquo;s way of redemption, offering produce without the shedding of blood. Rejected by God, he killed Abel his brother and was cast out of the presence of God, producing a culture that corrupted his descendants and that was judged by God.]</p>
<h2 class="head2">C. The Covenant Which God Made<br />
with the Man Who Was Saved Through Water</h2>
<p>[After God judged the corrupt generation by the flood and saved Noah&rsquo;s family of eight out of that generation, He made a covenant with Noah, which was the third covenant He made with man (Gen. 9:1-17). This covenant was made based upon the covenant which God made with Noah before the judgment of the flood. It was also based upon the sweet smell which issued from the burnt offerings presented on the altar built by man in taking God&rsquo;s way of redemption. The contents of the covenant include the following items: man would be fruitful, multiply, and replenish the earth, have dominion over all living creatures, and be allowed to eat animals for food but not to eat blood; and God would give man the authority over others to maintain the existence and order of the human race, promise to destroy the earth by a flood no more, and use the rainbow as a sign of His faithfulness in keeping the covenant. The result was that the earth was preserved, that all living things were able to grow, and that man was able to multiply endlessly and fill the face of the earth. However, man abused the God-given authority to form nations, exalted himself to oppose God, fell into idolatry, and was scattered abroad by God upon the face of the earth. Eventually, God was forced to give up the descendants of Noah, the created race of Adam.]</p><h2 class="head2">D. The Covenant Which God Made<br />
with the Called One</h2>
<p>[When the descendants of Noah violated the covenant which God had made with Noah, forming nations to oppose God and eventually falling into idolatry, Jehovah, the God of glory, came to call Abraham (Abram) as the head of a new race and to make a covenant with him, the fourth covenant that God made with man (Gen. 12:2-3, 7-8; 13:14-16; 15:1-21; 17:1, 5, 6; 22:17-18). God made a covenant with Abraham at six different times, the contents of which mainly included the following items: first, God would make him a great nation, and nations would be made of him and kings would come out of him; second, God would bless him and make his name great; third, God would give the land of Canaan to him and to his seed for an eternal possession; fourth, God would cause Sarah, his wife, to bear a son, would multiply his seed as the stars of the heavens and as the sand which is upon the seashore, and would make him the father of many nations and Sarah, a mother of nations; and fifth, God would give him the promise of grace that all the nations of the earth might be blessed in him and in his seed. The result was that although he kept the covenant, he left the land of promise twice. Furthermore, the house of Jacob, his descendants, all left the land of promise and went down to Egypt, falling under the tyranny and bondage of Egypt.]</p>
<h2 class="head2">E. The Old Covenant Which God Made<br />
with Those Who Did Not Know Themselves</h2>
<p>[When God through Moses delivered the children of Israel out of Egypt, the land of bondage, and brought them to the foot of Mount Sinai, He made a covenant with them, the fifth covenant that He made with man (Exo. 20&mdash;23). They had kept the Passover and had been redeemed by God, they had been rescued out of Egypt by God&rsquo;s power, and they had been brought through the wilderness by God&rsquo;s grace. However, not knowing themselves, they thought they were able to keep God&rsquo;s commands by themselves. Therefore, through Moses, God decreed the law, which was enacted according to what He is, in order to expose their offense that they might know sin, and to guard and shut them up that they might be brought to Christ. The contents of the law are divided into the commandments, the statutes, and the ordinances. The commandments, as God&rsquo;s basic commands, are the general principles of the law. There are ten commandments. The statutes set forth, explain in detail, and supplement the ten basic commandments; their stress is on man&rsquo;s worship and service to God and on the rituals and regulations pertaining to man&rsquo;s relationship with God. The ordinances, which are statutes with verdicts, or judgments, also set forth, explain in detail, and supplement the ten basic commandments; the emphasis is on the verdicts that concern the relationships between man and others and between man and God. This covenant was consummated by the offering of burnt offerings and peace offerings and by the sprinkling of the blood of sacrifices on the book of the covenant and on the people. Because God knew that they would break the words of the covenant, He prepared the sacrifices, which typify Christ, that they might be redeemed and have harmony with God to enjoy peace with Him. The result of making the covenant was that before the consummation of the covenant they worshipped the golden calf and thus broke the covenant. Moreover, after the consummation of the covenant, they disobeyed all the commandments, statutes, and judgments of the covenant throughout their generations. However, there were some just men who were perfected by God and who were kept and shut up by the covenant and were thus brought to the way of God&rsquo;s redemption.]</p>
<h2 class="head2">F. The Covenant Which God Made<br />
with Those Who Went to Inherit the Land</h2>
<p>[Through Moses God brought the children of Israel to the east of Jordan, to the land of Moab, and before they went on to take the good land of Canaan, He made a covenant with them through Moses, the sixth covenant that God made with man (Deut. 29&mdash;30). In this covenant, Jehovah God charged the new generation of the children of Israel that after they would enter into the good land, they were to keep all the commandments, statutes, and judgments in the covenant which He made with their fathers at Mount Sinai, and to turn to Jehovah their God with all their heart and with all their soul, to love Him and to cleave to Him. If they would keep the words of the covenant and do them, they would live and be blessed and prosper in all things. If they would turn away in their heart from Jehovah God to disobey the words of His covenant, they would be cursed, suffer calamities, and be rooted out of their land and cast into another land and scattered among the nations. If they would take God&rsquo;s word of blessing to heart in the land of captivity, and if they would return to Jehovah their God and obey His voice with all their heart and with all their soul, Jehovah God would have compassion upon them and would restore them and bring them into the good land which their fathers possessed. God would circumcise the heart of the returned ones and the heart of their descendants to love Jehovah their God with all their heart and with all their soul, and He would again rejoice over them for good, as He rejoiced over their fathers. The result of this covenant was that the new generation of the children of Israel, like their fathers, turned away from God through all their generations and disobeyed God&rsquo;s covenant. They were cursed and suffered calamities; they have been carried away to the nations, suffering man&rsquo;s mistreatment and persecution for nearly two thousand six hundred years. Until this day they still have not turned to God, who has been eagerly expecting their return. Not until the coming again of the Lord Jesus will their whole house repent and be saved. At that time the Lord will send forth His angels to gather them together from the four winds and bring them back to the good land which God gave their fathers.]</p><h2 class="head2">G. The Covenant Which God Made<br />
with One after His Own Heart</h2>
<p>[After the children of Israel entered into the good land of Canaan, and from the time that David became the king and there was peace in the entire nation, David desired to build the holy temple for God. At that time God made a covenant with him through Nathan the prophet, the seventh covenant that God made with man (2 Sam 7:8-16). The One who made this covenant is Jehovah of hosts, the Commander of all the host. This divine title was used beginning with the fall of the priesthood. The one with whom the covenant was made was David, a man after God&rsquo;s heart and the one who prevailed against the enemies to become the king. This covenant was a strengthening of the covenant which God made with Abraham, especially in the aspect of the kingdom. In this covenant God promised that He would be with David, that He would cut off all his enemies from before him, that He would make him a great name, and that He would cause his territory to rest from all his enemies. Furthermore, God promised that He would make him a house, that He would set up his seed after him, and that He would establish the kingdom and throne of his seed. His seed would build a house for God&rsquo;s name, and God would be a Father to his seed, Christ, and his seed would be a son to God. If his seed (referring to Solomon and his descendants) would commit iniquity, God would chasten his seed, but His lovingkindness would not depart from his seed. His house and his kingdom would be made sure before God, and his throne would be established forever. The result was that his son Solomon succeeded him to the throne and built the holy temple for God. However, when he was old, Solomon lusted after his foreign wives and followed them to worship idols, so that God was angry with him and tore the kingdom out of the hand of his son, thus dividing the kingdom of Israel into two. When both parts were carried away to the nations, the kingdom of David became the tabernacle that has fallen, and his throne was suspended. When Christ, the seed of David, comes again, He will rebuild the tabernacle that has fallen and will succeed to the throne to reign forever.]</p>
<h2 class="head2">H. The New Covenant Which God Made <br />
with All Sinners</h2>
<p>[In the New Testament, through the death of the Lord Jesus, which accomplished redemption for all men, God made a covenant with all sinners, the eighth covenant that He made with man (Matt. 26:28; Luke 22:20; Heb. 8:8-13). This covenant is the new covenant; it is also a better covenant. Hence, everything in this covenant is much better than the things in the old covenant. The contents of the new covenant include the following items: God will forgive the sins of all those who believe in Christ and will not remember their iniquities any more; God will impart His laws into their minds, and on their hearts He will inscribe them; God will be God to them, and they will be a people to Him; and they all will know God and will not need anyone to teach them. The contents of the new covenant are also the contents of the entire New Testament; they include such items as the Triune God Himself, redemption, forgiveness of sins, sanctification, justification, reconciliation, regeneration, and sonship. These bequests which the Lord bequeathed to the believers are inexhaustible and are for them to enjoy unto eternity. The Mediator of the new covenant is Jesus Christ, who executes the new testament, carrying out every item of the bequests of the new covenant in the believers. He is also the Surety of the new covenant, guaranteeing that the new covenant will become effective and that all the blessings of the new covenant will become practical experiences to the believers. The new covenant was consummated with Christ Himself as the better sacrifices and with His better and precious blood, causing the believers to have forgiveness of sins, the law of life, and a union with the Triune God in the Triune God. This is the ultimate issue of God&rsquo;s making covenants with man throughout the generations.]</p>
<h2 class="head1">II. THE DISPENSATIONS</h2>
<h2 class="head2">A. The Dispensation of the Patriarchs</h2>
<p>[After God created all things and mankind according to His eternal plan, His economy, He uses four distinct dispensations&mdash;the dispensation of the patriarchs, the dispensation of law, the dispensation of grace, and the dispensation of the kingdom&mdash;to do His work of the new creation on the man whom He created in order to accomplish the purpose of His eternal economy. The dispensation of the patriarchs was from the creation of Adam to the giving of the law by Moses (Rom. 5:14). In this dispensation, God first put the created man under His direct government that man might receive Him as life; then He caused the fallen man, the function of whose conscience had been activated by the knowledge of good and evil, to receive His redemption in Christ. He also caused man to be governed by his own conscience and to be acceptable to Him through sacrifices according to the way of redemption that He ordained. Moreover, He caused man to enjoy His riches by calling on His name so that he might walk and work with Him. Then He subjected the repeatedly fallen man under the authority which He gave to man, causing him to be ruled by man that he might live and be preserved and that He might have the opportunity to visit man. Finally, He called the new race out of the Adamic race, which was fallen to the uttermost, and gave them the promise of grace, leading them to hope in the Christ who would come to be a blessing to all the nations of the earth. In this way, God obtained the chosen patriarchs to be the first part of the new race in His new creation.]</p><h2 class="head2">B. The Dispensation of Law</h2>
<p>[God&rsquo;s original intention was to do the work of the new creation on the fallen man of the old creation according to His promised grace. However, because the fallen man did not know his weakness and corruption, and therefore did not realize his impotence and his need of God&rsquo;s grace, God temporarily changed the way of His work of the new creation on the fallen man of the old creation. That is, He gave the fallen man the law, which was established according to what He is. Thus, He initiated another dispensation, the dispensation of law, which extended from Moses to Christ (John 10:10; Gal. 3:24; Luke 2:25-26, 36-38; 3:15; 7:19; Rom. 5:20; Gal. 3:19). God&rsquo;s intention in setting up this dispensation of law according to His economy was to accomplish the following things through the law; first, to keep the chosen people in custody that they might satisfy the requirements of the law through the offerings, which typified Christ, and thereby be guarded, as sheep are guarded in the sheepfold; second, to provide the chosen people with a child-conductor that they might be led to Christ, that through the offerings they might be forgiven, and that through the tabernacle and temple they might enjoy God&rsquo;s riches; and third, to cause the chosen people to have the knowledge of sin and of themselves, and thereby realize and sense their need of God&rsquo;s grace. As a result, God kept His chosen people in the custody of the law, obtained the second part of the new race of the new creation, and brought Christ to the chosen people who waited for Him in the dispensation of law and to those who would believe into Him in the coming dispensation.]</p>
<h2 class="head2">C. The Dispensation of Grace</h2>
<p>[When God determined that the purpose of decreeing the law had been attained and that the law had been used to its full extent, the Triune God became flesh in the Son; He was born of a woman to become Christ, who possessed both the divine nature and the human nature, bringing grace and reality (John 1:1-2, 17-18). He passed through human life in humanity, experiencing every hardship and suffering, and He also lived out the Triune God in humanity. Furthermore, He passed through the death of the cross in humanity, accomplishing an all-inclusive death with a sevenfold status and releasing the divine life for multiplication and increase to constitute the Body of Christ, which is the church. Moreover, the Triune God was raised from among the dead with a resurrected body in humanity, that the only begotten Son might be born as the firstborn Son in His humanity in resurrection; at the same time, those who believed into Christ were regenerated to become His many sons. This Christ, who was resurrected to become the life-giving Spirit, breathed Himself into those who believed in Him to be the reality of their spiritual life for their spiritual existence and living. Then this resurrected and glorified One was exalted in ascension. He was made both Lord and Christ to be a Leader and Savior, that He might give repentance and forgiveness of sins to God&rsquo;s chosen people. Moreover, in ascension He poured Himself out as the consummated Spirit of the Triune God, baptizing those who believed and became His members in this consummated Spirit into one Body, that they might be His fullness to express Him. The above seven items mainly include the person and work of Christ and constitute the gospel of God to be preached to sinners, calling those who were chosen of God to believe, to be saved, and to be regenerated. God then constitutes them to be the churches in different localities that the Body of Christ may be fully built up. Thus God obtains all those who believe into Christ in the New Testament to be the third part of the new race in God&rsquo;s new creation.]</p>
<h2 class="head2">D. The Dispensation of the Kingdom</h2>
<p>[After the conclusion of the dispensation of grace, God will change for the last time the way of His work of the new creation on the man of the old creation. That is, He will set up His kingdom on the earth to carry out His administration that He may accomplish His work of the new creation in the old creation. This is the dispensation of the kingdom, which is also called the dispensation of righteousness; it covers the period from the second coming of Christ to the end of the millennium (Rev. 11:15; 20:4, 6). In this dispensation, according to His righteousness, He will use the manifestation of the kingdom of the heavens to reward the just men perfected in the Old Testament and the overcoming believers in Christ in the New Testament that they may participate in Christ&rsquo;s kingship and joy. Moreover, according to righteousness, He will perfect the immature believers in the New Testament and also will deal with all the Israelites who repent and believe in Christ at His coming back. The dispensation of the kingdom, which is the dispensation of righteousness, is still a dispensation in the old creation used by God to chasten, to discipline, and to perfect the believers. It is not in the new heaven and new earth that all the work of the new creation will be completed. God will use the last dispensation in the old creation to complete His work of the new creation on the man of the old creation. That is, He will cause the immature believers in the dispensation of grace to mature in life, and He also will cause the repentant Israelites, after the termination of the dispensation of grace, to become constituents of the new race. In this way God will complete the work of the new creation on the man of the old creation in the old creation, a work that will produce and perfect a new race. Thus, the processed Triune God and the transformed tripartite man will be mingled as one to be a mutual dwelling place for His ultimate corporate expression in eternity.]</p><h2 class="head1">III. SATAN</h2>
<p>The subject of Satan is very negative and we would rather not talk about it. However, God talks about it in the Bible and we need to know about it in order to fight against him. Therefore, we will spend some time on this subject.</p>
<p>[We have seen already that God&rsquo;s original creation is fully covered in Genesis 1:1, &ldquo;In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth.&rdquo; We have also seen that something happened between verse 1 and verse 2: God&rsquo;s original creation was damaged, the earth became waste and empty, and darkness was upon the face of the deep. This was the result of God&rsquo;s judgment on the earth due to Satan&rsquo;s rebellion. Now let us look at Satan&rsquo;s origin and rebellion.]</p>
<h2 class="head2">A. The Origin of Satan</h2>
<p>[Satan means adversary. Satan is not only God&rsquo;s enemy outside of God&rsquo;s kingdom, but also God&rsquo;s adversary from within God&rsquo;s kingdom, rebelling against God. Enemy refers to the foe outside of God&rsquo;s kingdom, whereas adversary refers to the foe from within God&rsquo;s kingdom. Satan, who had been under God&rsquo;s ruling, is not an outsider. Therefore, he has been God&rsquo;s adversary right up to now.]</p>
<p>Ezekiel 28:12-14 says, &ldquo;Thus saith the Lord God; Thou sealest up the sum, full of wisdom, and perfect in beauty. Thou hast been in Eden the garden of God; every precious stone was thy covering, the sardius, topaz, and the diamond, the beryl, the onyx, and the jasper, the sapphire, the emerald, and the carbuncle, and gold: the workmanship of thy tabrets and of thy pipes was prepared in thee in the day that thou wast created. Thou art the anointed cherub that covereth; and I have set thee so: thou wast upon the holy mountain of God; thou hast walked up and down in the midst of the stones of fire.&rdquo;</p>
<h2 class="head3">1. Created to be a King</h2>
<p>This portion of the Scripture describes Satan&rsquo;s position in the universe before his rebellion and corruption. His creation was heralded with tambourines and pipes which were used for kings. This indicates that he was a king, and explains why he was called &ldquo;the ruler of this world&rdquo; (John 12:31) and &ldquo;the ruler of the authority of the air&rdquo; (Eph. 2:2). He also stated that he had all the authority of the kingdoms of the earth (Luke 4:5-6).</p>
<h2 class="head3">2. Being the Highest Archangel</h2>
<p>He must have been the highest archangel because Michael the archangel (Dan. 10:13) did not dare to bring a reviling judgment against him (Jude 9).</p>
<h2 class="head3">3. Being the Perfect Cherub Having the Priesthood</h2>
<p>He was &ldquo;the anointed cherub that covers.&rdquo; He was to cover the ark of God in the holy mountain of God in the heavens. He was very close to God and was bearing God&rsquo;s glory. Cherubim typically lead the worship of God, as is the case in Ezekiel. The four cherubim in Ezekiel are the four living creatures, similar to the four living creatures in Revelation who led all the creatures to worship God (Ezek. 10:20; 1:10; Rev. 4:7). This reveals that Satan, &ldquo;the anointed cherub,&rdquo; must have been the high priest in the universal worship of God.</p>
<h2 class="head2">B. The Rebellion of Satan</h2>
<p>[Ezekiel 28:15 says that Satan was perfect in his ways from the day he was created. Of course, God did not create an evil Satan. God created a good and perfect archangel. But at a certain time, this archangel, the anointed cherub, rebelled against God.]</p>
<h2 class="head3">1. The Cause of Rebellion</h2>
<p>[Satan rebelled against God because of pride in his heart. Ezekiel 28:17 says that his heart was lifted up because of his beauty, that he corrupted his wisdom by reason of his brightness. He &ldquo;sealest up the sum, full of wisdom, and perfect in beauty&rdquo; (Ezek. 28:12). This means that he had the full measure of completeness and was short of nothing. But he gazed on his beauty and was proud. He looked at his brightness, and because of his brightness he used his God-given wisdom to commit sins and do unrighteous deeds, and thus corrupted his wisdom. To look at what God has made us and to forget God Himself always tempts us to be proud. Pride was the cause of Satan&rsquo;s rebellion. In our experience, all the natural virtues and spiritual gifts can be utilized by the Devil to make us proud. Even the apostle Paul could &ldquo;be exceedingly lifted up by the transcendence of the revelations&rdquo; (2 Cor. 12:7). The proud Devil is still walking about on the earth, seeking the proud ones whom he may devour (1 Pet. 5:8). The only way to resist him is to humble ourselves. &ldquo;Gird yourselves with humility toward one another, because God resists the proud, but gives grace to the humble&rdquo; (l Pet. 5:5). The Lord Jesus is a good example in this matter. Satan exalted himself, but the Lord Jesus &ldquo;humbled Himself&rdquo; (Phil. 2:8). Thus, the Lord Jesus overcame Satan, and Satan had nothing in Him (John 14:30).]</p>
<h2 class="head3">2. The Purpose of Rebellion</h2>
<p>[The purpose of Satan&rsquo;s rebellion was to exalt himself to be equal with God. In Isaiah 14:13-14 we find that five times Satan said, &ldquo;I will&rdquo;: &ldquo;I will ascend into heaven...I will exalt my throne...I will sit also upon the mount of the congregation...I will ascend above the heights of the clouds; I will be like the Most High.&rdquo; Satan wanted to be equal with God. That was the purpose of his rebellion against God.]</p>
<h2 class="head3">3. The Process of Rebellion</h2>
<p>Satan initiated the rebellion against God with the evil intention to overthrow God&rsquo;s authority (Ezek. 28:15-18; Isa. 14:13-14). Not only did he rebel, but one-third of the angels who were under his hand also rebelled (Rev. 12:4, 9; the stars represent angels).</p>
<p>[The living creatures which were on the earth at that time also joined Satan in his rebellion. Thus God judged them with water and they became the demons on the earth. Their lodging place is in the water. Man&rsquo;s body is also their temporary dwelling place (Matt. 12:43-45).]</p>
<p>[Geologists and archaeologists have discovered that the earth is not merely six thousand years old, but much older. Some have discovered fossil remains of bones which are thousands and thousands of years old. But according to the Bible, there are only about six thousand years from Adam to now. Mr. Pember found the answer. Between Genesis 1:1 and 1:2 there was a period of time which he called the interval. No one can say how long this interval was.] [Pember also inferred from the biblical record that in this pre-Adamic age there existed on the earth some living beings and that they also joined Satan in his rebellion against God. Thus Satan, his fallen angels, and these living beings were all judged by God. After they were judged by God, these beings lost their bodies and became disembodied spirits. This is the reason that demons want to enter a physical body. The water with which God judged them became the deep where the demons must live. Pember even proved that under this deep water there is the so-called abyss. The deep water is the demons&rsquo; dwelling place.]</p>
<p>When the Lord Jesus was crossing the sea to cast out demons, the fallen angels in the air stirred up the wind and the demons in the water stirred up the waves to frustrate the Lord (Matt. 8:23-32). Satan, the evil angels, and the demons form the kingdom of Satan. The kingdom of Satan is always fighting against the Lord and His kingdom. We must stand with the Lord in His kingdom to fight against Satan and His kingdom.</p><h2 class="head2">C. The Result of Rebellion</h2>
<h2 class="head3">1. Satan Being Judged by God</h2>
<p>[Satan&rsquo;s rebellion brought in God&rsquo;s judgment. God cannot tolerate any rebellion among His creatures. Immediately after Satan&rsquo;s rebellion, God declared His judgment on him.] He was cast down to the ground (Ezek. 28:15-18) and he shall be brought down to hell (Isa. 14:15).</p>
<h2 class="head3">2. The Heavens and the Earth Being Judged</h2>
<p>The heavens and the earth are Satan&rsquo;s sanctuary which he has defiled. God rebuked Satan, saying, &ldquo;Thou hast defiled thy sanctuaries by the multitude of thine iniquities&rdquo; (Ezek. 28:18). Therefore, the heavens and the earth were also judged by God. Under God&rsquo;s judgment the heavens did not shine and the earth was covered by darkness (Job 9:5-7; Gen. 1:2). This must have happened before Adam was created, because there is no record of such an event in human history; that is, in the six thousand years following the creation of Adam.</p>
<h2 class="head3">3. The Rebellious Angels and the Demons<br />
Being Judged</h2>
<p>When God judged Satan and the universe under him, God also must have judged both the angels who followed him and the living beings on the earth during that age who joined him in his rebellion. After being judged, the rebellious angels became the spiritual forces of evil in the air (Eph. 6:12), and the living beings became the disembodied spirits, the demons, lodging in the water with which they were judged.</p>
<h2 class="head2">D. The Execution of God&rsquo;s Judgment Upon Satan</h2>
<p>[Though Satan, the rebellious angels, and the demons were all judged by God, they are still moving and working today, because the judgment upon them has not yet been executed.</p>
<p>Today, Satan can still go to God to accuse God&rsquo;s people (Job 1:6-12; 2:1-7; Rev. 12:10). He still walks about&quot; on the earth, &ldquo;seeking someone to devour&rdquo; (l Pet. 5:8), still working to blind the thoughts of people (2 Cor. 4:4), to deceive them by transfiguring himself into an angel of light (2 Cor. 11:14). We must not be ignorant of his thoughts (2 Cor. 2:11), neither give place to the Devil (Eph. 4:27). We must withstand him firm in the faith (1 Pet. 5:8-9). We need to put on the whole armor of God that we may be able to stand against him (Eph. 6:11-17).</p>
<p>After Satan&rsquo;s rebellion, God pronounced His judgment upon him immediately. But it takes a long time to execute God&rsquo;s judgment. The Lord Jesus was manifested in the flesh that He might destroy the works of the Devil (l John 3:8). This was the execution of God&rsquo;s judgment. The Lord gave His disciples authority over all the power of the enemy (Luke 10:19). When the disciples cast out demons, Satan fell from heaven (Luke 10:17-20). Through His death on the cross, He destroyed the Devil (Heb. 2:14). He has bruised the head of the old serpent. Now we, as His Body, must continue this execution, to destroy the tail of the serpent. Through the church&rsquo;s executing work, the Devil will be cast to the earth, and his angels will be cast out with him (Rev. 12:9). He will later be bound and cast into the abyss (Rev. 20:2-3). Eventually, he will be &ldquo;cast into the lake of fire&rdquo; (Rev. 20:10). Then, the execution of God&rsquo;s judgment upon Satan and his followers will be completed.]</p>
<h2 class="head2">SUMMARY</h2>
<p>[Satan was originally the highest of the archangels created by God. He rebelled against God because of pride and became God&rsquo;s adversary, God&rsquo;s enemy. The heavens the earth, and the universe were corrupted because of Satan&rsquo;s rebellion and fell under God&rsquo;s judgment. God&rsquo;s judgment on Satan is being carried out gradually until Christ comes again, when he will be bound and cast into the abyss for one thousand years. At the end of the one thousand years, he will be released from the abyss and will rebel for the last time. Immediately after this rebellion, he will be cast into the lake of fire to be punished for eternity. Thus, God&rsquo;s judgment on Satan will be completed.]</p>

<h2 class="head2">Text</h2>
<p>In the next nine lessons, we will study various crucial matters in each of the sixty-six books of the Bible. These lessons will provide a general overview of each book of the Bible and of the Bible itself. We encourage you to do your best to remember the key points for each book.</p>
<p>The following topics are addressed for each book: the writer(s) of the book, the place where it was written, the time period it covers, the background and circumstances that may have influenced the writer(s), the central thought expressed by the writer(s) as it relates to the background, the subject and general sketch, and the main sections. The subject is an abstract of the general sketch, while the general sketch includes the crucial points of the book.</p><h2 class="head1">I. THE BIBLE</h2>
<h2 class="head2">A. The Writer(s), the Place, and the Time</h2>
<p>Thus far, we have seen that the Bible as a whole is the speaking from God by men borne by the Holy Spirit (2 Pet. 1:21). God, with the cooperation of forty writers, authored the Bible. It was primarily written in the good land, although certain portions were written in Gentile lands, including Babylon and Rome. It took nearly 1,600 years, from 1500 B.C. to A.D. 96, to complete the Bible.</p>
<h2 class="head2">B. The Subject</h2>
<p>[The subject of the Bible is contained in only four sentences: God planned and created, Satan rebelled and damaged, man fell and was lost, and Christ redeemed and built.]</p>
<p>[The subject of the Old Testament is that God created, Satan damaged, man fell, and God promised the coming of Christ for redemption.]</p>
<p>[The subject of the New Testament is Christ coming to redeem sinners and to build up the church according to God&rsquo;s plan.]</p>
<h2 class="head2">C. The Background</h2>
<p>Man was created by God to contain God so that he may express God and represent Him. However, man fell away from God, becoming useless to God and destined to eternal perdition. But God still loved man and desired to save man that He may accomplish His eternal purpose.</p>
<h2 class="head2">D. The Central Thought</h2>
<p>[The central thought of the Bible is Christ and the church. The Bible not only reveals Christ Himself; it also reveals the bride and the Body of Christ, which is the church.]</p>
<p>[The Old Testament leads man to Christ that man would be redeemed by Him.]</p>
<p>[The New Testament shows us how the church is redeemed and built up in Christ.]</p>
<h2 class="head2">E. The General Sketch</h2>
<p>The Bible reveals God, Christ, the Spirit, the work of Christ, man, salvation, the eternal life, the believers, the church, the kingdom, the New Jerusalem, the covenants, the dispensations, and Satan. It is God who planned and Christ who created man according to God&rsquo;s plan. Satan came in to corrupt man and Christ came to save man. Those who believe God&rsquo;s salvation receive eternal life and, as a corporate expression, are the church in this age, the manifested kingdom in the next age, and the New Jerusalem in eternity. God made eight covenants with man concerning His purpose. God carried out His eternal purpose in four dispensations, that is, four periods in which He deals with man. Ultimately, Satan is judged, and God is glorified by the mingling of Himself with man.</p>
<h2 class="head2">F. The Sections</h2>
<h2 class="head3">1. The Old Testament</h2>
<p>a. The books of law, the Pentateuch by Moses: Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers, and Deuteronomy.</p>
<p>b. The books of history, twelve books: Joshua, Judges, Ruth, 1 Samuel, 2 Samuel, 1 Kings, 2 Kings, 1 Chronicles, 2 Chronicles, Ezra, Nehemiah, and Esther.</p>
<p>c. The books of poetry, five books: Job, Psalms, Proverbs, Ecclesiastes, and Song of Songs.</p>
<p>d. The books of prophecy, eleven books: Isaiah, Jeremiah, Lamentations, Ezekiel, Daniel, Hosea, Joel, Amos, Obadiah, Jonah, Micah, Nahum, Habakkuk, Zephaniah, Haggai, Zechariah, and Malachi.</p>
<h2 class="head3">2. The New Testament</h2>
<p>a. The books of history, five books: Matthew, Mark, Luke, John, and Acts.</p>
<p>b. The epistles, twenty-one books: Romans, 1 Corinthians, 2 Corinthians, Galatians, Ephesians, Philippians, Colossians, 1 Thessalonians, 2 Thessalonians, 1 Timothy, 2 Timothy, Titus, Philemon, Hebrews, James, 1 Peter, 2 Peter, 1 John, 2 John, 3 John, and Jude.</p>
<p>c. The book of prophecy, one book: Revelation.</p><h2 class="head1">II. GENESIS</h2>
<p>[Genesis...means giving of birth, origin. Genesis brings birth to everything, gives the origin of everything. Genesis is a book containing all the seeds of the divine truths. All the divine truths in the whole Bible were sown in this book.]</p>
<h2 class="head2">A. The Writer(s), the Place, and the Time</h2>
<p>[The Pentateuch of Moses&mdash;Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers, and Deuteronomy&mdash;was written by Moses. Moses was raised in the palace. He was a scholar, a politician, and a military leader. According to the world, he was also a religious leader. The Pentateuch was written by him at Mount Sinai and in the wilderness.] The events recorded in this book took place between 4004 B.C. and 1689 B.C., and it was written around 1500 B.C.</p>
<h2 class="head2">B. The Subject</h2>
<p>The subject of Genesis is: God created, Satan corrupted, man fell, and Jehovah promised to save.</p>
<h2 class="head2">C. The Background</h2>
<p>Genesis is the first book of the Bible. After 2,500 years of God&rsquo;s spoken revelation, Genesis marked the beginning of the written record of God&rsquo;s revelation. The written revelation is needed to make God&rsquo;s revelation available to all.</p>
<h2 class="head2">D. The Central Thought</h2>
<p>[The central thought of Genesis is: Christ is the hope and salvation of fallen man, and God will make fallen man to fulfill His purpose through Christ.]</p>
<h2 class="head2">E. The General Sketch</h2>
<p>[The book of Genesis reveals God&rsquo;s creation and man&rsquo;s fall. According to Genesis, man fell step by step: from God to the conscience, from the conscience to human government, and from human government to rebellion. In this rebellion man forsook God and turned to the worship of idols. After man rebelled against God at Babel, God gave up the created race; however, He could not and did not forsake His purpose. Therefore, after giving up the created race, God called out a new race, a selected race, beginning with Abraham. To Abraham God promised that in him all the families of the earth would be blessed (Gen. 12:3). Eventually the race selected and called by God fell from God&rsquo;s selection and calling into Egypt, that is, into the world.]</p>
<h2 class="head2">F. The Sections</h2>
<p>1) God created (1:1&mdash;2:25), 2) Satan corrupted (3:1&mdash;11:32), and 3) Jehovah called (12:1&mdash;50:26).</p>
<h2 class="head1">III. EXODUS</h2>
<h2 class="head2">A. The Writer(s), the Place, and the Time</h2>
<p>The events recorded in this book took place between 1706 B.C. and 1490 B.C. (Please see this section in Genesis.)</p>
<h2 class="head2">B. The Subject</h2>
<p>The subject of Exodus is God&rsquo;s salvation, supply, and revelation, and the building of His habitation.</p>
<h2 class="head2">C. The Background</h2>
<p>After the children of Israel were saved out of Egypt, they wandered in the wilderness. The purpose of God was not merely to save them from of the tyranny of Pharaoh, but to have them build His habitation, that is, the tabernacle. God&rsquo;s intention was to reveal to the children of Israel His eternal purpose, which is to have His dwelling place on earth (25:8-9, 40).</p>
<h2 class="head2">D. The Central Thought</h2>
<p>[The central thought of Exodus is that Christ is the redemption, salvation, and supply of God&rsquo;s people and the means for them to worship and serve God so that in Him they may be built up with God together for them and God to meet, communicate, and dwell mutually.]</p>
<h2 class="head2">E. The General Sketch</h2>
<p>[The general sketch of Exodus firstly shows how the children of Israel were enslaved in Egypt (1:8-14). Then it reveals that the children of Israel were redeemed and saved (12:27; 14:30). After their redemption and salvation, the children of Israel were led by the Lord in the wilderness (13:17-18, 21-22; 17:1; 19:1-2; 40:36-38). They were led by the pillar of cloud and by the pillar of fire. Furthermore, manna rained down from heaven, and living water flowed from the cleft rock. In their journeys the children of Israel eventually were brought by the Lord to Mount Sinai where they received a revelation of God&rsquo;s eternal purpose, which is to have His dwelling place on earth (25:8-9, 40). After receiving this revelation, they built the tabernacle for God&rsquo;s habitation (39:32; 40:2, 34-35).]</p>
<h2 class="head2">F. The Sections</h2>
<p>1) Enslaved (1:1-22), 2) redeemed and saved (2:1&mdash;15:21), 3) led (15:22&mdash;18:27), 4) receiving revelation (19:1&mdash;34:35), and 5) building the tabernacle (35:1&mdash;40:38).</p><h2 class="head1">IV. LEVITICUS</h2>
<h2 class="head2">A. The Writer(s), the Place, and the Time</h2>
<p>(Please see this section in Genesis.)</p>
<h2 class="head2">B. The Subject</h2>
<p>The subject of Leviticus is the redeemed&rsquo;s worship to God and their living of a holy life.</p>
<h2 class="head2">C. The Background</h2>
<p>After the children of Israel built the tabernacle for God&rsquo;s dwelling place, they needed to know how to worship God, to offer to God, to serve God, to live before God, and to feast before God. Without the proper revelation from God, they would practice according to their own concept. Therefore, God purposed to give them a book that would reveal His concepts and His ways.</p>
<h2 class="head2">D. The Central Thought</h2>
<p>[The central thought of Leviticus is that Christ is everything in the fellowship, service, and life of God&rsquo;s redeemed. Dr. C. I. Scofield once pointed out that Christ can be seen in every page of this book. In Leviticus Christ is everything. He is the offerings, He is the high priest, and He is everything in the living of God&rsquo;s redeemed people. Leviticus, therefore, is a book on Christ and full of Christ.]</p>
<h2 class="head2">E. The General Sketch</h2>
<p>The general sketch of Leviticus is this: [Through the tabernacle, with the offerings, and by the priests, God&rsquo;s redeemed are enabled to fellowship with God, serve God, and be God&rsquo;s holy people living a holy life, which expresses God.]</p>
<h2 class="head2">F. The Sections</h2>
<p>1) Ordinances concerning offerings (chs. 1&mdash;7), 2) ordinances concerning service (chs. 8&mdash;10), 3) ordinances concerning living (chs. 11&mdash;22), 4) ordinances concerning feasts (ch. 23), and 5) other ordinances and warnings (chs. 24&mdash;27).</p>
<h2 class="head1">V. NUMBERS</h2>
<h2 class="head2">A. The Writer(s), the Place, and the Time</h2>
<p>The events recorded in this book took place between 1490 B.C. and 1451 B.C. (Please see this section in Genesis.)</p>
<h2 class="head2">B. The Subject</h2>
<p>The subject of Numbers is [God&rsquo;s redeemed formed into His army and their journey in fighting for God.]</p>
<h2 class="head2">C. The Background</h2>
<p>After the children of Israel had been saved out of Egypt and supplied by God, and after they had received revelation from God and built the tabernacle for God&rsquo;s habitation, God spoke to them from the tabernacle. Having learned how to worship God and to live a holy life, they needed to go on. This book showed them how.</p>
<h2 class="head2">D. The Central Thought</h2>
<p>The central thought of Numbers is this: [Christ is the testimony and center of God&rsquo;s people, and the Leader and goal of their journey and fighting.]</p>
<h2 class="head2">E. The General Sketch</h2>
<p>The general sketch of Numbers is this: [The redeemed and sanctified Israelites were formed into a holy army of God, which was to proceed by following God&rsquo;s leading and was to fight for Him.]</p>
<h2 class="head2">F. The Sections</h2>
<p>1) Being formed into an army (1:1&mdash;9:14), 2) journeying (9:15&mdash;20:29; 21:4-20; 33:1-49), and 3) fighting (21:1-3; 21:21&mdash;32:42; 33:50&mdash;36:13).</p><h2 class="head1">VI. DEUTERONOMY</h2>
<h2 class="head2">A. The Writer(s), the Place, and the Time</h2>
<p>The events recorded in this book took place between 1491 B.C. and 1451 B.C. (Please see this section in Genesis.)</p>
<h2 class="head2">B. The Subject</h2>
<p>The subject of Deuteronomy is the preparation of God&rsquo;s redeemed people to take the good land.</p>
<h2 class="head2">C. The Background</h2>
<p>[The book of Deuteronomy is filled with the speaking of Moses to the second generation, the generation which was ready to enter into the good land and possess it. Concerned that they would repeat the failures of their fathers, Moses charged them concerning many matters, repeating certain things again and again. He especially spoke repeatedly concerning those matters which would preserve the people and qualify them to enter into the good land and to possess, inherit, and enjoy the land. Moses was like an elderly father speaking out of concern for his children.]</p>
<h2 class="head2">D. The Central Thought</h2>
<p>[The central thought of Deuteronomy is that Christ is the Instructor and Leader of the people of God that they may be able to enter into the heavenly territory and participate in His riches.]</p>
<h2 class="head2">E. The General Sketch</h2>
<p>The general sketch of Deuteronomy is this: the renewed training was given to the new generation of the children of Israel after their long journey in the wilderness, to prepare them to enter into the good land promised by God that they may inherit it as their possession.</p>
<h2 class="head2">F. The Sections</h2>
<p>1) Review of the past (1:1&mdash;4:43), 2) rehearsal of the law (4:44&mdash;26:19), 3) a warning (27:1&mdash;28:68), 4) the enactment of the covenant (29:1&mdash;30:20), 5) the final exhortations and charges (31:1-13, 24-29), 6) the song of Moses (31:14-23, 30; 32:1-47), 7) the blessing of Moses (33:1-29), and 8) the death of Moses, and his successor (32:48-52; 34:1-12).</p>

</ol><h2 class="head2">Text</h2>
<h2 class="head1">I. JOSHUA</h2>
<p>A. The writer(s), the place, and the time: The book of Joshua is written by Joshua. He was a military leader and a politician. He wrote most of this book in Canaan and a smaller portion in the plains of Moab. The events recorded in this book probably took place between 1450 B.C. and 1426 B.C.</p>
<p>B. The subject: The destruction of the enemies and the entering into rest.</p>
<p>C. The background: [The purpose of God&rsquo;s calling was not only to bring the children of Israel out of Egypt, the land of bondage, but also to bring them into Canaan, the land flowing with milk and honey (Exo. 3:8, 10, 17). In typology, to bring the children of Israel into the good land signifies the bringing of man into Christ, the all-inclusive One typified by the good land. Today Christ is the good land flowing with milk and honey.]</p>
<p>D. The central thought: The faithful God brought His people into the good land promised to their forefather, Abraham. The righteous God dealt with the sin of His people and the inhabitants of the good land.</p>
<p>E. The general sketch: [God spoke to Joshua, the son of Nun, Moses&rsquo; minister, to rise up and cross over Jordan with all the people to the land that He would give to them as their inheritance (Josh. 1:2, 6). Joshua 11:23 says, &ldquo;Joshua took the whole land, according to all that the Lord said unto Moses; and Joshua gave it for an inheritance unto Israel according to their divisions by their tribes. And the land rested from war.&rdquo;]</p>
<p>F. The sections: 1) entering of the good land (chs. 1&mdash;5), 2) conquering the enemies (chs. 6&mdash;12), 3) distributing of the good land (chs. 13&mdash;22), and 4) farewell (chs. 23&mdash;24).</p>
<h2 class="head1">II. JUDGES</h2>
<p>A. The writer(s), the place, and the time: [There are a lot of contentions about the authorship of Judges, and they are hard to verify. However, many authorities have postulated that it was written by Samuel.] It was probably written between 1425 B.C. and 1120 B.C.</p>
 <p>B. The subject: Confusion and revival.</p>
<p>C. The background: After the children of Israel inherited the good land, they rebelled against God; they bowed down to idols, warred among themselves, and were full of the sins of the flesh. It is a dark and painful history.</p>
<p>D. The central thought: Man has a rebellious nature. God is righteous to judge all sins. God is merciful and faithful to forgive and save every time His people repent and call upon Him.</p>
<p>E. The general sketch: [The period from the death of Joshua to the reign of Saul is called the age of the judges. The entire age of the judges lasted about 450 years (Acts 13:19, 20). During this period, the children of Israel could not utterly drive out and destroy the seven tribes in Canaan. Consequently they gradually forsook God, followed the customs of the nations, had mixed marriages with the nations, and worshipped other gods. Therefore, God delivered them into the hands of the nations according to His warnings. But whenever they repented, God would listen to their prayers and would deliver them through the hand of a judge. The children of Israel would forsake God, but they would then repent and God would deliver them. But eventually they would forsake God again. This cycle was repeated, as many as seven times.]</p>
<p>F. The sections: 1) foreword&mdash;faith in God (chs. 1&mdash;2:5), 2) history of falling&mdash;rebellion against God (chs. 2:6&mdash;16), and 3) appendix&mdash;confusion in religion, in morality, and between the tribes (chs. 15&mdash;21).</p><h2 class="head1">III. RUTH</h2>
<p>A. The writer(s), the place, and the time: [The book of Ruth is connected to the preceding book of Judges and the following books of Samuel in history and in time. Therefore, it was most probably written by Samuel.] Its events take place between 1322 B.C. and 1312 B.C., but they were recorded much later, after David had become king.</p>
<p>B. The subject: Boaz is seen as one valuing the God-given birthright and ushering in the king that built the kingdom&mdash;David.</p>
<p>C. The background: This book is part of and a supplement to the book of Judges. Judges is a book of the history of darkness and suffering. But this book is likened to an oasis in the desert or a bright star shining in a dark night. It causes the reader to rejoice and get excited.</p>
<p>D. The central thought: That man may have the birthright through the redemption of Christ and a union with Christ.</p>
<p>E. The general sketch: [In the book of Ruth, Boaz typifies Christ and Ruth typifies the church. This book shows us how Boaz redeemed both Ruth and her birthright. The birthright included a double portion of the land, the priesthood, and the kingship, that is, the right and position to enjoy Christ fully with the privileges to be a priest to bring people to God and a king to bring God to men. Ruth was Naomi&rsquo;s daughter-in-law, and both had lost their birthright due to poverty. According to God&rsquo;s ordination, the recovery of one&rsquo;s birthright required the redemptive effort of a kinsman.</p>
<p>Boaz treasured the God-given birthright. He was not only concerned for his own birthright, but also for that of others. He paid a price to redeem his kinsman&rsquo;s inheritance and married his widow (Ruth 4:1-17). It was due to his compassion on the poor and weak Ruth and his redemption of her birthright that David, the king that built the kingdom, was brought in.]</p>
<p>F. The sections: 1) the loss of the birthright (1:1-5), 2) the desire for the birthright (1:6-22), 3) the seeking of the birthright (chs. 2&mdash;3), and 4) the recovery of the birthright (ch. 4).</p>
<h2 class="head1">IV. 1 SAMUEL</h2>
<p>A. The writer(s), the place, and the time: [The first twenty-four chapters of 1 Samuel were probably written by Samuel. Chapter twenty-five, verse 1 says that Samuel died. Therefore, from chapter twenty-five on, the rest of 1 Samuel and the whole book of 2 Samuel were surely not written by him. First Chronicles 29:29 says that regarding the things of David, there was not only the recording of Samuel, but also the recordings of the prophets Nathan and Gad. Bible scholars have concluded from this verse that the recordings in the books of Samuel after the death of Samuel must have been continued by the prophets Nathan and Gad.] The book of 1 Samuel was written in Canaan and covers the period between 1171 B.C. and 1056 B.C.</p>
 <p>B. The subject: The degradation of the priesthood, the establishment of the prophethood to speak for God, and the anointing of the kingship after God&rsquo;s heart.</p>
<p>C. The background: [The priests occupied an important position, because the people needed to go through the priests when they served and drew near to God.] But Eli the priest was weak, thus, the priesthood had deteriorated. Therefore, God needed to establish a prophet to speak for Him so the people could come to God through him. Furthermore, God wanted a habitation on earth. He used Samuel to anoint David, a man after His heart, to be the king and to build His temple.</p>
<p>D. The central thought: Prayer. Hannah&rsquo;s prayer produced a son (fruit). Samuel&rsquo;s prayer caused Israel to win the victory. Samuel prayed for a king according to the request of Israel. He regarded prayerlessness as sin.</p>
<p>E. The general sketch: The key word for this book is prayer. &ldquo;Samuel&rdquo; means God listens to prayer. God gave Samuel to his mother Hannah because of her prayer. Samuel lived in the temple from his youth. Eli the priest had allowed the priesthood to deteriorate due to his weakness in disciplining his two children. God bypassed Eli and established Samuel to speak for Him. Samuel was a praying person. The Israelites wanted a king. Samuel anointed Saul to be king. Saul rebelled and was given up. Then David was anointed to be the king. David defeated Goliath as a young man and became famous. Saul was jealous of David and tried to kill him many times. David became a fugitive for many years, but he never rebelled against Saul. Eventually, Saul was killed.</p>
<p>F. The sections: 1) Samuel (chs. 1&mdash;7), 2) Saul (chs. 8&mdash;15), and 3) David (chs. 16&mdash;31).</p><h2 class="head1">V. 2 SAMUEL</h2>
<p>A. The writer(s), the place, and the time: The writers were Nathan and Gad. It was written in Canaan about events that took place between 1056 B.C. and 1018 B.C.</p>
<p>B. The subject: Christ the King defeated God&rsquo;s enemies for the building of God&rsquo;s temple.</p>
<p>C. The background: This book is mainly about King David. The latter part of 1 Samuel recorded David&rsquo;s anointing, suffering, and fleeing in the early days. Second Samuel records David&rsquo;s kingship. The enemies of Israel continued to fight against Israel. The desire of God to have a temple for His habitation had still not been fulfilled. The Israelites had their land, yet they were not at rest, and God did not have His dwelling place. David was raised up for the purpose of conquering their enemies and building up the temple of God.</p>
<p>D. The central thought: As God&rsquo;s people, we should be after God&rsquo;s heart to fight against God&rsquo;s enemy and build up His temple, the church. God is righteous to judge rebellion and sins and to forgive us when we repent.</p>
<p>E. The general sketch: After the death of Saul and his son Jonathan, David was inaugurated to be the king of Judah. Later, he was inaugurated king of the whole nation of Israel. He established the capital in Jerusalem. He won many battles and brought back the ark of God. He had a desire to build the house of the Lord. But then David sinned. He caused Uriah to be killed and took his wife Bathsheba. God judged him with: the death of the child of adultery, the killing of Ammon by Absalom, the rebellion of Absalom, and the rebellion of Sheba. David sinned again by numbering the people. God&rsquo;s judgment came as a pestilence that killed seventy thousand men. God forgave David after his repentance. Out of David&rsquo;s two sins came two issues of importance: he had a son called Solomon who would be the builder of the temple, and he obtained a piece of land to be used as the site of the temple.</p>
<p>F. The sections: 1) David&rsquo;s success (chs. 1&mdash;10), 2) David&rsquo;s failure (chs. 11&mdash;20), and 3) appendix (chs. 21&mdash;24).</p>
 <h2 class="head1">VI. 1 KINGS</h2>
<p>A. The writer(s), the place, and the time: [The books of 1 and 2 Kings were one book in the Hebrew Old Testament. They were divided by the Septuagint. It is hard for Bible scholars to ascertain who was the author of Kings, but some think that Jeremiah was the author.] This book was probably written in Canaan, recording events that occurred between 1015 B.C. and 897 B.C.</p>
<p>B. The subject: Christ the King strengthened the kingdom of God and built up the temple of God, the church.</p>
<p>C. The background: After King David had established the kingdom, prepared material for the temple, and obtained the site for the temple, God did not have him build the temple directly, because he had killed too many people in all his battles. God raised up his son Solomon to build the temple.</p>
<p>D. The central thought: The resurrected Christ will build the church as Solomon built the temple. As God&rsquo;s redeemed ones, we will build the church with Christ. When God&rsquo;s people feared Him, the kingdom prospered. When God&rsquo;s people departed from Him, the kingdom declined. We should all walk and act &ldquo;as our father David did walk.&rdquo; David loved the temple; we should love the church.</p>
<p>E. The general sketch: This book records the latter years of David&rsquo;s life, the inauguration of Solomon, the building of the temple, the latter years of Solomon&rsquo;s life and his degradation, the division of the kingdom into Judah and Israel, the kings of Judah from Rehoboam to Jehoram, the kings of Israel from Jeroboam to Ahaziah, and the acts of Elijah.</p>
<p>The main event in this book is Solomon&rsquo;s building up of the temple and God&rsquo;s glory filling it. This was the peak of the experience of the Israelites in the Old Testament.</p>
<p>F. The sections: 1) the strengthening of the kingdom (chs. 1&mdash;2), 2) the glory of the kingdom (chs. 3&mdash;10), 3) the division of the kingdom (chs. 11&mdash;12:24), and 4) the decline of the kingdom (12:25&mdash;22).</p>
<h2 class="head1">VII. 2 KINGS</h2>
<p>A. The writer(s), the place, and the time: Jeremiah wrote this book. It was probably written in Canaan. The events recorded in this book took place between 896 B.C. and 588 B.C.</p>
<p>B. The subject: The decline and the destruction of the divided kingdoms because of rebellion and idolatry.</p>
<p>C. The background: Because of rebellion, idolatry, and division, the kingdom had declined. Most of the kings did evil in the sight of the Lord. Therefore, the Lord warned them of the destruction that would come if they did not repent.</p>
<p>D. The central thought: When God saw that His people rebelled against Him and turned away from Him to serve the idols, He sent His prophet to warn them. He hoped that they would repent and come back to Him. Therefore, the prophets said, &ldquo;Thus saith the Lord.&rdquo; If they would not listen, His righteous anger would be kindled against them. He would let their enemies overthrow their kingdoms and carry them away into captivity.</p>
<p>E. The general sketch: This book is the record of the kings of the kingdom of Judah and Israel. It also includes the acts of Elisha. It records the history of the kingdom of Judah from Ahaziah to Zedekiah and the kingdom of Israel from Joram to Hoshea.</p>
<p>F. The sections: 1) the latter part of Elijah&rsquo;s ministry (1:1&mdash;2:12), 2) Elisha&rsquo;s ministry (verses within 2:13&mdash;13:25), 3) the decline and the destruction of the kingdom of Israel (verses within 1:17&mdash;17:41), and 4) the decline and the destruction of the kingdom of Judah (verses within 8:16&mdash;25).</p><h2 class="head1">VIII. 1 CHRONICLES</h2>
<p>A. The writer(s), the place, and the time: [The books of 1 and 2 Chronicles were also one book in the Hebrew Old Testament. It was also divided by the Septuagint. This book has been generally ascertained by many authorities to have been written by Ezra. If we compare the ending of Chronicles and the beginning of Ezra, we can see that the style, the grammar, and the phrases are all very similar and have to be from the same author. Thus, it has been proposed that Chronicles was written by Ezra.] He wrote this book in Jerusalem. The events recorded in 1 Chronicles took place between 1056 B.C. and 1015 B.C.</p>
 <p>B. The subject: The review of the history of the children of Israel for the recovery of the temple and the city.</p>
<p>C. The background: When the children of Israel were coming back to rebuild the temple and the city of Jerusalem, there was a need to review their history. By reviewing their history, the children of Israel would know the Lord, worship Him, and serve Him. Although this book may record many things similar to Samuel and Kings, it has a different view. It uses the word and view of God to explain history.</p>
<p>D. The central thought: The Chronicles, from the beginning to the end, reveal to us the greatness of God and His rightful position in the kingdom of His people. Although the people always departed from Him and rebelled against Him, He still was the Lord ruling over the whole earth (29:11-12). God&rsquo;s way of seeing and explaining things is different from man&rsquo;s way. This book also reveals to us that God cares for those who seek after Him, that He is the One who judges and the One who forgives, that He is the God on the throne in every situation, and that He always gets the glory.</p>
<p>E. The general sketch: This book uses approximately nine chapters to review the genealogy of the children of Israel. This review reminded the people that they were the chosen ones. The record here concerning David is positive. This shows that the Lord has forgiven David of his gross sins. This book gives the returning people a positive view of God. It chronicles David&rsquo;s inauguration and his men of valor, the ark of testimony, the prosperity of the kingdom, his desire to build the temple, and his victory. It also tells us about the purchase of the site for the temple, the preparation of the materials for the temple, the priests and the Levites, and the rulers. Lastly, it tells us about David&rsquo;s will concerning the building of the temple.</p>
<p>F. The sections: 1) genealogy (chs. 1&mdash;9:34), 2) Saul (chs. 9:35&mdash;10), 3) David (chs. 11&mdash;20), and 4) preparation for the building of the temple (chs. 21&mdash;29).</p>
<h2 class="head1">IX. 2 CHRONICLES</h2>
<p>A. The writer(s), the place, and the time: (see 1 Chronicles).</p>
<p>B. The subject: (see 1 Chronicles).</p>
<p>C. The background: (see 1 Chronicles).</p>
<p>D. The central thought: All those with a living faith and an overcoming living must fulfill the requirement of seeking, believing, serving, and loving the Lord.</p>
<p>E. The general sketch: This book recounts the history of Solomon strengthening his kingship, the building of the temple, the dedication of the temple and its acceptance by the Lord, Solomon&rsquo;s deeds, his wisdom and glory, and his death. This book also records the kings of Judah from Rehoboam to Zedekiah and the carrying away to Babylon. Praise the Lord! This book does not end with the carrying away to Babylon. It continues to say that there was a decree by Cyrus, the king of Persia, charging the people of God to go back to Jerusalem to build a house for God.</p>
<p>F. The sections: 1) Solomon (chs 1&mdash;9) and 2) the kings of Judah (chs. 10&mdash;36).</p>
<h2 class="head1">X. EZRA</h2>
<p>A. The writer(s), the place, and the time: [The book of Ezra was certainly written by Ezra. Ezra was a very learned scribe and priest. He knew the laws of God very well and therefore was also a lawyer. His books were written in Jerusalem.] This book covers the time between 536 B.C. and 457 B.C.</p>
<p>B. The subject: The recovery of the temple by the remnant of the people.</p>
<p>C. The background: The remnant of the people of God, by His grace and sovereign arrangement, returned to their own land from captivity. They had learned a severe lesson during their captivity; that lesson was to forsake idols. They realized that idolatry was the main cause of their kingdom&rsquo;s destruction (Therefore, from their recovery to the Lord&rsquo;s first coming, the Jews did not worship idols). They remembered Jerusalem during their captivity. They refused to enjoy the pleasures of the Gentiles and did not forget their own country. Nevertheless, they did not have much opportunity to know God, serve Him, and understand His laws. They had married heathen wives. The ministry of Ezra was to rebuild the temple and to cause the people to return to God to know Him, serve Him, and read His laws. He also dealt with them concerning their marriage to heathen wives.</p>
 <p>D. The central thought: As children of God, we should pay attention to God&rsquo;s word and His temple and keep the testimony of our sanctification.</p>
<p>E. The general sketch: The Lord fulfilled the prophecy of Jeremiah. The Lord stirred up the spirit of Cyrus the king to encourage God&rsquo;s people to rise up from their captivity, go up to Jerusalem, bring up the vessels of the house of the Lord, and build up the temple. Then the remnant, about fifty thousand people, went back. First they built an altar. Then they began to build the temple. Overcoming many hindrances, they continued to build until the temple was completed. There was a second return of about two thousand people. Ezra led the second group. After finding out that the people had married strange wives and had practiced according to the Canaanites, he confessed to God the sins of the people. He spoke to the people and they repented. There was a revival following their repentance.</p>
<p>F. The sections: 1) the first return (chs. 1&mdash;6) and 2) the second return (chs. 7&mdash;10).</p><h2 class="head1">XI. NEHEMIAH</h2>
<p>A. The writer(s), the place, and the time: [The book of Nehemiah was certainly written by Nehemiah. Ezra was a descendant of Levi, the tribe of the priests. Nehemiah was a descendant of Judah, the tribe of the kings. One attended to religion, and the other attended to politics. At that time, the Persian Empire treated Judea as a province, and Nehemiah became the governor of Judea. His book was also written in Jerusalem.] This book covers the period of time between 446 B.C. and 434 B.C.</p>
<p>B. The subject: The rebuilding of the wall of Jerusalem in oneness bringing in a revival from a degraded condition.</p>
<p>C. The background: This is the last historical book of the chosen people. The people were poor. They had sold their fields, land, and houses, and had even sold themselves to be slaves. The people had also become intermingled with the heathen. Instead of having a testimony of sanctification, there were mixed multitudes, mixed marriages, priests without proper genealogy, and Ammonites and Moabites living among them, and there were false prophets speaking threatening words. In addition, they had lost their fellowship with God. They had strayed far from God and no longer understood His law, nor did they offer sacrifices or keep the feasts. Their condition was not good at all.</p>
<p>D. The central thought: Praying and laboring with endurance is the secret to succeed in God&rsquo;s work.</p>
<p>E. The general sketch: When Nehemiah heard that those who had returned from the captivity were in great affliction and reproach, and that the wall of Jerusalem was broken down and its gates were burned with fire, he wept, fasting and praying before God. He was ordered by the king of Persia to return to Jerusalem to govern the people of Israel. He encouraged the returned ones to continue and to complete the rebuilding of the walls of Jerusalem, that they would no longer be a reproach. The people strengthened their hands for this good work (2:1-18). Due to opposition, they had to rebuild the walls with one hand doing the work and the other hand holding a weapon. The rebuilding of the wall took fifty-two days.</p>
<p>Ezra joined Nehemiah to recover the things pertaining to the worship of God contained in the book of the law. All the people gathered together to hear the reading of the law. The Sabbath was also recovered. In addition, the people confessed their sin of marrying heathen wives.</p>
<p>F. The sections: 1) the returning (ch. 1&mdash;2:16), 2) building the wall in afflictions (2:17&mdash;7:4), 3) reckoning by genealogy (7:5-73), 4) the congregation (chs. 8&mdash;11), 5) reckoning the priests&rsquo; genealogy (12:1-26), 6) the dedication of the wall (12:27-47), and 7) the reformation and recovery (ch. 13).</p>
 <h2 class="head1">XII. ESTHER</h2>
<p>A. The writer(s), the place, and the time: [It is hard to ascertain the authorship of the book of Esther. Probably Mordecai was the author, because in 9:20 and 23 it is mentioned that Mordecai recorded the happenings then. He was one who loved God and loved the Jews. If it was written by him, it was written in the heathen city of Shushan.] This book records the period between 521 B.C. and 509 B.C.</p>
<p>B. The subject: The invisible God saving His scattered people who trust in Him.</p>
<p>C. The background: Ezra and Nehemiah recorded God&rsquo;s care for the remnant that returned to the good land. Esther tells us how God also kept the scattered Jews in a heathen land. God is not mentioned in this book; therefore, some people wonder if it is the word of God. The beauty of this book is that some portions should mention God yet do not. By faith, we see the invisible God keeping His people who trust in Him.</p>
<p>D. The central thought: God&rsquo;s visible and hidden care keeps His people in matters both great and small.</p>
<p>E. The general sketch: Esther, a Jew, became the queen of Ahasuerus after the original queen was removed due to disobedience. Mordecai, Esther&rsquo;s relative, saved the kings&rsquo; life by exposing a conspiracy against the king. These two were used by God to deliver his people from Haman&rsquo;s wicked plot to kill all the Jews in the kingdom of Ahasuerus. By God&rsquo;s sovereignty, Haman was hung on the gallows that he had built to hang Mordecai. All the Jews were saved from execution. The Jews remember their salvation from evil Haman by keeping the feast of Purim until now.</p>
<p>F. The sections: 1) the feast of Ahasuerus (chs. 1&mdash;2), 2) the feast of Esther (chs. 3&mdash;7), and 3) the feast of Purim (chs. 8&mdash;10).</p>

<h2 class="head2">Text</h2>
<p>There are five books in the Bible considered to be poetry: Job, Psalms, Proverbs, Ecclesiastes, and the Song of Songs. The book of Lamentations is also poetic in form, but it is considered as a supplement to the book of Jeremiah, even referred to as &ldquo;the Second Book of Jeremiah&rdquo; by some ancient writings; therefore, it is not included among the books of poetry.</p>
<p>The content of the books of poetry is the various spiritual experiences gained by the people of God in their living, expressed through poetry as they were moved by the Holy Spirit; it is the pouring out of their hearts. So, the poetry in the Bible is not abstract, impractical, or unrealistic.</p>
<h2 class="head1">I. JOB</h2>
<p>A. The writer(s), the place, and the time: There is great contention about the authorship of the book of Job. [The things recorded in this book took place before the time of Moses and may have been concurrent with Abraham, which is about two thousand years before Christ. Some have said it was written by Elihu, and some have said that Moses was probably the author.] Job lived in Uz, in the southern part of Edom, west of the Arabian plain, at the border of Canaan. Uz belongs to Edom (Lam. 4:21). The events recorded in this book probably took place within one year&rsquo;s time.</p>
<p>B. The subject: God&rsquo;s people having deeper and higher visions and experiences of God in spite of Satan&rsquo;s attack.</p>
<p>C. The background: Job was blameless and upright before God. He was one who feared God and shunned evil. He became a glory to God before Satan. Satan thought that Job loved God because God blessed him with many physical blessings, so he requested and received God&rsquo;s permission to test him by destroying everything he had. Ultimately, God and Job triumphed. Job was proven to love God regardless of his outward situation, and Satan was defeated.</p>
<p>D. The central thought: God allows Satan to attack godly people so that they may have deeper experiences and visions. We may not understand why certain things happen, but we believe &ldquo;that God causes all things to work together for good to those who love God&rdquo; (Rom. 8:28).</p>
<p>E. The general sketch: God boasted of Job before Satan. Satan accused Job before God twice. He obtained permission to ruin what Job had and to cause Job to suffer. During Satan&rsquo;s attack, Job&rsquo;s three friends came to visit. They tried to comfort Job during his suffering, but, because they did not know God&rsquo;s will, they could only offer their opinions. Job was somewhat affected by them. Elihu, a young man, having more knowledge of God, spoke something better; however, because he lacked maturity, he also was unable to help Job.</p>
<p>When God appeared and spoke to Job face to face, he understood what was going on. He saw God. He knew God. All his problems were solved. Praise the Lord! What we need is to contact God.</p>
<p>F. The sections: 1) introduction (1:1&mdash;2:10), 2) Job and his three friends (2:11&mdash;31), 3) Job and Elihu (chs. 32&mdash;37), 4) Job talking to God face to face (ch. 38&mdash;42:9), and 5) conclusion (42:10-17).</p><h2 class="head1">II. PSALMS</h2>
<p>A. The writer(s), the place, and the time: There are more writers of this book than of any other book in the Bible. David wrote most of the psalms; therefore, the Psalms are sometimes called the Psalms of David. According to the headings of the psalms, seventy-three psalms were written by David; twelve psalms were written by Asaph; one psalm was written by Heman; and one psalm was written by Ethan. Ten psalms were written by the sons of Korah. Two psalms were written by Solomon. One psalm was written by Moses. Fifty psalms did not have a heading. Of the fifty without a heading, a few are written by David, such as: Psalm 2 (Acts 4:25), Psalm 95 (Heb. 4:7), Psalm 96 (1 Chron. 16:23-33), and Psalm 105 (1 Chron. 16:8-22). Although many people wrote the Psalms, it was inspired by the one Holy Spirit.</p>
<p>Most of the psalms were probably written in Israel, except Psalm 90, which was written by Moses in the wilderness.</p>
<p>The earliest psalm was written by Moses about 1500 B.C. (Psalm 90), and the last one was probably Psalm 137, which was written after the children of Israel had been taken into captivity.</p>
<p>B. The subject: the praises of the saints revealing Christ and typifying the church.</p>
<p>C. The background: Psalms is the second book of poetry. Job leads us into the school of God to be educated to know God. The Psalms leads us into the Holy of Holies for us to fellowship with God through prayers, aspirations, meditations, desires, and praises. [All Christians know that in the Bible there is a wonderful book called the Psalms. Yet most of them merely know that this book is wonderful; they cannot tell why it is so wonderful. The Psalms are indeed very impressive to the reader. Whoever reads the Psalms is touched. The reason the Psalms are so touching is because they are not mere teachings; they are the sentiments and impressions of the godly saints <em>in their experiences.</em> Moreover, these expressions are uttered in praises to God, not in ordinary talk. These are not praises according to doctrine, but praises according to the feelings and impressions which the godly saints have derived from their experiences.]</p>
<p>D. The central thought: The psalms [are the expression, in their praises to God, of the sentiments and impressions of the godly saints in their experiences, in and through which Christ is revealed and the Church as God&rsquo;s house and God&rsquo;s city is typified.]</p>
<p>E. The general sketch: We can look at Psalms from the human point of view or from the divine point of view. [From the human point of view it is one thing, and from the divine it is another. According to the human concept it is one thing, but according to the divine it is another. From the human standpoint, we may say that the center and content of all the Psalms are the experiences of the saints concerning God&rsquo;s mercy, kindness, love, faithfulness, power, and glory. They experienced so much of God&rsquo;s goodness that they praised God with all these aspects of their experience of God. This is the human concept, this is the human point of view. But according to the divine concept and the divine point of view, the center and content of all the praises are Christ, the house and the city of God. Christ is the center, and the church, typified by the house and the city, is also the center. Christ and the church are the center and content of all the praises of the Psalms. Therefore, in all our praises we must have the sentiments and impressions gathered from our experience; yet in all our praises we must have Christ and the church as the center and the content.]</p>
<p>F. The sections: The Psalms were divided into five sections, called books. No one knows who divided the Psalms into five books, nor why they did so. It is traditionally believed that Book I was compiled by David, Book II by Hezekiah, Book III by Josiah, and Books IV and V by Ezra and Nehemiah. Regardless of who compiled them, one thing is for sure: it was the work of the Holy Spirit arranging the Psalms into these five books through the hand of man.</p>
<p>When you look at these five books according to the experience of the children of Israel, you can see that they correspond to the five books of Moses respectively. But according to spiritual experience, they show us the ascending steps of the experiences of Christ and the church. Let us look at them according to these two views.</p>
<p>According to the experience of the children of Israel:</p>
<ol class="decimal">
<li>Book I (Psa. 1&mdash;41) corresponds to Genesis.
	<ol class="lower-alpha">
	<li>The blessing of man (Psa. 1)</li>
	<li>The fall of man (Psa. 2&mdash;15, man became enemies of God due to the fall.)</li>
	<li>The recovery of man (Psa. 16&mdash;41, man recovered the position of blessing because of salvation.)</li>
	</ol></li>

Numbers is a book of the wilderness, or a book of land. The central thought of this book is land. The children of Israel, while wandering in the wilderness, longed for that more beautiful land in which they could obtain rest; the psalms of the kingdom in this book reveal that God will cause His people to obtain rest in the good land.</li>

</ol><h2 class="head1">III. PROVERBS</h2>
<p>A. The writer(s), the place, and the time: Like Psalms, Proverbs is a compilation; it was not written by one person. Just as David is the most important contributing author of the Psalms, Solomon is the most significant author of Proverbs (1:1; 10:1; 25:1). Solomon wrote three thousand proverbs (1 Kings 4:32; cf. Eccl. 12:9), and this book contains the best selections from among those proverbs. In addition to the ones he wrote himself, he also collected a number of traditional and popular sayings and converted them into proverbs; in this book they are referred to as the &ldquo;words of the wise&rdquo; (22:17; 24:23). Chapter 30 consists of the proverbs of Agur; chapter 31 is the sayings of Lemuel.</p>
<p>The origin of this book is as follows: first, from among Solomon&rsquo;s three thousand proverbs, some were selected which were more important and regularly quoted. Then, during the time of Hezekiah, this king added some of the proverbs of his ancestors to the collection (chs. 25&mdash;29). Finally, the proverbs of Agur and Lemuel were added, thus completing the book of Proverbs that we have today.</p>
<p>Regardless of the writers&rsquo; identity or the process by which it was compiled, the proverbs in this book are not ordinary exhortations urging men to be virtuous, or teaching ethics and good behavior, but they are golden verses inspired by the one Holy Spirit to cause men to revere and respect God.</p>
<p>B. The subject: living a godly life by God&rsquo;s wisdom&mdash;Christ.</p>
<p>C. The background: Proverbs have existed from the most ancient times, and they were especially popular in the East. People used them to instruct young children, because in those days books were very scarce and expensive, not easy to come by, but proverbs were compact and simple, easy to remember. Often one brief and weighty, powerful proverb became a person&rsquo;s motto, affecting his manner of living for his entire life.</p>
<p>D. The central thought: Seek after wisdom so that you may live a godly life on earth that is acceptable to God.</p>
<p>E. The general sketch: The beginning of this book clearly states: &ldquo;The proverbs of Solomon...to know wisdom and instruction&rdquo; (1:1, 2). So the purpose of this book is to seek &ldquo;wisdom.&rdquo; &ldquo;Counsel,&rdquo; &ldquo;prudence,&rdquo; &ldquo;discretion,&rdquo; &ldquo;instruction,&rdquo; &ldquo;understanding,&rdquo; and &ldquo;knowledge,&rdquo; spoken of in this book, are all &ldquo;wisdom,&rdquo; whereas &ldquo;simple,&rdquo; &ldquo;fools,&rdquo; &ldquo;folly,&rdquo; &ldquo;void of understanding,&rdquo; &ldquo;foolishness,&rdquo; &ldquo;ignominy,&rdquo; and &ldquo;without knowledge&rdquo; all refer to the opposite of &ldquo;wisdom.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wisdom&rdquo; here does not refer to the &ldquo;wisdom of the world&rdquo; (1 Cor. 1:20). Human philosophy, science, common sense, comprehension, discernment, and aptitude are not what is meant by &ldquo;wisdom.&rdquo; Rather, the wisdom spoken of here indicates man&rsquo;s knowledge and fear toward God. &ldquo;The fear of Jehovah is the beginning of wisdom, and the knowledge of the Holy One is understanding&rdquo; (9:10). God is omniscient. The true wisdom is to know Him and understand His ways; it is to fear Him and carry out His will. If you have such wisdom, then you can show forth holiness, righteousness, goodness, noble characteristics, and all-surpassing virtues in your living.</p>
<p>But how can one attain to such true wisdom? The Old Testament believers had to deeply know and strictly fear God. We, the New Testament believers, are more blessed than they, because we simply need to believe in the Lord Jesus. The &ldquo;wisdom&rdquo; which was in ancient times, which from the beginning was in the presence of God, through which He created the universe (8:22-31) has become flesh and dwelt among us, and this is our Lord. Whoever has the Lord Jesus has that &ldquo;wisdom,&rdquo; because He is God&rsquo;s wisdom (1 Cor. 1:24), and He has become wisdom to us from God (1 Cor. 1:30).</p>
<p>Although this book is in the Old Testament, it is also valuable to New Testament believers, because it is full of advice on how to deal with people, standards of behavior, governing principles for a believer&rsquo;s walk, how to be free from evil snares, and how to receive God&rsquo;s approval. With regards to the believers who seek and wait on God, 3:5-6 and 8:17 are words of comfort and guarantee. Towards suffering, disciplined believers, 3:12 is a word full of help and guidance.</p>
<p>F. The sections: Proverbs is primarily composed of stand-alone golden verses, not necessarily related to the ones before and after. Therefore, it is more difficult to divide into sections than any other book.</p>
 <p>We can divide it into five sections according to content: 1) foreword (1:1-6), 2) the importance of seeking wisdom and the danger of lacking it (1:7&mdash;9), 3) comparison between wise and foolish, virtuous and evil (chs. 10&mdash;24), 4) proverbs compiled during the time of Hezekiah (chs. 25&mdash;29), and 5) common proverbs: a) the words of Agur (ch. 30) and b) the words of Lemuel (ch. 31).</p><h2 class="head1">IV. ECCLESIASTES</h2>
<p>A. The writer(s), the place, and the time: Although this book does not clearly name Solomon as its author, and although many Bible readers attribute its authorship to other people, yet according to the contents of the entire book we can say with certainty that Solomon wrote it. We can say this because the author was:</p>
<ol class="decimal">
<li>A son of David (1:1).</li>
<li>A king in Jerusalem (1:1).</li>
<li>A man of great wisdom, above all that were before him in Jerusalem (1:16; 1 Kings 3:12).</li>
<li>One who had done great works and built houses (2:4; 1 Kings 7:1-2).</li>
<li>Possessor of many wives and concubines (2:8 (Darby); 1 Kings 11:1-3).</li>
<li>One who had gathered to himself silver and gold and the peculiar treasure of kings and of the provinces (2:8; 1 Kings 9:28; 10:10-11, 14-24).</li>
<li>One who had set in order many proverbs (12:9; 1 Kings 4:32).</li>
</ol>
<p>In the Bible, no other person meets all the above qualifications except Solomon; therefore, no one else could possibly have written this book.</p>
<p>This book was written in Israel during Solomon&rsquo;s later years.</p>
<p>B. The subject: A living and seeking apart from God can never lead to true satisfaction.</p>
<p>C. The background: The Holy Spirit selected Solomon to write this book because he had been through a time of failure. God had established him as king, and had granted him great wisdom. At first, he used this wisdom to take care of God&rsquo;s people, but later he became proud of his great wisdom and followed his unbridled lusts, rebelling against God and seeking earthly luxuries. God had commanded concerning kings, &ldquo;Only he shall not multiply horses to himself, nor cause the people to return to Egypt, to the end that he may multiply horses: forasmuch as Jehovah hath said unto you, Ye shall henceforth return no more that way&rdquo; (Deut. 17:16), but he &ldquo;had forty thousand stalls of horses for his chariots, and twelve thousand horsemen&rdquo; (1 Kings 4:26), &ldquo;and the horses which Solomon had were brought out of Egypt&rdquo; (1 Kings 10:28). God had made another commandment regarding kings: &ldquo;Neither shall he multiply wives to himself, that his heart turn not away&rdquo; (Deut. 17:17), but he &ldquo;had seven hundred wives...and three hundred concubines: and his wives turned away his heart...after other gods&rdquo; (1 Kings 11:3-4). Another commandment that God had given concerning kings was: &ldquo;Neither shall he greatly multiply to himself silver and gold&rdquo; (Deut. 17:17), but he had a tremendous amount of gold, and &ldquo;silver...was nothing accounted of&rdquo; and &ldquo;as stones...for abundance&rdquo; (1 Kings 10:21, 27). All the commandments concerning kings were broken by Solomon. He had the highest position, the greatest wisdom, and the top endowments. One could say that no other person under the sun was more qualified to seek after earthly education, renown, enjoyment, and pleasure. He obtained them all, but still these were not able to satisfy him. Eventually, he reached a point where he could only say, &ldquo;Vanity of vanities...vanity of vanities, all is vanity&rdquo; (1:2). So, we can also say that there is no other person under the sun more qualified to write the book of Ecclesiastes than Solomon.</p>
<p>In Solomon&rsquo;s later years, after his recovery, the Holy Spirit moved him to write the book of Ecclesiastes, reminding him of how the time that he had spent apart from God seeking the world had caused him to become disappointed and dissatisfied, resulting in pessimism and disillusionment. Then, after he had been fully recovered, the Holy Spirit moved him further to write the Song of Songs, expressing the true satisfaction which he had achieved only after returning to the presence of God.</p>
<p>D. The central thought: A man may attain to all the education, knowledge, treasures, riches, renown, position, enjoyment, and pleasure that the world has to offer, yet if he does not have God, it is still all vanity, because the end is &ldquo;once to die, and after this judgment&rdquo; (Heb. 9:27).</p>
<p>E. The general sketch: The author uses several experiences to prove his point:</p>
<ol class="decimal">
<li>The study of natural phenomena results in disgust, causing one to feel that all is tasteless and nothing is new (1:4-11).</li>
<li>Pursuit of wisdom and knowledge is also vexation of spirit (1:12-18).</li>
<li>Pursuit of mirth (2:1-11)&mdash;pleasure (v. 1), wine (v. 3), houses and gardens (vv. 4-6), possessions (v. 7), music (v. 8), concubines (v. 8), treasures (v. 8)&mdash;is also eventually just vanity.</li>
<li>Wisdom excels folly, but the two have the same result, which is still vanity (2:12-26).</li>
<li>Fatalism still does not satisfy (3:1-15).</li>
<li>Becoming pessimistic, disillusioned, and vexed, one is still unable to be satisfied (3:16-4:16).</li>
<li>Performing all the religious rituals, one still feels that God is far away and unreachable (5:1-8).</li>
<li>Pursuit of wealth and riches cannot satisfy and is also vanity (5:9&mdash;6:12).</li>
<li>Pursuit of greater wisdom and higher virtues and ethics (7:1&mdash;12:12) results still in &ldquo;vanity of vanities, all is vanity&rdquo; (12:8).</li>
</ol>
<p>F. The sections: 1) title (1:1-3), 2) experience (1:4&mdash;12:12), and 3) conclusion (12:13-14).</p><h2 class="head1">V. SONG OF SONGS</h2>
<p>A. The writer(s), the place, and the time: The Song of Songs was written by Solomon in Israel during his later years and is just as difficult to understand as Proverbs and Ecclesiastes.</p>
<p>B. The subject: loving the Lord to experience Him as life for the building up of His Body, the bride.</p>
<p>C. The background: This book follows Ecclesiastes and is in contrast with and supplementary to it. Ecclesiastes tells us that if man abandons God and seeks anything under the sun, the result is &ldquo;vanity of vanities, all is vanity.&rdquo; The Song of Songs tells us that if man yearns for the Lord, pursuing everything in Christ, the result is satisfaction of satisfactions, all is satisfaction.</p>
<p>Poetry is the expression of the moving within the human heart, the writing of the experiences of human life. These five books of poetry&mdash;Job, Psalms, Proverbs, Ecclesiastes, and the Song of Songs&mdash;also show forth the good pleasure of the Holy Spirit, telling of our experiences and seekings along the spiritual way. Through suffering (Job), we are brought into prayer and fellowship in the presence of God (Psalms), through which prayer we receive wisdom and revelation (Proverbs) and are ushered into the realization of the vanity of all things apart from God (Ecclesiastes) and the satisfaction in Christ (Song of Songs).</p>
<p>D. The central thought: The believers need to seek after the Lord to fellowship with Him in love. This seeking causes them to get out of themselves through the work of the cross and to be transformed by the Spirit. The result is the Body of Christ, the bride of Christ ready to be raptured into the wedding feast with the Lord.</p>
<p>E. The general sketch: Some say that Solomon wrote this book based on one of his own love stories, which may have taken place as follows:</p>
<p>In Ephraim, Baalhaman, Solomon had a vineyard which he gave to a family of the people of Ephraim to take care of. Their father had evidently already died. Their mother had at least two sons and two daughters; the two daughters were the Shulamite and her younger sister (1:6; 8:8). When she was at home, the Shulamite&rsquo;s older brothers abused her, forcing her to give up her own vineyard to take care of theirs, and also compelling her to shepherd their sheep, so that her face became blackened by extended exposure to the sun. One day a handsome young man in shepherd&rsquo;s garb came from far away, paying particular attention to the young woman and making friends with her. Then the Shulamite said, &ldquo;Look not upon me, because I am swarthy, because the sun has scorched me. My mother&rsquo;s sons were incensed against me; they made me keeper of the vineyards; but mine own vineyard have I not kept. Tell me, O thou whom my soul loveth, where thou feedest thy flock&rdquo; (1:6-7). The shepherd responded by calling her &ldquo;fairest among women&rdquo; (1:8). After a while, they fell in love. One day, the shepherd bid her farewell, promising to return soon to marry her. But after he left, there was no news from him. Although the other people around her told her that she had been tricked by the shepherd, she refused to listen, firmly believing that their engagement was irrevocable. After waiting for a long time without his return, she longed for him so much that she felt sick, sometimes imagining that she saw him. Then one day she noticed clouds of dust flying up along one of the mountain roads of Ephraim, as if many carriages were approaching. Soon a messenger arrived, informing her that the king was on his way to marry her. At first, the Shulamite did not know what to say, but as soon as she caught sight of the king, she recognized him as her beloved shepherd, so she cried out triumphantly, &ldquo;I am my beloved&rsquo;s, and his desire is toward me&rdquo; (7:10). (This is also the story of each one of us. From Genesis all the way to Revelation, the whole Bible is a record of how our good Shepherd left His glory and His throne to come to earth to seek out His bride of lowly birth. When He had found her, He left her for a while, promising that He would come back to claim her. Now we are in the time of waiting. May we have as much faith, patience, longing, and fervent love as the Shulamite had, and may we have the same cry as she had&mdash;&ldquo;Make haste, my beloved, to come!&rdquo;)</p>
<p>F. The sections: 1) initial seeking and satisfaction (1:1&mdash;2:7), 2) the calling to put off the self (2:8&mdash;3:5), 3) the calling to ascend to the heavens (3:6&mdash;5:1), 4) after resurrection, the more severe calling of the cross (5:2&mdash;6:13), 5) God&rsquo;s work (ch. 7), and 6) the sighing of the flesh (ch. 8).</p>

<h2 class="head2">Text</h2>
<h2 class="head1">I. ISAIAH</h2>
<h2 class="head2">A. The Writer(s), the Place, and the Time</h2>
<p>The book of Isaiah is named after its author. All the other books of the prophets are also named in this way. [Isaiah means &ldquo;Jehovah saves.&rdquo; Isaiah the son of Amoz (Isa. 1:1) was a contemporary of Amos and Hosea, the prophets in the kingdom of Israel, and of Micah, the prophet in the kingdom of Judah. His prophetic ministry lasted the longest; he prophesied under the reigns of four kings: Uzziah, Jotham, Ahaz, and Hezekiah (1:1). His wife was a prophetess (8:3), and he had at least two sons: Shear-jashub (meaning, &ldquo;a remnant shall return&rdquo;) and Maher-shalal-hash-baz (meaning &ldquo;quickly the spoil, hasting the prey&rdquo;) (7:3; 8:3). He was a historian (2 Chron. 26:22; 32:32). According to a credible tradition among the Jews and some rabbinic writings of the second century, he suffered martyrdom during the reign of Manasseh (2 Kings 21:16; 24:4; cf. Acts 7:52) by being sawn asunder. Hebrews 2:13b shows that he (Isaiah) and the children whom God gave to him (Isa. 8:18) typify Christ and the believers whom God gave to him.]</p>
<p>Isaiah was written in Jerusalem from about 760 B.C. to 698 B.C.</p>
<h2 class="head2">B. The Subject</h2>
<p>The subject is [the salvation of Jehovah through the incarnated, crucified, resurrected, ascended, and coming Christ.]</p>
<h2 class="head2">C. The Background</h2>
<p>Israel, the people of God, rebelled against God. They did not know Jehovah and had become full of iniquities and corruption. Jehovah needed to chastise His people. First He prophesied concerning His chastisement, then He hired the nations to chastise them. However, the nations were excessive in carrying out God&rsquo;s intentions; thus, He also prophesied concerning His judgment on the nations. He then unveiled His ultimate desire&mdash;His chastisement of Israel and judgment upon the nations would usher in the God-man, Christ, and issue in the restoration of the nation of Israel.</p>
<h2 class="head2">D. The Central Thought</h2>
<p>[Christ is God incarnated in humanity to be the Savior of man, that all the God-created universe, which is fallen, might be restored and consummate in the new heaven and new earth for eternity.]</p>
<h2 class="head2">E. The General Sketch:</h2>
<p>[God&rsquo;s dealing in love with His beloved Israel and His righteous judgment upon the nations bring in Christ, the Savior (43:3; 49:26), who is God (9:6) incarnated to be a man (7:14), possessing both the divine and human natures (4:2), living on this earth (53:2-3; 42:1-4), crucified (53:7-10a, 12), resurrected (53:10b-11), ascended (52:13), and coming (40:10; 64:1) to meet the need of God&rsquo;s chosen people and the nations (9:1-7; 49:6) in God&rsquo;s all-inclusive salvation (12:2-3), that the restoration of all things (2:2-5; 11:6-9; 35:1-10; 30:26) may be brought in, which will consummate in the new heaven and new earth for eternity (65:17). Hence, the content of Isaiah covers God&rsquo;s entire economy of the New Testament, from the incarnation to the new heaven and new earth, with the Old Testament background of God&rsquo;s dealing with Israel and His judgment upon the nations.]</p>
<h2 class="head2">F. The Sections</h2>
<p>1) The salvation of Jehovah to His beloved people and to the nations (chs. 1&mdash;12), 2) the judgment of Jehovah upon the nations (chs. 13&mdash;23), 3) the issue of Jehovah&rsquo;s dealing with His beloved Israel (chs. 24&mdash;35), 4) an example of seeking after Jehovah and trusting in Him (chs. 36&mdash;39), and 5) the Servant of Jehovah and the salvation brought in by Him (chs. 40&mdash;66).</p><h2 class="head1">II. JEREMIAH</h2>
<h2 class="head2">A. The Writer(s), the Place, and the Time</h2>
<p>[Jeremiah, the son of Hilkiah the priest, was born in Anathoth (Jer. 1:1). He was born as a priest and was called to be a prophet in the thirteenth year of King Josiah. He spoke for the Lord until the captivity of Israel (Jer. 1:2-3, 5-7). Among all the prophets, he was the one who suffered the most persecution. Except for a few of the kings, leaders, priests, and people, everyone was against him and hated him. The false prophets, who assumed to speak in God&rsquo;s name, especially lied about and contradicted his prophecy. Finally, Azariah and Johanan and those who were close to Egypt forced him to go to Egypt (Jer. 43:2-7).]</p>
<p>Most of this book was written in Judah; the final chapters were written in Egypt. It spans from 629 B.C. to 588 B.C.</p>
<h2 class="head2">B. The Subject</h2>
<p>The subject is the salvation of Jehovah through Christ, the righteous Sprout, administered according to a new covenant.</p>
<h2 class="head2">C. The Background</h2>
<p>The kings and people of Israel had committed sins and were full of wickedness; they worshipped idols, rejected God&rsquo;s word, and were extremely unrestrained. Jeremiah prophesied that they needed to repent and turn back to Jehovah; otherwise, they would be carried into captivity and their nation would be destroyed.</p>
<h2 class="head2">D. The Central Thought</h2>
<p>The judgment of Jehovah on sin is definite. His love and faithfulness are also definite and eternal. The ones who went astray should repent and come back to His bosom.</p>
<h2 class="head2">E. The General Sketch</h2>
<p>Jehovah rebuked the kings and the people for their sins. They had forsaken God and disobeyed His word (2:13; 9:13). They were worshipping idols and committing fornication (1:16; 11:13). They also spoke lies, deceiving others, and committed iniquity (9:3, 5; 11:10). The kings scattered God&rsquo;s people and did not care for them. [Jeremiah, on one hand, rebuked the kings and the people for their sins and wanted them to repent; on the other hand, he warned them that they would be taken into captivity, that their nation would be destroyed, and that the cities of Judah and Jerusalem would become desolate.]</p>
<h2 class="head2">F. The Sections</h2>
<p>1) The calling and commission of the prophet (ch. 1), 2) the prophet in Judah before the fall of Jerusalem (chs. 2&mdash;38), 3) the fall of Jerusalem (ch. 39), 4) the prophet in Judah after the captivity (chs. 40&mdash;43:7), 5) the prophet in Egypt (chs. 43:8&mdash;51), and 6) conclusion (ch. 52).</p>
<h2 class="head1">III. LAMENTATIONS</h2>
<h2 class="head2">A. The Writer(s), the Place, and the Time</h2>
<p>The writer of Lamentations is also Jeremiah. This book was once part of the book of Jeremiah, and at one time it was called &ldquo;the Second Book of Jeremiah.&rdquo; According to Jewish tradition and the translators of the Septuagint, this book was written by the prophet after Nebuchadnezzar&rsquo;s final destruction of Jerusalem. This would mean that it was written about 588 B.C.</p>
<p>This book was most probably written in Jerusalem. Outside the city, facing Golgotha (also called Calvary), there is a hidden cave which is called the cave of Jeremiah. It is said that the prophet used to sit there to mourn for that desolate city, and that it is there that he wrote the lamentations recorded in this book.</p>
<h2 class="head2">B. The Subject</h2>
<p>The subject is repentance from the sin that brought in the righteous judgment of God results in His merciful salvation and restoration.</p>
<h2 class="head2">C. The Background</h2>
<p>[Jerusalem fell and the people were taken captive. All the warnings of Jeremiah were fulfilled. But because he loved God and God&rsquo;s people, Jeremiah could not bear to see the fall of Israel and the loss of God&rsquo;s glory due to the degradation of the people of Israel. Thus Jeremiah wrote Lamentations and wept for them.]</p>
<h2 class="head2">D. The Central Thought</h2>
<p>The central thought is the suffering and calamities brought on by sin, and the mercy and lovingkindness which Jehovah still has toward His children even when He is angry.</p>
<h2 class="head2">E. The General Sketch</h2>
<p>[Lamentations, composed of five chapters which are five songs, may be divided into five sections: suffering, lamenting, hope, confessing, and prayer. Except for the fifth, each song speaks first of the tragic destruction of Jerusalem and then of the righteousness of God&rsquo;s severe judgment. &ldquo;How doth the city sit solitary, that was full of people! how is she become as a widow! she that was great among the nations&rdquo; (1:1). &ldquo;How hath the Lord covered the daughter of Zion with a cloud in his anger, and cast down from heaven unto the earth the beauty of Israel&rdquo; (2:1). &ldquo;The Lord is righteous; for I have rebelled against his commandment&rdquo; (1:18). &ldquo;Mine eyes do fail with tears, my bowels are troubled, my liver is poured upon the earth, for the destruction of the daughter of my people&rdquo; (2:11). &ldquo;Turn thou us unto thee, O Lord, and we shall be turned; renew our days as of old&rdquo; (5:21).]</p>
<h2 class="head2">F. The Sections</h2>
<p>1) Suffering (ch. 1), 2) lamenting (ch. 2), 3) hope (ch. 3), 4) confessing (ch. 4), and 5) prayer (ch. 5).</p><h2 class="head1">IV. EZEKIEL</h2>
<h2 class="head2">A. The Writer(s), the Place, and the Time</h2>
<p>Ezekiel, the son of Buzi, was a priest (Ezek. 1:3). His name means &ldquo;God strengthens&rdquo; or &ldquo;God is the strength.&rdquo; His prophetic work was carried out in Babylon, from 595 B.C. to 574 B.C.</p>
<h2 class="head2">B. The Subject</h2>
<p>The subject is the spiritual recovery of God&rsquo;s people by being revived in spirit to be built up into the full expression of God.</p>
<h2 class="head2">C. The Background</h2>
<p>The people of God were judged because of their sins and were carried into captivity, but God still loved them and had mercy on them. He wanted to recover them and bring them back to rebuild the temple and the holy city, Jerusalem. [He sternly rebuked the leaders and people of Israel for turning away from God, worshipping idols, committing fornications, and doing all kinds of evil. He transmitted the word of God to the children of Israel who were in captivity (Ezek. 3:10-11); he continued and confirmed that which was spoken by Jeremiah (Jer. 29:1-14), earnestly telling them that before they could return to Jerusalem they needed to turn back to Jehovah their God. Although it was very difficult in the beginning and although he encountered great opposition (Ezek. 3:7-9), the people in captivity eventually detested the idols, turned their hearts to God, and were returned to their homeland after seventy years. This was mostly the result of the work of the prophet Ezekiel.]</p>
<h2 class="head2">D. The Central Thought</h2>
<p>God is righteous toward His people; He cannot tolerate sin, and He must judge them. However, He is also full of lovingkindness toward them, hoping that they will repent and turn back to Him, that He might receive them and pour out His grace upon them.</p>
<h2 class="head2">E. The General Sketch</h2>
<p>Ezekiel saw the visions in the land of captivity concerning the spiritual recovery of God&rsquo;s people signified by the wind, the cloud, the fire, and the electrum (ch. 1). God revives His people and gives them a new heart and a new spirit (ch. 36). God&rsquo;s people, as the dry bones, are revived and formed into God&rsquo;s army (ch. 37). Then, Ezekiel reveals the rebuilding of the holy city and the holy temple (chs. 40&mdash;48). [There are forty-eight chapters in Ezekiel. At the end God obtains a holy temple and a holy city in the holy land. The holy temple is for God&rsquo;s presence, fellowship, and service, whereas the holy city is for God&rsquo;s ruling, administration, and government. The building of the holy city and the holy temple are the issue of the enjoyment of God by His people in their living in the holy land. When God&rsquo;s people have an abundant and full enjoyment of God, He obtains from them an expression in fullness, God&rsquo;s house and God&rsquo;s city. Here God can fellowship with man and rule through man; man can enjoy God, and God can also enjoy man. Man can be filled to the uttermost with God and can express God.]</p>
<h2 class="head2">F. The Sections</h2>
<p>1) The manifestation of the glory of Jehovah (chs. 1&mdash;3), 2) the departure of the glory of Jehovah (chs. 4&mdash;24), 3) Jehovah&rsquo;s glory in dealing with the nations (chs. 25&mdash;32), and 4) the return of the glory of Jehovah (chs. 33&mdash;48).</p><h2 class="head1">V. DANIEL</h2>
<h2 class="head2">A. The Writer(s), the Place, and the Time</h2>
<p>Daniel was of the children of Judah (1:6). His name means &ldquo;God is the Judge&rdquo; or &ldquo;my God is the Judge.&rdquo; This book covers approximately seventy-three years, from 607 B.C. to 534 B.C.</p>
<h2 class="head2">B. The Subject</h2>
<p>The subject is the judgment and destruction of Satan and the kingdoms of the world ushering in Christ and the kingdom of God.</p>
<h2 class="head2">C. The Background</h2>
<p>[In the third year of the reign of Jehoiakim king of Judah, Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon came to Jerusalem and carried away Daniel and his three friends (Dan. 1:1-6). They were chosen to be taught in the palace and prepared to serve the king, for they were well favored, skillful in all wisdom, and gifted in knowledge and the understanding of science.</p>
<p>But Daniel purposed in his heart that he would not defile himself with the portion of the king&rsquo;s meat, nor with the wine which he drank: therefore he requested of the prince of the eunuchs that he might not defile himself. Daniel requested that they be tested ten days by being given only vegetables to eat and water to drink, after which their countenances would be judged. At the end of ten days, their countenances appeared fairer and fatter in flesh than all the rest. Hence, the prince of the eunuchs allowed them to take vegetables and water only (Dan. 1:8-16).</p>
<p>At that time, God&rsquo;s people were carried away, the house of God was destroyed, and the vessels of the house were taken to the house of the false gods (Dan. 1:2; 2 Chron. 36:7). The dominion and glory of God on the earth were completely gone. The people were under the rule of the king of Babylon and were associated with demons, because even the food they ate and the wine they drank, being sacrificed to demons, were defiled and unclean. In such a time, God gained Daniel and his three friends, some who cared for the dominion and glory of God. They were determined that, by refraining from eating the royal food and drinking the royal wine, they would not be defiled. Hence, they were the overcomers in captivity.]</p>
<p>Since Daniel was such a person, he was able to pray for the holy city and the holy temple of God until they were recovered. He was a man of God who turned the age of captivity to recovery. He was also able to interpret dreams and see visions. All young people should take Daniel and his three friends as examples.</p>
<h2 class="head2">D. The Central Thought</h2>
<p>The most high God is the Ruler of heaven and earth and the supreme Judge. &ldquo;Know that the Most High ruleth in the kingdom of men&rdquo; (4:25). Therefore, He is the One that rules over the rising and falling of Gentile nations, He is the One that gives the kingdom to whomever He will (4:17). He arranges the position and work of His faithful servants. He bestows outstanding gifts and wisdom upon them, and in the end He is the One that protects them and gives them peace during their affliction and persecution.</p>
<p>He judged the rebellion of Judah, the pride of Nebuchadnezzar, and the blasphemy of Belshazzar. He also will judge Satan, his servants, and the nations. Finally, it is He who will bring in the kingdom of God to replace all the kingdoms of the world. Hallelujah!</p>
<h2 class="head2">E. The General Sketch</h2>
<p>Chapter one gives an introduction and the history of Daniel and his three friends. Chapter two tells us the key to the whole book&mdash;Nebuchadnezzar&rsquo;s dream of the great image. Daniel interpreted this image as the prophecy concerning the nations&mdash;Babylon, Medo-Persia, Greece, and the Roman Empire, which became two parts and will be ten nations in the future. The kingdom of God will come down from heaven to smash the kingdoms of the world into pieces and fill the whole earth. Chapters three and four tell us that Nebuchadnezzar was proud and was judged. Chapter five tells us that his son, King Belshazzar, blasphemed God and was punished. Belshazzar died and his kingdom was turned over to the Medes and Persians. Chapter six tells us that Daniel defied the decree of King Darius and continued to worship God in prayer. He was thrown into a lions&rsquo; den. God saved him from the lions&rsquo; mouth. Chapters seven through twelve tell us of the visions that Daniel saw&mdash;the four beasts, the ten horns, the little horn, the Ancient of Days, the Son of Man, the ram, the he-goat, the great horn, the four notable horns, the little horn, the seventy weeks, and so on.</p>
<p>[He predicted that Christ would be cut off four hundred eighty-three years (that is, sixty-nine weeks) after the issuing of the decree to rebuild Jerusalem (Dan. 9:25-26); that He would receive the kingdom and come back (7:13-14); and that at His coming back He would be as a stone cut out without hands, which would become a great mountain (the kingdom) and would fill the whole earth (2:34-35). He also prophesied that in the future resurrection, some will receive eternal life and others will receive eternal punishment (Dan. 12:2; John 5:28-29); they who are wise shall shine as the brightness of the firmament; and they that turn many to righteousness, as the stars forever and ever (Dan. 12:2-3; Matt. 13:43).]</p>
<p>After Daniel finished his work faithfully, he was asked to rest and wait for the resurrection, rapture, and reward. We all should be like Daniel to receive the same reward.</p>
<h2 class="head2">F. The Sections</h2>

<h2 class="head2">Text</h2>
<p>[The books of the so-called Minor Prophets are not called such to infer that the prophets were of a lower rank, or that the contents were of lesser importance, but because they were shorter books.]</p>
<h2 class="head1">I. HOSEA</h2>
<p>A. The writer(s), the place, and the time: [Hosea was the son of Beeri (Hosea 1:1). His name means &ldquo;salvation&rdquo; or &ldquo;Jehovah is salvation.&rdquo;]</p>
<p>This book covers sixty years, from 785 B.C. to 725 B.C. It was written in Israel. Some say Hosea relocated to the kingdom of Judah in his later years, but there is not enough evidence to substantiate this.</p>
<p>B. The subject: the loving God seeking after and saving His backsliding people.</p>
<p>C. The background: During the time that Hosea was a prophet, Israel was in a state of decline. The kingdom was in confusion. Both the king and the people were involved in idolatry, adultery, departure from knowledge, evil acts, lying, theft, pilfering, murder, rape, deceitfulness, mixture with the Gentiles, and betraying their kingdom for gain. (For more details about this period, see 2 Kings 15&mdash;17.) Driven beyond the limit of forbearance, and having no other alternative, God declared &ldquo;Loammi&rdquo;&mdash;Israel was no longer His people.</p>
<p>D. The central thought: God shows His rebellious people the right way to go from being &ldquo;Loruhama&rdquo; (I will not have mercy) and &ldquo;Loammi&rdquo; (you are not My people) to &ldquo;Ruhama&rdquo; (I will have mercy) and &ldquo;Ammi&rdquo; (you are My people).</p>
<p>E. The general sketch: Hosea married a prostitute, and they had three children. Later she played the harlot, but he still loved her and bought her back. That was a sign depicting Israel. Israel was of a lowly origin. God chose Israel not because she was good but because of His love. After she came to the Lord, she went to worship idols. The Lord rebuked her, yet He still loved her. He prophesied that she would return to Him and be saved.</p>
<p>F. The sections: 1) the disloyal wife (chs. 1&mdash;3), 2) the rebellious people (chs. 4&mdash;13), and 3) the restoration of Israel (ch. 14).</p><h2 class="head1">II. JOEL</h2>
<p>A. The writer(s), the place, and the time: [Joel was the son of Pethuel (Joel 1:1). His name means &ldquo;Jehovah is God.&rdquo;] This book was written in Judah, probably between 870 B.C. and 865 B.C.</p>
<p>B. The subject: repentance and calling upon the name of the Lord bringing in salvation and the outpouring of the Holy Spirit.</p>
<p>C. The background: Through Moses and Solomon, God mentioned the plague of locusts, but His people didn&rsquo;t listen. Now through Joel, God warned them again.</p>
<p>D. The central thought: The judgment of God will come soon. If any one of the people of God will repent and turn back to God, he will receive God&rsquo;s grace and love.</p>
<p>E. The general sketch: Joel prophesied that God would judge His people because their heart had turned away from God and they had committed sins. Locusts and their larvae would eat up their vegetation. The locusts also signified the armies of the nations that would attack the holy land. If the people would repent and call upon the name of the Lord, He would bless them. He even prophesied about the outpouring of the Holy Spirit on the day of Pentecost and the war of Armageddon.</p>
<p>F. The sections: 1) the plague of locusts (ch. 1), 2) the day of Jehovah (ch. 2), and 3) Israel receiving blessing (ch. 3).</p>
<h2 class="head1">III. AMOS</h2>
<p>A. The writer(s), the place, and the time: [The prophet Amos was a native of Tekoa in the kingdom of Judah (Amos 1:1).] He wrote this book about 787 B.C. in Bethel.</p>
<p>B. The subject: the judgment of God bringing in Christ to restore the kingdom.</p>
<p>C. The background: The king of Israel, Jeroboam, the son of Joash, was successful politically and militarily. He recovered land for Israel, yet he failed in bringing the people back to God. The people were idolatrous and sinful; thus, Amos was raised up by God to prophesy to Jeroboam.</p>
<p>D. The central thought: Amos had a burden to deliver to the Israelites, during their era of greatest prosperity, a serious message of warning&mdash;the judgment of God. In this book, his pointing out of the iniquities of the nation is equivalent to his judgment of the nation. The judgment of the sins of individuals will be before the throne, but the judgment of the sins of nations takes place in this age.</p>
<p>E. The general sketch: God wanted to judge the six nations surrounding Judah and Israel&mdash;Syria, Philistia, Phoenicia, Edom, Ammon, and Moab. He also wanted to judge the nations of Judah and Israel. Therefore, Amos prophesied to rebuke and to warn. Like other books of prophecy, regardless of the severe rebuking and the horrible judgment, at the end, there will be a bright future awaiting the children of God. The Lord promised that their kingdom will be restored, prosperous, and established forever.</p>
<p>F. The sections: 1) judgment on the surrounding nations (1:1&mdash;2:3), 2) judgment on Judah and Israel (2:4-16), 3) the controversy between God and the house of Jacob (3:1&mdash;9:10), and 4) the prosperity of the kingdom of David (9:11-15).</p>
<h2 class="head1">IV. OBADIAH</h2>
<p>A. The writer(s), the place, and the time: [Obadiah means &ldquo;the servant of Jehovah.&rdquo;] This book was probably written in Judah about 880 B.C.</p>
<p>B. The subject: judgment on Edom, the brother and enemy of the whole house of Israel.</p>
<p>C. The background: Edom is the descendant of Esau, the older brother of Israel. They did not allow Moses and the children of Israel to pass through their land (Num. 20:14-21). They were the most cruel enemies. They even aided other enemies and rejoiced when Jerusalem was destroyed. That is why the Lord wanted to destroy Edom.</p>
<p>D. The central thought: the judgment on Edom, the proud, exalted nation that was always persecuting God&rsquo;s people. God wanted to speak for His own people and carry out His righteous judgment according to their work.</p>
<p>E. The general sketch: [The book of Obadiah is the shortest book of the Old Testament, yet its content is very important. It pronounces the future and end of Edom, Israel&rsquo;s enemy for generations. In name the Edomites were Israel&rsquo;s brothers, but in reality they were Israel&rsquo;s archenemies, who were constantly trying to destroy God&rsquo;s chosen people.]</p>
<p>F. The sections: 1) the shame of Edom (vv. 1-9), 2) the sins of Edom (vv. 10-14), 3) the day of Jehovah (vv. 15-16), and 4) the destiny of Edom (vv. 17-21).</p>
<h2 class="head1">V. JONAH</h2>
<p>A. The writer(s), the place, and the time: [The prophet Jonah, the son of Amittai, was of Gath-hepher (Jonah 1:1; 2 Kings 14:25). Jonah means &ldquo;a dove,&rdquo; signifying that God&rsquo;s commission to Jonah was to fly out like a dove to preach the gospel of peace.</p>
<p>Jonah typifies Christ in two aspects:</p>
<p>First, the death of Christ, as seen in Matthew 12:40: &ldquo;For as Jonah was in the belly of the sea monster three days and three nights, so shall the Son of Man be in the heart of the earth three days and three nights.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Second, the ministry of Christ, as shown in Matthew 12:41: &ldquo;Behold, a greater than Jonah is here.&rdquo; Jonah was sent to Nineveh to preach the word of God; Christ was sent to the world as the Word of God (John 1:1). The Ninevites repented because they heard the preaching of the word of God; yet those during the time of the Lord Jesus would not repent, even though they had the very Word of God among them. Hence, the Ninevites will stand up in the judgment with that generation and will condemn it (Matt. 12:41).]</p>
<p>B. The subject: The loving God is ready to forgive and to save all those who repent in response to the preaching of the incarnated, crucified, and resurrected Christ.</p>
<p>C. The background: Nineveh was a wicked city. It was the capital of Assyria. God wanted to destroy Nineveh. He still loved His creatures. Therefore, He sent Jonah to preach to them to give them one more chance to repent. Jonah not only typified Christ, he also typified God&rsquo;s chosen people.</p>
<p>D. The central thought: There are three important messages in this book: 1) &ldquo;Or is He the God of Jews only? Is He not of the nations also? Yes, also of the nations&rdquo; (Rom. 3:29); 2) &ldquo;God is love&rdquo; &ldquo;who desires all men to be saved,&rdquo; &ldquo;not intending any to perish&rdquo; (1 John 4:8; 1 Tim. 2:4; 2 Pet. 3:9); and 3) &ldquo;Salvation is of Jehovah&rdquo; (2:9).</p>
<p>E. The general sketch: This book records a lot of God&rsquo;s deeds. 1) Jehovah called Jonah to go to Nineveh to preach (1:1). 2) Jehovah sent a great wind upon the sea (1:4). 3) God caused the people in the boat to cast lots, and He caused the lot to fall upon Jonah (1:7). 4) God caused the sea to grow tempestuous against them, that they were unable to get back to the land (1:13). 5) God caused the sea to cease from its raging (1:15). 6) Jehovah prepared a great fish to swallow up Jonah (1:17). 7) God caused Jonah to repent and pray to Him in the fish&rsquo;s belly (2:1). 8) God answered Jonah&rsquo;s prayer by speaking to the fish and causing it to vomit Jonah out upon the dry land (2:10). 9) The word of Jehovah came to Jonah the second time (3:1). 10) God caused the people of Ninevah to repent (3:5). 11) God did not perform the evil which He had said He would do to them (3:10). 12) Jehovah asked Jonah a question (4:4). 13) Jehovah God prepared a gourd to be a shade for Jonah (4:6). 14) God prepared a worm to cause the gourd to wither (4:7). 15) God prepared the sun to beat upon Jonah&rsquo;s head (4:8). 16) God prepared a sultry east wind to cause Jonah to faint (4:8). 17) Jehovah questioned Jonah a second time (4:9). 18) God gave an explanation (4:10-11).</p>
<p>Why did Jonah try to run away? It is not because of cowardice. Jonah was a very patriotic prophet. Deep down, he was acutely aware that Assyria was the most powerful country at that time, and that one day Israel would be destroyed by Assyria. He only wanted to see God judging Assyria for her sin. He did not want to see Assyria repenting and causing God to have mercy on her. Therefore, despite all the danger involved, he fled to Tarshish to hide from God.</p>
<p>F. The sections: 1) Jonah&rsquo;s disobedience (ch. 1), 2) Jonah&rsquo;s repentance (ch. 2), 3) Jonah&rsquo;s preaching (ch. 3), and 4) Jonah&rsquo;s opinion (ch. 4).</p><h2 class="head1">VI. MICAH</h2>
<p>A. The writer(s), the place, and the time: [Micah the Morasthite prophesied in the days of Jotham, Ahaz, and Hezekiah, kings of Judah (Micah 1:1). He was a contemporary of Isaiah, Hosea (Isa. 1:1; Hosea 1:1), and possibly Amos. His name means &ldquo;Who is like Jehovah?&rdquo;] His book was written in Judah about 750 B.C. to 710 B.C.</p>
<p>B. The subject: the forgiveness out of God&rsquo;s love saving His disciplined people by Christ issuing in the restoration of the kingdom.</p>
<p>C. The background: Micah and Isaiah were prophets of the same generation. One was in the countryside, the other was in the imperial court. It is possible that they were acquainted. The content of their prophesies are very similar, both speaking of God&rsquo;s judgment towards Israel and Judah, the coming of the Messiah, and the recovery and rebuilding of the kingdom of God&rsquo;s people. Some have suggested that Micah is a condensed version of Isaiah. The two books have many similar wordings and thoughts (compare 4:1-3 with Isaiah 2:2-4).</p>
<p>D. The central thought: Towards His elect, God must: 1) chastise, because He hates sin; 2) forgive and save, because of His lovingkindness; and 3) provide recovery and regeneration, because of His covenant.</p>
<p>E. The general sketch: In this book, Micah [pointed out repeatedly the transcendence and incomparableness of God&rsquo;s holiness, righteousness, love, and mercy. At the end of his book, he said, &ldquo;Who is a God like unto thee...?&rdquo; (Micah 7:18). He prophesied concerning the birthplace of Christ when He became a man in time and the goings forth of His Godhead being from eternity (5:2), that He as the victorious Ruler would be the deliverance and peace of God&rsquo;s people (5:2-9), that His kingdom would be above all nations, and that the people would flow unto it (4:1-5), as also prophesied by Isaiah (Isa. 2:2-4).]</p>
<p>F. The sections: 1) chastisement (chs. 1&mdash;3), 2) consolation (chs. 4&mdash;5), 3) argument (ch. 6), and 4) forgiveness (ch. 7).</p>
<h2 class="head1">VII. NAHUM</h2>
<p>A. The writer(s), the place, and the time: [Nahum was an Elkoshite (Nahum 1:1). God gave him the vision specifically concerning the Assyrian Empire and the destruction of its capital Nineveh. Although he was an Israelite, he prophesied in the kingdom of Judah. His name means &ldquo;consolation&rdquo; or &ldquo;revenge.&rdquo; His prophetic speakings were full of both consolation and revenge. Toward the oppressed people, God comforted them through the prophets; toward the cruel and violent Assyria, God made revenge.] His book was written about 713 B.C.</p>
<p>B. The subject: God consoling His oppressed people and taking revenge on the cruel aggressors.</p>
<p>C. The background: Jonah went to Nineveh about 862 B.C. The Ninevites repented because of his preaching. After 150 years they had departed from God again, even rebelling against God. They invaded the holy land and blasphemed God. Therefore, God wanted to utterly destroy them. [Nahum prophesied in the reign of Hezekiah king of Judah. At that time Assyria was the strongest nation and the most cruel aggressor, and all the Near Eastern nations were afraid of her. Judah was especially afraid of her, and having seen the fall of the kingdom of Israel into the hands of Assyria (720 B.C.) and Egypt&rsquo;s defeat by Assyria (714 B.C., see Isa. 20), was constantly wary of this terrible enemy. Under this circumstance, Nahum rose up as a prophet to comfort God&rsquo;s people, telling them not to fear and predicting the soon coming of God&rsquo;s judgment upon Assyria.]</p>
<p>D. The central thought: The people that forsake or betray God have a fearful and irredeemable destiny, but the people that depend on God receive Him as their shelter and refuge in times of tribulation.</p>
<p>E. The general sketch: The prophecy in chapter one is about how &ldquo;in the fourteenth year of King Hezekiah did Sennacherib king of Assyria come up against all the fortified cities of Judah, and took them&rdquo; (713 B.C., 2 Kings 18:13). The prophecy in chapters two and three refers to Babylon&rsquo;s defeat of Assyria.</p>
<p>F. The sections: 1) the Judge (1:1-7) and 2) the judgment (1:8&mdash;3:19).</p>
<h2 class="head1">VIII. HABAKKUK</h2>
<p>A. The writer(s), the place, and the time: [Habakkuk means &ldquo;embraced&rdquo; or &ldquo;attached.&rdquo; When he had problems or when he sought for the interest of his fellow people, he embraced God and attached himself to God, asking questions repeatedly and not relaxing at all.] This book was written in Judah about 626 B.C.</p>
<p>B. The subject: The God who abhors iniquities will judge, but the just shall live by faith.</p>
<p>C. The background: [The book of Habakkuk is very similar to the book of Nahum, both being concerned with God&rsquo;s judgment upon the enemies of God&rsquo;s people. The latter prophesied the end of Assyria, while the former predicted the end of Chaldea.]</p>
<p>D. The central thought: God cannot tolerate sin, but the execution of His judgment is in time, according to a plan, and in stages. When He is angry, He still remembers His mercy (3:2), because He causes the righteous to live by faith. What a marvelous gospel!</p>
<p>E. The general sketch: Habakkuk asked God why He did not listen to his prayer and did not judge sin. God showed him that He was about to use the cruel Chaldeans to carry out His judgment on Israel. Then Habakkuk asked again, How could the righteous and holy God use the Chaldeans, who were more sinful, to judge Judah? God showed him that He knew of their sinfulness and would judge them with fire. &ldquo;But the righteous shall live by his faith&rdquo; (2:4). At the end, Habakkuk praised God, because he was filled and satisfied by Him.</p>
<p>F. The sections: 1) first dialog (1:1-11), 2) second dialog (1:12&mdash;2:20), and 3) Habakkuk&rsquo;s song (ch. 3).</p><h2 class="head1">IX. ZEPHANIAH</h2>
<p>A. The writer(s), the place, and the time: [Zephaniah the son of Cushi, the son of Gedaliah, the son of Amariah, the son of Hizkiah (Zeph. 1:1), was a prince in the royal house of Judah. His name means &ldquo;Jehovah hides.&rdquo;] The events recorded in this book took place in Judah about 630 B.C.</p>
<p>B. The subject: idolatry and mixture resulting in judgment, and the destruction of idols resulting in salvation.</p>
<p>C. The background: [A contemporary of Habakkuk and Jeremiah, Zephaniah prophesied in the days of Josiah, king of Judah. During his reign Josiah began to remove the idols but did not do it thoroughly; thus, some idols still remained. Therefore, Zephaniah spoke the word of God, saying, &ldquo;I will also stretch out mine hand upon Judah, and upon all the inhabitants of Jerusalem; and I will cut off the remnant of Baal from this place, and the name of the Chemarim with the priests; and them that worship the host of heaven upon the housetops&rdquo; (1:4-5). He was in the imperial court assisting and guiding the young king Josiah to seek God. He prophesied that God would punish the nations, cause the people to call upon Him and serve Him, and bring restoration to the nation of Israel (3:8-20).]</p>
<p>D. The central thought: The jealous God 1) rebukes the evil of idolatry, 2) warns of the imminent day of Jehovah, and 3) predicts the blessing of the coming kingdom age.</p>
<p>E. The general sketch: Manasseh and Amon, the two most evil kings of Judah, had led the people to worship idols and forsake God. Zephaniah warned Judah that the judgment of the righteous and holy God, although suspended during the years of King Josiah (2 Chron. 34:24-28), would eventually be fully accomplished on Judah. This judgment was to be executed on two kinds of remnants&mdash;the remnant of the priests and worshippers of Baal would be utterly destroyed; the remnant of the house of Judah, after being chastened, would be blessed and prosper in the end. Some of the people worshipped both Jehovah and Malchim (god of Amon&mdash;1:4-5). God is a jealous God; He will never tolerate compromise. His promised judgment came in part when Babylon invaded Judah and will come in full in the last day. Such chastening is proof of God&rsquo;s love. Like Habakkuk, it ends with a very sweet song. Though stressing judgment, it is full of promises (3:14-17). &ldquo;For then will I turn to the peoples a pure language, that they may all call upon the name of Jehovah, to serve Him with one consent&rdquo; (3:9). This will be fulfilled in the coming kingdom, but we have a foretaste in the church today (Rom. 15:5-6).</p>
<p>F. The sections: 1) judgment (1:1&mdash;3:8) and 2) salvation (3:9-20).</p>
<h2 class="head1">X. HAGGAI</h2>
<p>A. The writer(s), the place, and the time: [Haggai, who lived at the same time as Zechariah (Ezra 5:1), spoke for God in the second year of Darius the king. His name means &ldquo;my feasts&rdquo; or &ldquo;Jehovah&rsquo;s feasts.&rdquo; This shows how much he longed for an early return to his homeland to restore God&rsquo;s feasts.] The events recorded in this book took place about 520 B.C. in three months and twenty-four days in Jerusalem.</p>
<p>B. The subject: building up the house of God by rejecting our discouragement and interest.</p>
<p>C. The background: [During the years when the rebuilding of the holy temple was interrupted, the children of Israel began to build beautiful houses for themselves and gradually forgot the building of the holy temple. Furthermore, the enemy&rsquo;s opposition and hindrance steadily increased, and desolation and drought continued to plague the land. Therefore, the people of Israel concluded that the time to build the house of Jehovah had not yet come (Hag. 1:2, 4, 6, 10). It was under such a circumstance that the prophets Haggai and Zechariah rose up to deliver the word of God and encourage the returned Israelites to finish the rebuilding work of God&rsquo;s holy temple.]</p>
<p>D. The central thought: 1) In their life and service, the believers should always put God in the first place. 2) You should &ldquo;seek first His kingdom and His righteousness, and all these things shall be added to you&rdquo; (Matt. 6:33). 3) &ldquo;Wherefore, my beloved brothers, be steadfast, immovable, always abounding in the work of the Lord, knowing that your labor is not in vain in the Lord&rdquo; (1 Cor. 15:58).</p>
<p>E. The general sketch: [God reprimanded the people through Haggai, telling them to consider their ways because of the disasters and miseries that had come upon them, and to not let the house lie waste, but to go up to the mountain, bring wood, and build God&rsquo;s house. So, Zerubbabel the son of Salathiel, and Joshua the son of Josedech, the high priest, with all the remnant of the people, obeyed the voice of Jehovah their God (Hag. 1:2).</p>
<p>Then God spoke through Haggai the prophet to encourage the people to be strong and work for the completion of the rebuilding of God&rsquo;s house. &ldquo;Yet now be strong, O Zerubbabel, saith the Lord; and be strong, O Joshua, son of Josedech, the high priest; and be strong, all ye people of the land, saith the Lord, and work: for I am with you, saith the Lord of hosts&rdquo; (Hag. 2:4).]</p>
<p>F. The sections: 1) the chastisement and the encouragement for the lazy, selfish people (ch. 1), 2) the prophecy of the holy temple in the kingdom age (2:1-9), 3) the warning for the transgressions of the people (2:10-19), and 4) the promise of the Messiah (2:20-23).</p><h2 class="head1">XI. ZECHARIAH</h2>
<p>A. The writer(s), the place, and the time: [Zechariah, the son of Berechiah, the son of Iddo (Zech. 1:1), was born in the land of captivity; he returned to the homeland with Zerubbabel. Iddo was one among the first group of priests to return (Neh. 12:4, 16); hence, Zechariah was both a prophet and a priest (Zech. 7:3-4), like Jeremiah and Ezekiel.</p>
<p>Iddo means &ldquo;an appointed time;&rdquo; Berechiah means &ldquo;blessed of Jehovah;&rdquo; Zechariah means &ldquo;remembered of Jehovah.&rdquo; These three names taken together mean &ldquo;at the appointed time Jehovah blesses and remembers.&rdquo; Surely, at an appointed day, God will bless and remember His people.] This book was written in Judah around 520 B.C.</p>
<p>B. The subject: the importance of Christ in the recovery of God&rsquo;s building.</p>
<p>C. The background: Haggai and Zechariah were contemporaries, prophets after the return from captivity. They spoke the same prophecies in the same circumstances, strengthening Zerubbabel, Joshua, and the people of the land for the rebuilding work, and at the same time they gave them the hope of the future restoration and glory.</p>
<p>D. The central thought: the love and care of God toward His people guaranteeing that He will bless and remember them at the appointed time.</p>
<p>E. The general sketch: [In order that Zechariah might strengthen the rebuilding work of the holy temple by foretelling its success, God gave him a series of eight visions in the beginning of the prophecies in his book.]</p>
<p>The first vision showed that God would grant mercies that His house might be rebuilt. The second vision showed the tools used by God to smite Israel&rsquo;s enemies. The third vision showed that Christ, the Sender and sent One, would choose Jerusalem and dwell in its midst. In the fourth vision, [God raised up Christ as the Sprout of life and the stone with God&rsquo;s seven Spirits (seven eyes&mdash;4:10; Rev. 5:6), and judged (engraved on) Him on the cross that He might remove the iniquity of Israel. The Sprout of life, Christ, who is filled with God&rsquo;s Spirit, also became the festival-robes to clothe them as their righteousness that they might live in God&rsquo;s presence.] The fifth vision showed that the purged Israel would shine as a lampstand among the nations. In this vision [the two olive trees, on the one hand, signify Joshua and Zerubbabel building the holy temple and recovering God&rsquo;s testimony by the Spirit of Jehovah; on the other hand, they denote the two witnesses in Revelation 11 preaching the word by being filled with the Spirit.] It also showed that Christ is the topstone for the building of God&rsquo;s temple. The sixth vision showed that God wants to cleanse His people by His law and righteousness. The seventh vision showed that the people needed to return all the Babylonian things to Babylon. The eighth vision showed that the nations will be judged and this judgment will cause them to come and build up God&rsquo;s temple.</p>
<p>Zechariah also prophesied various aspects of the two comings of Christ (9:9-10; 11:12-13; 12:1-14; 13:1, 6, 7; 14:2-5, 12-15).</p>
<p>F. The sections: 1) the message during the building of the temple (chs. 1&mdash;8) and 2) the message after the building of the temple (chs. 9&mdash;14).</p>
<h2 class="head1">XII. MALACHI</h2>
<p>A. The writer(s), the place, and the time: [Malachi, whose name means &ldquo;my messenger,&rdquo; was the last of the prophets.] He prophesied in Jerusalem about 434 B.C.</p>
<p>B. The subject: The Old Testament age of the law ends with a curse, and the New Testament age of grace dawns with the introduction of Christ.</p>
<p>C. The background: [During that time, first, the holy temple had been rebuilt and the offering of sacrifices had been restored (Mal. 1:6-10); second, the zeal of the priests had gradually grown cold in the service of God (compare Mal. 1:6 with Neh. 13:4); third, the people had neglected to bring their tithes to the storehouse (compare Mal. 3:8 with Neh. 13:10-12); fourth, the people had married heathen wives (compare Mal. 2:11 with Neh. 13:23-25); and fifth, the initial fulfillment of the prophecy in Malachi 3:1-5 probably refers to Malachi and Nehemiah initially.]</p>
<p>D. The central thought: Remember God&rsquo;s love, repent of your sins, turn back to Him, and look to the coming Lord.</p>
<p>E. The general sketch: Malachi rebuked and admonished the people of Israel for their evils after the rebuilding of the holy temple and the holy city. Then he foretold the coming of Elijah the prophet and John the Baptizer. Finally, he foretold the second coming of Christ.</p>
<p>F. The sections: 1) the zeal of God towards Israel (1:1-5), 2) God&rsquo;s chastisement of the iniquities of the priests (1:6&mdash;2:9), 3) God&rsquo;s chastisement of the iniquities of the people (2:10-17; 3:7-15), and 4) God&rsquo;s unveiling of the day of Jehovah (3:1-6, 16-18; 4:1-6).</p>
<h2 class="head1">CONCLUSION</h2>
<p>Malachi&rsquo;s [message terminated the age of law of the Old Testament and introduced the greatest messenger, the messenger of the covenant (Mal. 3:1), the Lord Jesus who gives grace. However, he could only introduce the Lord Jesus and could not bring Him in. Therefore, his concluding word was still on the curse (4:6), which was the terrible result of the age of law.]</p>
<p>[Between the book of Malachi and the Gospel of Matthew there was a space and silence of about four centuries. Bible readers can see, however, that a wonderful connection and correspondence definitely exist between the two books. The things that were mentioned at the end of Malachi are also at the beginning of Matthew&mdash;the Messenger of the covenant and His forerunner (3:1; 4:2, 5; Matt. 1&mdash;3).]</p>

<h2 class="head2">Text</h2>
<p>[Christ as the wonderful center of the entire Bible is all-inclusive, having many aspects. The New Testament at its beginning presents four biographies to portray the four main aspects of this all-inclusive Christ. The Gospel of Matthew testifies that He is the King, the Christ of God according to the prophecies of the Old Testament, who brings the kingdom of the heavens to the earth. The Gospel of Mark tells us that He is the Servant of God, laboring for God faithfully. His account is most simple, for a servant does not need any detailed record. The Gospel of Luke presents a full picture of Him as the only proper and normal man who ever lived on this earth, and thus the Savior of mankind. The Gospel of John unveils Him as the Son of God, the very God Himself, to be life to God&rsquo;s people. Among these four Gospels, Matthew and Luke have a record of genealogy; Mark and John do not. To testify that Jesus is the King, the Christ of God prophesied in the Old Testament, Matthew needs to show us the antecedents and status of this King, proving that He is the proper successor to the throne of David. To prove that Jesus is a proper and normal man, Luke needs to show the generations of this man, attesting that He is qualified to be the Savior of mankind. For a record of a servant, Mark does not need to tell us His origin. To unveil that Jesus is the very God, neither does John need to give us a human genealogy; rather he declares that as the Word of God He is the very God in the beginning.]</p><h2 class="head1">I. MATTHEW</h2>
<p>A. The writer(s), the place, and the time: Matthew, also called Levi, was a tax collector who became an apostle (9:9, Luke 5:27). This is proved by the mystery host in 9:10 and special mention of the tax collector in 10:3. This book was probably written between A.D. 37 and A.D. 40, not long after the Lord&rsquo;s resurrection (28:15), and before the destruction of the temple (24:2). It may have been written in Judea, although we have no way to know for sure. We know that this book was written to the common Jewish people because it gives no explanation of the Jewish customs and holidays (compare 15:2 with Mark 7:2-3; compare 26:17 with Mark 14:12).</p>
<p>B. The subject: the gospel of the kingdom&mdash;proving that Christ is the King-Savior.</p>
<p>C. The background: [The Bible is a book of life, and this life is a living Person, the wonderful and all-inclusive Christ. The Old Testament gives a portrait of this wonderful Person in types and prophecies as the coming One. Now in the New Testament this wonderful Person has come.]</p>
 <p>D. The central thought: [Christ, as Jesus (Jehovah the Savior) and Emmanuel (God with us), is the King, the Baptizer, the light, the Teacher, the Healer, the Forgiver, the Bridegroom, the Shepherd, the Friend, the wisdom, the rest, the greater temple, the real David, the Lord of the Sabbath, the greater Jonah, the greater Solomon, the Sower, the seed, the Feeder, the bread, the crumbs under the table, the Christ, the Son of the living God, the rock for the church, the Builder of the church, the Founder of the kingdom, the present Moses, the present Elijah, the Head of the corner, the Lord, the resurrected One, the One with authority, and the One ever-present to His people in resurrection.]</p>
<p>E. The general sketch: [Christ is Jehovah God incarnated to be the King-Savior who came to establish the kingdom of the heavens (the heavenly rule) by saving His people from sin (of rebellion) through His death and resurrection.]</p>
<p>F. The sections: 1) the King&rsquo;s antecedents and status (1:1&mdash;2:23), 2) the King&rsquo;s anointing (3:1&mdash;4:11), 3) the King&rsquo;s ministry (4:12&mdash;11:30), 4) the King&rsquo;s being rejected (12:1&mdash;27:66), and 5) the King&rsquo;s victory (28:1&mdash;20).</p>
<h2 class="head1">II. MARK</h2>
<p>A. The writer(s), the place, and the time: [The writer of this Gospel was Mark, also called John (Acts 12:25), the son of one of the Marys (who was close to the apostle Peter in the church at Jerusalem, Acts 12:12), and the cousin of Barnabas (Col. 4:10). He accompanied Barnabas and Saul in their ministry (Acts 12:25), and joined Paul in the first journey of his ministry to the Gentiles, leaving him and turning back at Perga (Acts 13:13). Due to his return he was rejected by Paul in his second journey. Mark then joined Barnabas in his work, at which time Barnabas separated himself from Paul (Acts 15:36-40). However, Mark was close to Paul in his later years (Col. 4:10; Philem. 24), and useful to him for his ministry until Paul&rsquo;s martyrdom (2 Tim. 4:11). He was close to Peter, probably continually, since Peter considered him his son (1 Pet. 5:13).]</p>
<p>This book was written between A.D. 60 and A.D. 70. The content of 13:2 proves that it was written before the destruction of the holy temple, possibly after the death of the apostle Paul. It may have been written in Rome (see 2 Tim. 4:11).</p>
<p>The book of Mark explains many Jewish names, customs, and holidays (3:17; 5:41; 7:3, 11; 14:12; 15:42); this proves that it was written to the Gentiles, particularly to Romans.</p>
<p>B. The subject: the gospel of God&mdash;proving that Jesus Christ is the Slave-Savior.</p>
<p>C. The background: [Concerning the Gospel of Mark we need to keep three matters in mind: first, that this Gospel is a written account of Peter&rsquo;s presentation of the history of Jesus Christ, the Son of God; second, that this Gospel was written according to historical sequence; and third, that this Gospel gives more details of historical facts than the other Gospels do. The Gospel of Mark may actually be regarded as the Gospel of Peter. Peter presented the story of the Lord Jesus orally to Mark, and Mark put this story into writing.]</p>
<p>D. The central thought: [The Gospel of Mark presents the Lord Jesus as a Slave of God and as the Slave-Savior of sinners. As the Slave-Savior, the Lord served sinners and gave His life as a ransom for them (10:45). By giving His life as a ransom for sinners, the Lord as the Slave-Savior accomplished the eternal purpose of God, whom He served as a Slave.]</p>
<p>E. The general sketch: [Since Mark presents the Savior as a Slave, he does not tell His genealogy and status, as the ancestry of a slave is not worthy of note. Mark also does not intend to impress us with the Slave&rsquo;s wonderful words (as Matthew does with His marvelous teachings and parables concerning the heavenly kingdom, and John with His profound revelations of divine truths), but he impresses us with His excellent deeds in His gospel service, providing more detail than the other Gospels, in order to portray the Slave-Savior&rsquo;s diligence, faithfulness, and other virtues in the saving service He rendered to sinners for God. In Mark&rsquo;s Gospel is the fulfillment of the prophecy concerning Christ as the Slave of Jehovah in Isaiah 42:1-4, 6-7; 49:5-7; 50:4-7; 52:13&mdash;53:12, and the details of the teaching regarding Christ as the Slave of God in Philippians 2:5-11. His diligence in labor, His need of food and rest (Mark 3:20-21; 6:31), His anger (3:5), His groaning (7:34), and His affection (10:21) display beautifully His humanity in its virtue and perfection. His lordship (2:28), His omniscience (2:8), His miraculous power, and His authority to cast out demons (1:27; 3:15), to forgive sins (2:7, 10), and to silence the wind and the sea (4:39) manifest in full His deity in its glory and honor. What a Slave of God! How lovely and admirable! Such a Slave served sinners as their Slave-Savior, with His life as their ransom (10:45), for the fulfillment of the eternal purpose of God, whose Slave He was.]</p>
<p>F. The sections: 1) the beginning of the gospel and the initiation of the Slave-Savior (1:1-13), 2) the ministry of the Slave-Savior for the spreading of the gospel (1:14&mdash;10:52), 3) the preparation of the Slave-Savior for His redemptive service (11:1&mdash;14:42), 4) the death and resurrection of the Slave-Savior for the accomplishment of God&rsquo;s redemption (14:43&mdash;16:18), 5) the ascension of the Slave-Savior for His exaltation (16:19), and 6) the Slave-Savior&rsquo;s universal spreading of the gospel through His disciples (16:20).</p><h2 class="head1">III. LUKE</h2>
<p>A. The writer(s), the place, and the time: [The early church recognized Luke as the author of both this Gospel and Acts. Luke&rsquo;s authorship is evident from the style of composition of the two books. Luke was a Gentile (Col. 4:14, cf. 11), probably an Asiatic Greek, and a physician (Col. 4:14). Starting in Troas, he joined Paul in his ministry and accompanied him in his last three ministry journeys (Acts 16:10-17; 20:5&mdash;21:18; 27:1&mdash;28:15). He was a faithful companion of Paul until Paul was martyred (Philem. 24; 2 Tim. 4:11). Hence, his Gospel should represent Paul&rsquo;s views, as Mark&rsquo;s represents Peter&rsquo;s.]</p>
<p>This book was written before the book of Acts (Acts 1:1), probably about A.D. 60. It may have been written in Caesarea while the apostle Paul was in prison there. It was written to Theophilus (1:3 and footnote 2).</p>
<p>B. The subject: the gospel of redemption&mdash;proving that Jesus Christ is the Man-Savior living a life in the highest standard of morality.</p>
<p>C. The background: [It may seem that the Gospel of Luke is not as profound as the Gospel of Matthew or as mysterious as the Gospel of John. The reason for this is that Luke gives us a record of our Savior, the Lord Jesus, as a Man. A man, of course, is not profound when compared to God.] [Although the Gospel of Luke is not the most profound or mysterious of the four Gospels, it is the most sweet and pleasant of the Gospels. Yes, God is profound. But when He became a man, He became sweet and pleasant.]</p>
<p>[Luke does not stress the dispensational aspect or the Jewish background as Matthew does. The Gospel of Luke is the Gospel written to mankind in general, announcing the good news to all people (2:10). Its characteristic is absolutely not Jewish, but Gentile (4:25-28). It is a Gospel to all sinners, both Jews and Gentiles. As such, its record is according to the sequence of morality, not according to the sequence of historical events.] [In this respect Luke is similar to Matthew. Matthew&rsquo;s sequence is the sequence of doctrine concerning the kingdom, and Luke&rsquo;s sequence is the sequence of morality. Therefore neither Luke nor Matthew was written according to the sequence of historical events.]</p>
<p>D. The central thought: [According to the Gospel of Luke, our Savior lives, behaves, and works in the highest standard of morality. Moreover, His salvation is carried out in the highest standard of morality. Therefore, we need to keep in mind that the subject of the Gospel of Luke is the Man-Savior and His salvation in the highest standard of morality.]</p>
<p>This highest standard of morality is an issue of His human virtues being fully strengthened and enriched by the Father&rsquo;s divine attributes. [Today the very Christ who lives in us is still the One who possesses the human virtues strengthened and enriched by the divine attributes. While He was on earth, He lived a life in the highest standard of morality. Such a life was a composition of the divine attributes and the human virtues. Of course, the Lord Jesus lived this kind of life outside the disciples. But from the time of His resurrection He has been living this kind of life within the believers. This means that within us today the Man-Savior is still living a life in the highest standard of morality, a life that is a composition of the divine attributes and the human virtues. If we see this, we shall say with Paul, &ldquo;It is no longer I, but Christ lives in me&rdquo; (Gal. 2:20).]</p>
<p>E. The general sketch: The gospel of Luke [displays and presents to us mainly five crucial and excellent aspects concerning the Man-Savior: His birth, ministry, death, resurrection, and ascension.</p>
<ol class="decimal">
<li>His birth is of and with the Spirit of God essentially, making Him a God-man to be the Man-Savior (1:35).</li>
<li>His ministry is by and through the Spirit of God economically to carry out God&rsquo;s economy in His jubilee (4:18-19).</li>
<li>His death is by the God-man to accomplish God&rsquo;s redemption for man (23:42-43) and to release Himself into man as the fire of life to burn on the earth (12:49-50).</li>
<li>His resurrection is: a) God&rsquo;s vindication of Him and of His work; b) His success in all His achievements; and c) His victory over the universal enemy of God.</li>
<li>His ascension is God&rsquo;s exaltation of Him, making Him the Christ of God and the Lord of all (Acts 2:36), to carry out His heavenly ministry on the earth as the all-inclusive Spirit poured out from the heavens upon His Body composed of His believers (Acts 2:4, 17-18), as recorded also by Luke in his further writing called the Acts.]</li>
</ol>
<p>F. The sections: 1) introduction (1:1-4), 2) the preparation of the Man-Savior in His humanity with His divinity (1:5&mdash;4:13), 3) the ministry of the Man-Savior in His human virtues with His divine attributes (4:14&mdash;19:27), 4) the Man-Savior&rsquo;s presentation of Himself to death for redemption (19:28&mdash;22:46), 5) the death of the Man-Savior (22:47&mdash;23:56), 6) the resurrection of the Man-Savior (24:1-49), and 7) the ascension of the Man-Savior (24:50-53).</p><h2 class="head1">IV. JOHN</h2>
<p>A. The writer(s), the place, and the time: This book was written by the apostle John (21:20, 24), the son of Zebedee (Matt. 10:2); his brother was James, and his mother was Salome (Matt. 27:56; Mark 15:40). It was written about A.D. 90, perhaps in Ephesus. It was written to all Jewish and Gentile believers; we know this because of the explanations in 1:38; 5:2; and 19:13.</p>
<p>B. The subject: the gospel of life&mdash;proving that Jesus Christ is the God-Savior coming as life to bring about God&rsquo;s enlargement.</p>
<p>C. The background: [The Gospel of John is a good example of a New Testament book written against a negative background. This Gospel was written during the last decade of the first century. At that time there was a tendency, even among Christians, to deny the deity of Christ. Some were doubting Christ&rsquo;s deity, and others were even denying this truth. With such a trend as the background, this Gospel was written by the apostle John. Without this Gospel, we could not have an adequate understanding of Christ&rsquo;s deity and His eternal existence. Neither could we realize how Christ could become our life. But through the Gospel of John we clearly see that Christ&rsquo;s deity is eternal and absolute. In this Gospel we also have the clear view of eternal life and of how Christ can be life to us. If there had not been such a dark background at the end of the first century, this wonderful Gospel probably would not have been written.]</p>
<p>D. The central thought: [The Gospel of John reveals that the Triune God is dispensing Himself into His believers and that all His believers, as a result of the transfusion and infusion of the Triune God into them, become His enlargement. This enlargement of the Triune God is the expansion, the building, and the expression of God.]</p>
<p>E. The general sketch: [The Gospel of John reveals that in Christ, the Word of God, is life (1:4); that He came that man may have life (10:10b); and that He Himself is life (11:25; 14:6). Furthermore, this Gospel shows us that Christ is the bread of life (6:35); that He has the water of life (4:14); that He gives life to man (5:21); and that He even lives in man as life (14:19).</p>
<p>The Gospel of John unfolds the building. In 1:14 we see that Christ in the flesh was the tabernacle for God&rsquo;s habitation among men on earth. &ldquo;And the Word became flesh and tabernacled among us.&rdquo; Also, Christ&rsquo;s body was the temple before His death and after His resurrection (2:19-22). Before His death His body in the flesh was the temple, and after His resurrection His resurrected body remained the temple of God. This is the building. Furthermore, this gospel reveals that the believers are to be built as the abode of the Triune God (14:2, 23). This is adequately and fully disclosed in John 14. According to that chapter, all the believers will be built together as God&rsquo;s eternal habitation with so many abodes. Thus, as the Lord&rsquo;s last prayer found in John 17 indicates, all His believers must be built up into one (vv. 11, 21-23).]</p>
<p>F. The sections: 1) the eternal Word incarnated coming to bring God into man (chs. 1&mdash;13), and 2) Jesus crucified and Christ resurrected going to prepare the way to bring man into God, and as the Spirit coming to abide and live in the believers for the building of God&rsquo;s habitation (chs. 14&mdash;21).</p>
<h2 class="head1">V. ACTS</h2>
<p>A. The writer(s), the place, and the time: Luke wrote the book of Acts after the book of Luke, between A.D. 67 and A.D. 68 (1:1). It may have been written in Rome (see Philem. 24; 2 Tim. 4:11). Its recipient was Theophilus (see Acts 1:1; Luke 1:3 footnote 2).</p>
<p>B. The subject: the propagation of the resurrected Christ in His ascension, by the Spirit, through the disciples, for the producing of the churches&mdash;the kingdom of God.</p>
<p>C. The background: The first book written by Luke, his Gospel, describes the Lord&rsquo;s life and ministry on earth. [That life and ministry were initiated by His conception and concluded by His resurrection. Then after His resurrection the Lord Jesus ascended to the heavens. This ascension was not a termination but another initiation. This initiation brought Him into a new realm, that is, into the heavens, where He now has another living with another ministry.] [Now there is the need of the second book, the book of Acts, to tell us into what kind of living and ministry the Lord has been initiated through His ascension. Therefore, Luke had the burden to write a second book to unveil the living and ministry of this ascended Christ.]</p>
<p>D. The central thought: [God&rsquo;s New Testament economy is to propagate the processed Triune God in the Person of the all-inclusive, resurrected Christ. Only the propagation of this resurrected Christ is the answer to the pitiful situation on the earth. What is needed is for us to allow God to carry out His New Testament economy in propagating the resurrected Christ.] [Having become the all-inclusive Spirit, He now enters into God&rsquo;s chosen people to apply to them all that the Triune God in the Son has accomplished. Through such an application, God&rsquo;s people become living witnesses of the incarnated, crucified, resurrected, and ascended Christ (Acts. 1:8).] [As those who have the all-inclusive Spirit within us, what should we do? We should simply be living witnesses containing, bearing, and conveying the incarnated, crucified, resurrected, and ascended Christ so that He may be propagated throughout the earth for the fulfillment of the divine economy.]</p>
<p>E. The general sketch: The Lord charged His disciples to wait in Jerusalem until they receive power from the Holy Spirit, that they may be His witnesses from Jerusalem, to Judea and Samaria, and to the uttermost part of the earth (1:8). They prayed in one accord and were filled with the Holy Spirit on the day of Pentecost (1:14; 2:1-4). They became witnesses of the resurrected Christ in ascension to the Jews and to the Gentiles (chs. 2 and 10). They witnessed in Jerusalem, throughout Judea, Samaria, Asia Minor, Macedonia, Europe, and in Rome. Many people became the reproduction of Christ, and many churches were established in these regions as the expression of the resurrected Christ in ascension. The book of Acts did not have an ending. Any one of us, filled with the Spirit, may continue Acts by propagating Christ to the people around us for the producing of the church.</p>
<p>F. The sections: 1) introduction (1:1-2), 2) the preparation (1:3-26), and 3) the propagation (2:1&mdash;28:31).</p>
<h2 class="head2">CONCLUSION</h2>
<p>Jesus Christ, the promised and prophesied Messiah in the Old Testament, came as a King-Savior, served as a Slave-Savior, lived as a Man-Savior, and gave His life as a God-Savior. He served His people through His death and resurrection. In His ascension, He was propagated through gospel-preaching and baptism to produce many sons of God like Him, and local churches to be His corporate expression on the earth.</p><h2 class="head2">Questions and Exercises</h2>

<h2 class="head2">Text</h2>
<p>We will cover the fourteen epistles of the apostle Paul in this lesson and the next two lessons. Paul said he was commissioned to &ldquo;complete the word of God&rdquo; (Col. 1:25). He meant that he was to complete the revelation of God. If his fourteen epistles were removed from the Bible, the Bible would not be complete. There are [three crucial points in Paul&rsquo;s Epistles: God as our contents, Christ as God&rsquo;s mystery, and the church as Christ&rsquo;s mystery.] [Our God today is in us to be our contents. The mystery of God is Christ as the embodiment and manifestation of God, making God so real and so enjoyable to us. The mystery of Christ is that the Triune God through death and in resurrection is mingling Himself with us, making us the living members of His organic Body. This vision must direct us. It will keep us in the central lane, walking according to the mingled spirit and being in the Body life. This is what the Lord is after.]</p><h2 class="head1">I. ROMANS</h2>
<p>A. The writer(s), the place, and the time: This book was written by the apostle Paul to the saints in Rome (1:7). It was written in Corinth (Rom. 15:25-32; Acts 19:21; 20:1-3) about A.D. 60, during his third journey of ministry.</p>
<p>B. The subject: The gospel of God makes sinners His sons, to become the Body of Christ, manifested in the local churches.</p>
<p>C. The background: [The gospel of God is the subject of the book of Romans (1:1). Christians are accustomed to saying that there are four gospels, the books of Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John. However, Paul also refers to his epistle to the Romans as a gospel. The gospel in the first four books of the New Testament concerns Christ in the flesh as He lived among His disciples before His death and resurrection. After His incarnation and before His death and resurrection, He was among His disciples, but not yet in them. The gospel in Romans concerns Christ as the Spirit, not Christ in the flesh. In Romans 8 we see that the Spirit of life who indwells us is simply Christ Himself. Christ is in us. The Christ in the four gospels was among the disciples; the Christ in Romans is within us. The Christ in the four gospels is the Christ after incarnation and before death and resurrection. As such, He is a Christ outside of us. The Christ in Romans is the Christ after His resurrection. As such, He is the Christ within us. This is something deeper and more subjective than the Christ in the gospels. Keep this one point in mind: that the gospel in Romans concerns Christ as the Spirit in us after His resurrection.</p>
<p>If we only have the gospel concerning Christ as in the first four books of the New Testament, our gospel is too objective. We need the fifth gospel, the book of Romans, to reveal the subjective gospel of Christ. Our Christ is not merely the Christ in the flesh after incarnation and before resurrection, the Christ who was among His disciples. Our Christ is higher and more subjective. He is the Spirit of life within us. He is such a subjective One. Though John chapters 14 and 15 revealed that Christ will be in His believers, yet that was not fulfilled before His resurrection. The book of Romans is the gospel of Christ after His resurrection, showing also that He is now the subjective Savior in His believers. So, this gospel is deeper and more subjective.]</p>
<p>D. The central thought: [Romans explains how the individual Christ can become the corporate Christ and how all of us who were once sinners and enemies of God can become parts of Christ and form His one Body. The book of Romans offers us a full definition of this, unfolding both the Christian life and the church life in detail.]</p>
<p>E. The general sketch: [The major structures of the book of Romans are three&mdash;salvation, life, and building. The first major structure of Romans is salvation, revealed in 1:1&mdash;5:11 and 9:1&mdash;11:31. Salvation includes propitiation, redemption, justification, reconciliation, selection, and predestination.] [Salvation is for the life unfolded in 5:12&mdash;8:39.] [In the last part of Romans, 12:1&mdash;16:27, we have the building, the Body with all of its expressions in the local churches. Salvation is for life, and life is for building.]</p>
<p>F. The sections: 1) introduction&mdash;the gospel of God (1:1-17), 2) condemnation (1:18&mdash;3:20), 3) justification (3:21&mdash;5:11), 4) sanctification (5:12&mdash;8:13), 5) glorification (8:14-39), 6) selection (9:1&mdash;11:36), 7) transformation (12:1&mdash;15:13), and 8) conclusion&mdash;the consummation of the gospel (15:14&mdash;16:27).</p>
<h2 class="head1">II. 1 CORINTHIANS</h2>
<p>A. The writer(s), the place, and the time: This book was written by the apostle Paul (1:1; 9:1-2) about A.D. 59. He had been sent out as the apostle to the Gentiles fourteen years before he wrote it (Acts 13:1-4, 8), and he had been called eleven years before that (Acts 9:3-6, 15-16). He wrote it in Ephesus after he had been there for three years (16:8; Acts 20:31). The recipients were the saints&mdash;the church in Corinth, with all those who call upon the name of our Lord Jesus Christ in every place (1:2).</p>
<p>B. The subject: Christ and His cross, the unique solution to all problems in the church.</p>
<p>C. The background: First Corinthians [was written because of the confusion and divisiveness in the church at Corinth. If we did not have the book of 1 Corinthians, we would not know how Christ could be our enjoyment in all kinds of situations. This book describes the enjoyment of Christ in a way not found elsewhere in the New Testament. We should thank the Lord for the confusion in Corinth that gave rise to this Epistle.]</p>
<p>D. The central thought: [As Paul was writing this Epistle, he was burdened to guide the distracted, philosophical Christians in Corinth back to Christ. These believers had been distracted by their wisdom, philosophy, and culture. Thus, Paul&rsquo;s spirit was burdened to bring them back to the very Christ whom he had testified to them. This burden in Paul&rsquo;s spirit is especially evident in the first two chapters of this book.]</p>
<p>E. The general sketch: [This book unveils to us that the very Christ, who is the portion of all believers, and into whose fellowship we all have been called, is all-inclusive. He is God&rsquo;s power and God&rsquo;s wisdom as righteousness, sanctification, and redemption to us (1:24, 30). He is our glory for our glorification (2:7; Rom. 8:30), hence, the Lord of glory (2:8). He is the depths (deep things) of God (2:10). He is the unique foundation of God&rsquo;s building (3:11). He is our Passover (5:7), the unleavened bread (5:8), the spiritual food, the spiritual drink, and the spiritual rock (10:3-4). He is the Head (11:3) and the Body (12:12). He is the firstfruit (15:20, 23), the second Man (15:47), and the last Adam (15:45); and as such He became the life-giving Spirit (15:45). This all-inclusive One, with the riches of at least nineteen items, God has given to us as our portion for our enjoyment. We should concentrate on Him, not on any persons, things, and matters other than Him. We should focus on Him as our unique center appointed by God, that all the problems among the believers may be solved.]</p>
<p>F. The sections: 1) introduction&mdash;the initial gifts and the participation in Christ (1:1-9), 2) dealing with divisions (1:10&mdash;4:21), 3) dealing with an evil brother (5:1-13), 4) dealing with lawsuits among the believers (6:1-11), 5) dealing with the abuse of freedom (6:12-20), 6) dealing with marriage life (7:1-40), 7) dealing with the eating of food sacrificed to idols (8:1&mdash;11:1), 8) dealing with head covering (11:2-16), 9) dealing with the Lord&rsquo;s Supper (11:17-34), 10) dealing with the gifts (12:1&mdash;14:40), 11) dealing with the matter of resurrection (15:1-58), 12) dealing with the collection of the gift (16:1-9), and 13) conclusion (16:10-24).</p><h2 class="head1">III. 2 CORINTHIANS</h2>
<p>A. The writer(s), the place, and the time: The apostle Paul wrote this book (1:1) about A.D. 60, prior to the writing of the book of Romans (see Acts 20:1 footnote 1 and 20:3 footnote 1). It was written in Macedonia (2:13 and footnote 2; 7:5-6; 8:1; 9:2,4) &ldquo;to the church of God which is in Corinth, with all the saints who are in the whole of Achaia&rdquo; (1:1).</p>
<p>B. The subject: the New Testament ministry and ministers.</p>
<p>C. The background: [Paul wrote the Epistles of 1 and 2 Corinthians as a loving father. In his first Epistle Paul disciplined the Corinthians. Parents know that in disciplining children we run the risk of alienating them. If a parent disciplines a child without limitation, the child may want to run away from home. After writing 1 Corinthians, Paul was concerned about how the believers at Corinth would react to his discipline. Paul was not at rest about the matter, and he even regretted somewhat writing that Epistle. He was concerned that the entire church in Corinth would be alienated from him. Because of his deep concern, he was eagerly awaiting Titus to bring him news of the response of the Corinthians to his first Epistle. In chapter two Paul did not have rest in his spirit, for he did not find Titus. But we see from chapter seven that Titus came with good news.</p>
<p>Paul&rsquo;s first Epistle had caused sorrow to the Corinthians, but this sorrow produced repentance unto salvation. That salvation was a full reconciliation. When Paul heard this good news, he was beside himself with joy. As he says in 7:13, &ldquo;We rejoiced more abundantly over the joy of Titus.&rdquo; When he wrote his second Epistle, Paul was in such an atmosphere of encouragement and joy. Thus, as we read chapter seven, we can touch the feeling in Paul&rsquo;s spirit, a feeling of deep concern for the church in Corinth.]</p>
<p>D. The central thought: [First Corinthians reveals the matter of living Christ for the church. If we read this Epistle in a thoughtful way, we may wonder if there is a pattern of living Christ for the church. We may say as we read this book, &ldquo;Paul, show us a pattern. We have seen many things in our parents, relatives, neighbors, friends, and colleagues, but we have never seen a person living Christ for the church. We would like to see a pattern, for a pattern is much better than thousands of words.&rdquo; Realizing the need for such a pattern, Paul presents this pattern in 2 Corinthians.]</p>
<p>E. The general sketch: [The first Epistle to the Corinthians was the apostle&rsquo;s argument, an argument which defeated and subdued the distracted and confused Corinthians. Now the second Epistle brings them back into the experience of Christ, who was the subject of his argument in the first Epistle. Hence, the second Epistle is more experiential, more subjective, and deeper than the first. In the first, Christ, the Spirit with our spirit, the church, and the gifts are covered as the major subjects. In the second, Christ, the Spirit with our spirit, and the church are further developed, but the gifts are not even mentioned. They are replaced in this book by the ministry, which is constituted with, and produced and formed by, the experiences of the riches of Christ through sufferings, consuming pressures, and the killing work of the cross. The second Epistle gives us a pattern, an example, of how the killing of the cross works, how Christ is wrought into our being, and how we become the expression of Christ. These constitute the ministers of Christ and produce the ministry for God&rsquo;s new covenant. The first Epistle deals negatively with the gifts; the second speaks positively about the ministry. The church needs the ministry much more than the gifts. The ministry is to minister Christ whom we have experienced; the gifts are just to teach the doctrines concerning Christ. Not the gifts, but the ministry produced and formed by the experience of the sufferings, the afflictions, of Christ, is the proof that the apostles are ministers of Christ.]</p>
<p>F. The sections: 1) introduction (1:1&mdash;2:11), 2) the ministry of the new covenant (2:12&mdash;3:11), 3) the ministers of the new covenant (3:12&mdash;7:16), 4) the apostle&rsquo;s fellowship concerning the ministry to the needy saints (8:1&mdash;9:15), 5) Paul&rsquo;s vindication of his apostolic authority (10:1&mdash;13:10), and 6) conclusion (13:11-14).</p>
<h2 class="head1">IV. GALATIANS</h2>
<p>A. The writer(s), the place, and the time: This book was written by the apostle Paul to the churches of Galatia (1:1-2) around A.D. 54, during his third journey of ministry. At this time he had passed through Galatia (Acts 16:6) and arrived in Corinth (Acts 18:1) for the first time. He stayed there for one year and six months (Acts 18:11).</p>
<p>B. The subject: Christ replacing the law and versus religion and traditions.</p>
<p>C. The background: [The churches in Galatia had been bewitched by the Judaizers (3:1). They had been distracted from Christ to Judaism. A good number of the New Testament believers in the churches of Galatia had turned back to the old Jewish religion and were endeavoring to keep the law with the ordinance of circumcision. This was the background that gave Paul the opportunity to write this wonderful book.]</p>
<p>D. The central thought: [The book of Galatians is focused on Christ replacing the law. It is not God&rsquo;s intention to keep His people under the law. His intention is to dispense Christ into them. Thus, Christ as the center of God&rsquo;s economy must replace the law. Because the Judaizers were misusing the law, the Epistle to the Galatians was written to reveal Christ as the replacement of the law. Yes, the law was given for a specific purpose, but God did not intend for the law to be permanent. Christ has come to replace the law with Himself. This is the focal point of Galatians.]</p>
<p>E. The general sketch: [In chapter one Paul shows that God is pleased to reveal His Son, Jesus Christ, in us (1:15-16). In chapter two we see that we should live this Christ, not the law (2:19-21).] [In chapter three, the Spirit is mainly for us to have the divine life. In chapter four, the Spirit is for us to be born of God. In chapter five, the Spirit is for us to live and walk.] In [chapter six, the Spirit is for our aim, our goal. In the first two chapters of Galatians we have the revelation of Christ as the focal point of God&rsquo;s economy, but in the last four chapters we have the Spirit in our experience.]</p>
<p>F. The sections: 1) introduction&mdash;the will of God to rescue us out of the evil religious age (1:1-5), 2) the revelation of the apostle&rsquo;s gospel (1:6&mdash;4:31), 3) the walk of God&rsquo;s children (5:1&mdash;6:17), and 4) conclusion&mdash;the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ to be with our spirit (6:18).</p><h2 class="head1">V. EPHESIANS</h2>
<p>A. The writer(s), the place, and the time: This book was written by the apostle Paul to &ldquo;the saints who are in Ephesus&rdquo; (1:1) about A.D. 64, while imprisoned in Rome (3:1).</p>
<p>B. The subject: the church&mdash;the mystery of Christ, the Body of Christ, to be the fullness of Christ and become the fullness of God.</p>
<p>C. The background: [Ephesians has a specific position in the order of the books of the New Testament.] [It has been placed in the right position, immediately after the revelation concerning Christ versus religion (Galatians), followed by the practical experience of Christ (Philippians), and leading to the Head (Colossians).]</p>
<p>[In Galatians we see the matter of Christ versus religion. We should not replace Christ with anything. This means that it should not be our emotion versus religion or our practice versus religion. It must be Christ versus religion. Ephesians comes after this revelation of Christ versus religion. The matter of Christ versus religion leads us to the church. Christ is not versus religion merely for our experience. That is the improper emphasis of the so-called inner life people who seek Christ, not for the church, but for their experience. Christ is versus religion for the church. The very Christ who is versus religion is not primarily for our experience, but for the church. Galatians 2:20 says that we have been crucified with Christ and that Christ lives in us. This experience must be for the church life.]</p>
<p>D. The central thought: [God&rsquo;s intention in His economy is to obtain a glorious church. Strictly speaking, God is not seeking a spiritual church, a heavenly church, nor even a victorious church. He wants a church of glory. Glory is the expression of God and it is altogether different from human morality and behavior.]</p>
<p>E. The general sketch: Ephesians covers seven aspects of the church: the church as [the Body, the new man, the kingdom, the family, the dwelling place, the wife, and the warrior. What we do does not mean very much, but what we are means a great deal. In such a church as described in Ephesians Christ is expressed. Through such a church Christ, the Person, is lived out. In such a church there is the kingdom of God with rights and responsibilities and the family of God with life and enjoyment. This church is also God&rsquo;s dwelling place, Christ&rsquo;s satisfaction, and God&rsquo;s warrior fighting the battle for His eternal purpose.]</p>

<h2 class="head2">Text</h2>
<h2 class="head1">I. PHILIPPIANS</h2>
<p>A. The writer(s), the place, and the time: This book was written by &ldquo;Paul and Timothy, slaves of Christ Jesus, to all the saints in Christ Jesus who are in Philippi, with the overseers and deacons&rdquo; (1:1) from a prison in Rome (1:13; Acts 28:30), about A.D. 64. It may have been written after the book of Ephesians (see 1:25; 2:24).</p>
<p>B. The subject: the experience of Christ&mdash;taking Christ as our living, our pattern, our goal, our power, and our secret.</p>
<p>C. The background: [At the time the book of Philippians was written, the Judaizers were exercising their influence over the believers in Christ (3:2-4).] [According to 1:15-18, some were preaching Christ &ldquo;because of envy and strife&rdquo; and &ldquo;out of rivalry.&rdquo;] [Another aspect of the background of this book concerns a matter that is very positive, the participation of the Philippian believers with the apostle Paul in the furtherance of the gospel (1:5-7; 4:14-19).] [Even though the Philippian believers participated with Paul in the furtherance of the gospel, there was still at least some amount of dissension among them (1:27; 2:1-4; 4:2-3).] [The reason for this dissension lay in the fact that they were not one in soul. They had been regenerated in the spirit, but they had not yet been transformed in soul. They had no problem in the spirit, but there were at least some problems in the soul, particularly in the mind. Some among them had different concepts, and these different concepts were causing dissension.]</p>
<p>D. The central thought: [In 1:20 Paul says, &ldquo;Christ shall be magnified in my body,&rdquo; and in 1:21 he declares, &ldquo;To me to live is Christ.&rdquo; These two statements represent the basic concept of the whole book. In this book we are charged to magnify Christ and to live Him. To magnify Christ is not only to express Him; it is to express Christ by causing Him to be enlarged. We should magnify Christ by living Him in a practical way day by day. Our daily living should be a living that lives Christ.]</p>
<p>E. The general sketch: [In the four chapters of Philippians we see Christ as the One lived out and magnified, Christ as the pattern, Christ as the goal, and Christ as our inward strength. This book on the experience of Christ covers four major points: the expression, the pattern, the goal, and the strength. We all need to experience Christ in this fourfold way.]</p>
<p>F. The sections: 1) introduction (1:1-2), 2) to live and magnify Christ (1:3-30), 3) to take Christ as the pattern and hold Him forth (2:1-30), 4) to pursue and gain Christ (3:1-21), 5) having Christ as the secret of sufficiency (4:1-20), and 6) conclusion (4:21-23).</p><h2 class="head1">II. COLOSSIANS</h2>
<p>A. The writer(s), the place, and the time: This book was written by the apostle Paul and Timothy the brother (1:1) to the saints in Colosse (1:2). It was written from a Roman prison around A.D. 64, at about the same time as the book of Philemon (4:9-10; Philem. 10-12).</p>
<p>B. The subject: Christ&mdash;the all-inclusive One, having the first place in all things; the mystery and embodiment of God, the Head and portion of the church, the inheritance, life, portion, and hope of the saints, and the reality of all positive things.</p>
<p>C. The background: [The vital point concerning the background of the book of Colossians is that culture had been brought into the church life. The population of Colosse was a mixture of Gentiles and Jews. The Gentiles and the Jews had different cultures. For the most part, the Gentiles were under the influence of Greek culture with its philosophy. At that time, however, Greek philosophy was no longer pure. Rather it was a mingling of various philosophies. Furthermore, the Gentile culture was at least somewhat blended with Jewish religious concepts.</p>
<p>This mixture of cultures flooded the church at Colosse. The church should be a house filled with Christ and constituted with Him. Instead, the church there had been invaded by culture. To a large extent, Christ as the unique element in the church life was being replaced by various aspects of this mixed culture. The constituent of the church should be Christ and Christ alone, for the church is the Body of Christ. Therefore, the content of the church should be nothing other than Christ Himself. Nevertheless, the good elements of the culture, especially philosophy and religion, had invaded the church and saturated it.]</p>
<p>D. The central thought: [Paul&rsquo;s purpose in the book of Colossians is to show that in the church nothing should be allowed to be a substitute for Christ. The church life must be constituted uniquely of Christ. He should be our only constituent and our very constitution. This is the reason that in this short Epistle a number of elevated expressions are used to describe Christ. For example, He is called the image of the invisible God, the firstborn of all creation, the firstborn from among the dead, and the body of all the shadows.]</p>
<p>E. The general sketch: In [Colossians Christ is revealed to the uttermost, much more than in Galatians. In Galatians Paul speaks of Christ being revealed in us, of Christ living in us, and of Christ being formed in us. But in Colossians he uses a number of special terms for Christ: the portion of the saints, the image of the invisible God, the firstborn of all creation. In this short book, one aspect of Christ after another is unfolded. Therefore, Colossians reveals that Christ is profound and all-inclusive. The all-inclusive Christ transcends our understanding. Our need is to be infused, saturated, and permeated with Him until in our experience Christ is everything to us: our food, our drink, our feasts, our holy days, our Sabbath, our new moon, our everything. We must not allow anything to replace Christ or to be a substitute for Him. This is the central point of Colossians. Whereas Galatians reveals that Christ is versus religion and the law, Colossians reveals that Christ is versus everything because He Himself is the reality of every positive thing.]</p>
<p>F. The sections: 1) introduction (1:1-8), 2) Christ&mdash;the pre-eminent and all-inclusive One, the centrality and universality of God (1:9&mdash;3:11), 3) the living of the saints in union with Christ (3:12&mdash;4:6), and 4) conclusion (4:7-18).</p>
<h2 class="head1">III. 1 THESSALONIANS</h2>
<p>A. The writer(s), the place, and the time: This book was written by Paul, Silvanus, and Timothy to the church of the Thessalonians (1:1) around A.D. 54 while Paul was staying in Corinth during his second journey of ministry (1:1; 3:6; Acts 18:1, 5).</p>
<p>B. The subject: a holy life for the church life&mdash;serving the living God, having a sanctified human living, and awaiting the coming of the Lord.</p>
<p>C. The background: [The two Epistles of Paul to the Thessalonians may be considered the earliest of Paul&rsquo;s writings. Thessalonica was a city of the Roman Empire in the province of Macedonia, north of the province of Achaia. After the Macedonian call, which Paul received on his second journey of ministry, he and his co-worker Silvanus visited first Philippi and then Thessalonica (Acts 16:9-12; 17:1-4). The apostle stayed and worked there for only a short time, probably less than one month (Acts 17:2).]</p>
<p>[The books of 1 and 2 Thessalonians were not written to experienced Christians. They were written to young believers, to those who had been saved for less than a year. Most of them had been typical Gentiles. Therefore, in writing to them, Paul surely viewed them as young believers. These Epistles are very precious, for they render us particular help concerning the young Christian life and church life.]</p>
<p>D. The central thought: a holy life for the church life. [This holy life for the church life is constructed of faith, love, and hope. The way to carry out such a life is to be sanctified wholly. In 1 Thessalonians 5:23 Paul says, &ldquo;And the God of peace Himself sanctify you wholly, and may your spirit and soul and body be preserved complete, without blame, at the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ.&rdquo; If we would be sanctified wholly, we need to have our heart established blameless in holiness, and we need to preserve our vessel, our body, in sanctification and honor. Furthermore, all the parts of our being&mdash;our spirit, our soul, and our body&mdash;need to be preserved complete. This is to sanctify our entire being to have a holy life for the proper church life.] [In 2 Thessalonians Paul repeats much of what he has said in 1 Thessalonians. Like a father with a loving heart toward his children, Paul is repetitious. This is characteristic of parents, especially as they grow older. Again and again, they may say the same thing to their children. Therefore, 2 Thessalonians is a repetition and a further development of 1 Thessalonians. It is a repetition with warnings and corrections. In 2 Thessalonians 2 Paul warns the believers not to be misled. He also corrects them in order to bring them back to the right track. Nevertheless, the main subject&mdash;the holy life for the church life&mdash;is the same in both books. Furthermore, in both 1 Thessalonians and 2 Thessalonians we see the basic structure of the Christian life, a structure that includes faith, love, and hope.]</p>
<p>E. The general sketch: [In the two Epistles to the young church in Thessalonica, the genuine Christian life for the proper church life is revealed in a simple and brief way. It is a life of three dimensions in the light of the Lord&rsquo;s coming back: faith as the beginning, the foundation; love as the process, the structure; and hope as the consummation, the topstone. Faith is toward God (1:8); love is toward the saints (3:12; 4:9-10); and hope is in the Lord&rsquo;s coming (2:19). The first Epistle is for encouragement and comfort; the second is for correction and balance. The believers should live, walk, and work by faith and love in the hope of the Lord&rsquo;s coming back; but we should not have the wrong concept that the Lord will come immediately, so that we need not do anything for the long run. These two Epistles may be considered the consummation of the Christian life for the church life. They conclude this section of the apostle Paul&rsquo;s writings, which begins with the book of Romans.]</p>
<p>F. The sections: 1) introduction (1:1), 2) the content&mdash;a holy life for the church life (1:2&mdash;5:24), and 3) conclusion (5:25-28).</p><h2 class="head1">IV. 2 THESSALONIANS</h2>
<p>A. The writer(s), the place, and the time: This book was written by Paul, Silvanus, and Timothy to the church of the Thessalonians (1:1) from Corinth around A.D. 54, as was 1 Thessalonians.</p>
<p>B. The subject: encouragement and correction concerning the holy life for the church life.</p>
<p>C. The background: See 1 Thessalonians.</p>
<p>D. The central thought: See 1 Thessalonians.</p>
<p>E. The general sketch: See 1 Thessalonians.</p>
<p>F. The sections: 1) introduction (1:1-2), 2) the content&mdash; encouragement and correction concerning the holy life for the church life (1:3&mdash;3:15), and 3) conclusion (3:16-18).</p>
<h2 class="head1">V. 1 TIMOTHY</h2>
<p>A. The writer(s), the place, and the time: This book was written by the apostle Paul to Timothy (1:1-2) around A.D. 65, after being released from his first imprisonment in Rome. He may have been in Macedonia when he wrote it (1:3).</p>
<p>B. The subject: God&rsquo;s economy concerning the church.</p>
<p>C. The background: [At this point we need to see something concerning the grouping and the timing of Paul&rsquo;s Epistles. Although Philemon is grouped with 1 and 2 Timothy and Titus, it was actually written earlier, during Paul&rsquo;s first imprisonment. Paul was imprisoned the first time because of the Jews, not because of persecution carried out by the Roman Empire. We know from Acts that Paul appealed to Caesar and this caused him to be sent to Rome, where he was imprisoned. During his first imprisonment, Paul wrote four books: Ephesians, Philippians, Colossians, and Philemon. Thus, according to the time it was written, Philemon should be grouped with Colossians, Philippians, and Ephesians; however, in content it should be grouped, not with these Epistles, but with 1 and 2 Timothy and Titus. Philemon was written not long before Paul&rsquo;s release from prison. In the book of Philippians he expressed his expectation that soon he would be released and visit the churches. Not long afterward, Paul&rsquo;s expectation was fulfilled. Having been released, he traveled to Ephesus, where Timothy was, and from Ephesus he went into Macedonia. From Macedonia Paul wrote the first Epistle to Timothy. Then from Macedonia he went to Nicopolis, where he wrote the Epistle to Titus. First Timothy and Titus, therefore, were written after Paul&rsquo;s release from his first imprisonment. After approximately a year, Caesar Nero suddenly began to persecute Christians. At that time, Paul was accused of being the outstanding leader among the Christians. He was arrested and imprisoned again, this time due to Nero&rsquo;s persecution. From prison, he wrote the Second Epistle to Timothy. In chapter four he indicates to his dear child Timothy that he was ready to depart, to be martyred, to be poured out as a drink offering.</p>
<p>During Paul&rsquo;s first imprisonment, the churches were tested. This test showed that decline and degradation had set in. This decline was altogether due to differing teachings, teachings that were different from the ministry. This was the reason Paul charged Timothy to war a good warfare.]</p>
<p>D. The central thought: [First Timothy unveils to us God&rsquo;s dispensation concerning the church. It is not easy to present such a brief yet all-inclusive summary of this book. Only when we dig into the depths of this Epistle do we realize that this is the subject. If we get into the depths of this book, we shall see that it can be summarized as a book which speaks of God&rsquo;s dispensation, His New Testament economy, concerning the church.</p>
<p>In 1:4 Paul uses the marvelous term &ldquo;God&rsquo;s dispensation.&rdquo; This dispensation is an economical administration. Hence, it refers to God&rsquo;s economy. God&rsquo;s economy is revealed in four expressions found in 1 Timothy 3: Great is the mystery of godliness; God was manifested in the flesh; the church is the house of the living God; the church is the pillar and base of the truth. God&rsquo;s dispensation is related to the great mystery of godliness, to the manifestation of God in the flesh, and to the church as both the house of the living God and the pillar and base of the truth. When God&rsquo;s dispensation is put together with these four matters, we see that 1 Timothy does in fact reveal God&rsquo;s economy concerning the church.]</p>
<p>E. The general sketch: After the introduction, Paul reminded Timothy that he was left in Ephesus to charge others not to teach differently but to center on God&rsquo;s dispensation which is in faith (1:3-17). He then charged Timothy to hold faith and a good conscience to keep the faith (1:18-20). Prayer is needed to carry out God&rsquo;s desire for man&rsquo;s salvation (2:1-7). Paul pointed out that the brothers and sisters in the church needed to have a normal life (2:8-15) and that the overseers and deacons are needed for the church&rsquo;s administration (3:1-13). The proper church then functions as the house of the living God and as the pillar and base of the truth (3:14-16). But Paul predicted the decline of the church (4:1-5). Therefore, Timothy needed to be a good minister of Christ (4:6-16) and learn to deal with saints of different ages (5:1-16), with elders (5:17-25), and with slaves and money lovers (6:1-10) as a man of God (6:11-21a).</p>
<p>[In 1:4 we read of God&rsquo;s dispensation, and in 6:11 Paul uses the expression &ldquo;man of God.&rdquo; Hence, this book begins with God&rsquo;s dispensation and concludes with the charge to a man of God. God&rsquo;s desire is to produce men of God by dispensing Himself into those who believe in Christ. A man of God is one who partakes of God&rsquo;s life and nature (John 1:13; 2 Pet. 1:4) and thus becomes one with Him in His life and nature (1 Cor. 6:17) and thereby expresses Him. This corresponds to the mystery of godliness, which is God manifest in the flesh (1 Tim. 3:16).]</p>
<p>F. The sections: 1) introduction (1:1-2), 2) God&rsquo;s economy versus differing teachings (1:3-17), 3) the faith and conscience needed for the keeping of the faith (1:18-20), 4) prayer for man&rsquo;s salvation (2:1-7), 5) the normal living in the church (2:8-15), 6) overseers and deacons for the church&rsquo;s administration (3:1-13), 7) the function of the church&mdash;the house of the living God and the pillar and base of the truth (3:14-16), 8) the prediction of the decline of the church (4:1-5), 9) a good minister of Christ (4:6-16), 10) dealing with the saints of different ages (5:1-16), 11) dealing with the elders (5:17-25), 12) dealing with slaves and money-lovers (6:1-10), 13) a man of God (6:11-21a), and 14) conclusion (6:21b).</p><h2 class="head1">VI. 2 TIMOTHY</h2>
<p>A. The writer(s), the place, and the time: The apostle Paul wrote this book to Timothy (1:1-2) around A.D. 67, during his second imprisonment in Rome, shortly before his martyrdom (4:6).</p>
<p>B. The subject: inoculation against the decline of the church.</p>
<p>C. The background: [This book was written at a time when the churches established through the apostle&rsquo;s ministry in the Gentile world were in a trend of degradation, and the apostle himself was confined in a remote prison. Many had turned away from him and forsaken him (1:15; 4:16), including even some of his co-workers (4:10). It was a discouraging and disappointing scene, especially to his young fellow-worker and spiritual child, Timothy.] This was why Paul wrote this epistle to encourage, strengthen, and establish Timothy.</p>
<p>D. The central thought: [When Paul was writing this Epistle, he was fully aware that the churches were declining. However, because he was one who laid hold on the promise of eternal life, he was not discouraged or disappointed. He had something within him which never changed&mdash;the eternal, uncreated, incorruptible life of God. No matter how the environment may change, this eternal life remains the same. Because he himself was encouraged in the life of God and not disappointed by the situation, Paul wrote the Second Epistle to Timothy not only as an encouragement and strengthening to a younger co-worker, but also as an inoculation for the entire Body of Christ against the decline of the church.]</p>
<p>E. The general sketch: [The subject of 2 Timothy is inoculation against the decline of the church. After a word of introduction (1:1-2), Paul speaks of the divine provisions for the inoculation: a pure conscience, unfeigned faith, the divine gift, a strong spirit, eternal grace, incorruptible life, the healthy word, and the indwelling Spirit (1:3-14). Then he goes on to point out that the basic factor of the decline is the forsaking of the apostle and his ministry (1:15-18). In 2:1-15 Paul speaks of the inoculator, indicating that he must be a teacher, soldier, contender, husbandman, and workman. In the second half of chapter two he tells us of the spread of the decline, a spreading likened to that of gangrene (2:16-26). In chapter three Paul first speaks of the worsening of the decline, showing that it will become grievous times of deceiving (3:1-13), and then speaks of the antidote of the inoculation&mdash;the divine word (3:14-17). In chapter four there are three sections: the incentive to the inoculator&mdash;the coming reward (4:1-8); the issue of the decline&mdash;loving the present age and doing many evil things (4:9-18); and the conclusion (4:19-22). If we consider the outline of 2 Timothy, we shall see that it is not merely a pastoral book, a book for so-called pastors. On the contrary, it is a book written for inoculators, those who would inoculate others against the decline of the church.]</p>
<p>F. The sections: 1) introduction (1:1-2), 2) the divine provisions for the inoculation&mdash;a pure conscience, unfeigned faith, the divine gift, a strong spirit, eternal grace, incorruptible life, the healthy word, and the indwelling Spirit (1:3-14), 3) the basic factor of the decline&mdash;forsaking the apostle and his ministry (1:15-18), 4) the inoculator&mdash;a teacher, a soldier, a contender, a husbandman, and a workman (2:1-15), 5) the spreading of the decline&mdash;like that of gangrene (2:16-26), 6) the worsening of the decline&mdash;becoming grievous times of deceiving (3:1-13), 7) the antidote of the inoculation&mdash;the divine word (3:14-17), 8) the incentive to the inoculator&mdash;the coming reward (4:1-8), 9) the issue of the decline&mdash;loving the present age and doing many evils (4:9-18), and 10) conclusion (4:19-22).</p>

<h2 class="head2">Text</h2>
<h2 class="head1">I. TITUS</h2>
<p>A. The writer(s), the place, and the time: The apostle Paul wrote this book to Titus (1:1, 4) from Nicopolis around A.D. 65, after being released from his first imprisonment in Rome and passing through Crete (1:5; 3:12).</p>
<p>B. The subject: the maintenance of the order of the church.</p>
<p>C. The background: [During Paul&rsquo;s first imprisonment in Rome, the churches were subject to testing. During this time of testing, certain churches proved not to be so orderly. Thus, after his release from prison, Paul visited various places, including the city of Ephesus and the island of Crete. Realizing the situation of the churches, Paul became burdened to write an epistle to Titus telling him how to maintain the proper order of a local assembly. This was the background and also the reason for the writing of this book.]</p>
<p>D. The central thought: [To have an orderly life, we need to take care of four units: the church, the family, the social system, and the government. If we care for these units properly, we shall have an orderly life in every way. When Paul was writing the book of Titus, he had within him a concern for these four units. Unbelievers, of course, care only for family, society, and government. Even the philosophers and thoughtful people throughout the centuries have considered only these three units among mankind. But among us in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery the most important unit is the church. For us, the church is first. We give the church preeminence in our consideration, for the church is the house of the living God, the pillar and base of the truth. Furthermore, the church is the great mystery of godliness, God manifested in the flesh. Paul covered the matter of the church first in this Epistle, and we follow him to give the church the first place among the four basic units covered in this book.]</p>
<p>[Next to the church, the family is the most important unit in society. Without a proper family life, how could we have a healthy society or country? A nation is constituted of families as the basic factors. We fully realize that without a proper family life it is difficult to have an orderly church life. But we also realize that without a proper church life it is difficult to have a normal and proper family life. We are here for the church and also for the family. Furthermore, we care for society. We respect others, we honor our neighbors, and we care for the existing social system. We are not here as social reformers, and it is not our intention to change the social system. In the Lord&rsquo;s recovery we are here to present to others healthy teachings concerning the all-inclusive Christ and the church as the Body of Christ.]</p>
<p>E. The general sketch: [When Paul was writing the Epistle of Titus, there were certain basic concepts within him. These concepts were the factors, the elements, of the composition of this book. In writing chapter one of Titus, Paul was deeply concerned for the church. Hence, in this chapter he takes care of the proper order in the church and speaks of establishing the eldership for the administration of a local church, of the termination of the various isms, and of holding to the healthy teaching of the apostles. Paul goes on in chapter two to speak of an orderly human life, which is primarily related to the family life. Then...he speaks of society, or of the social system. In 3:1-8 Paul speaks of the rulers, that is, the government.]</p>
<p>F. The sections: 1) introduction (1:1-4), 2) establishing the authority in the church (1:5-9), 3) dealing with the influence of Judaism and Gnosticism (1:10-16), 4) bringing the saints of different ages into an orderly life (2:1-8), 5) charging the slaves to behave well in the social system of slavery (2:9-15), 6) charging the saints to keep a good relationship with the government (3:1-8), 7) dealing with a factious one (3:9-11), and 8) conclusion (3:12-15).</p><h2 class="head1">II. PHILEMON</h2>
<p>A. The writer(s), the place, and the time: This book was written by the apostle Paul and Timothy to Philemon, Apphia, and Archippus, and to the church in their house (vv. 1, 2). It was written about A.D. 64, shortly before Paul&rsquo;s release from his first imprisonment in Rome (vv. 9, 22).</p>
<p>B. The subject: an illustration of the believers&rsquo; equal status in the new man.</p>
<p>C. The background: [When Paul wrote to Philemon, Philemon was in Colosse and Paul was far away, a prisoner in Rome. One of his co-prisoners, Onesimus, was brought to the Lord and begotten by Paul in the Spirit to become not only a believer in Christ and a child of God, but also a dear child to Paul himself. Since there was a church in Rome, why did Paul not recommend this newly saved one to the local church there? Paul did not do this, because Onesimus was a runaway slave and his master, Philemon, lived in Colosse.</p>
<p>The fact that there were churches in Rome and in Colosse indicates that the churches as the expression of the Body of Christ are universal. This was true in ancient times just as it is true today. The first church, the church in Jerusalem, came into existence approximately 34 or 35 A.D. The Epistle to Philemon was written about thirty years later. Even during the comparatively short time of thirty years, churches had been established not only in Judea, but also in the Gentile world. Thus, the church was universal. This was according to the Lord&rsquo;s sovereignty to carry out the commission He had given to Paul. It also was the fulfillment of Paul&rsquo;s desire to see a new man on earth.</p>
<p>By the spreading of the Roman Empire the various nations and peoples around the Mediterranean Sea were brought into contact with one another and were even unified politically. There was a great deal of traffic and communication between people in various parts of the empire. This communication was altogether related to the old man. But at the time Paul wrote to Philemon, another man had come into existence on earth. In the midst of the old man, the new man had come into being. This is fully revealed in Colossians 3:10 and 11: &ldquo;And having put on the new man, which is being renewed unto full knowledge according to the image of Him who created him; where there cannot be Greek and Jew, circumcision and uncircumcision, barbarian, Scythian, slave, freeman, but Christ is all and in all.&rdquo; Philemon was an elder of the church in Colosse. In the Epistle to the Colossians Paul emphasized that all the believers are part of the new man. Furthermore, in the new man there cannot be Greek and Jew, slave and freeman. Philemon was a freeman, and Onesimus was his bondservant. But in the new man they were of equal status.]</p>
<p>D. The central thought: [This short Epistle serves the special purpose of showing us the equality in eternal life and divine love of all the members in the Body of Christ. In the age of Paul the life of Christ had annulled, among the believers, the strong institution of slavery. Since the sentiment of the love of the Christian fellowship was so powerful and prevailing that the evil social order among fallen mankind was spontaneously ignored, any need for institutional emancipation was obviated. Because of the divine birth and living by the divine life, all the believers in Christ had equal status in the church, which was the new man in Christ, with no discrimination between free and bond (Col. 3:10-11). This is based on three facts. First, Christ&rsquo;s death on the cross has abolished the ordinances of the different ways of life for the creation of the one new man (Eph. 2:15). Second, we all have been baptized into Christ and made one in Him without any difference (Gal. 3:27-28). Third, in the new man Christ is all and in all (Col. 3:11). Such a life with such a love in equal fellowship is well able to maintain good order in the church (in Titus), carry out God&rsquo;s economy concerning the church (in 1 Timothy), and stand against the tide of the church&rsquo;s decline (in 2 Timothy). It is of the Lord&rsquo;s sovereignty that this Epistle was positioned after the three preceding books in the arrangement of the New Testament.]</p>
<p>E. The general sketch: [In the book of Philemon we have an excellent pattern and example of bringing a sinner to the Lord through begetting him with the divine life; regarding him as a child, even as our heart; and helping him to rectify all the human relationships. In the churches in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery it is our practice to send back the escaped one and the divorced or separated wife or husband. We want to help rectify all human relationships. In doing this, we must have a loving concern and appeal to the love of the other party. Finally, in keeping with Paul&rsquo;s example in this Epistle, we must help the newly saved one to come into the church life. Paul&rsquo;s desire was to bring Onesimus into the church life. Having been begotten by Paul, Onesimus was now a slave reborn to be a brother. As the one who had begotten him, Paul bore the responsibility to bring Onesimus into the church life, into the fellowship among the members of the Body.]</p>
<p>F. The sections: 1) introduction (vv. 1-3), 2) a slave reborn to be a brother (vv. 4-16), 3) a brother recommended for the acceptance of the new man (vv. 17-22), and 4) conclusion (vv. 23-25).</p><h2 class="head1">III. HEBREWS</h2>
<p>A. The writer(s), the place, and the time: According to the rich and deep contents of this book, none other than the apostle Paul was qualified to be its writer. The mention of Timothy in 13:23 and the tone of fellowship also indicate that Paul was the writer. (For the reason why the writer was not clearly mentioned, see 1:1 footnote 2.) This book may have been written around A.D. 67 after the apostle Paul&rsquo;s release from his first imprisonment in Rome, while he remained in Miletus (2 Tim. 4:20). The mention of &ldquo;those from Italy&rdquo; (13:24) proves that this book was not written in Rome. According to the content, it was clearly written to the Hebrew believers.</p>
<p>B. The subject: Christ is superior to Judaism and everything it encompasses. His completed new covenant is likewise superior to the old.</p>
<p>C. The background: [The Hebrews to whom this book was written believed in the Lord, but they still wanted to hold on to their Jewish religion.] [In A.D. 63 Ananias, one of the high priests in the Jewish religion in Jerusalem, rose up with the Sadducees and Pharisees to persecute the Hebrews. At that time those dear Hebrews appreciated the Lord Jesus, but they were unwilling to forsake their old religion. Eventually, the Lord sovereignly raised up a circumstance which forced them out of it. If they were unwilling to go out, they would be forced out.] [Those Hebrew Christians truly suffered under that persecution. The Jewish religionists robbed them of their property and even threatened their lives (10:34). The Hebrew believers were troubled.] [The Hebrew brothers were bothered and began to wander. They could not say that what Peter and Paul preached and talked was wrong; neither could they say that the temple, the sanctuary, was wrong. They were in a dilemma, finding it difficult to decide whether to go on or to retreat. It was at this juncture that the book of Hebrews was written to them.]</p>
<p>D. The central thought: [In Hebrews is the present Christ who is now in the heavens as our Minister (8:2) and our High Priest (4:14-15; 7:26), ministering to us the heavenly life, grace, authority, and power, and sustaining us to live a heavenly life on earth. He is the Christ now, the Christ today, and the Christ on the throne who is our daily salvation and moment by moment supply. This is the Christ revealed in Hebrews.]</p>
<p>E. The general sketch: [This book, from 1:3, points us continually to the Christ seated in heaven. Paul, in all his other epistles, presents to us mainly the Christ who dwells in our spirit (Rom. 8:10; 2 Tim. 4:22) as the life-giving Spirit (1 Cor. 15:45 ASV) to be our life and our everything. But in this book, he points us particularly to the Christ seated in heaven with so many aspects to care for us in every way. In Paul&rsquo;s other epistles, the indwelling Christ is versus our flesh, self, and natural man. In this book, the heavenly Christ is contrasted with the earthly religion and all earthly things. To experience the indwelling Christ we need to turn to our spirit and contact Him. To enjoy the heavenly Christ we need to look away from all things on earth unto Him who is seated at the right hand of the throne of God. He has accomplished everything that is needed for both God and us by His death and resurrection. Now in His ascension He is sitting in the heavens, in the Person of the Son of God (1:5) and the Son of Man (2:6), in the Person of God (1:8) and man (2:6), as the appointed Heir of all things (1:2), the Anointed One of God (1:9), the Captain of our salvation (2:10), the Sanctifier (2:11), the instant Helper and constant Succor (2:18), the Apostle from God (3:1), the High Priest (2:17; 4:14; 7:26), the Minister in the true tabernacle (8:2) with a more excellent ministry (8:6), the surety and the Mediator of a better covenant (7:22; 8:6; 12:24), the Executor of the new testament (9:16-17), the Forerunner (6:20), the Author and Perfecter of faith (12:2), and the great Shepherd of the sheep (13:20). If we would look unto Him as such a wonderful and all-inclusive One, He, ministering heaven, life, and strength to us, will transfuse and infuse us with all that He is to enable us to run the heavenly race and to live the heavenly life on earth, carrying us through all the lifelong pathway and leading and bringing us into glory (2:10).]</p>
<p>F. The sections: 1) introduction&mdash;God speaking in the Son (1:1-3), 2) the superiority of Christ (1:4&mdash;10:39), 3) faith&mdash;the unique way (11:1&mdash;12:29), 4) virtues for the church life (13:1-19), and 5) conclusion (13:20-25).</p>
<h2 class="head1">CONCLUSION</h2>
<p>[There is an urgent need today for the completion of the word of God. Although Paul was used in the completion of the divine revelation centuries ago, there is still the need for its completion in a practical way among Christians today. In most Christian groups there is very little ministry of Christ as life. Furthermore, not many dare to face the issue of the church. Through his subtlety, Satan, the enemy of God, is seeking to nullify the completion of the word of God. The enemy may allow Christians to preach what is revealed in the Old Testament, in the Gospels, and in the Acts. But he cannot tolerate the teaching concerning Christ as the all-inclusive life-giving Spirit or concerning the church as the mystery of Christ. Anyone who ministers along this line will be attacked by the enemy.] We are not afraid of the enemy&rsquo;s attack because we love the Lord and His completed word. We should give ourselves to study the word that we may be full of the truth. Then we may complete the age and bring the Lord back.</p>

<h2 class="head2">Text</h2>
<h2 class="head1">I. JAMES</h2>
<p>A. The writer(s), the place, and the time: This book was written by James, a slave of God and of the Lord Jesus Christ, a flesh brother of the Lord Jesus (1:1; Matt. 13:55), to the twelve tribes of Israel in dispersion (see 1:1 and footnotes 3 and 4). Because the content does not mention the church being degraded, this book may have been written around A.D. 50. Because it is not easy to find evidence that James left Jerusalem at any time, it was probably written in Jerusalem.</p>
<p>B. The subject: practical Christian perfection.</p>
<p>C. The background: [After studying Paul&rsquo;s writings and all the Life-study Messages on these writings, we shall no doubt be influenced to receive the light concerning God&rsquo;s economy and to be strongly for it. But there is the possibility that we may be careless in our behavior or that we may neglect the matter of practical Christian perfection. Therefore, we need the balance provided by the book of James.]</p>
<p>[A striking characteristic of the Epistle of James is that it indicates that we may be very strong in God&rsquo;s economy, yet may not be complete and entire in our Christian behavior in our personal daily life. Many of us can testify that we have seen the vision concerning God&rsquo;s economy and that we are absolutely for this vision. However, we still need to pay attention to our behavior in our daily life.] A brother may easily become angry with his sibling, or a sister may not have the proper attitude toward her mother. In such cases, [both the brother and the sister are neither complete nor entire. This is an illustration of the fact that we need the balancing word found in the book of James.]</p>
<p>In Acts 21, James told Paul emphatically that many believers were still zealous of the law. He also asked Paul to perform a Nazarite vow in a purification rite for seven days and to pay for several others who could not afford it. James was mixing the dispensation of law with the dispensation of grace. He was unclear concerning God&rsquo;s New Testament economy (Acts 21:23-24, 26 and footnote 1).</p>
<p>[In addition to providing balance, the Epistle of James also serves as a strong warning that it is possible to be very godly and yet not be clear concerning the vision of God&rsquo;s New Testament economy. According to church history, James was noted for living a godly life. One account says that James spent so much time kneeling in prayer that his knees became calloused. James certainly was a godly man, a man of prayer, and prayer is emphasized in his Epistle. Nevertheless, James may not have had a clear view concerning the distinction between grace and law; that is, he may not have had a clear view regarding God&rsquo;s economy. In his writings there are hints that this was the situation. However, his Epistle is notable and remarkable concerning Christian conduct and emphasizes practical Christian perfection. For this reason, in 1:4 James indicates that the believers should be &ldquo;complete and entire, lacking in nothing.&rdquo;]</p>
<p>Because we have pointed out that James may not have been so clear about God&rsquo;s New Testament economy, you may wonder if his epistle is inspired by God. [In 2 Timothy 3:16 Paul says, &ldquo;All Scripture is God-breathed.&rdquo; Therefore, we need to explain carefully what is our attitude toward the inspiration of the Scriptures in relation to the book of James.</p>
<p>First, we definitely believe that all Scripture is God-breathed, that is, inspired by God. We believe that every word of every book of the Bible has been breathed out by God.</p>
<p>Second, although every line and word of the Scripture is inspired by God, this does not mean that every word in this holy Book is the word of God, but we must be very careful in our understanding of this matter. In the Bible there are a great many words that are not God&rsquo;s words.]</p>
<p>Many [words recorded in the Scriptures are the words of Satan, evil men, God&rsquo;s opposers, and even the nonsensical talk of godly men. Furthermore, all the words of the Scriptures were breathed out by God and recorded for a particular purpose. In Genesis 3 the purpose is to expose the subtlety of the enemy. In Acts 21 and in the book of James the purpose is to show us the possibility that a godly person may lack the clear, heavenly view of God&rsquo;s New Testament economy. Praise the Lord that everything in the Bible is God&rsquo;s breath, and everything has been recorded to serve a particular purpose! We thank God for the Scriptures breathed out by Him.]</p>
<p>Although we know that James was not clear concerning God&rsquo;s New Testament economy, we should not despise the book of James, because it is part of God&rsquo;s breathing concerning practical Christian perfection. We need to be clear that God&rsquo;s New Testament way is for us to believe into Christ and to enjoy the dispensing of life. This life becomes our supply for us to have a godly living that James would approve. The Lord said, &ldquo;For I say to you, that unless your righteousness surpass that of the scribes and Pharisees, you shall by no means enter into the kingdom of the heavens&rdquo; (Matt. 5:20). The standard of our morality must be high; yet, the living is not a result of our trying to fulfill the law of the Old Testament. Whenever we try to fulfill the law, we do it in the flesh. The Lord also said, &ldquo;You, therefore, shall be perfect as your heavenly Father is perfect&rdquo; (Matt. 5:48). Our perfection is not by the law but by grace, in the enjoyment of the life of the Father. Praise the Lord that we are getting clear on God&rsquo;s New Testament economy.</p>
<p>D. The central thought: [James writes not merely concerning Christian perfection, but concerning practical Christian perfection, that is, a perfection that is not theoretical but practical in our daily living. It is a strong point of this Epistle that James teaches regarding this practical Christian perfection. The many virtues he covers in this book are related to this perfection.]</p>
<p>E. The general sketch: James begins by addressing the twelve tribes in the dispersion. He then presents many points concerning practical virtues of Christian perfection, such as enduring trial by faith, resisting temptation as God-born ones, living a God-fearing life by the implanted word according to the perfect law of freedom, having no respect of persons among the brothers, being justified by works in relations with the believers, bridling the tongue, behaving in wisdom, dealing with pleasures, the world, and the Devil, not speaking against the brothers, confiding not in self-will but in the Lord, awaiting the Lord&rsquo;s coming with longsuffering, speaking honestly without swearing, and having healthy practices in the church life.</p>
<p>F. The sections: 1) introduction&mdash;to the twelve tribes in dispersion (1:1) and 2) practical virtues of Christian perfection (1:2&mdash;5:20).</p><h2 class="head1">II. 1 PETER</h2>
<p>A. The writer(s), the place, and the time: This book was written by Peter, an apostle of Jesus Christ (1:1), to the Jewish believers dispersed among the Gentile nations (see 1:1 and footnotes 4 and 5). The time of its writing should be prior to Paul&rsquo;s martyrdom (see 5:13 footnote 3), so it may have been written around A.D. 64. It was written in Babylon, a large city on the Euphrates (see 5:13 and footnote 2).</p>
 <p>B. The subject: the Christian life under the government of God.</p>
<p>C. The background: [The reason the two Epistles of Peter were written, especially the first, was that the dispersed Jewish believers were suffering persecution. They were undergoing a fiery trial. Peter compares this persecution to the burning of a furnace. Because the believers were troubled and perhaps doubting, Peter wrote to instruct them and also to comfort them. In 5:10 he says, &ldquo;But the God of all grace, who called you into His eternal glory in Christ, after you have suffered a little while, will Himself perfect, establish, strengthen, and ground you.&rdquo; Here Peter seems to be telling the believers that there is no need for them to doubt, for God is perfecting them. Just as stones are cut in order to be fit together in a building, we also need to be &ldquo;cut&rdquo; in order to be perfected, established, strengthened, and grounded. Peter wrote to comfort the suffering, persecuted saints, showing them that all of them were under God&rsquo;s government. The exercise of God&rsquo;s government is first upon His own children.]</p>
<p>D. The central thought: [In his two Epistles Peter is on the subject of God&rsquo;s universal government. These two books speak concerning the universal government of God.]</p>
<p>[God&rsquo;s government covers the entire universe. We know this by the fact that Peter speaks of the new heavens and new earth. This indicates God&rsquo;s universal government. Eventually, in eternity future, everything will be right and in good order, for righteousness will dwell in the new heavens and new earth. Today the earth is filled with unrighteousness and disorder. Nevertheless, God is still governing heaven and earth.</p>
<p>God governs by judging. This is the way God carries out His government.] [In 1 and 2 Peter we have a record of God&rsquo;s judgment.]</p>
<p>[What is the purpose of God&rsquo;s governing judgment? God judges in order to clear up His universe. The universe was created by God for a positive purpose, but Satan came in to defile it. Now God is cleansing the universe through judgment. He is doing a thorough work of cleaning the entire universe. Eventually, the universe will be new.]</p>
<p>[God will not live or dwell in a place that is unclean. Thus, God is cleansing, purifying, the universe. First He purifies us, His household. We are now the center of His cleaning work.] After He finishes His cleaning work on us, He will clean the universe during the tribulation and the millennium. After everything is cleansed, the new heaven and new earth will be brought in.</p>
<p>E. The general sketch: [The purpose of the book of 1 Peter is to establish and strengthen the suffering believers who have been chosen by God, sanctified by the Spirit from the world unto God, sprinkled by the redeeming blood of Christ, and regenerated by God the Father unto a living hope, unto an inheritance kept in the heavens for them (1:1-4), yet are as pilgrims still sojourning on this earth (1:1, 17; 2:11). In their sojourn, sufferings are unavoidable. They are used by God to test and prove their faith (1:7), to see whether they will follow Christ in suffering for doing good (2:19-23; 3:14-18). The sufferings are used to arm them with a mind against the flesh, that they might not live in the lusts of men, but in the will of God (4:1-2), that they might share the sufferings of Christ and rejoice at the unveiling of His glory (4:12-19), that they might be witnesses of the sufferings of Christ (5:1), and that they might be perfected, established, strengthened, and grounded for the eternal glory into which God has called them (5:8-10). This is wholly under God&rsquo;s government that He might judge His chosen people (1:17), to begin His judgment from His own house (4:17). Hence, this book may also be considered a book concerning God&rsquo;s government.]</p>
<p>F. The sections: 1) introduction&mdash;to the pilgrims in dispersion under the operation of the Triune God (1:1-2), 2) full salvation of the Triune God and its issues (1:3-25), 3) growth in life and its results (2:1-10), 4) Christian life and its sufferings (2:11&mdash;4:19), 5) the elders&rsquo; shepherding and its reward (5:1-4), 6) the mighty hand of God and its goal (5:5-11), and 7) conclusion (5:12-14).</p><h2 class="head1">III. 2 PETER</h2>
<p>A. The writer(s), the place, and the time: This book was written by Peter, a slave and apostle of Jesus Christ, to the Jewish believers in the dispersion in the Gentile world (1:1 footnote 3). According to the degraded condition of the church in chapter 2, and the commending words spoken concerning the apostle Paul in 3:15-16, this book may have been written after the martyrdom of Paul, possibly around A.D. 69, before the destruction of Jerusalem in A.D. 70, and it must have been written shortly before Peter&rsquo;s martyrdom (1:14).</p>
<p>B. The subject: the divine provision and the divine government.</p>
<p>C. The background: See this section under 1 Peter.</p>
<p>D. The central thought: [The subject of 1 Peter is the Christian life under the government of God. The book of 2 Peter is a continuation of 1 Peter, and it also emphasizes God&rsquo;s government. However, in this Epistle we also see God&rsquo;s provision. Therefore, we may say that the subject of 2 Peter is the divine provision and the divine government.</p>
<p>With God&rsquo;s government there is God&rsquo;s provision. God grants us His provision so that we may cooperate with His government. In other words, if we would carry out God&rsquo;s government, we need God&rsquo;s provision; that is, we need the divine supply. In 2 Peter the writer first presents the divine supply. We see how God&rsquo;s power provides all the supply for our need. This is the main significance of this book. Furthermore, the Epistle of 2 Peter shows us a continuation of the picture of God&rsquo;s government unveiled in 1 Peter. Therefore, what we have in 2 Peter is the divine provision and the divine government.]</p>
<p>E. The general sketch: [After a word of introduction (1:1-2), Peter speaks concerning the divine provision (1:3-21). The divine provision includes two matters: the impartation of the divine power (1:3-11) and the shining of the divine truth (1:12-21). Regarding the impartation of the divine power, we have two main points: all things related to life and godliness with the divine nature (vv. 3-4) and the development by the growth in life unto the rich entrance into the eternal kingdom (vv. 5-11). Regarding the shining of the divine truth, there are also two main points: the glory of the apostles&rsquo; witnessing (vv. 12-18) and the light of the prophetic word (vv. 19-21).] [In 2 Peter 2 we see God&rsquo;s judgment on the false teachers (2:1-3), God&rsquo;s judgment of old on both angels and men (vv. 4-9), and the evils of the false teachers and their punishment under God&rsquo;s judgment (vv. 10-22).] [In 3:1-9 we see God&rsquo;s judgment on the heretical mockers.] In 3:10-12, [Peter speaks concerning God&rsquo;s judgment on the heavens and the earth.] [In verse 13 we have the expectation of the new heavens and the new earth filled with God&rsquo;s righteousness; in 14 to 16, the preparation for the coming judgment; and in 17 and 18, the conclusion, where we are told to be on guard and grow in grace and knowledge of the Lord.]</p>
<p>F. The sections: 1) introduction&mdash;to the believers allotted like precious faith (1:1-2), 2) the divine provision (1:3-21), 3) the divine government (2:1&mdash;3:16), and 4) conclusion&mdash;to be on guard and grow in grace and knowledge of the Lord (3:17-18).</p>

<h2 class="head2">Text</h2>
<h2 class="head1">I. 1 JOHN</h2>
<p>A. The writer(s), the place, and the time: According to the structure, tone, and wording, there can be no doubt that this book was written by the same John who wrote the Gospel of John. It was written to all the believers who had received God&rsquo;s eternal life by believing in the Son of God (5:11-13). According to church history and the contents of the entire book, it must have been written after John had returned from being exiled on the island of Patmos, probably between A.D. 90 and A.D. 95, and it must have been written in Ephesus, where the apostle John last ministered.</p>
<p>B. The subject: the fellowship of the divine life.</p>
<p>C. The background: [Toward the end of the first century, when the apostle John was writing his Gospel, Epistles, and Revelation, there were already heresies concerning the Person of Christ. One heretical teaching was that Christ was God but not man, and another heresy was that Christ was man but not God. Other heretics denied that Jesus was the Christ. Because of such a situation, John was burdened to write concerning the Person of Christ in an all-inclusive way.]</p>
<p>D. The central thought: [In John&rsquo;s Epistles, especially in the first one, the focus is the mystery of the fellowship of the manifested divine life among the believers with God and with one another. This fellowship is mysterious. Although we are of different races, colors, and nationalities, we enjoy the one fellowship in the manifested divine life. We have a wonderful oneness among us. This is the mystery of the fellowship of the divine life.]</p>
<p>E. The general sketch: [In the Epistle of 1 John there are three main sections: the fellowship of the divine life (1:1&mdash;2:11), the teaching of the divine anointing (2:12-27), and the virtues of the divine birth (2:28&mdash;5:21).] [The sequence here is very significant. First, John shows us that in the divine life there is the enjoyment of fellowship, and in this fellowship we enjoy the teaching of the anointing.] Then, the [sequence of these sections indicates that the fellowship of the divine life and the teaching of the divine anointing bring us into the virtues of the divine birth.] [In the third section we see how much enjoyment we receive from the divine birth. In particular, this enjoyment is related to the virtues of the divine birth. The divine birth brings in many virtues. Only by the fellowship of the divine life and by the teaching of the divine anointing can we experience and enjoy all the virtues imparted to us through the divine birth.]</p>
<p>F. The sections: 1) the fellowship of the divine life (1:1&mdash;2:11), 2) the teaching of the divine anointing (2:12-27), and 3) the virtues of the divine birth (2:28&mdash;5:21).</p><h2 class="head1">II. 2 JOHN</h2>
<p>A. The writer(s), the place, and the time: This book was written by John, the elder, to the chosen lady and her children (see v. 1 and footnote 2). It should have been written after 1 John (refer to this section under 1 John). Church history definitely states that at the time of the writing of this book, John was an elder in Ephesus; therefore, this book must have been written in Ephesus.</p>
<p>B. The subject: prohibition of the participation in heresy.</p>
<p>C. The background: See this section under 1 John.</p>
<p>D. The central thought: [The Epistle of 2 John prohibits us from participating in any heretical teaching concerning Christ&rsquo;s Person. In verse 10 the apostle John says, &ldquo;If anyone comes to you and does not bring this teaching, do not receive him into your house, and do not say to him, Rejoice!&rdquo; As in verse 9, the &ldquo;teaching&rdquo; here is the teaching concerning the deity of Christ, especially regarding His incarnation by divine conception. In this Epistle John warns us not to receive anyone who denies the truth concerning Christ&rsquo;s deity and incarnation.]</p>
<p>E. The general sketch: In his introduction (vv. 1-2), John speaks of loving in truth for the truth. In verse 3 the apostle greets and blesses the believers with grace, mercy, and peace based upon the existence among them of the two crucial matters of truth and love. In verses 4 through 6 he speaks concerning the walk in truth and love. In verses 7 through 11 he speaks concerning not participating in heresy. In verses 12 and 13 John concludes his epistle with his expression of hope of closer fellowship for more joy and his greeting in endearing care.</p>
<p>F. The sections: 1) introduction (vv. 1-3), 2) the walk in truth and love (vv. 4-6), 3) not participating in heresy (vv. 7-11), and 4) conclusion (vv. 12-13).</p>
<h2 class="head1">III. 3 JOHN</h2>
<p>A. The writer(s), the place, and the time: This epistle was written in Ephesus by John, while he was an elder there, to Gaius (v. 1 and footnote 2). It was written after 2 John.</p>
<p>B. The subject: encouragement to the fellow workers in the truth.</p>
<p>C. The background: See this section under 1 John.</p>
<p>D. The central thought: [Both 2 John and 3 John are based on 1 John. Both 2 and 3 John indicate that we need to live in truth and walk in truth. The difference is that in 2 John there is the prohibition of participating in heresy, of participating in any teaching that is against this truth. We must stay away from any teaching or any person who is against the reality of the Triune God. But in 3 John there is the encouragement to help the fellow workers in the truth. We need to join ourselves to anyone who works for the divine reality of the Triune God that we are enjoying, and we need to do whatever we can to promote this work. Hence, in 2 John there is a negative attitude toward heresy and in 3 John, a positive attitude toward the work for the truth. Whether our attitude should be negative or positive depends on whether the particular situation is for the divine reality or against it.]</p>
<p>E. The general sketch: In his introduction (vv. 1-4), John speaks concerning loving in truth (v. 1), prospering in all things and in health (v. 2), and walking in truth (vv. 3-4). In verses 5 through 8 he speaks concerning hospitality to the traveling workers (vv. 5-8) given faithfully, in love, and worthily of God (vv. 5-6) by the fellow workers in the truth (vv. 7-8). In verses 9 through 12, John speaks concerning imitation not of the evil but of the good, giving two examples&mdash;the self-exalting and domineering Diotrephes as an evil example (vv. 9-11), and the well-reported Demetrius as a good example (v. 12). In verses 13 and 14, as the conclusion, John expresses the hope of closer fellowship (vv. 13-14a) and extends mutual greetings (v. 14b).</p>
<p>F. The sections: 1) introduction (vv. 1-4), 2) hospitality to the traveling workers (vv. 5-8), 3) imitation not of the evil but of the good (vv. 9-12), and 4) conclusion (vv. 13-14).</p>
<h2 class="head1">IV. JUDE</h2>
<p>A. The writer(s), the place, and the time: This book was written by Jude, a slave of Christ. Both Jude and James were brothers of the Lord Jesus in the flesh (v. 1 and footnote 1). Because the degraded condition of the church evident in this book is similar to that which must have existed at the writing of 2 Peter, these two books must have been written at about the same time, around A.D. 69, before the destruction of Jerusalem in A.D. 70. Jude may have been written in Jerusalem or Judea. According to the Jewish flavor of this book, it must have been intended for the Jewish saints.</p>
<p>B. The subject: contending for the faith.</p>
<p>C. The background: The [Epistle of Jude was written in the time of the church&rsquo;s apostasy and degradation.]</p>
<p>D. The central thought: Jude and Peter (in his second epistle) [bore the responsibility to sound the trumpet for the New Testament truths, condemned the same things and emphasized the fact that anyone who takes the way of apostasy will suffer God&rsquo;s judgment.] [We need to learn from the books of Jude and 2 Peter to fear God and to be very careful concerning the Lord&rsquo;s Person and His redemptive work. Because we live in a perverted age, the young people especially need to be on the alert. We all must have a basic understanding of the Word of God. This will protect us.] [Today we all need to be faithful to contend for the faith once for all delivered to the saints.]</p>
<p>E. The general sketch: After his introduction (vv. 1-2), Jude charges the believers to contend for the faith (v. 3). Then he goes on to speak concerning apostasy (v. 4), pointing out historical examples of the Lord&rsquo;s judgment upon apostasy (vv. 5-7), and the evils of the apostates and their punishment under the Lord&rsquo;s judgment (vv. 8-19). In verses 20 through 23, he charges the believers to build themselves up in the holy faith and to live in the Triune God (vv. 20-21), and to care for others with mercy in fear (vv. 22-23). Jude concludes with praise to Him who is able to guard the believers and set them before His glory (vv. 24-25).</p>
<p>F. The sections: 1) introduction&mdash;to those called, beloved, and kept (vv. 1-2), 2) contending for the faith (v. 3), 3) heresies of the apostates (v. 4), 4) historical examples of the Lord&rsquo;s judgment upon apostasy (vv. 5-7), 5) evils of the apostates and their punishment under the Lord&rsquo;s judgment (vv. 8-19), 6) charges to the believers (vv. 20-23), and 7) conclusion&mdash;praise to Him who is able to guard and set the believers before His glory (vv. 24-25).</p><h2 class="head1">V. REVELATION</h2>
<p>A. The writer(s), the place, and the time: The apostle John wrote this book to the seven churches in Asia around A.D. 90, while he was in exile on the island Patmos (1:1, 4, 9).</p>
<p>B. The subject: Christ as the centrality of God&#8217;s governmental administration by God&#8217;s eternal economy.</p>
<p>C. The background: [The book of Revelation is the conclusion of John&#8217;s writings. As we pointed out in the life-study of John, the writings of the apostle John are of three categories: his Gospel, his Epistles, and his Revelation. John&#8217;s Gospel is for the imparting of life. In John 10:10 Jesus said, &#8220;I came that they may have life and may have it abundantly,&#8221; and in John 12:24 He said, &#8220;Truly, truly, I say to you, unless a grain of wheat falls into the ground and dies, it abides alone; but if it dies, it bears much fruit.&#8221; In these verses we see the imparting of life, which is the central thought of the Gospel of John. In John&#8217;s Epistles is the fellowship for the growth of life. Although life has been imparted into us, it needs to grow. Life grows by fellowship. Therefore, in John&#8217;s Epistles we see the fellowship for the growth of life. In the last category of John&#8217;s writings, his Revelation, we have the reaping of life. Firstly, life is imparted, then it grows, and eventually it is reaped. Without Revelation, we would have the imparting of life and the growth of life, but not the reaping of life.</p>
<p>Revelation is also the conclusion of the New Testament, which is composed of the Gospels, the Acts, the Epistles, and Revelation. In the Gospels we see the sowing of the seed of life, for in the Gospels Jesus came to sow Himself into humanity as the seed of life, sowing Himself into a small number of people, such as Peter and John. In the Acts is the propagation of life. In the Epistles we see the growth of life. The central concept of all the Epistles written by Paul, Peter, John, and the others is the growth of life. We all need to grow in life. In Revelation we see, once again, the harvest of life. In chapter fourteen of Revelation we have a ripened field and a harvest. Revelation 14:15 says, &#8220;Another angel came out of the temple, crying with a loud voice to Him who sat on the cloud, Send forth Your sickle and reap, for the hour to reap has come, because the harvest of the earth is ripe.&#8221; In Revelation 14, the whole field is harvested. By this we see that Revelation is the conclusion of the New Testament.</p>
<p>As the last book of the Bible, Revelation is the conclusion, completion, and consummation of the entire divine revelation, the whole Bible. The Bible needs such a conclusion. The seeds of most of the truths of the divine revelation were sown in Genesis, the first book of the Bible. The growth of all these seeds is progressively developed in the following books, especially in the books of the New Testament, and the harvest is reaped in the book of Revelation. For example, in Genesis is the seed of the serpent, and in the book of Revelation there is the harvest of the serpent. Hence, most of the things covered in this book are not absolutely new, but refer back to the foregoing books of the Bible. In Genesis is the seed of the divine revelation, in the following books is the progressive development of the divine revelation, and in Revelation is the harvest of the divine revelation. Therefore, we all must get into this book and know it. If we do not know this book, we cannot be clear about God&#8217;s revelation. In our travels, we often are not clear about the way, the road, until we have reached our destination. After we have reached our destination and look back upon the way we have taken, we become very clear. In Revelation we arrive at the destination of the whole Bible. Having arrived at this destination, we can understand this divine Book.]</p>
<p>D. The central thought: [Revelation is a book of conclusion. If the book of Revelation were deleted from the Bible, there would be a great shortage, for there would be a beginning but no ending. Although there is the beginning in the book of Genesis, without the book of Revelation there is no conclusion or consummation. After having a good start and after passing through so many works, there is the need for God to have a consummation. Without Revelation, there is no conclusion of God&#8217;s economy. God is great; He is a God of purpose. For the fulfillment of His purpose, His economy must be accomplished. Many Bible students have neglected the matter of God&#8217;s economy. If we did not have Revelation, we could not see the consummation of God&#8217;s economy. In fact, we would even find it difficult to realize what God&#8217;s economy is, because we would not see the result, the issue of His economy. But in this book the revelation of God&#8217;s economy is so clear because it contains the conclusion of God&#8217;s economy.]</p>
<p>E. The general sketch: [Revelation is firstly a book of Christ, secondly a book of the church, and thirdly a book of God&#8217;s economy.] [The whole Bible reveals Christ. As the conclusion, completion, and consummation of the Bible, the book of Revelation especially is &#8220;the revelation of Jesus Christ&#8221; (1:1). Although this book also reveals many other things, the focus of its revelation is Christ. Several aspects of Christ, such as the vision of Him as the High Priest in the midst of the churches, caring for them in love yet with a judging attitude (1:13-16), the vision of Him as the Lion-Lamb in the midst of God&#8217;s throne and of the four living creatures and in the midst of the twenty-four elders of the universe, opening the seven seals of God&#8217;s universal administration (5:1-6:1), and the vision of Him as Another Mighty Angel coming down from heaven to take possession of the earth (10:1-8; 18:1) have never been unveiled as they are in the book of Revelation. In this book, the revelation of Christ is unique and ultimate. In the Gospels, Acts, and Epistles we do not see that Christ has seven eyes, but this is revealed in the book of Revelation (5:6). Christ, our Savior, has seven eyes. How terrifying! This revelation of Christ is unique. In Luke 4:22 we are told that &#8220;words of grace&#8221; proceeded out of Christ&#8217;s mouth, but in Revelation 1:16 a sharp two-edged sword proceeds out of His mouth. Moreover, in his Gospel, John says, &#8220;Behold, the Lamb of God&#8221; (1:29), but in Revelation one of the elders says, &#8220;Behold, the Lion of the tribe of Judah&#8221; (5:5). Hence, the revelation of Christ in this book is unique. In no other book is Christ unveiled as He is in Revelation. The first item of the contents of Revelation is this unique Christ.]</p>
<p>[On one hand, this book gives us &#8220;the revelation of Christ,&#8221; and on the other hand, it shows us &#8220;the testimony of Jesus,&#8221; which is particular and consummate (1:2, 9; 12:17; 19:10; 20:4). The testimony of Jesus is the church. Revelation presents the revealed Christ and the testifying church. In this book we have a particular and consummate record of the church. In no other book are the churches revealed as they are in the book of Revelation. The lampstands in chapter one, the great multitude of the redeemed in chapter seven, the bright woman with her man-child in chapter twelve, the harvest with its firstfruits in chapter fourteen, the overcomers on the sea of glass in chapter fifteen, the Bride ready for marriage and the fighting army of Christ in chapter nineteen, and the New Jerusalem in chapters twenty-one and twenty-two are all the testimony of Jesus. The testimony of Jesus is the spirit-the substance, the disposition, and the characteristic-of the prophecy (19:10). Christ is the Witness (1:5), the testimony, the expression of God, and the church is the testimony, the expression of Christ. As such, the church is the reproduction of the testimony, the expression of God in Christ. The particular revelation of the church in this book is very crucial, and we all must see it.]</p>
<p>[The contents of Revelation also include the economy of God. God&#8217;s economy is His universal and eternal administration. In the book of Revelation we see God&#8217;s universal and eternal administration which is for the carrying out of His economy. Space-wise His administration is universal and time-wise it is eternal.] [In God&#8217;s administration the first group of items is the seven seals.] [The first four seals cover the history of the world from Christ&#8217;s ascension to the end of this age (6:1-8).] [The fifth seal covers the cry of the martyred saints (6:9-11). This will occur close to the end of this age and near the beginning of the great tribulation.] [The sixth seal, taking place very near to the time of the great tribulation, covers the shaking of earth and heaven (6:12-17).] [The seventh seal, which will last for eternity, consists of the seven trumpets.] [The seven trumpets are the contents of the seventh seal. The first four trumpets are the judgments on the earth, the sea, the rivers, and the sun, moon, and stars (8:7-12). As a result of the judgments in the first four trumpets, the earth will no longer be a suitable place for people to live in. The fifth trumpet, the first woe as judgment on men, will be the beginning of the great tribulation (8:13-9:11).] [The sixth trumpet, which is the second woe as a further judgment on men, is a part of the great tribulation (9:12-21). The seventh trumpet is quite complicated. It consists of the eternal kingdom of Christ, the third woe comprising the seven bowls, the judgment of the dead, the rewarding of the saints and of the God-fearing people, and the destruction of the earth&#8217;s destroyers (11:14-18). The third woe, which is the second item of the seventh trumpet, will be the closing of the great tribulation. After this, there will be the rewarding of the prophets, the saints, and those who fear God&#8217;s name.] [The seventh trumpet also comprises the judgment of the dead and the destruction of the earth&#8217;s destroyers. The destroyers of the earth are Satan, the Antichrist, the false prophet, and all their followers. Hence, the seventh trumpet includes everything from the end of the tribulation to eternity.]</p>
<p>[The seven bowls, a part of the negative contents of the seventh trumpet as the last plagues of God&#8217;s wrath on men, will be the ending of the great tribulation (15:1, 6-8; 16:1-21). The seven bowls, like the seven seals and the seven trumpets, are composed of a group of the first four and then the fifth, sixth, and seventh. This grouping is meaningful. Certainly the writer of the book of Revelation must be God. Who else would have had the wisdom required to write it? If this book was written according to John&#8217;s imagination, then John must be God. The book of Revelation is surely composed in a marvelous way.]</p>
<p>F. The sections: 1) introduction-the revelation of Christ and the testimony of Jesus (1:1-8), 2) &#8220;the things which you have seen&#8221; (1:9-20), 3) &#8220;the things which are&#8221;-the seven local churches (2:1-3:22), 4) &#8220;the things which are about to take place&#8221; (4:1-22:5), and 5) conclusion-the Lord&#8217;s last warning and the apostle&#8217;s last prayer (22:6-21).</p>

<h2 class="head2">Text</h2>
<p>[In this chapter we need to see some of the principles in interpreting the Bible. If we want to study the Bible, we have to understand the Bible. In order to understand the Bible, we need to interpret it. If there is no interpretation and no explanation, naturally we will have no way to understand the Bible. We know everything has its own principles. The more esteemed and important a matter is, the stricter are its governing principles and laws. If a matter is of no significance or importance, and can be carried out in any way, there will not be any laws, principles, and regulations to speak of. But if a matter is proper, and occupies a definite place and significance, and if it is great and noble, surely there are principles and laws governing it; one cannot carry it out haphazardly.</p>
<p>The Bible is an extremely great item in the universe. Besides our Lord and God of glory, I believe the greatest item in the universe is the Bible we have before our eyes and in our hands. Since the Bible is so important, we need the proper interpretation before we can study or understand it. This interpretation must be governed by definite rules, laws, and principles. We cannot interpret it in this or that or any way we like.</p>
<p>Now that we have seen how the Bible was written, how it was translated into different languages and placed in our hands as an available book, we need to find out the governing principles and laws for its interpretation and study. Not only will this help us to understand the Bible, it will also help us to avoid many errors.</p>
<p>All rules are a kind of protection. If a train has no railroad tracks to run on, not only will it be unable to run smoothly, but it will also be without protection. When there are railroad tracks, the train will move smoothly and will have the proper protection. This is the same way with the study of the Bible. If one studies the Bible and expounds it blindly and carelessly, the result will be inconceivable and even dangerous. Our thoughts are often without restraints. It is very dangerous for a person to judge according to what he thinks and to interpret according to what he perceives. If we want to study the Bible properly and understand it accurately, there must be the restrictive interpretation. If we want a restrictive exposition of the Bible, we need to find out the principles and laws of Bible interpretation. Here we will point out ten such principles.]</p><h2 class="head1">I. AS LITERALLY AS POSSIBLE</h2>
<p>[The first principle is to interpret and understand the Bible as literally as possible. We have to grasp firmly the fact that when God inspired men to write the Bible, He used words that are fully comprehensible to man. When we attempt to understand the Bible today, we must understand the thought of God strictly and accurately according to the letter of the words. We should not think that since the Bible is inspired by God, it will always transcend human language, and is therefore open for spiritual interpretation. This is a dangerous proposition. We should interpret the Bible according to the literal meaning of the words. No matter how difficult or out of place a literal interpretation appears to us, we have to adhere strictly to the literal meaning.</p>
<p>Let us mention a few examples. An obvious one is the Old Testament prophecy in Isaiah concerning the Lord Jesus being born of a virgin. Today, the Lord has already been born of a virgin. It is therefore no surprise to us when we read and hear this word. But at the time of Isaiah, when men read what he wrote concerning a virgin bearing a child and calling his name Emmanuel, would they not have had difficulty in their mind? A person would certainly have difficulty in understanding how a virgin can be with child. Some could have turned to a spiritual interpretation, suggesting that the virgin could mean something else rather than an actual virgin. But when this prophecy was fulfilled, it was fulfilled literally. The virgin referred to an actual virgin.</p>
<p>Again the book of Zechariah in the Old Testament prophesied that the Lord Jesus would enter Jerusalem the last time on a colt. When a person read this at that time, they could have found it hard to understand because to them, this One to whom others would proclaim &ldquo;Hosanna,&rdquo; the King worthy of praise, the most esteemed One of Israel, could not possibly enter Jerusalem on a little colt. Men would think that it is illogical to ride on a colt. For that reason, they would interpret it spiritually to mean something else. However, when the prophecy was fulfilled, it was fulfilled literally in every way. The word was colt, and it was in fact a colt.</p>
<p>When we read the Bible, on the one hand, we have to receive spiritual inspirations, but on the other hand, we must not alter the literal meaning to fit a spiritual interpretation. Only when a literal interpretation of a prophecy or parable leads to absurdities or improprieties can we interpret them spiritually. But such cases are few in the Bible.</p>
<p>One has to consider carefully whether a passage should be interpreted literally or spiritually. There is a big difference there. I have heard that some have interpreted the locusts in Revelation as today&rsquo;s airplanes, and the hail from heaven as the bombs dropped by the planes. This is ridiculous. We must be careful not to interpret the Bible too freely. If one wants to find examples of strange and irrational interpretations, he can read the &ldquo;Signs of the Times,&rdquo; published by the Seventh-Day Adventists. There one can find many unrestricted and haphazard interpretations. We should not interpret the Bible this way. We should hold fast to the principles and adhere to the literal meanings as much as possible. It is only when a literal interpretation of some words in some visions, prophecies, and parables becomes too absurd and silly that we can interpret them spiritually.]</p>
<h2 class="head1">II. NO LITERAL AND SPIRITUAL<br />
INTERPRETATION<br />
WITHIN THE SAME SENTENCE,<br />
VERSE, OR SECTION</h2>
<p>[We cannot interpret a sentence, a verse, or a section of the Bible spiritually for the first part and literally for the second part. We should not do that the other way around either. If a passage is to be interpreted spiritually, it should be interpreted spiritually throughout. If a passage is to be interpreted literally, it must be interpreted literally throughout. For example, the Lord Jesus said in John 3 that unless one is born of water and of the Spirit, he cannot enter into the kingdom of God. Many Bible expositors have interpreted the water here spiritually as referring to the word of God. However, in the next phrase, they take the Spirit literally, referring to it as the Holy Spirit. This kind of interpretation is wrong and is against the principle of Bible interpretation. If one would interpret the Spirit in the second part literally, he must interpret the water in the first part literally also. If one interprets the water spiritually, he must interpret the Spirit spiritually also. Since one cannot interpret the Spirit spiritually, neither can he interpret the water spiritually; it must be interpreted literally.</p>
<p>In Matthew 3, John the Baptist said, &ldquo;I indeed baptize you in water unto repentance, but He who is coming after me is mightier than I...He shall baptize you in the Holy Spirit and fire; whose winnowing fork is in His hand, and He will thoroughly cleanse His threshing floor and will gather His wheat into His barn, but He will burn the chaff with unquenchable fire&rdquo; (vv. 11-12). Some expositors have interpreted the fire here spiritually as tribulations and trials. Some have even interpreted this to be the Holy Spirit burning as a fire. All these have interpreted the word fire spiritually. But in this verse, the water mentioned by John is actual water, and the Holy Spirit is the Holy Spirit, literally. Therefore, the fire in the latter part should not be interpreted spiritually, but rather, literally. If the word fire has to be interpreted spiritually, then the water should also be interpreted spiritually. However, it is impossible to do this. This is an important principle in the interpretation of the Bible. For the different parts within a same passage, either they must all be interpreted literally, or they must all be interpreted spiritually. They cannot be interpreted both ways.]</p><h2 class="head1">III. ONE PORTION NOT SUFFICIENT<br />
TO REPRESENT A WHOLE TRUTH</h2>
<p>[In interpreting the Bible, we have to pay attention to one more thing: one portion of the Word is not sufficient to represent the whole truth. In other words, there is no truth that can be fully explained in a single portion of the Word. Therefore, in reading and interpreting the Bible, we should pay attention to the words &ldquo;again it is written.&rdquo; This is the word spoken by the Lord Jesus in Matthew 4:7. When the Lord was tempted, the devil quoted to the Lord the words in Psalm 91 that God would give charge to His angels to bear Him up, lest He strike His foot against a stone. The devil argued that He could jump from the top of the temple and would not be hurt because there is such a promise in the Old Testament. This is how the devil tempted the Lord Jesus with an isolated passage of the Old Testament. When the Lord heard that, He answered right away, &ldquo;Again it is written, You shall not tempt the Lord your God.&rdquo; This shows us that we cannot consider one isolated portion of the Bible alone. Instead, we must consider two, three, or more portions of the Word together.</p>
<p>If we neglect the principle of &ldquo;again it is written,&rdquo; but apply the words of the Bible in an isolated way, we will easily be deceived by the wiles of the devil. If the devil cannot stop someone from following the Bible, he will cause that one to quote the Bible in an isolated way. Of course, Satan would wish that we do not do anything according to the Bible. But many times, he knows that this is impossible. All those who love and fear the Lord want to walk according to the Bible. The devil cannot stop us from following the Bible or walking according to the Bible. He can only use other ways, one of which is to cause us to follow the Bible in an isolated way. In this way we are driven to the extreme and forget the words that say &ldquo;again it is written.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This word &ldquo;again&rdquo; is too big a word. We should put a circle around it. This shows us that when we follow the Bible, we should not do so in an isolated way. We should consider both sides and even all sides. No single portion of the Bible can represent the whole truth, in the same way that no one face of a house can represent the whole house completely. Even we ourselves are the same. If we take a picture from behind, there is not a single hole in the head. But if we take a picture from the front, there are clearly seven holes. Any single side of a man cannot represent the whole person. The same can be said of the words of the Bible. Any one portion of the Bible cannot represent the whole truth, and we have to be balanced in every way. Hence, we have to remember the principle of &ldquo;again it is written.&rdquo;]</p>
<h2 class="head1">IV. EVERY VERSE CONTAINING ALL THE TRUTHS</h2>
<p>[No single verse can represent the whole truth. However, every verse of the Bible contains all the truths. On the one hand, no single verse can include the whole truth, and to understand a truth, one cannot rely on one verse alone, but has to consider many other verses. On the other hand, in determining any truth, one has to consider every verse. Each verse in the Bible contains all the truths.</p>
<p>One brother once said that any single verse in the Bible requires the whole Bible to explain it. This is very true. If one wants to understand Genesis 1:1, he has to understand the whole Bible. On the one hand, Genesis 1:1 cannot contain the whole truth. On the other hand, Genesis 1:1 includes all the truths of the Bible.</p>
<p>Therefore, in determining any truth, we cannot rely on one portion of the Bible alone. Instead, we have to depend on all the words of the Bible. In a similar way, the exposition of any single verse cannot be based on its own context; instead it must be based on the whole Bible. Second Peter 1:20 says that no prophecy of the Scripture is of one&rsquo;s own interpretation. The original meaning of this verse is that the prophecy of the Bible should not be interpreted according to its own context. This means to interpret any prophecy, one has to study all the prophecies in the Bible, and has to make decisions based on all the prophecies of the Bible. Only then will the interpretation be complete.]</p>
<h2 class="head1">V. NOT SACRIFICING ANY PORTION OF THE WORD</h2>
<p>[In determining a truth, sometimes many related verses indicate a certain meaning, but two or three among them cannot be explained in that kind of way. One cannot say that because there were only one or two verses that could not be explained that way, one can therefore sacrifice them and base the exposition on the majority of the verses. If one does that, he is sacrificing a small number of verses. We cannot do this. As long as one or two verses do not allow a certain interpretation, we have to give up that interpretation. We have to respect every portion of the Bible. Only when an interpretation harmonizes with the whole Bible can this interpretation be considered reliable. Any verse that forbids a certain interpretation of the truth must not be sacrificed. Instead, that certain interpretation must be abandoned, and we must wait for God&rsquo;s further revelation. If we study the Bible this way, we will not fall easily into error.]</p><h2 class="head1">VI. ALL APPOSITIONAL EXPRESSIONS<br />
BEING EQUAL</h2>
<p>[There are many expressions in the Bible that are in apposition one to another. All these appositional expressions are equal and are not different. For example, Matthew 5 speaks of nine blessings. It says, &ldquo;Blessed are the poor in spirit, for theirs is the kingdom of the heavens,&rdquo; and &ldquo;Blessed are the pure in heart, for they shall see God.&rdquo; These are matching expressions, with the first expression matching the second one. In this case, with every blessing, there is first the condition for blessing and then the blessing itself. All matching expressions are equal. If the first part of one expression specifies a condition, then all first parts of matching expressions specify conditions also. If the second part of one expression specifies a blessing, then the second parts of all expressions specify blessings also. This is another principle or rule.]</p>
<h2 class="head1">VII. NEITHER BEING CONFINED<br />
BY THE BACKGROUND NOR IGNORING<br />
THE BACKGROUND</h2>
<p>[In interpreting the Bible, one should not be confined by the background, nor should he ignore the background. For example, in the Lord&rsquo;s sermon on the mount, many words are spoken with a Jewish background. The Lord says, &ldquo;Therefore, if you are offering your gift at the altar and there remember that your brother has anything against you,&rdquo; (Matt. 5:23) and so on. This offering of the gift at the altar is based wholly on the background of Judaism. If you want to understand the original meaning of this word, you cannot neglect the background of the time. The Jews offered their gift at the altar then for the purpose of drawing nigh to God and fellowshipping with Him. If you grasp hold of this principle, you will realize that the Lord&rsquo;s words refer to a man offering something before God and fellowshipping with God. Therefore, we cannot neglect the background. Rather, we should understand the background.</p>
<p>On the other hand, we should not be confined to the background. We cannot teach people to go to the altar to offer gifts now just because the Lord Jesus has spoken such a word. If you are confined by this background, you will have a big problem. Hence, we must see that we cannot neglect the background; if we do, we will not understand the exact meaning of the Bible. On the other hand, we must be careful not to be confined to the background lest we fall into error.]</p>
<h2 class="head1">VIII. PAYING ATTENTION TO THE DIFFERENCES<br />
IN THE DISPENSATIONS</h2>
<p>[God&rsquo;s words to man are divided into dispensations. Some words were spoken by God to man in the dispensation of the law. Some words were spoken by God to man in the dispensation of grace. When we try to understand these words, we must differentiate between the different dispensations. We should not apply the words spoken in the dispensation of the law to the dispensation of grace. This is the mistake of the Seventh-Day Adventists in keeping the Sabbath. Keeping the Sabbath is a commandment that God gave to man in the dispensation of the law. When one comes to the age of grace, it is a different matter altogether. But the Seventh-Day Adventists hold on to Exodus 20 and say that since God clearly spoke about the Sabbath, we should therefore keep the Sabbath today. It is true that God spoke of keeping the Sabbath, but this is a matter in the dispensation of the law and not in the dispensation of grace.</p>
<p>There is another example. In Psalms it says that our children in the flesh are God&rsquo;s blessings. Please remember that this is a word in the Old Testament. In the New Testament, this is no longer true. One cannot find anything in the New Testament that says that the children of the flesh are blessings. Although I cannot say that the children of the flesh are now curses, I dare to assure you that the children of the flesh are burdens and lessons. Today, in the dispensation of grace, the real blessing is the spiritual children.</p>
<p>In the same principle, God promised His chosen people in the Old Testament that they would prosper and enlarge their territory on the earth. But it is exactly the opposite in the New Testament. If you stood on the podium today and quoted the Old Testament words, telling the brothers and sisters, &ldquo;Thank God, He has promised that if we fear Him, He will enlarge our territory and everyone will be a great landowner,&rdquo; this would be entirely wrong. There is such a promise in the Bible, but this promise is not under grace, but under the law. In the New Testament age, God said that we should forsake our land and sell it to give to the poor. This is exactly opposite to the Old Testament age.</p>
<p>Although all these are words of the Bible and are all inspired by God, we should not take the words of the old dispensation and apply them to the present dispensation. The Catholics and many Protestants err on this point. There are many things in Catholicism that come from Judaism in the Old Testament. Even the clothing worn by their priests and their rituals of worship are all a borrowing of the principle of the Old Testament. Surely those things are mentioned in the Bible, but they are not for our present dispensation. In expounding and interpreting the Bible, one cannot say, &ldquo;Is not this the word of the Bible? If it is, we should keep it.&rdquo; We cannot speak in this way. We have to differentiate the ages; that is, we have to know clearly to which dispensation a word belongs. If you are not in a certain dispensation, then the words for that dispensation have nothing to do with you.]</p><h2 class="head1">IX. TAKING CARE OF THE DIFFERENCE<br />
IN THE PERSONS BEING ADDRESSED</h2>
<p>[In expounding the Bible, one has to take care of the persons to whom a word is spoken. Some words are spoken to the Jews, and they are not related to the nations or to the church. Some words are spoken to the nations and have nothing to do with the Jews or with the church. Some words are spoken to the church and have nothing to do with the Jews or with the nations.</p>
<p>First Corinthians 10:32 says, &ldquo;Give no occasion of stumbling both to Jews and to Greeks [referring to nations] and to the church of God.&rdquo; In the Bible, there are at least these three kinds of people to whom God speaks His words: the Jews, the nations, and the church. In the Old Testament, the majority of the words were spoken to the Jews. In the New Testament, there are many words that are spoken to the church. At the same time, whether in the New Testament or the Old, there are some words spoken to the nations. We should differentiate between these when we read them and should find out to whom the words are spoken. We should differentiate clearly between the different persons to whom a word is addressed, whether it is to the Jews, to the nations, or to the church. First we identify the persons spoken to, then we can make the proper judgment.</p>
<p>For example, some Bible scholars have had strong disputes concerning whom the book of Matthew was addressed to. There are many expositors who assert that Matthew was for the Jews and not for the church. They point out the Jewish background of the words in Matthew, saying that the Lord Jesus was clearly referring to offering gifts at the altar. To them this is a proof that these words are for the Jews. The Lord Jesus clearly spoke about the judgment of the Sanhedrin. The Sanhedrin was an organization of the Jews. They also point out Matthew 24 which mentions the abomination of desolation standing in the holy place. To them the holy place clearly belongs to the Jews. The Lord also said that when one encounters the great tribulation, he should pray that his flight may not be on a Sabbath. Would the church still keep the Sabbath? Since these people who receive the word keep the Sabbath, are they not Jews? These scholars point out many examples like these to prove that the book of Matthew is spoken to the Jews. If it were so, this would be very serious, because the whole book of Matthew would no longer be our inheritance.</p>
<p>After we read through the book of Matthew carefully, we have to admit that the words in Matthew 5 certainly have their Jewish background, but they are not spoken to the Jews; rather, they are spoken to the people of the kingdom of the heavens. The kingdom people not only include the saved ones among the Jews, but they also include the converted ones from among the nations. The kingdom people are the church. Because among the kingdom people there were some who had formerly been in Judaism, and who had a Jewish background, the Lord Jesus had to use things related to that background when He gave the sermon on the mount at that time. There are more discussions in chapters twenty-four and twenty-five of Matthew. If you read carefully, you will find that a portion was spoken to the Jews, a portion was spoken to the church, and a portion was spoken to the nations. In chapter twenty-four, verses 1 through 31 are spoken to the Jews. Verse 32 to chapter twenty-five verse 30 is spoken to the church. Verse 31 to the end of the chapter is spoken to the nations. In studying the Bible, before we make a decision on an interpretation, we must first ascertain the person to whom a word is spoken. Only then can we understand and interpret the words accurately.]</p>
<h2 class="head1">X. PERSONS, EVENTS, AND OBJECTS<br />
IN THE OLD TESTAMENT<br />
NOT CLEARLY REFERRED TO AS TYPES<br />
NOT TO BE TREATED AS TYPES<br />
BUT AS ILLUSTRATIONS</h2>
<p>[We know that there are many types in the Old Testament. Some types are simply individual persons, such as Isaac, who typified the Lord Jesus as the inheriting son, and Rebecca, who typified the bride gained by Christ&mdash;the church. Some types are events, such as the Passover of the Israelites which signifies our salvation before God when we received the slain Christ as our Savior. Another example is the children of Israel&rsquo;s exodus from Egypt, which signifies our going out from the world. There are also some types that are objects, such as the lamb typifying Christ and the brass serpent also typifying Christ.</p>
<p>In the Old Testament, many persons, events, and objects are types, but it is not up to us to decide whether or not they are types. We have to find out the clear evidence from the New Testament. If there is no mention in the New Testament of the object, the events, or the person as a type, then we should not rashly surmise that they are a type. At the most, we can only borrow these persons, events, and objects as illustrations and use them to explain the truths in the New Testament. To say that something is a type means more than to say that it is merely an illustration.]</p>
<h2 class="head1">CONCLUSION</h2>
<p>[Here we are only presenting and pointing out briefly these ten principles of interpretation of the Bible. These principles have evolved gradually from hundreds or thousands of years of experience of Bible study. They are like the cream of the milk and the honey of the bees, and are very precious. I hope we can all remember them clearly. These all are our aids and restrictions. I hope that from now on all the brothers and sisters will apply these principles in their study of the Bible. If we apply them, we will find new meaning to the Bible and will have a better, more accurate, and thorough understanding.]</p>

<h2 class="head2">Text</h2>
<p>After nineteen lessons of seeing how the Bible was written and learning some of the crucial truths in the Bible, we should be very attracted to the Word of God. There should be an appreciation welling up from our spirit causing us to desire to devour the Word of God until our being is fully constituted with His word. In the remaining lessons, we want to fellowship with you about our attitude toward the Bible and how we may be constituted with the Word of God.</p>
<h2 class="head1">I. THE NEED TO BELIEVE THE BIBLE</h2>
<p>First, we need to believe the Bible. At times we may read the Bible and not fully agree with it, or we may think that what it says is impossible. Other times we may not like what we read. We need to accept, agree, and believe the Word of God by faith.</p>
<h2 class="head2">A. Accepting the Word of God</h2>
<p>The Word of God is trustworthy. Not one word can be changed or annulled until it is fulfilled. Human words are not trustworthy because they are not eternal. Human feelings likewise fluctuate. We cannot depend on our words or our feelings. But what the Lord has spoken will be accomplished (Num. 23:19). For example, He said in Mark 16:16, &ldquo;He who believes and is baptized shall be saved.&rdquo; Anyone who believes the Lord Jesus and is baptized shall be saved. There is no reason to question if the person looks saved or feels that he is saved. He is saved because the Bible says so. We must accept the Word of God the way it is written.</p><h2 class="head2">B. Agreeing with the Word of God</h2>
<p>We should agree with the Word of God. When God says something, it is right; it is established. If we do not presently agree with the Word of God, we will in eternity. For example, Paul said in Ephesians 6:1, &ldquo;Children, obey your parents in the Lord, for this is right.&rdquo; You may not think that it is always right to agree with your parents. But the Bible says that it is right; therefore, it is right. The sooner you agree with the Word of God, the sooner you will receive the blessing from the Lord. After you agree with His word, you call on the Lord to receive the bountiful supply from the Spirit (Phil. 1:19); then you will be able to obey your parents in the Lord. But if you disagree, you will never receive the supply to overcome your flesh so that you may obey your parents. When you say &ldquo;Amen&rdquo; to the word of God, all the promises of God will become real to you (2 Cor. 1:20).</p>
<h2 class="head2">C. Believing the Word of God</h2>
<p>We must believe the Word of God. Whatever the Lord spoke in the Bible is for us to enjoy and experience. There may be times when we think that what we read in the Bible is impossible. When this happens, the word spoken is not effective in our Christian life. We become weak and beggarly. The children of Israel were told to go in to possess the good land, but they did not believe the word of God. Therefore, they did not go in, but died in the wilderness. There were two men, Joshua and Caleb, who believed the word of God and went in even though there were giants in the good land. Because of their faith, the giants became food for them. Without faith, the people regarded themselves as grasshoppers before the giants. Not believing in the word of God is due to an evil heart of unbelief (Heb. 3:12). Joshua and Caleb had an extraordinary spirit to believe the word of God (Num. 14:24). We should learn from them. Whenever we read the Bible, we must believe everything we read. If we lack understanding, we must pray and fellowship until we are clear. Never doubt the Word of God.</p>
<h2 class="head2">D. Having Faith by Hearing the Word of God</h2>
<p>Where do we receive faith to believe the Word of God? Romans 10:17 says, &ldquo;So faith comes out of hearing, and hearing through the word of Christ.&rdquo; Galatians 3:2 and 5 tell us that we receive the Spirit and the Lord supplies to us the Spirit by the hearing of faith. We were born without faith. We cannot conjure up faith to believe. However, when we hear the word of God, faith is infused into our spirit. It creates an appreciation for what is spoken. When we pray to the Lord according to what is spoken to us, we receive the reality conveyed by the word. For example, when we read Romans 10:12, &ldquo;The same Lord of all is rich to all who call upon Him,&rdquo; we appreciate this verse. Then we need to pray, &ldquo;O Lord, I call upon You. O Lord Jesus! You said that You will be rich to me if I call. O Lord Jesus, I call upon You now and I believe that You are rich to me. Lord, as I am calling, You are supplying me richly. Thank You, Lord!&rdquo; If we accept the Lord&rsquo;s word by agreeing with it, believing it, acting on it, and praying according to it, whatever the Bible says becomes not only a promise to us but also an accomplished fact as a bequest to us. Hallelujah!</p>
<h2 class="head1">II. THE NEED TO KNOW<br />
THE TRUTH IN THE BIBLE</h2>
<p>We also need to know the truth in the Bible. If we do not know the truth, we will not have the opportunity to accept, agree, believe, act, and pray. Therefore, it is imperative for us to know the truth in the Word.</p>
<h2 class="head2">A. Knowing the Interpreted Truth</h2>
<p>Believers throughout the last twenty centuries have been interpreting the Bible. The church fathers, during the first centuries, began to interpret the Bible. Subsequently, the Bible was locked up for approximately one thousand years. These one thousand years were called the dark ages. Following the dark ages, the reformers resumed the interpretation of the Bible. The Brethren continued, and many among us in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery have stood on the shoulders of the foregoing saints until now. The interpretation began with the Trinity and Christology and has continued until the recent revelation of the New Jerusalem. The top and proper interpretation is printed in the Recovery Version, the Life-study Messages, the lesson books, and the other books currently available in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery. We should not let the interpreted truths sit on our bookshelves. Instead, we should study them until we are constituted with the truth.</p>
<h2 class="head2">B. Knowing the Truth for Ourselves</h2>
<p>We need to know the truth to be set free. The Lord said, &ldquo;And you shall know the reality (truth), and the reality shall set you free&rdquo; (John 8:32). At times, we may be bound by things of sin and the world, or we may be under unnecessary condemnation. This is due to the lack of the truth. The truth sets us free from the bondages of sin and the world. The Lord prayed, &ldquo;Sanctify them in the truth; Your word is truth&rdquo; (John 17:17). The truth not only frees us, it also sanctifies us. Sanctification brings the holy nature of God into us, resulting in the transformation of our mind. The mind is the battleground between God and Satan, and between the mingled spirit and the flesh. Thus, knowing the truth sets us free from the attacks of Satan and makes it easy for us to turn to the spirit, to live in the spirit, and to follow the sense of life.</p>
<h2 class="head2">C. Knowing the Truth for the Church</h2>
<p>The church of the living God is the pillar and base of the truth (1 Tim. 3:15). [The pillar supports the building, and the base holds the pillar. The church is such a supporting pillar and holding base of the truth.] The church must be built with the truth and constituted with the truth; then she can be the pillar and base of the truth. If the church is full of worldly activities, she cannot display the truth. Ephesians 4:15 tells us that we need to hold to truth in love in order to grow up into Christ the Head in all things. By the functioning of every truth-holding member, the Body is built up in love (v. 16). Truth is essential to the Body of Christ. Therefore, we all should endeavor to know the truth, not only for our own sake, but also for the sake of the church.</p>
<h2 class="head2">D. Knowing the Truth for the Gospel</h2>
<p>Ephesians 1:13 says, &ldquo;In whom you also, hearing the word of the truth, the gospel of your salvation, in whom also believing, you were sealed with the Holy Spirit of the promise.&rdquo; The word of the truth is the gospel of salvation. A person who is full of truth has much to preach. A person who is not full of truth would not know what to say to help people to believe. People are regenerated by the living and abiding word of God (1 Pet. 1:23). They grow by the milk of the word (1 Pet. 2:2). The truth of the word is crucial in preaching to unbelievers and in begetting and nourishing new believers.</p>
<p>We must be people full of the truth for ourselves, for the building up of the church, and for the gospel.</p><h2 class="head1">III. THE NEED TO APPLY<br />
THE TRUTH OF THE BIBLE</h2>
<p>Merely studying and knowing the truth is not enough; we need to apply the truth in our daily Christian life and in the church life. The truth is not only in the Bible; it has been interpreted and published for our benefit. We need to study the interpreted truth to receive it into us. Then we need to experience the truth so that it becomes our reality. God &ldquo;desires all men to be saved and come to the full knowledge of the truth&rdquo; (1 Tim. 2:3-4). Getting saved is not enough; we need the full knowledge of the truth, the complete realization of the divine realities embodied in the Word. This full knowledge comes from knowing and experiencing the truth.</p>
<h2 class="head2">A. Applying the Truth in Our Daily Christian Life</h2>
<p>First, we need to apply the truth in our daily Christian life. We must believe that everything spoken of by the Lord is for our experience. If we have this view, we will experience the Lord according to His word in all our daily situations. For example, when we read in Matthew 5:48, &ldquo;You, therefore, shall be perfect as your heavenly Father is perfect,&rdquo; we believe it and we can experience it. We are the Father&rsquo;s children having the Father&rsquo;s divine life and divine nature (1 John 5:12a; 2 Pet. 1:4). As the Father is perfect, we also can be perfect. When we notice that we are not perfect like the Father, we can repent and be forgiven. Then we can call on the Lord and pray-read His word to be strengthened by His divine life in the Spirit. Such strengthening enables us to express Him in His perfect living. Thus, we can fulfill the word in Matthew 5:48.</p>
<p>Many times our experience does not match the Word. We should never say, &ldquo;It is all right.&rdquo; Nor should we say, &ldquo;It is not possible.&rdquo; We should simply repent and confess our shortcomings, then call on the Lord and pray-read His word. The Lord will save us and allow us to experience Him according to the truth of the Word.</p>
<h2 class="head2">B. Applying the Truth in the Church Life</h2>
<p>Second, we need to apply the truth in the church life. Many Christians have gathered themselves in denominations and do not practice according to the truth. They do not believe that the things spoken of in the Bible are for our practice today. They may excuse themselves and say that it is not possible to practice what is in the Bible or that what is in the Bible is for the future. Some others may say, &ldquo;We have been practicing this way for hundreds of years; why should we change now?&rdquo;</p>
 <p>We must not be loose with the Word of God. Whatever the Lord says, we must do. We must practice according to the truth that is revealed in the Bible. For example, 1 Corinthians 14:26 says that we all should have something to say when we come to the meetings so that we may build up the church. Some may say that it is hard to speak, preferring to hire a pastor to speak for them. We cannot hold on to this attitude. We must hold on to the truth and practice accordingly. Therefore, we need to call on the Lord, pray, and pray-read every morning so that we may be revived and enlightened by the Lord. As we practice overcoming in all our situations during the day by continuing to pray over the word which we enjoyed in the morning, our enjoyment and experience of the Lord in His word will increase. At the end of each week, we should consider what we have seen and experienced in the Word and prepare something to share in the Lord&rsquo;s Day meeting. This will provide the Lord a way to build up His church according to His prophecy in Matthew 16:18.</p>
<h2 class="head1">CONCLUSION</h2>
<p>We have the interpreted truth in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery. We must use our time and energy wisely to study the truth for ourselves, for preaching to the unbelievers, and for the church. The more our experience is according to the truth, the more we will have the full assurance to speak to others, to beget children for God, and to build up the church.</p>

<h2 class="head2">Text</h2>
<p>Since the Bible is the word of God, its nature is divine and spiritual. We must read it with every part of our being. There is milk for our soul in the Word. It is for nourishing our inner man through the understanding of our rational mind, and it is assimilated by our mental faculties (1 Pet. 2:2 footnote 5). The milk of the word eventually nourishes our spirit, making us spiritual (1 Pet. 2:5 footnote 3). [Therefore, in reading the Bible, after we have understood the meaning of the text by our understanding and have apprehended the truth of the text with our wisdom, we should use our spirit by prayer to receive the truths in the Scripture into the deepest part of our being, that is, our spirit. In other words, after we understand the text and receive the truth therein, we still must exercise our spirit to turn what we have understood and realized into prayer that it may be assimilated in our spirit, becoming our life supply and the basis of our spiritual experience.]</p>
<h2 class="head1">I. READING THE WORD OF GOD</h2>
<p>We need to read the Bible sequentially from cover to cover. By reading the Bible in this way, we can better understand it (Col. 3:16; 2 Tim. 3:15; Psa. 119:11, 130). The foregoing lessons have given you a guided tour of the Bible. This overview of the Bible and of its sixty-six books has given you a bird&rsquo;s-eye view. The more you read the Bible and compare your reading to these lessons, the more you will understand. Some of you may like to read the Old Testament at one rate and the New Testament at another. For example, if you read a chapter a day, you can finish reading the New Testament in nine months. Brother Watchman Nee read the New Testament through fifty times in one year. That became his foundation in the Bible. Most of us may not be able to read the New Testament as frequently as he did, but we can at least read through it once a year. We all need to decide on how much to read every day, schedule the time to read, and develop a habit to read.</p><h2 class="head1">II. PRAY-READING THE WORD OF GOD</h2>
<p>[Another simple, spiritual, and most beneficial way to read the Bible is pray-reading. We take the Bible text as prayer and pray-read with it. Not only do we read and pray simultaneously, or pray and read, read and pray; but also we directly turn the text we are reading into the very words of prayer to pray with. At times we may apply the text to ourselves through prayer. The more we repeat this kind of pray-reading, the more uplifted and released our spirit becomes and the greater, deeper, and richer the benefit is which we receive.]</p>
<p>The apostle Paul told us to receive &ldquo;the sword of the Spirit, which is the word of God, by means of all prayer and petition, praying at every time in spirit&rdquo; (Eph. 6:17-18). When we pray-read this way, we get nourished with the Spirit and we maintain the fellowship with the Lord (1 Pet. 2:2; 1 Tim. 4:6; 1 John 1:3). As we pray, the Lord may expose our shortcomings through His word; then, when we confess, He will forgive and cleanse us (1 John 1:9). We may also use the Word to pray for others and for the Lord&rsquo;s move (1 Tim. 2:1; Col. 4:3-4). Pray-reading is very useful.</p>
<h2 class="head1">III. STUDYING THE WORD OF GOD</h2>
<p>By reading the Bible sequentially, we obtain the breadth of the Word. By pray-reading the Bible, we are able to enjoy the Lord in His word. However, we need to study the Bible to grasp the depth of the truth in His word (1 Tim. 5:17b; 2 Tim. 2:15).</p>
<h2 class="head2">A. Knowing the Facts of the Bible</h2>
<p>Before we fellowship on studying the truth, there are some preliminary points we need to address. We need to know the basic facts of the Bible. We should remember all the names of the books and their sequence so we can locate specific verses. We should know the fundamentals of each book, such as the points in lessons eleven through twenty-one. It is also helpful to memorize the first verse of every book so that we know how every book begins. In addition, it is good to familiarize ourselves with the key people and the key events which take place in each book so that we know the background as we are studying the truth. These basic facts should have been acquired before we entered junior high school. If we have not yet learned them, then we must do some remedial study.</p>
<h2 class="head2">B. Helpful Materials</h2>
<p>First, we need a good translation of the Bible, such as the Recovery Version of the New Testament. The outlines guide our study. The footnotes open up the Word to us. The cross references direct us to other verses similar to the verses that we are studying.</p>
<p>Second, the Life-study Messages open the Word further to us. They explain the verses in the New Testament. The Life-study Messages are likened to footnotes on the footnotes in the Recovery Version. If we do not understand the footnotes in the Recovery Version, then we should refer to the corresponding sections in the Life-study Messages. Better yet, we should study the Bible sequentially with the aid of the Life-study Messages. (There are also Life-study Messages for some of the Old Testament books, such as the Pentateuch.)</p>
<p>Third, there are lesson books which teach us the truth step by step in a progressive way. There are the <em>Life Lessons</em> consisting of forty-eight lessons. The <em>Life Lessons</em> instruct new believers in the basics of the Christian life. The <em>Truth Lessons</em> are six volumes containing twelve lessons each. The <em>Truth Lessons</em> teach us various truths concerning the Bible. The six levels of lessons designed for the summer school of the truth teach us the basic truths of the Lord&rsquo;s recovery in an abbreviated format.</p>
<p>Fourth, other books of truth written by Brother Watchman Nee and Brother Witness Lee teach us the truth by topics. Books such as <em>The All-Inclusive Christ</em> and <em>The Economy of God</em> are very helpful. In the Lord&rsquo;s recovery, we have an abundance of good books that reveal the truth to us.</p>
<p>Fifth, one of the most commonly used study aids is a concordance. A concordance such as Strong&rsquo;s Exhaustive Concordance of the Bible is very helpful in finding verses. A concordance is arranged like a dictionary; it lists all the verses in the Bible that contain a certain word. For example, we may want to find some verses that explain the meaning of &ldquo;truth.&rdquo; We would then look up the word &ldquo;truth.&rdquo; We would find that there are 114 verses in the Old Testament and 108 verses in the New Testament listed under &ldquo;truth.&rdquo; By reading through these verses, we would be able to locate the ones that address our question.</p><h2 class="head2">C. An Example&mdash;a Way to Use<br />
a Life-study Message to Study the Bible</h2>
<p>Let us suggest a way to use a Life-study Message to study the Bible.</p>
<p>First, pray to open to the Lord. This is crucial because you need to use your spirit to study the Bible. You do not need to pray for a long time.</p>
<p>Second, read the title and the subtitles of the message to get an overview of the content.</p>
<p>Third, read and pray-read the verses, being careful to manage your time wisely. If there are too many verses to cover in the allotted time, just pray-read the key portions of the key verses.</p>
<p>Fourth, try to identify the main point covered in each verse as outlined in the title and subtitles. The title and the subtitles are there to guide you in studying the verses; therefore, you must know how they relate.</p>
<p>Fifth, read the text of the message section by section and underline the crucial points related to the title or corresponding subtitle.</p>
<p>Sixth, pray with the crucial points as you are reading. Go to the Lord with these points in confession and in fellowship that He may fill you with His Spirit to renew your mind.</p>
<p>Seventh, write one or two sentences to summarize each section. This will keep your mind focused on your reading.</p>
<p>Eighth, at the end of the message, write a conclusion summarizing what it has revealed to you in the verses.</p>
<p>Ninth, pray with the content of the message. This will help you assimilate the main points.</p>
<p>Tenth, speak to others about what you have seen. You may use your conclusion as a prophecy in the Lord&rsquo;s Day meeting.</p>
<p>You can modify this example to best suit your needs. Whichever method you use, you need to exercise your whole being to study the Word of God.</p>
<h2 class="head2">D. Having Study Companions</h2>
<p>It may be more enjoyable to study with several companions. Pray with your companions and encourage one another to pursue the truth (2 Tim. 2:22). Your companions will help you persevere.</p>
<h2 class="head2">E. Being Definite</h2>
<p>It is necessary to be definite. Everything in your human life is definite. The sun rises and sets at definite times. School starts and ends at definite times on definite days. Airline departures and arrivals adhere to clearly defined schedules. Therefore, you need to be definite in studying the Bible (Eph. 5:16). Set up a definite time and day for studying the truth. Determine what materials you will use and your rate of progress. It is not only prudent to have study companions, but it is also good to tell your elders and serving ones of your plan of study, so that they may guide you. If you receive any enlightenment, be sure to share it with them. If you have any questions or difficulties while studying, be sure to fellowship with the elders and serving ones. This will help keep you on course.</p>
<p>If you are definite in your pursuit of the truth, you will be constituted with the truth gradually.</p>
<h2 class="head1">IV. MEMORIZING THE WORD OF GOD</h2>
<p>It is very beneficial to memorize some of the key verses in the Bible. There are approximately 1,200 chapters in the Bible. If you can memorize one key verse from every chapter, you will have a rich reserve to draw upon when you speak (1 Tim. 6:20). Your mind will be constituted and saturated with His word (Deut. 11:18; Rom. 12:2; Col. 3:16). A psalmist prayed in Psalm 119:11, &ldquo;Thy word have I laid up in my heart, that I might not sin against thee.&rdquo;</p><h2 class="head1">V. SPEAKING THE WORD OF GOD</h2>
<p>After getting filled with the word of God, we must speak the word to others. [We must see a principle, a fundamental, a law: you must speak if you want to be healthy. You will be the most healthy person if you speak unceasingly each day. But you must speak the word of the Lord. When you speak the Lord&rsquo;s word, you have joy. People may oppose you, but everyone has a conscience within him; there is an element of fairness in the human heart. A brother who once worked in the telegraph company spoke Jesus whenever he met his colleagues; that is, he spoke for God. Then the others looked down at him, saying in a derogatory way that he was Jesus. But when they had difficulties or when they needed someone to take care of certain important documents for them, they all came to him. Whenever these colleagues faced difficulties, the gospel they had heard operated in them.]</p>
<h2 class="head2">A. Speaking the Word in Our Daily Life</h2>
<p>[Dear saints, now we are in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery and I do believe that now is the time for the Lord to carry out His up-to-date move. All of us in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery have to speak Christ in our daily life to our parents, our children, our cousins, and our in-laws. We all owe so much to our relatives. Try to write a list of all the names of your relatives. Among these names maybe twenty percent are saved, and the rest are remaining in unbelief. They need your speaking. All of your relatives need the real help rendered by your speaking of Christ. Do not preach in a religious way, but speak Christ to your relatives in a living way. Speak to your father. Speak to your mother. Speak to your aunt. Speak to your uncle. Speak to your brother. Even if both you and your brother are Christians, you still need to speak one to another. Let your parents hear your speaking. Do not talk about computers, physics, or mathematics, but only Christ. He is the unique treasure! Speak about Jesus, Christ, the life-giving Spirit, the all-inclusive, processed Triune God. Your parents would marvel at such a speaking.</p>
<p>Continue to speak Christ every day. All human beings today need Christ, yet we need to speak to them. Speak in a living way, in a practical way, according to your experience of Him.] Speak in your school, in between classes, in your study groups, during your lunch break, and after school at least five minutes every day, five days a week, four weeks a month. In this way, you can speak Christ to others at least twenty times a month (Isa. 59:21).</p>
<h2 class="head2">B. Preaching the Word in Season and Out of Season</h2>
<p>In 2 Timothy 4:2, Paul charged Timothy to &ldquo;preach the word; be ready in season and out of season.&rdquo; The word of God that we have learned makes us complete and equipped for every good work (2 Tim. 3:15-17). This is the word that we preach. If we do not know the Bible, what word can we preach? [We must preach the word that we have learned from the Word of God. This is what the early believers did in Acts 5:42 when they met from house to house &ldquo;teaching and bringing the good news of Jesus as the Christ.&rdquo; In the home meetings they taught and preached what they had learned concerning Christ.</p>
<p>Paul charged Timothy to be ready &ldquo;in season and out of season,&rdquo; to preach the word. Many times we say that now is not the time to speak; that it is out of season. That is the right time for us to speak. We all must speak out of season. I surely treasure all the young saints and desire to rescue them from the pastoral system. The young ones who are still in school have the most people around them. Every school is a big fishing pond full of fish. This is an environment arranged by God for speaking to others. Students always enjoy listening to their classmates much more than to their teachers or parents. We have to learn to catch these fish by speaking Christ to them. We have to be made the fishers of men, bringing people to Christ and to the home meetings. For this, I do not trust in any human arrangement, but in the young saints&rsquo; acting, behaving, working, endeavoring, and struggling to contact their fellow students. If we would do this, within a short time many would be baptized and added to the churches.]</p>
<h2 class="head2">C. Prophesying in the Meetings<br />
to Build Up the Church</h2>
<p>Another place to speak is in the meetings of the church. The apostle Paul said in 1 Corinthians 14:1, &ldquo;Desire earnestly spiritual gifts, but rather that you may prophesy.&rdquo; In verses 3 and 4, he said, &ldquo;He who prophesies speaks to men for building up and encouragement and consolation...he who prophesies builds up the church.&rdquo; We need to see that the most important part of our meeting is the prophesying, which is to speak for the Lord, to speak Him forth, and to speak the Lord into people. Through the speaking of the Lord&rsquo;s word, the riches of Christ are released and are dispensed into all the attendants. To prophesy is to speak for the Lord and to speak forth the Lord. It is to supply Christ to others. This is the main work in the church meetings. After having been constituted with the truth in the Word and filled up with the Spirit, we should prophesy in the church meetings to build up the church. The Lord&rsquo;s goal is the built up church. Our studying is not only for ourselves but for preaching the gospel to produce members for the Body of Christ and to build up the church. We need to have such a view and practice it.</p><h2 class="head2">D. Speaking by the Spirit of Faith with Boldness</h2>
<p>The apostle Paul said that we can be filled in spirit by speaking (Eph. 5:18-19) and by praying (Acts 4:31). On the one hand, we get filled to speak. On the other hand, we get filled by speaking. The more we are filled with the word of God, the more we like to speak and the more we have to speak. The more we speak, the more we are filled in spirit. The more we pray according to the Word, the more we get filled with the Spirit. The apostle Paul also said that we need to speak by the spirit of faith (2 Cor. 4:13). After our spirit is strengthened by prayer and we are enriched by the word of God, we will be full of faith. We must speak and we will speak the word of God with boldness (Eph. 6:19).</p>
<p>[I hope you can see that for everyone to speak the word of God, you need to pray, to be filled in the spirit, and at the same time to learn to speak the proper words. When you speak, you need to be filled with the riches of the words of the Bible and the experiences of life. You need to know the person you are speaking to. You need to approach people, help people, and know people, and to deal with each kind of person with a certain kind of word. In this way, you will never miss the mark, and you will be certain to be successful.] If this is the case, the church surely will be propagating, and the number surely will increase.</p>
<h2 class="head1">VI. SINGING THE WORD OF GOD</h2>
<p>There are times when we enjoy the word of God so much that we spontaneously sing it out loud. You can sing verses to a familiar tune or make up your own tune. This type of spontaneous song does not need to have a proper tune nor does it have to rhyme. It is a spiritual song you make up to sing to the Lord (Eph. 5:19). Another good way to be filled with the Spirit is to sing or speak the rich hymns in our hymnal which are composed with the Word, especially the ones marked with an asterisk or dagger. Praise the Lord we have so many ways to enjoy the word of God!</p>
<h2 class="head1">VII. THE NEED TO PRACTICE</h2>
<p>Each morning, we need to pray-read two or three verses from the Bible to revive our spirit (Psa. 119:47; Jer. 15:16). Many saints like to use<em> The</em>
 <em>Holy Word for Morning Revival</em>. If you do this, you can pray-read through the New Testament verse by verse in about six years. You should write the verses you pray-read in the morning on a card and carry it with you. Whenever you feel depressed, think evil thoughts, or are tempted to do something not of the Lord, pull out your card and pray-read. You will overcome Satan, and he will have to retreat from you (Rev. 12:11; 2 Cor. 10:4-5; Eph. 6:16; James 4:7). Each night, before you go to bed, read one or two chapters of the New Testament. This practice will enable you to begin your day by being revived with the word of God, to overcome the evil one throughout the day with the word of God, and to end the day with the word of God. Your whole life will be enveloped with the word of God. Your speaking will be the word of God. How wonderful your living will be.</p>
<p>You should set up regular times to study the truth with the help of the outlines, footnotes, cross-references, Life-study Messages, lesson books, and other recovery books.</p>
<p>Learn to speak the Word all the time. This practice will fill and constitute you with the word of God. Wherever you go, the Lord can flow out of you through your speaking. Your friends and relatives will be saved to become sons of God and members of the Body of Christ.</p>
