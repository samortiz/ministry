   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER FORTY-TWO THE QUALITY OF THE SPIRIT 2 Date:March 9, 1950</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Place:Jordan Road, Hong Kong</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Scripture Reading:Luke 9:51-56 Motive and Spirit</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Watchman Nee: Today we will pick up from where we left off yesterday.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The second question Brother Lee asked yesterday was how one can tell the difference between his motive and his spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Many Bible translators use the word heart instead of spirit in Luke 9:55.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Some may think that the spirit here refers to a man's attitude.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>They think that to be right in spirit is actually to be right in attitude.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>But there is a big difference between spirit and attitude.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Attitude issues from motives in the heart.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>What then is the difference between one's spirit and his motive?</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Before a man is saved, he can have motives in his heart, but he does not have a spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>A believer has motives, and he also has a spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>It is easy for a saved person's spirit to be affected by the motives in his heart.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>We have said that man's spirit is neutral.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>A young man has to pass through thirty years of his Christian life before he realizes that his spirit is neutral.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The longer you are a Christian, the more you will realize that your spirit is neutral; it has no characteristic of its own.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>It draws its characteristics from your very person.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The spirit is neutral; it is like pure water.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>When you add different things to water, it assumes the characteristics of the added elements.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Suppose you add soy sauce to water; the water will assume the characteristics of soy sauce.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The same can be said about the human spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Different persons have different characteristics in their spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The spirit that God has given us is the same.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>However, our spirit becomes impure when it is released because we have impure motives in our heart.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>If our motive is for ourselves or for our own future and business, this motive will taint our spirit, and our spirit will carry the characteristic of this motive.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The Lord said to the disciples that their spirit was wrong; their spirit was different from His.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The Lord does not want anyone to die from his sins.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The Son of Man came not to destroy, but to save.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The world is a strange place.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>No one in this world has the kind of feeling the Lord has for human life.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Everyone in this world is selfish in his motive.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Suppose you cannot rank first in school.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>When the one who ranks first in school goes into the hospital to have an operation, you want to see him die.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Should this man die just because he is more intelligent than you are?</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Such things are commonplace in politics.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>If a man cannot climb to a high position, he would rather see his political opponents die.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>When business competition becomes fierce, some also wish that their competitors' managers would die.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The disciples were wrong in their spirit because their motive was one of hatred.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The Lord would not allow them to pray the way they wished.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The Lord's spirit does not think that anyone deserves to die.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>This is the reason He said that He came to save, not to destroy.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>This is the Lord's heart.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>This is His spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The disciples were wrong in their heart.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>This is the reason they were wrong in their spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The unbelievers only have a heart; they do not have a spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Their heart is hidden within them; it cannot show.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>But a saved person's spirit can flow out, and his heart can flow out with his spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>You can guess the motive of an unbeliever from his speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>But with a Christian, it is not a matter of guessing.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Something definite comes out of his being, and all who are experienced can identify it.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>The heart is hidden within an unsaved person, but a Christian's heart flows out with his spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>When a Christian's spirit is released, another Christian touches something if he is exercising his spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>A man can deceive others with his words, but his spirit cannot hide from an experienced person.</S>
