   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Message Eight Taking Christ as Our Goal 2 Knowing Christ, the Power of His Resurrection,</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>and the Fellowship of His Sufferings Scripture Reading: Phil 3:10 Paul aspired to know Christ Phil 3:10: To have the excellency of the knowledge of Christ in Philippians 3:8 is by revelation, but to know Him in verse 10 is by experience.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Paul first received the revelation of Christ, then sought the experience of Christ to know and enjoy Christ in an experiential way.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The one thing in the book of Philippians is the subjective knowledge and experience of Christ 2:2; cf.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>1:20-21; 2:5; 3:7-9; 4:12-13.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>To know Christ is not merely to have the knowledge concerning Him but to gain His very person 2 Cor 2:10; cf.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Col 2:9, 16-17: To gain something requires the paying of a price; to gain Christ is to experience, enjoy, and take possession of all His unsearchable riches Eph 3:8 by paying a price.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Christ has gained us, taken possession of us, that we might gain Him, take possession of Him Phil 3:12.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The Christian life is a life of gaining Christ in His full ministry in His three divine and mystical stages incarnation, inclusion, and intensification John 1:14; 1 Cor 15:45b; Rev 1:4; 4:5; 5:6: Even though Paul had experienced and gained Christ tremendously, he did not consider that he had experienced Him in full or gained Him to the uttermost; for this reason he was still advancing toward the goal the gaining of Christ to the fullest extent Phil 3:12-14.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>In order to gain Christ to the fullest extent, Paul not only forsook his experiences in Judaism but also would not linger in his past experiences of Christ and be limited by them; he forgot the past v. 13.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Not to forget but to linger in our past experiences, however genuine they were, frustrates our further pursuing of Christ v. 13; Heb 6:1a.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Christ is unsearchably rich, and there is a vast territory of His riches to be possessed; Paul was stretching out to reach the farthest extent of this territory Phil 3:13.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Paul aspired to know the power of Christ s resurrection v. 10: The power of Christ s resurrection is His resurrection life, which raised Him from the dead Eph 1:19-20.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The Spirit is the reality of Christ s resurrection and its power Rom 8:9-11; 1 Cor 15:45b; 1 John 5:6.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The Spirit compounded with Christ s resurrection and its power Phil 1:19; Exo 30:23-25 indwells our spirit Rom 8:10-11 to dispense Christ s resurrection and its power not only to our spirit and soul vv.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>6b, 10 but also to our mortal body vv.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>11, 13b; 2 Cor 4:11 .</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>We should cooperate with the resurrecting Spirit to recognize that we have been resurrected with Christ Col 2:12; Eph 2:6a and to pursue the power of the resurrection of Christ: It is by this power of Christ s resurrection that we, the lovers of Christ, determine to take the cross by denying our self Matt 16:24; cf.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>S. S. 2:8-9.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>It is also by this power of resurrection that we, the lovers of Christ, are enabled to be conformed to His death, to be one with His cross Phil 3:10; cf.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>S. S. 2:14-15.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>In order to experience the life-giving Spirit as the reality of the flourishing riches of the resurrection of Christ, we have to discern our spirit from our soul Heb 4:12; cf.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>S. S. 2:14-15.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Christ s resurrection with its power in the life-giving Spirit is the sufficient grace of the processed and consummated Triune God 2 Cor 12:9; 13:14; 1 Cor 15:10, 45b, 58; cf.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Exo 3:2-6, 14-15.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Paul aspired to know the fellowship of Christ s sufferings Phil 3:10: With Christ, the sufferings and death came first, followed by the resurrection; with us, the power of His resurrection comes first, followed by the participation in His sufferings and conformity to His death.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>We first receive the power of His resurrection; then by this power we are enabled to participate in His sufferings and live a crucified life in conformity to His death.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Christ s sufferings are of two categories: those for accomplishing redemption, which were completed by Christ Himself, and those for producing and building the church, which need to be filled up by the apostles and the believers Col 1:24: We cannot participate in Christ s sufferings for redemption, but we must take part in the sufferings of Christ for the producing and building up of the Body cf.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Rev 1:9; 2 Tim 2:10; 2 Cor 1:5-6; 4:12; 6:8-11.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Christ as the Lamb of God suffered for redemption John 1:29 ; Christ as the grain of wheat suffered for reproducing and building 12:24 : The Lord, as a grain of wheat that fell into the ground, lost His soul-life through death that He might release His eternal life in resurrection to the many grains 10:10-11.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The one grain did not complete all the sufferings that are needed for the building up of the Body; as the many grains, we must suffer in the same way the one grain suffered 12:24-26: 1 As the many grains, we also must lose our soul-life through death that we may enjoy eternal life in resurrection v. 25.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>2 This is to follow Him that we may serve Him and walk with Him on this way, the way of losing our soul-life and living in His resurrection v. 26.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>3 The way for the church to come into being and to increase is not by human glory; it is by the death of the cross vv.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>20-24.</S>
