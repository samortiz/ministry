<h2 class=head2>The Enjoyment of Christ as Our Holiness</h2><p>By the cross and the working of the Holy Spirit, we enjoy Christ as our righteousness. In the outer court, we see that Christ is expressed as righteousness before God and man. But this is just the outward behavior, the outward conduct, with nothing related to the inward nature. Righteousness relates to conduct, to behavior, but holiness relates to nature. God’s divine nature is holiness. As far as your conduct, morality, and behavior are concerned, you may enjoy Christ as your righteousness, but this is just the outward aspect. You have to go deeper to enjoy Christ as your inward nature, your holiness. In other words, we have to go on to express Christ not only as righteousness in our behavior but also as holiness in our nature, in what we are.<p>Now we need to consider how we can go on to enjoy Christ in such a deeper way. After the people offered the offerings and the shed blood was sprinkled so that they could experience redemption, they began to eat. All the experiences of holiness begin with eating. The bread on the showbread table in the Holy Place was for eating (Lev. 24:5-9). We do not merely put on Christ as our righteousness, but we also eat Christ as our spiritual food so that He can become our very nature (John 6:57). When the prodigal son in Luke 15 returned to his father, the father clothed him with the best robe to justify and qualify him so that he could come into the living presence of the father to eat and enjoy the fattened calf. Our salvation is not a matter of just putting something on but also of taking something in, of eating something. First, we have to put on Christ as our righteousness. Then we have to take Christ into us as our holiness.<p>The first part of Romans shows that we have Christ as our righteousness to put on. The next part speaks of Christ as our holiness taken into us and working within us. We enjoy Christ as our holiness by eating Him as our spiritual food. By eating Christ, He will work in us to enlighten us all the time. Then we enjoy Him as the light of life, which is the reality of the lampstand in the Holy Place. This brings us into the enjoyment of Christ as the sweet incense ascending to God to have His acceptance at the incense altar (Exo. 30:1-4). We enjoy the sweet acceptance of God in Christ in an inward and subjective way. When we take Christ into us, He is mingled with us to be our holiness.<p>Real sanctification involves not just a positional change but a dispositional change. The process of sanctification changes us in nature, in form, and in essence as well as in place. This metabolic change is transformation (2 Cor. 3:18; Rom. 12:2). When the church is transformed, the church expresses Christ as holiness. Holiness as the content of the church is Christ Himself.<p>In the outer court, the most striking thing is the white linen hangings, signifying Christ as righteousness. In the Holy Place the significant element is gold. Gold signifies God’s holy nature, His holiness. The outer court shows that the church expresses Christ as our righteousness. The Holy Place shows that the church expresses Christ as our holiness. When you were outside the tabernacle, you saw righteousness. When you came inside, you saw holiness.<p>When we look at the church outwardly, we should see good, pure, and righteous people. But when we come into the church, we should see that these people are not only righteous but also holy. They should have not only outwardly good behavior but also something in their nature which is divine and holy. By the Lord’s grace, we should express Christ in such a way. This is what we have to attain. We have Christ as our righteousness without and our holiness within, and we need to express Him in such a way even to the principalities and powers in the heavenlies.
