No! God had to send Peter to the house of Cornelius. At Pentecost Peter exercised the keys and ushered many Jews into the kingdom. God also wanted him to open the door for Gentiles to enter into the kingdom of God. This fulfilled the Lord's word in Matthew 8:11, which says that there would be many people from the east and from the west, who would recline at table in the kingdom of the heavens. Before Peter exercised the keys to open the door for Gentiles to be saved, God prepared Paul. Dispensationally speaking, Peter's work ended at the house of Cornelius. After this, although Peter still bore many testimonies, his work was dispensationally over. Consider how wonderful this is! In Acts 10, Peter went to the house of Cornelius, but Paul repented in Acts 9.</P><P>Originally, Paul was a zealous persecutor of the Lord. But on his way to Damascus, the Lord shined a light around him and he received grace. However, his eyes were not yet opened. The Lord sent Ananias, telling him that Paul was the vessel He had chosen. This word expressed the Lord's heart. The kingdom of God was large, and Peter had brought in many people. However, there was still the need for a manager and designer. Therefore, the Lord raised up Paul and made him a vessel. Ananias put it very well when he said, "Saul, brother." This meant that every hatred was removed. Consequently, Paul was able to testify for the Lord and be useful for the work. Later, his work extended from inside the city to outside the city; the scope of his work expanded. How did he get down from the wall? He was let down by the disciples. Although he could have climbed down by himself, he did not. He was willing to have the disciples let him down. This was brotherly fellowship, help, and approval. Paul did not go out alone; he was backed up by others' participation. So many works can be more effectual if they are backed up by others' prayer and help. When Paul originally went to Jerusalem, the disciples were somewhat fearful. Later Paul was able to go in and out among them; there was full fellowship between them with no obstacles. In this way, he was able to continue Peter's work.</P><P>Now let us come back to Peter. When the Lord called him to the house of Cornelius, he did not want to go at first. Then the Lord gave him the vision of a great sheet descending from heaven. Inside there were animals, reptiles, and birds, but no fish. Why were there no fish? We see animals, reptiles, birds, and fish all the time. Why were only three things mentioned, the animals, the reptiles, and the birds, and the fish were omitted? According to the type in the story of Noah's ark, fish were never saved. The creatures saved through the ark did not include fish. This is why fish were not included in the things God gave to Peter.</P><P>What is the meaning of the great sheet with animals, reptiles, and birds? Let us consider this. The great sheet represents Peter's whole work. The extent of Peter's work was not like a vessel which can only contain a certain amount. It was not like a ship which has its limits. It was like a piece of cloth, a great sheet. What is cloth? Cloth does not have a fixed shape. It has not yet been formed into any shape; it is only a piece of fabric. Who came to make this fabric into something with a shape? Paul came. He specialized in the work of tidying up. We may liken Peter to a person who buys cloth and Paul to a tailor or dressmaker. We should be clear about this. Throughout his life, Peter's work was like a piece of cloth; it was not limited and it did not have any form or boundary.</P><P>Let us consider the three things in the great sheet. Birds are the most active animals. Sometimes they fly around, sometimes they rest upon branches or rooftops, and sometimes they take a few steps on the ground. They are the most free and not restricted at all. They are the wildest of all animals. What about animals? They are ferocious and vicious. What about reptiles? They refer to filthiness. In God's eyes, Gentiles are merely animals, reptiles, and birds. But now God has wrapped up the wild, vicious, and filthy ones in a great sheet. He has put us in a new environment. He no longer considers us as animals, reptiles, and birds. In the Bible there is only the gospel of the kingdom of the heavens; there is no such thing as the gospel of the church. We do not hear the gospel and then enter into the church. Rather, we hear the gospel and enter into God's kingdom, which is a new sphere and a new realm. Once you were under Satan's hand; now you are under God's hand. What does it mean to be saved? It means that God puts you in a new position. Today many people make the matter of the church too encompassing. They think that they have everything once they enter into the church, but they forget the matter of entering into the kingdom of God. Being saved does not mean entering into only the church; it also means entering into the kingdom of God to become His children, not by power, but by authority (John 1:12). Everyone can enter because it is not according to what a person does, but according to the authority that God has given to him. All of Peter's work was to bring something from the outside to the inside. In other words, Peter's work was to bring people into the kingdom of God. The meaning of entering into the kingdom of God is to be subject under God's sovereignty. Peter's specialty was to draw people and bring in group after group. When he drew one person in, another citizen was added to God's kingdom. However, he could do nothing to help those who were in the kingdom and needed direction. Paul picked up this responsibility. Paul's work was to help settle down those whom Peter drew in. Can you find the words "born again" in Paul's Epistles? No, he spoke about justification; he never spoke about being born again. What about Peter? He talked about regeneration. He also mentioned "inheritance." Paul only mentioned "inheritance" a little. John did not mention anything about it because his focus was on God's family. The simplest explanation of God's kingdom is that it is the sphere of God's rule.</P><P>Acts mentions many things concerning God's kingdom. Even Paul mentioned God's kingdom because at that time many people were saved and had entered into God's kingdom. It would be much better if we were clear about this on the day we were saved. The reason we are in such a degraded condition now is that we have made ourselves the center. The Lord only considers us as a helper. God truly wants to give us blessings. But more importantly, He wants us to enter His kingdom and be under His ruling. O brothers and sisters, salvation is not for our enjoyment; it is for God to deal with us according to His sovereign authority. Originally you lived a carefree and foolish life; now God wants you to be subject to Him. After a person is saved, he cannot live a loose life any longer. Instead, he must be restricted. Salvation is taking up the Holy Spirit as your yoke. When you want to be saved, He puts this yoke upon you. Once you have the yoke, you are a saved person. From a human point of view, when God saves a person, everything that he receives is not all good because God wants to bring him under His sovereignty. This was Peter's work. No matter what you are-animal, reptile, or bird-he took everyone into the kingdom of God.</P><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_007.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_009.html">Next</a> </body></html>
