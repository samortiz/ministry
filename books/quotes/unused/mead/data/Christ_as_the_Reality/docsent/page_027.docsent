   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER SEVEN THE HUMANITY OF JESUS IN MATTHEW, MARK, AND JOHN Scripture Reading: Matt 3:15; 4:4, 7, 10; 8:20; 11:29; 12:19-20; 17:27; 20:28; 21:27; 26:63-64; 27:12, 14; Mark 1:35; 3:20-21; 6:31, 39-40; John 6:12; 7:6, 46; 11:33, 35, 38; 13:4-5</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The four Gospels give us a full picture of the Lord Jesus from four directions.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>I believe we all know that Matthew reveals the Lord Jesus as the King.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Mark shows us a picture of Him as the slave, the servant of God.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Luke portrays the Lord Jesus as the perfect man.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The last Gospel, John, reveals that Christ is God Himself; He is the Son of God.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>So from these four Gospels we obtain four words: King, Servant, Man, and God.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The Lord Jesus is so much!</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>He is the King; He is the Servant; He is the Man; and He is also the very God.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>But what He is in all these directions and aspects depends upon His humanity.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>That is why in all the Gospels there are verses concerning His humanity.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>WOOD OVERLAID WITH GOLD</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Let me illustrate in this way.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Among the types in the Old Testament, there is the ark made of wood overlaid with gold.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The wood, not the gold, is the frame of the ark.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The gold gives the beauty, the worth, and the value, but the gold is not the frame.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The gold is the decoration upon the wood.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The frame and the main basic structure that holds and supports the gold is the wood.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>In typology, wood signifies humanity; hence, this wood of the ark signifies the humanity of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The humanity of Christ is the basic structure that supports the gold of the ark.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The tabernacle is built with forty-eight wooden boards which are the frame of the tabernacle.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>This means that the humanity of Jesus is the frame of the tabernacle.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>If He were not a proper man, He could never be the King, the Servant, and the perfect Man.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The very God revealed in John is not God alone, but a God-man; He is God in man.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>But if Jesus were not a perfect man, how could God be incarnated in Him?</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>If Jesus were not perfect and God was incarnated in Him, God would be depreciated and lose His value.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The divine value, however, is complemented by a perfect humanity.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>It was a complete, solid, and perfect humanity in which God could be contained in a full way.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Even for Jesus to be God requires the humanity of Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>If He were not a perfect man, He could never be the King, the Servant, the Man, or the very God incarnated in a man.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>All these aspects of the Lord Jesus depend upon His humanity.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>How we need such a humanity today in the church life!</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>We have already seen that the ark is the type of Christ, and the tabernacle is the type of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The tabernacle is the enlargement of the ark.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>In the same way today the church is the enlargement of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>If it is necessary for Christ to have such a humanity to be God's testimony, then we as the church also need the same strong and perfect humanity.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>THE BASIC STRUCTURE</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Wood is the basic structure of the ark, and wood is also the main structure of the tabernacle.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Hence, it is the humanity of Jesus that is the main structure of Christ as God's testimony, and it is the humanity of Jesus that is the basic structure of the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>If we do not have this humanity, as typified by acacia wood, it is impossible for us to have a proper church as the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>For a real building up of the Body of Christ in our locality, we all need the humanity of Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>There is only one kind of wood that is good for the structure of both the ark and the tabernacle that is acacia wood.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>And there is only one kind of humanity that is good for God's testimony today in the local church life that is the humanity of Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Our humanity is not good for God's building.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Many of us may be good, but regardless of how good we are, our humanity is of no use.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>It may be useful for many other things, but not for the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>For the building up of the ark and the tabernacle, there is only one kind of wood which is useful that is the acacia wood, the humanity of Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Many people today say that all we need is the baptism of the Holy Spirit, the outpouring from above.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>That is wonderful, but consider yourself: what kind of humanity do you have?</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>The Spirit is typified by the gold, but this is not the basic structure.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>The basic structure is the wood.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Suppose we were going to build a tabernacle and had tons of gold, yet the wood we used was rotten.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>That tabernacle would not stand.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Regardless of how much gold we have, without the proper wood, we can never build a tabernacle.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>I have seen people praying, seeking, and crying for the baptism of the Holy Spirit, and eventually they received it.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>But their building fell apart.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>It was not due to the gold, but to the poor quality of the wood.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>This is the thing that is neglected by today's Christianity.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Today's Christians pay much attention to the baptism of the Holy Spirit, but where is the proper humanity?</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>The tabernacle as a type of the church was not built purely with the gold.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>It was built with the wood as the main structure.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>The gold was just a kind of decoration.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Of course, without the overlaying gold, there would be little value or beauty.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>The wood alone is not of much worth.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>But although the value is in the gold, gold is not the main structure.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>The gold requires something solid to support it.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>That is the proper, solid, strong, and perfect humanity.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Do we have such a humanity?</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>We do not have it in ourselves, but we do have it in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>He is the perfect humanity within us.</S>
