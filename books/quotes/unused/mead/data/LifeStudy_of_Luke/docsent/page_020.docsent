   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Adored by Anna</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In 2:36-39 we have Anna s adoration of the Child Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Verse 36 says, And there was Anna, a prophetess, a daughter of Phanuel, of the tribe of Asher.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>She was well advanced in years, having lived with a husband seven years from her virginity.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Anna was a widow up to the age of eighty-four, who did not depart from the temple, serving with fastings and petitions night and day v. 37 . Verse 38 says, At that very hour she came up and returned thanks to God, and spoke concerning Him to all those looking for the redemption of Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Here the word redemption indicates that the Man-Savior is the redemption of God s people.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Anna returned thanks to God for the Man-Savior and spoke concerning Him as the redemption of God s people.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>In 2:21-38 we see that the Man-Savior, in order to be a proper Israelite according to the law, was circumcised, named, and offered to God.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Luke 2:39 says, And when they had finished all things according to the law of the Lord, they returned into Galilee, to their own city, Nazareth.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The Man-Savior was born in Bethlehem, the city of David, and He remained there just briefly.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>He was raised in Nazareth, a despised city in Galilee, a despised region.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Being despised was also a characteristic of the Savior s human life.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Growing in Stature of Body,</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Becoming Strong in Spirit,</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Being Filled with Wisdom,</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>and the Grace of God Being upon Him</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Luke 2:40 says, And the little child grew and became strong, being filled with wisdom, and the grace of God was upon Him.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>He grew in stature of body v. 52 , and He became strong in spirit see 1:80 .</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Verse 40 says that as the Man-Savior was growing, He was being filled with wisdom.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>This wisdom, which came from the Savior s deity Col 2:2-3 , was revealed in proportion to the measure of His bodily growth.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Verse 40 also tells us that the grace of God was upon Him.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>As a Man, even Jesus needed the grace of God for His human life.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>He was filled with wisdom from His deity, and He needed the grace of God for His humanity.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>As God, the Man-Savior did not need grace.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>However, as a Man He needed the grace of God.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Therefore, we are told in verse 40 that the grace of God was upon Him.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>As human beings, we all need God s wisdom and grace.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Wisdom is related to the way of doing things, and grace, to the power, the ability, to carry out those things.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>In our living we first need the way to do a particular thing; then we need the power to do it.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Wisdom is the way, and grace is the power.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>We need wisdom in order to have the proper way.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>However, wisdom itself is not enough.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>We also need grace.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>If we do not have grace, we shall not have the power, strength, or energy to carry out a certain matter in the proper way.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>If we have wisdom without grace, we shall be disappointed because we shall not be able to fulfill our responsibility.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>But we may have God s wisdom for our way and God s grace for our power, strength, and energy.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The Man Jesus lived in God s wisdom and grace.</S>
