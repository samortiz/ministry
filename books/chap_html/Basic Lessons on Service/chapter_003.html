In the previous lesson, we saw that the focus of the Lord's table is the Lord Himself. We also saw that we remember the Lord by breaking the bread to apprehend with appreciation and thanks the Lord's physical body being broken for us. Now we want to consider more points concerning our remembrance of the Lord.</P>
