   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>LEADING OUR LAMBS TO THE HOME MEETINGS</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>AND FEEDING THEM THERE</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Let us go on to see a key to the home meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Today we want to bring out one key to the home meetings, that is, to bring others to our meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>If we desire to see our home meetings prosper, everyone must bring others to the meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>If you would do this, and he would do this, soon the number in the home meetings would increase.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>This principle is very scriptural.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Consider the Shulammite in the Song of Songs.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>She was only thinking of herself.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Her word to the Lord was, Tell me, you whom my soul loves, Where do you pasture your flock?</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>/ Where do you make it lie down at noon?</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>1:7 .</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The Lord replied, If you yourself do not know, / You fairest among women, / Go forth on the footsteps of the flock, / And pasture your young goats / By the shepherds tents 1:8 .</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>This seeker of the Lord told the Lord that she was tired of seeking.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>She did not have peace; she needed rest.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The Lord told her, You may follow the footsteps of the flock.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>As long as you take the way of the flock, you will find Me. But do not forget that there are still the kids.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>You must bring your kids along as well.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Where are the shepherds tents today?</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>They are in the church.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>And where is the church?</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>It is in the home meetings!</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Therefore, we all must bring our young, new, and unbelieving kids to the shepherds tents.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Do not think that it is only in the world that we have children.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>As seekers of the Lord, we should also have children.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>We should have apprentices following us.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>I have seen many precious brothers and sisters in both the West and the East who are very dear.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Yet they have a big problem: they do not have any offspring.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Neither do they have any apprentices.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>All believers must be like parents, bringing forth children.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>They must also be like masters taking on apprentices.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Everyone must learn to bring in people.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>We learn many lessons when we bring in people.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>All parents can learn many lessons from their children.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Up to now I have been a parent for three generations.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>I have not only grandchildren but also great-grandchildren.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>I am a father, a grandfather, and a great-grandfather.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>I have learned the most.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>What teachers teach us is theoretical, but what our children teach us is practical.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>MORE FRUIT AND MORE ENJOYMENT OF THE LORD</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>John 15:2 says, Every branch in Me that does not bear fruit, He takes it away; and every branch that bears fruit, He prunes it that it may bear more fruit.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Every branch in Jesus must bear fruit.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Perhaps some may say, The fruit-bearing in chapter fifteen does not necessarily refer to people.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>In Galatians chapter five, the fruit of the Spirit refers to love, joy, peace, longsuffering, and so forth.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>If you read the context of John chapter fifteen you will see that the emphasis there is on people as fruit.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>If a branch has only one fruit it is unattractive.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>But if a branch has no fruit at all, the Lord said that He will take it away.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>To be taken away means to be deprived of the enjoyment of the riches of the tree.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>The fruitless ones are in danger of losing their enjoyment.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>As a branch, if you want to enjoy the riches of the tree, you must bear much fruit.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>The more fruit you bear, the more riches you will receive from the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>That means the more fruit you bear, the more enjoyment you have.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>You must go and bear fruit.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>You must bring in people.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>In this matter there are too many lessons to learn.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>I have mentioned this in the past.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>You must deal with different kinds of people in different ways.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>To teach gospel songs to your relatives children is one way.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>To sing to your grandfather is another.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Of course, you must pray for them.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>There are many ways.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>The question is whether or not you have the heart to take care of them.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>We who are saved and are the Lord s are destined to bear fruit.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Whether or not you have the desire, you must bear fruit.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>If you do not bear fruit, you are doing something other than the Lord s destiny for you, and you will lose the enjoyment of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Chapter one of the Song of Songs says that we, the seekers of the Lord, must not give up our kids.</S>
