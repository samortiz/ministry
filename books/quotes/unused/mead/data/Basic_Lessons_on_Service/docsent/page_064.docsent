   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>In this lesson we want to see the grace-ministering service.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Romans 12:4-6a says that grace is given to every member and that every member has a gift.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Ephesians 4:7 says that to each one of us grace was given according to the measure of the gift of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Then 1 Peter 4:10 tells us that we have to be good stewards of the varied grace of God.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>John 1:17b shows us that grace is Christ Himself coming as the embodiment of God for our enjoyment.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In 1 Corinthians 15:10 Paul said, "I labored more abundantly...yet not I but the grace of God which is with me."</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Then in 2 Corinthians 12:9 the Lord told Paul, "My grace is sufficient for you, for My power is perfected in weakness."</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>I. ALL THE MEMBERS OF THE BODY</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>OF CHRIST BEING GIFTED</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Romans 12:6a says that we all have gifts which differ according to the grace given to us.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>This shows that all the members of the Body of Christ are gifted.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>We have to impress the saints with this.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>They may know that all the members of the Body of Christ are gifted, but they do not use their gift.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>II.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>EVERY MEMBER HAVING BEEN GIVEN GRACE</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>According to Ephesians 4:7 and Romans 12:6b every member has been given grace.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>We need to read these two verses to the saints repeatedly in order to impress them that all of them have been given grace.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>In this message what is needed is mainly to impress the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>They may know some of these points, but they have never been impressed with them.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>III.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>ALL THE MEMBERS BEING STEWARDS</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>OF THE VARIED GRACE OF GOD</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>According to 1 Peter 4:10, all the members are the stewards of the varied or manifold grace of God.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>On this point we need much speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>This is not a common thought to all the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>God's grace is not only of one aspect; it has manifold aspects.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The Pentecostals think that grace is just to speak in tongues.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>If you do not speak in tongues, you do not have grace.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>To those who are for healing, grace is a miracle.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>If you do not have miracles, you do not have grace.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>But the New Testament shows us that to serve the saints with a cup of cold water is also an aspect of grace.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>To clean the meeting hall and prepare the chairs for the saints to sit on is another aspect of grace.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>If a brother is very bothered by a certain situation, and I go to pray with him, that is still another aspect of grace.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>God's grace is manifold.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>We can illustrate this point to the saints in many ways.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The church is the best society and has the best communal life.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>In such a society with such a communal life, there is the need of many kinds of services.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Every service is an aspect of grace ministered by the saints to one another.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Thus, all the saints as members of the Body of Christ are stewards of the manifold grace of God.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>On the one hand, we are members of the Body of Christ, and on the other hand, we are stewards of God.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Stewards are persons who have the commission to minister the rich supply to others.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>A steward is one who always supplies others with certain needs, so we have to help the saints realize that every brother and every sister today in the church life as a member of Christ should be a steward of God assigned by God, commissioned by God, charged by God, with some aspect of His grace to minister to others for their supply.</S>
