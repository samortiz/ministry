   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHRIST BEING THE FATHER, THE SON, AND THE SPIRIT</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In the King James Version, Romans 8:16 renders the pronoun for the Spirit as itself, leaving the impression that the translators of that version did not realize that the Holy Spirit is a person, considering Him simply as a kind of power or instrument.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>From the time of the American Standard Version of 1901, people began to see more clearly that the Holy Spirit is a divine person, so that at least since then, translations refer to the Spirit as He or Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>However, some of the Brethren continued to teach that we should not pray to the Holy Spirit but only to the Father and sometimes to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>I myself was taught in this way, because I was under the teaching of the Brethren for seven years.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>I adopted their teaching, and I tried to practice it.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Many times I began my prayer by saying, O Father in heaven.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Then after a few minutes I realized that the One to whom I was praying is not only in heaven but also within me.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>At this point I might pray, O Lord, O Father, my Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>I was very bothered when this happened, wondering whether He is the Father or the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>After this, I was more cautious when I prayed, carefully considering whether I should pray to the Father or to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>This demonstrates that we have been too influenced by the traditional teaching of Christianity.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>In 1933 I gave up my job and went to Shanghai, China, to visit Brother Watchman Nee.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>He received me as his guest and also as his trainee for four months.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>One day Brother Nee invited a traveling preacher from the China Inland Mission churches to give a message in our meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>At a certain point in his message, the preacher said, Please, do not think that Jesus is one and the Holy Spirit is another.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>You must all realize that the Lord Jesus and the Spirit are one.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Today Jesus the Lord is the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Brother Nee, who was sitting in the back of the meeting, boldly said Amen!</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>That surprised us all very much.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>After that meeting, while dinner was being prepared, Brother Nee took me on a little walk.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>I took the opportunity to ask him why he had so boldly said Amen.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>He told me, This message is what we need.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>It is right to say that the Lord Jesus is the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Because there were not many saints in the Lord s recovery at that time, the work among us was not great.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>This gave Brother Nee the time to sit with the eight or ten trainees living there and have some free talk.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>This went on for a long period of time.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>These were wonderful times, and I can never forget them.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>At a certain point he was burdened to expound John 14 to us.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Formerly, the Brethren had taught me mostly concerning types and prophecies, such as the seventy weeks and the ten toes, four beasts, seven heads, and ten horns Dan 9:24; 2:34; 7:2-3; Rev 13:1; 17:3 .</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>At this time, however, Brother Nee sat down to speak something more profound from John 14.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>He pointed out how Philip foolishly asked Jesus, Lord, show us the Father and it is sufficient for us v. 8 . Jesus answered, Have I been so long a time with you, and you have not known Me, Philip? He who has seen Me has seen the Father; how is it that you say, Show us the Father? Do you not believe that I am in the Father and the Father is in Me? vv.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>9-10a .</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The Lord seemed to be saying, Don t you know by now that if you see Me, you see the Father?</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>You have seen the Father every day for several years.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The Father is in Me, and I am in the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>We are one.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Verse 16 continues, I will ask the Father, and He will give you another Comforter, that He may be with you forever.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Then in verse 18 the pronoun changes from He to I: I will not leave you as orphans; I am coming to you.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>He the Comforter in verse 16 is I Jesus in verse 18.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Therefore, the Lord Jesus is not only the Father but also the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>We must receive this word, because it is the word of the Bible in John 14.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>When Brother Nee shared this with us, my eyes became open.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>This was truly new to me.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>We do not teach in a light way that Christ is the Son, the Father, and also the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>We have spent many years studying this matter in the Bible and in our experience.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The New Testament tells us that the Father is in us Eph 4:6 , the Son is in us 2 Cor 13:5; Col 1:27 , and the Spirit is in us John 14:17 .</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>According to our experience, do we have three or one in us?</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>In John 14:23 Jesus said, If anyone loves Me, he will keep My word, and My Father will love him, and We will come to him and make an abode with him.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Here the Lord said that We, the Father and the Son, will abide in the disciples.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>However, it is not accurate to say that two or three dwell in us, because the Father, the Son, and the Spirit are one.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Shortly before Brother Nee was imprisoned, he wrote a hymn that says,</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Thou, Lord, the Father once wast called,</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>But now the Holy Spirit art;</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>The Spirit is Thine other form,</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Thyself to dwell within our heart.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Hymns, #490</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Later, after we came to Taiwan, we further saw the truth in 1 Corinthians 15:45b, which says, The last Adam became a life-giving Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>At that time the light shined brightly from this verse.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>About the same time we also saw 2 Corinthians 3:17: The Lord is the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>We looked into many different translations to find the correct rendering of this verse.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>We found that John N. Darby, in his New Translation, places verses 7 through 16 in parenthesis, meaning that in Darby s realization, verse 17 directly continues verse 6.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Verse 6 says, The letter kills, but the Spirit gives life, and verse 17 continues, The Lord is the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>The Lord in verse 17 is the Spirit who gives life in verse 6.</S>
