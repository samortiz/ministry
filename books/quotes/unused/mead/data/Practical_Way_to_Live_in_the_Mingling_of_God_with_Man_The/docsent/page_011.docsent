   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER FOUR DENYING THE NATURAL MIND, EMOTION,</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>AND WILL TO GO ALONG WITH</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>THE INDWELLING CHRIST Scripture Reading: Rom 8:29; 1 Cor 6:17; 2 Cor 3:16-18; Rom 12:2; Eph 3:17a; 1 Cor 2:16</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Romans 8:29 tells us that God predestinated us to be conformed to the image of His Son.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>This is the desire of God s heart.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The Scriptures tell us that originally God had the only begotten Son, the Lord Jesus Christ John 1:18 .</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The Bible also tells us that after the death and resurrection of Christ, God had many sons, with Christ as the Firstborn among them 20:17; Heb 2:10; cf.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Rom 8:29 .</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>In other words, Christ was originally the only begotten Son of God, but after He died and rose from the dead, He became the Firstborn of many sons.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>God s work according to His eternal purpose is to produce many sons with His Firstborn as the model.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>God s firstborn Son is the pattern, and according to this pattern, this model, God has produced many sons.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>God has accomplished this through our regeneration.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>When we received the Lord Jesus as our Savior, the Holy Spirit entered into our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Because the Spirit is the reality of Christ, when the Spirit came into us, Christ Himself came into us.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Now, by virtue of our having been regenerated, Christ is in us.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Before Christ came into our spirit, our spirit was dead because of sin Eph 2:1, 5 .</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>However, Christ is life, and when He entered into us, He enlivened our deadened spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Because He as the Spirit has entered into our spirit, He is now our life Col 3:4 .</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>It is by the Spirit regenerating us with Christ as life that we have been made God s many sons.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Not only so, God put His Son into us so that Christ might grow and be formed within us Gal 4:19 .</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>This fulfills God s eternal purpose and desire that we would be His sons in life, nature, and image.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>I have been a believer for thirty-eight years.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>For the first years of my Christian life I was taught much and heard many messages.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Within four and a half years I listened to more than one thousand messages.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Not only was I taught much in the meetings, but I also read many Christian books.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>These messages, teachings, and books stressed mainly negative matters, such as how to overcome sin, pride, hatred, and falsehood.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>During those first years, I do not recall ever being taught that, on the positive side, God s eternal purpose is that we would be conformed to the image of His Son.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The teaching on the negative side never enabled me to overcome the negative matters.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The more I tried, the more frustrated I became, and after a period of time, I gave up trying altogether.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>It was then that the Lord opened my eyes to realize that there is no need for me to try to do anything.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>I realized that since the Holy Spirit was within me, He would work out my conformation to His glorious image.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>When I realized this, I forgot about trying to be humble and trying not to be proud.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>We should forget about these negative matters.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The more we try to deal with them, the more we will be troubled by them.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>For example, the more we try to be humble, the prouder we will become.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>God did not ordain us to live in such a way.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Rather, He foreordained us to be conformed to the image of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>We have to focus on Christ and forget about sin.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>However, it is very hard for us to do this.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>As Christians, we constantly remember that we should not sin, that we should be humble, and that we should not do anything wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Consequently, it is very hard for us to forget about the negative things.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>It is God s desire that we be conformed to the image of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Let us therefore forget about doing good or evil.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>We should tell good and evil, I have nothing to do with you anymore.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>I only care for Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Christ is my aim and my everything.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>I need to be conformed to the image of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>He is now in me as the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>He is also my life.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>I no longer pay attention to good and evil.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>I only know to live by Christ who is my life.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>APPLYING CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Our problem is that although Christ is in us, we do not apply Him.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>When I was a young man in China, I used oil lamps for light.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Even after electricity was installed in my house, by force of habit I would often strike a match and light the oil lamp when I returned home at night.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Even though I tried to remember that since I had electricity, I no longer needed to use the oil lamp, I would frequently forget.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>At the time of our regeneration, Christ came into us as an electric lamp.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Nevertheless, because we are so accustomed to our oil lamp, that is, our old life, we forget to apply Christ in our daily living.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>In other words, although we have been regenerated in our spirit, we still remain in the old life and forget to live by Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>This is an indication that after we have been regenerated, we still need to be transformed.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Transformation is very important.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Yet among the children of God today, it is almost entirely neglected.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Christians speak very much concerning sanctification and holy living.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>However, our being transformed is more vital than our being sanctified, for unless we are transformed, we cannot be sanctified.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>We must be transformed from the old life, form, and shape into another life, form, and shape.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>The old form is the form of Adam.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>The new form is the form of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>To be regenerated is one thing; to be transformed is another thing.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Although we have been regenerated in our spirit, the remainder of our being primarily our mind, emotion, and will has yet to be transformed.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Hence, we are still in the old man.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>We are certain that our spirit is regenerated, but are we as confident that our mind, emotion, and will have been transformed?</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Are all these parts transformed, or do they remain in the old life?</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>We all must admit that there is still a long way for us to go before we are fully transformed in our soul.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>In Romans 12:2 Paul uses the phrase be transformed by the renewing of the mind.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>This verse implies that although we have been regenerated in our spirit, our mind remains old.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>Our mind is about six thousand years old it is the mind of Adam.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>Hence, our mind, and with it our emotion and will, stands in need of being transformed.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>How then can we be transformed?</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>This matter has much to do with our heart.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>Ephesians 3:17 speaks of Christ making His home in our hearts.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>Again, we have all been regenerated, but I doubt that Christ has made His home in many of our hearts.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>Is your heart Christ s home?</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>Does Christ really make His home in your heart?</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>Do you love the Lord so much that you offer your heart to Him to let Him occupy it fully?</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>This is a vital matter.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>The Lord already dwells in our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>The problem is whether or not Christ is making His home in our heart.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>The spirit and the heart are not the same.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>The Scriptures tell us that the heart includes all the parts of the soul the mind, emotion, and the will Matt 9:4; John 16:22, 6; Heb 4:12 plus the conscience 10:22; 1 John 3:20 .</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>Although we have been regenerated in our spirit, we have to be transformed in our mind, emotion, and will.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>This transformation can take place only when Christ occupies our heart as a home.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>We have to love Christ with our whole heart, offer our heart to Him, and let Him take over our whole heart so that He may dwell in it.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>We should tell Him, Lord, here is my heart.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>Come and occupy it fully.</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>Come to make Your home in my heart.</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>First Corinthians 2:16 says, For who has known the mind of the Lord and will instruct Him?</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>But we have the mind of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='98' RSNT='1' SNO='98'>That we have the mind of Christ means that our mind has been transformed into the mind of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='99' RSNT='1' SNO='99'>We have Christ, but we may have Him in our spirit only.</S>
   <S PAR='100' RSNT='1' SNO='100'>Whether or not Christ occupies our mind, emotion, or will is the problem.</S>
   <S PAR='101' RSNT='1' SNO='101'>If we are going to enjoy and experience Christ, we must learn this lesson absolutely.</S>
   <S PAR='102' RSNT='1' SNO='102'>We have to love the Lord with our whole heart, offer our whole heart to Him, and give up our mind, emotion, and will to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='103' RSNT='1' SNO='103'>As those who are regenerated, we have to learn that we cannot go along with our own mind, emotion, and will, for they are old and natural.</S>
   <S PAR='104' RSNT='1' SNO='104'>Rather, we must deny them.</S>
