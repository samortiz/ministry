Signifying That the Partakers of Christ Should Be God&#8217;s Serving Ones-Priests</h2><p>The males among the sons of Aaron eating of the meal offering also signifies that the partakers of Christ should be God&#8217;s serving ones-priests. If we do our daily work without serving God as a priest, we cannot share in the real enjoyment of Christ. In such a case, we may think that we have this enjoyment, but our thought does not correspond to the actual situation.<h2 class=head1>VI. THE MEAL OFFERING OF AARON AND HIS SONS ON THE DAY WHEN AARON IS ANOINTED</h2><p>&#8220;This is the offering of Aaron and his sons which they shall offer to Jehovah on the day when he is anointed&#8221; (v. 20a). This signifies that the enjoyment of Christ as the life supply is related to the priestly service. Again and again I would emphasize the fact that the enjoyment of Christ as the meal offering is related to our priestly service.<h2 class=head2>A. The Tenth of an Ephah of Fine Flour as a Continual Meal Offering</h2><p>Verse 20b speaks of &#8220;the tenth of an ephah of fine flour as a continual meal offering.&#8221; This signifies that the top portion, the tenth part, of the enjoyment of Christ should be for God. This also signifies that this kind of enjoyment of Christ should continue in our priestly service.<h2 class=head2>B. Half of the Meal Offering in the Morning and Half in the Evening to Keep It a Continual Offering</h2><p>Half of the meal offering was offered in the morning and half in the evening to keep it a continual offering (v. 20c). This signifies the continual enjoyment of Christ in the priestly service.<p>The meal offering is only for the priests, and it is prevailing only in the priestly service. We may be priests, but our priestly service may not be prevailing. If this is our situation, then the priestly food will likewise not be prevailing. This spiritual food can be prevailing only in a prevailing priestly service. We must be serving priests in actuality. Then the priestly food will actually be our portion.<h2 class=head2>C. The Meal Offering Being Entirely Burned and Not Eaten by the Priest</h2><p>&#8220;It is a perpetual statute; it shall be entirely offered up in smoke to Jehovah. Every meal offering of a priest shall be entirely burned; it must not be eaten&#8221; (vv. 22b-23). This signifies that the enjoyment of Christ for God&#8217;s satisfaction should be absolute.<p>Our enjoyment of Christ is measured by the extent to which we are actually priests serving God. Our feeling is not the measurement. We are priests, but if there is a problem with our priestly service, there will also be a problem with the enjoyment of Christ as the meal offering.<p>In doing anything, we need to be in the right position. If we are not in the right position, then we cannot have anything to do with that particular matter. Although we are priests, in a practical way we may be in the wrong position and therefore cannot have the real enjoyment of Christ as the meal offering.<p>My loving intention in speaking this word is to encourage you to reconsider your way. Do not think that you are all right. I can testify to you that daily I need to reconsider my way and my situation. This is a serious matter because none of us knows when the Lord might take him. We may be taken at any time. Once the Lord takes us away, it will be too late for us to do anything about our situation. We have been clearly told that at His coming the Lord will set up a judgment seat (Rom. 14:10; 2 Cor. 5:10). We all will stand there and give an account to Him. In particular, we will have to confess all the words that came out of our mouth while we were on earth (Matt. 12:36-37). Therefore, we need to be careful in what we speak.<p>My desire is not to be an expositor of the Bible. My burden is to minister the Lord&#8217;s word in a living and enlightening way. I would like all the dear saints to be enlightened and to see some light concerning themselves, concerning the church, and concerning God&#8217;s New Testament economy. It is crucial that we be brought into the light and that the light shine upon us, around us, and within us.<p>We need to remember that the first three offerings-the burnt offering, the meal offering, and the peace offering-bring us into the light. In the light we are enlightened to see our sin and our sins. This is what we need.<p>Whether we are old or young, whether we have been saved for many years or for a few months, we need to be enlightened. We all need to be brought into the divine light. We thank the Lord that we are children of light (Eph. 5:8). Since we are children of light, we must be in the light to be clear first concerning ourselves and then concerning God&#8217;s economy. This is what I am expecting to see.<br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_087.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_089.html">Next</a> </body></html>
