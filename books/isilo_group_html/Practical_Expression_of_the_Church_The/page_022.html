We all have our own tastes and our own concepts in so many matters; but if we are in our opinions and our concepts, we only cause trouble. For instance, regarding the matter of baptism, there are many different opinions, and they have caused much trouble. However, if we are full of Christ, we will not care for these things.<h2 class=head1>THE APOSTLE&#8217;S ATTITUDE</h2><p>The attitude of the Apostle Paul in Romans 14 regarding different concepts of eating and the keeping of days was exceedingly liberal and general. According to the teaching of the Bible, it is abundantly clear that today under God&#8217;s grace, there is no need to make distinctions regarding the things we eat. All things are good for food, both meat and herbs-there is no difference in the eyes of God. We can eat herbs, and we can eat any kind of meat. The Apostle Paul knew this better than we. But in this chapter he said not a word according to the doctrine regarding this matter. Instead, he said, &#8220;Let not him that eateth despise him that eateth not; and let not him which eateth not judge him that eateth.&#8221; If you eat all things, do not despise those who do not; if you do not eat all things, do not criticize those who do. What a liberal attitude the Apostle tells us that we should take! As to the doctrine, he said not a word.<p>Concerning the keeping of days, the Apostle said, &#8220;One esteemeth one day above another: another esteemeth every day alike. Let every man be fully persuaded in his own mind.&#8221; Again the Apostle took a very liberal attitude, not saying which was right or which was wrong. According to the Scriptures, we should not keep any day in this age. Today, under the Lord&#8217;s grace, every day is the same. Even the Sabbath differs not from any other day. The Apostle knew this quite well, but he did not speak concerning the right teaching. He did not say whether esteeming one day above another is right, or whether esteeming every day alike is right. He only said, &#8220;He that regardeth the day, regardeth it unto the Lord; and he that regardeth not the day, to the Lord he doth not regard it.&#8221; His attitude was truly liberal!<p>Could we be so liberal? We must be so liberal. By the Lord&#8217;s mercy and grace, we must learn to be so liberal. I do not mean that we should be liberal regarding the Lord. We must be absolutely definite concerning the Lord and the church as His expression. But could we be liberal with all other things? Whether or not a brother or sister should do a certain thing depends upon his or her feeling before the Lord. If they feel they should do it, let them do it unto the Lord. Perhaps they will feel that they need not do it. Then let them not do it unto the Lord. If the Lord wants them to do it, they should not say no to Him.<p>We should not have any legal regulations, and we should not attempt to make everyone alike. If we insist upon having certain things in uniformity, we are legal. If one eats herbs and feels that everyone should also eat herbs, it will cause trouble. As long as the brothers and sisters do not do things that are sinful, we should not trouble them. We should only be definite regarding Christ as life and the church as the expression of Christ. With all other things, we must learn from the Apostle Paul to be very liberal and general.<br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_021.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_023.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>The Practical Expression of the Church &nbsp; pg 22</div><br></body></html>
