The Holy Spirit in God's incarnation makes man distinct from being common as God is distinct in His holy nature
The Lord Jesus was conceived of the Holy Spirit with the divine essence in a human virgin who was found to be with child of the Holy Spirit
Luke 3:22 tells us that the Holy Spirit descended upon Christ in bodily form as a dove, anointing Him for His ministry
According to John 20:22, the Lord Jesus on the day of His resurrection breathed into the disciples and told them to receive the Holy Spirit
Later in Matthew 2819 the Lord charges the disciples to baptize people into the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit
In Romans 15:16 Paul says that in his ministry the offering of the nations might be acceptable, having been sanctified in the Holy Spirit
God the Father is the source, God the Son is the course, the expression, and God the Spirit is the reaching and the application
Although He already had the Spirit of God within Him, He still needed to have the Spirit of God upon Him for His ministry
In Romans 8:9 Paul speaks of the Spirit of God dwelling in us, and in verse 14, of the sons of God being led by the Spirit of God
In the New Testament phrases such as the love of God and the life of God mean that love and life are God Himself
Galatians 4:6 says, 'Because you are sons, God sent forth the Spirit of His Son into our hearts, crying, Abba, Father'!
As sons of God we have the position with the full right to participate in the Spirit of God's Son, who has the bountiful supply of life
After He finished this work He became in resurrection the life-giving Spirit and comes to us as the Spirit of the Son
The Spirit of Christ, therefore, is the totality, the aggregate, of the all-inclusive Christ with His all-inclusive death and resurrection
Because we have this Spirit in us, we have the all-inclusive Christ and His all-inclusive termination and germination
By the Spirit of Christ we partake of Christ in His resurrection life and power, His transcendency, and His reigning authority
Before Christ's resurrection, the Spirit that is not only the Spirit of God but also the Spirit of Christ was 'not yet'
Acts 16:7 says, 'When they had come down to Mysia, they tried to go into Bithynia, and the Spirit of Jesus did not allow them'
The interchangeable use of the Spirit of Jesus with the Holy Spirit in Acts 16:6 reveals that the Spirit of Jesus is the Holy Spirit
The Spirit is not the Spirit of Jesus as in Acts 16:7, nor the Spirit of Christ as in Romans 8:9, but the Spirit of Jesus Christ
The Spirit of Jesus is mainly for the Lord's humanity and human living; the Spirit of Christ is mainly for the Lord's resurrection
To Paul the Spirit was the Spirit of Jesus Christ, the compound, all-inclusive, life-giving Spirit of the Triune God
The Spirit of Jesus Christ is the Spirit of the Jesus who lived a life of suffering on earth and of the Christ who is now in resurrection
There is no way to divide the Lord from the Spirit or to separate the Lord from the Spirit, for the Lord and the Spirit are one
The Spirit of God has been processed through Christ's death and resurrection to consummate in the life-giving Spirit
The title 'the life-giving Spirit' indicates that the Spirit is moving, working, and living in us to impart life into us
The Triune God as the Spirit of life makes sinners into sons of God who become the living members of the Body of Christ
For the Spirit to be the Spirit of grace means that the Triune God in the Son as the Spirit becomes our enjoyment
He was among the disciples, but He needed to go through death and resurrection to become the life-giving Spirit
In the New Testament expressions such as the Spirit of life and the Spirit of grace indicate that the Spirit is life and grace
The fact that the Spirit is gracious is indicated by Zechariah 12:10, which speaks of the outpouring of the Spirit of grace and supplication
The Spirit is called the Spirit of reality because whatever the Father in the Son is and whatever the Son is, is realized in the Spirit
Because the Spirit is the reality of all divine and spiritual entities and items, He is called the Spirit of reality
In a note on John 14:16 Darby says that a paraclete was 'one who carries on the cause of any one and helps him'
In his translation of 1 John 2:1, where the same Greek word is used, Darby says that we have a patron with the Father
On the one hand, we have all been baptized in one Spirit into one Body; on the other hand, we have been given to drink of the one Spirit
The inward aspect of the Spirit is for life essentially, and the outward aspect is for ministry and work economically
Peter 4:14 says, 'If you are reproached in the name of Christ, you are blessed, because the Spirit of glory and of God rests upon you'
We should rejoice when we are reproached in the name of Christ, because the Spirit of glory and that of God is resting upon us
The seven Spirits in Revelation 1:4 undoubtedly are the Spirit of God because They are ranked among the Triune God
As seven is the number for completion in God's operation, so the seven Spirits must be for God's move on earth
The seven lamps here refer to the seven lamps of the lampstand in Exodus 25:37 and the seven lamps of the lampstand in Zechariah 4:2
The seven lamps of fire which are the seven Spirits of God signify the enlightening and searching of the sevenfold intensified Spirit of God
The seven lamps are for God's judgment, which will issue also in God's building-the building of the New Jerusalem
These seven eyes are the seven Spirits of God sent forth into all the earth, running 'to and fro through the whole earth'
When Christ looks at us with His seven eyes, these eyes, which are the seven Spirits, will transfuse Christ's element into us
When all the aspects and elements of the Spirit are put together, we have a totality, an aggregate, known in the New Testament as the Spirit
Even though, before Christ's death and resurrection, the Spirit of God was the Spirit of Jehovah and the Holy Spirit, the Spirit was not yet
In speaking of the Spirit John and Paul are referring to the all-inclusive life-giving Spirit of the Triune God
The Spirit is the Triune God after He has passed through the process of incarnation, human living, crucifixion, resurrection, and ascension
Having passed through this process, the Triune God is now this consummate Spirit as the blessing of the New Testament
The Spirit is the ultimate expression of the processed Triune God and the bride is the ultimate expression of the transformed tripartite man
By the time of Revelation 22:17, the processed Triune God and the transformed tripartite man will be one and will speak as one
The Spirit is the reality of God, the Father, the Lord, the Son of God, Jesus, Christ, the living God, grace, power, and glory
By the Spirit of God descending upon Him as a dove the Lord Jesus ministered in gentleness and singleness focusing solely on the will of God
On the negative side, the Lamb solves the problem of man's sin; on the positive side, the dove brings God to man
The dove in John 1:32 signifies the Holy Spirit for life-giving, regenerating, anointing, transforming, uniting, and building
The lamp signifies the word of God used by the Spirit to enlighten and expose the sinner's position and condition so that he may repent
The Holy Spirit is actually nothing less than the resurrected Lord Jesus Himself, because this Spirit is His breath
John 1:14 says, 'The Word became flesh,' and 1 Corinthians 15:45b says, 'The last Adam became a life-giving Spirit'
The incarnated One was the Triune God to be a man as the last Adam, and this last Adam in resurrection has become the life-giving Spirit
On the day of His resurrection, He appeared to His disciples, breathed upon them, and said, 'Receive the Holy Spirit'
The breathing in John 20 is for the imparting of the life-giving Spirit into the disciples essentially for their spiritual being and living
For this reason some Bible teachers have called the Spirit of power symbolized by clothing the mantle Spirit the Spirit as an outer coat
In 4:14 the Lord Jesus said that whoever drinks of the water that He gives will have in him a spring of water welling up into eternal life
In chapter seven the Lord goes somewhat further, saying that anyone who drinks of Him will have the flow of the rivers of the water of life
One river is the river of peace, and other rivers are joy, comfort, righteousness, life, holiness, love, patience, and humility
Acts 10:45 also speaks of the Spirit as a gift: 'On the Gentiles also the gift of the Holy Spirit had been poured out'
The firstfruit of the Spirit is simply the Spirit Himself as the firstfruit of the coming harvest of what God is to us
The cloud that covered the children of Israel typifies the Spirit of God being with the New Testament believers
Corinthians 10:4 says, 'All drank the same spiritual drink; for they drank of a spiritual rock which followed them, and the rock was Christ'
In our Christian life we should all drink the same spiritual drink; we should not drink anything other than the all-inclusive Spirit
The oil is simply of one single element, symbolizing that the Spirit of God was merely of the element of divinity
According to the type in Exodus 30, a hin of olive oil was compounded with four spices to produce the holy anointing oil, the holy ointment
Through a compounding process the oil became an ointment and was used to anoint the tabernacle and everything related to it
Before Exodus 30 this compound was 'not yet,' but after Exodus 30 such an ointment was definitely in existence
Before Christ was crucified, resurrected, and glorified, the Spirit as the all-inclusive life-giving Spirit was not yet
In this compound ointment we have the Triune God signified by the numbers one and three and humanity signified by the number four
We also have the death of Christ the effectiveness of Christs death the power of Christs resurrection and the flavor of His resurrection
In the compound Spirit there are many items: divinity, humanity, the effectiveness of Christ's death, and the power of Christ's resurrection
John 2:20 says that we have an anointing from the Holy One, and verse 27 says that this anointing abides in us
Because we have been attached by God to Christ, the anointed One, we are spontaneously anointed with Him by God
Through that anointing Christ has received the ointment, and eventually He, the anointed One, became the anointing One
God's intention is to work Himself into us as our life and our everything to make us His counterpart for His expression
In order to accomplish this it was necessary for God to pass through the process of incarnation human living crucifixion and resurrection
Today we all are under the anointing of the compound Spirit with Christs divinity humanity allinclusive death and wonderful resurrection
Corinthians 122 says that God has sealed us and Ephesians 113 and 430 tell us that as believers we have been sealed with the Holy Spirit
At the time we were saved God put His Holy Spirit into us as a seal to mark us out, indicating that we belonged to God
The Holy Spirit, who is God Himself entering into us, causes us to bear God's image signified by the seal, thus making us like God
We need the Spirit as both the seal and the pledge because in God's work on us two kinds of inheritances are involved
As those who are to inherit God, we have the Holy Spirit as a pledge, guarantee, earnest, and down payment of our inheritance
The Spirit of the living God is the heavenly ink used by the apostles in writing living letters that convey Christ
In Revelation 4:5 the Spirit is symbolized by the seven lamps of fire burning before God's throne, which are the seven Spirits of God
The seven lamps of fire which are the seven Spirits of God signify the enlightening and searching of the sevenfold intensified Spirit of God
God will touch the earth by the seven lamps, by His seven Spirits, which are burning, shining, observing, searching, and judging
In Exodus 25 and Zechariah 4 the seven lamps, signifying the enlightening of the Spirit of God in God's move, are for God's building
In Revelation 4:5 the seven lamps are for God's judgment, which will issue in the building of the New Jerusalem
While God executes His judgment His sevenfold intensified Spirit will carry out His eternal building by searching enlightening and judging
The seven lamps of fire burning before the throne of God are for enlightening, searching, exposing, judging, and burning
Today, God is administrating His government by means of enlightening, searching, exposing, judging, and burning
Any fleshly work, work done in the name of the Lord but actually having nothing to do with Him, will be burned
Everything that is not of God or according to God will be counted by God as wood, grass, and stubble, and it will be burned by fire
The lamps are for enlightening and burning; the eyes are both for watching and observing and also for infusing and transfusing
As the redeeming Lamb, Christ has seven watching and observing eyes for the carrying out of God's administration
These seven eyes are also transfusing all that the Lamb is into our being so that we may become the same as He
The seven eyes of Christ, which are the seven Spirits of God, are Christ's expression in God's move for God's building
In the New Testament physical life and psychological life are indicated by the Greek words bias and psuche respectively
Eternal life is neither temporary nor limited; rather it is everlasting with respect to time and unlimited with respect to space
Life originally is in the Father, in the Son it is manifested among man, and as the Spirit it enters into man for man to experience
According to Romans 8:11, He who raised Christ Jesus from among the dead gives life to our mortal bodies through the indwelling Spirit
Life is imparted into us in a threefold way: our spirit becomes life, our mind becomes life, and life is imparted to our mortal bodies
Because the Spirit has the attribute of love, the more we are under His dispensing, the more genuine love we have
The more the Spirit is dispensed into us, the more we become love in the sense of being constituted of the divine love
Thessalonians 1:6 tells us that the believers 'accepted the word in much affliction with joy of the Holy Spirit'
In the universe there is only one nature that is absolutely different from all other things, and this is the nature of God
To have holiness is to have the element, and to undergo sanctification is to be in the process of being made holy
Sanctification may also denote the practical effect produced, the character and activity, and the resultant state of being sanctified to God
When this Spirit enters into our spirit and remains there as the essence of holiness, there is in our spirit a condition of holiness
By this we are thoroughly saved from all old and negative things and made a new creation to obtain the Lord's glory
In Romans 15:16 Paul says, that 'the offering of the nations might be acceptable, having been sanctified in the Holy Spirit'
Reality is the allinclusive attribute of the Spirit of God for it includes the Father Christ the Son and all the divine items and entities
Apart from the Spirit of reality, in our experience we cannot have the Trinity or any of the divine attributes
The purpose of His going was for Him to have a change in form, a change from the form of the flesh to the form of the Spirit
Before the Holy Spirit in power descended upon Him, He already had the Holy Spirit within Him essentially for His living
The Lord Jesus had the Holy Spirit both essentially as life for His living and economically as power for His ministry
Acts 18 is another verse that speaks of the economical power of the Spirit You shall receive power when the Holy Spirit has come upon you
The Holy Spirit was breathed into the disciples on the day of Christ's resurrection to be the Spirit of life to them essentially
The coming of the Holy Spirit to John the Baptist was the first instance of the Spirit's coming to God's people in the New Testament
As the cloud overshadowed the Mount of Transfiguration and the tabernacle , the power of the Most High overshadowed Mary
It seems that, according to Luke 1:35, the Holy Spirit was only upon Mary as the power for her to conceive the Holy Child
The Spirit came to Mary, overshadowing her, in such a way that something of the Holy Spirit was begotten in her
Concerning the conceiving of the Godman Luke 135 speaks of the Holy Spirit coming upon Mary and the power of the Most High overshadowing her
Matthew 118 and 20 tell us that Mary was found having in womb out of the Holy Spirit and the thing begotten in her is out of the Holy Spirit
When He came forth at the age of thirty to minister and work for God, He needed the Spirit as His power economically
Before the Holy Spirit in power descended upon the Lord Jesus, He already had the Holy Spirit in essence from His birth
He was constituted of the Holy Spirit as the intrinsic essence of His being when He was conceived in the womb of the virgin Mary
It is crucial for us to see these two aspects of the coming of the Spirit to Jesus Christ-the essential aspect and the economical aspect
During the transitional period between His incarnation and resurrection, the Lord Jesus was the unique one to minister by the Holy Spirit
Elizabeth's blessing by the Holy Spirit reveals Christ's humanity as the fruit of Mary's womb and His deity as the Lord
In verse 68 Zachariah says, 'Blessed be the Lord, the God of Israel, because He has visited and accomplished redemption for His people'
Finally, during this transitional period the Spirit came to Simeon, being upon him and filling him economically
It was communicated to him by the Holy Spirit that he would not see death before he should see the Lord's Christ
The first Comforter, Jesus, asked the Father to send the second Comforter, the Spirit of reality of the first Comforter
Having been sent by both the Father and the Son, the Spirit was sent with the Father and in the name of the Son
The one sent-the Spirit-was actually sent as two because He was sent in the name of the Son and thus as the Son
The phrase 'in My name' in John 14:26 modifies both the Father who sent the Spirit and the Spirit who was sent
Since the Spirit as the one sent is one with the Son and the Son is the sender, the Spirit must also be the sender
The fact that both the Father and the Son have given the Spirit is a strong proof that the Son and the Father are one
The word 'immeasurable' denotes not only the sphere of the Spirit but also the content and nature of the Spirit
The immeasurable Spirit is actually the all-inclusive compound Spirit typified by the compound ointment in Exodus 30:23-25
The immeasurable Spirit as the all-inclusive compound Spirit is not simply the Spirit of power or the Spirit of life
Concerning the giving of the Spirit to the New Testament believers, the Son as the last Adam became the life-giving Spirit
The point here is that whereas the Triune God was raw before incarnation, through incarnation He began to enter into a process
The process through which the Triune God passed to become the life-giving Spirit is an economical, not essential, matter
In Hebrews 13:8, a verse written after Christ's incarnation and resurrection, the word 'yesterday' counts from the day of His resurrection
Now this Spirit is the life-giving Spirit, who is the ultimate consummation of the processed Triune God reaching us
After the Lord Jesus accomplished all of His processes, He became the life-giving Spirit, and the life-giving Spirit is the pneumatic Christ
Such a One, the pneumatic Christ as the Spirit, came to His disciples and breathed Himself as the Spirit into them
From that time onward He was truly one with His disciples, for He became the intrinsic being of His disciples essentially
The blessing of the gospel is the all-inclusive Spirit as the ultimate consummation of the processed Triune God supplied to us
We know that we have received this blessing because we have the realization that the life-giving Spirit is within us
The physical aspect of the blessing God promised to Abraham was the good land , which was a type of the all-inclusive Christ
The Spirit as the realization of Christ in our experience is the good land as the source of God's bountiful supply for us to enjoy
We have considered nine aspects of the coming of the Spirit to the New Testament believers essentially for their spiritual life and being
Finally, in His ascension Christ received the economical Spirit from the Father and poured out this Spirit upon the believers
The exalted Christ's receiving of the promise of the Holy Spirit was actually the receiving of the Holy Spirit Himself
In particular, the Spirit communicated to Simeon that 'he would not see death before he should see the Lord's Christ'
Through the overshadowing of the Holy Spirit the divine essence was generated in Marys womb so that she was with child of the Holy Spirit
When the Spirit entered in through the womb of Mary, that was the essence of God the Father entering into the virgin
When Christ came out to minister, the Holy Spirit descended upon Him and abode upon Him as the economical power for His work
The Lord had been born of the Spirit, the Spirit was one of the essences of His being, and He had the Holy Spirit within Him
At the time of His baptism the Holy Spirit came upon Him economically, and this economical Spirit abode upon Him
After being baptized in water and anointed with the Spirit of God, Jesus, as a man, moved according to the leading of the Spirit
The Spirit led the Lord Jesus concerning where He should go, what He should do, what He should speak, and whom He should contact
When the Spirit discloses what the Son is to the believers and makes Him real to them in their life, the Son is glorified
In particular, as the context of John 15 reveals, the Spirit of reality testifies concerning the Son as the vine
God is manifested in our flesh, but this needs to be verified, justified, and vindicated by the all-inclusive Spirit
Although the church is still in the flesh, the church is such a manifestation of God, a manifestation that is vindicated by the Holy Spirit
In actuality only when we live in the allinclusive Spirit is there the vindication and verification that God is manifested in us the church
Because Christ's redemption is eternal, it surpasses time and space; it is everlasting in time and all-prevailing in space
The accomplishment of His death covers all the believing Old Testament saints and all the New Testament believers
Whoever believes in Christ has the eternal redemption, accomplished through the eternal Spirit, applied to him
Because we are partakers of the Spirit, we are also partakers of the unique offering, partakers of eternal redemption
Whatever the Lord Jesus accomplished and experienced in His living, labor, and work has been made eternal by the eternal Spirit
We need to be deeply impressed that Christ first filled His believers essentially and later poured out the Spirit upon them economically
Acts 1:2 says that the resurrected Christ gave 'command through the Holy Spirit to the apostles whom He chose'
The resurrected Christ has become the life-giving Spirit, yet in resurrection He still did things through the Holy Spirit
Finally, the Spirit was the means for Christ, as the Head of the Body, to baptize all His believers into His Body
By these two steps, these two instances, Christ, the Head of the Body, baptized His entire Body into the Spirit once for all
Rather, He is always one with the Spirit, and the Spirit is His means for His living the divine life and for doing everything
We have covered the Spirit's work on John the Baptist, on the saints in the transitional period, and in Christ
Sin entered through Adam , righteousness is the resurrected Christ , and judgment is for Satan, who is the author and source of sin
Sinners, who are born in Adam, must believe in the resurrected Christ so that they may have Him as their righteousness
When the gospel is preached in a proper way, those who hear should have the desire not to remain in Adam but to be transferred into Christ
To them the convicting Spirit will become the regenerating Spirit , the Spirit of life , and the Spirit of reality, dwelling within them
Now we can be filled and saturated with the Triune God, who is dispensing Himself into us and mingling Himself with us
Although the Spirit works on the believers as well as in them the main part of His work is in the believers and only a small part is on them
Just as the Holy Spirit worked mainly in Christ and not on Him, so the Spirit works mainly in the believers and not on them
In Luke 15:8-9 the Spirit is likened to a woman finding a lost coin by lighting a lamp, sweeping the house, and seeking the coin carefully
Just as human generation is a matter of human dispensing, so divine regeneration is a matter of divine dispensing
As believers, regenerated ones, our nature and life are God Himself, not God in Himself but God in His dispensing
The Spirit in verse 6 is the divine Spirit, the Holy Spirit of God, and the spirit is the human spirit, the regenerated spirit of man
Once our spirit has been born of the Spirit of God with the life of God, it has the Spirit with the divine life in it and mingled with it
The main work the Spirit does in regeneration is to impart the divine life, the eternal, uncreated life of God, into us
When we receive Him as the crucified and resurrected Savior, the Spirit who gives life comes into us to impart eternal life to us
Because we are the old creation, we need not only regeneration but also the renewing of the Spirit that follows regeneration
Daily we should cooperate with the renewing work of the Spirit so that the process of His renewing within us may be speeded up
Titus 3:5 says, 'According to His mercy, He saved us, through the washing of regeneration and renewing of the Holy Spirit'
We see that God's salvation is through a certain action: the washing of regeneration and renewing of the Holy Spirit
In this is a passage from the old state we were in into a wholly new one, from the old creation into the status of a new creation
As long as a particular life exists and is free, it can naturally develop its characteristics and manifest its abilities
The law of the Spirit of life is nothing less than the processed Triune God becoming the life-giving Spirit to dwell within us
He is a law operating within us, working not merely as the mighty God but as a law that operates automatically
In the same principle, if the Triune God had remained outside of us, He could not be to us the law of the Spirit of life
Because the Triune God has been processed and dispensed into us and now dwells in us, He has become to us the law of the Spirit of life
As the Spirit works in this way, the Triune God is dispensed into our entire tripartite being, into our spirit, soul, and body
Through the working of the Spirit by His law of life the riches of the divine life are being dispensed into us
If we contact the Lord when we are physically weak or sick, the Spirit will dispense the divine life into our weak and sick bodies
Gradually, through the Spirit's giving life to our mortal bodies, we are healed, perhaps without being aware of it
If by the Spirit we put to death the practices of the body-that is, mortify or crucify them-we shall live in spirit
Paul's word in Romans 8:13 corresponds to verse 6, which says that the mind set on the flesh is death and the mind set on the spirit is life
In order to put to death the practices of the body by the Spirit, we need to set our mind on the spirit and walk according to spirit
The genuine experience of the co-crucifixion with Christ is in our putting to death by the Spirit the practices of the body
If we walk according to spirit and set our mind on the spirit, spontaneously we shall by the Spirit put to death the practices of the body
We shall be absolutely under the divine dispensing, and we shall participate in this rich dispensing and enjoy it
If we put to death the practices of the body by the Spirit, we shall automatically be in the Body of Christ in a practical way
If we do not by the Spirit put to death the practices of the body, our body cannot be presented to the Lord for the Body life
In order to have our body presented to God for the Body of Christ, we need to put to death by the Spirit the practices of the body
The choragus supplied all the needs of everyone in the chorus, the needs for food, clothing, lodging, and musical instruments
In using the expression 'the bountiful supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ,' Paul likens the supply of the Spirit to that of the choragus
By calling on the Lord's name or by praying over even a few words in the Bible, we enjoy the Spirit with His bountiful supply
It is significant that in Philippians 1:19 Paul speaks first of the saints' petition, then of the bountiful supply of the Spirit
The reason Paul speaks this way is to indicate that the bountiful supply of the compound Spirit is upon the Body of Christ
If the Body would be exercised to supply him, the bountiful supply of the Spirit would come to him through the Body
If we are not in the Body or if we do not care for God's service, it will be very difficult for us to partake of the supply of the Spirit
To enjoy the Spirit we need to be part of the tabernacle and of the priesthood, part of God's dwelling and of His service
Spontaneously we shall be anointed with the compound Spirit and enjoy the bountiful supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ
The Spirit's leading is an issue of the inner life; it comes from the sense of life, from the consciousness of the divine life within us
By this sense and consciousness we know the life within us and by this sense of life we can know that we are under the leading of the Spirit
The leading of the Spirit does not depend on outward things; it depends absolutely on the sense of life within our spirit
The divine life leads us constantly, not by signs or indicators but by giving us an inner sense or consciousness
Because we have the life of God, we have the leading that issues from this life, the leading which indicates that we are sons of God
The leading of the Spirit which Paul speaks of in Romans 8:14 comes as we walk according to the spirit and set our mind on the spirit
Because the leading of the Spirit is a matter of life, it should continue normally in every aspect of our daily walk
We may be God's children, but we do not have the growth that comes by living and walking according to the leading of the Spirit in life
As long as we have the witness of the Spirit with our spirit, we have the assurance that we are children of God
Through the various aspects of the Spirit's work which we have covered thus far, the believers are washed, sanctified, and justified
We are washed from sinful things; second, we are sanctified, separated, unto God; and third, we are justified, accepted, by God
According to chapters fourteen, fifteen, and sixteen of the Gospel of John, the name cannot be separated from the Spirit
The work of the Spirit in washing, sanctifying, and justifying us is actually the dispensing of the Spirit into us
The Spirit dispenses His element into us, and this dispensing of the Spirit is the washing, sanctifying, and justifying work of the Spirit
All day long the Spirit is sanctifying us, applying to us what the Father has planned and what the Son has accomplished
Without the sanctification of the Spirit, there would be no way to apply what the Father and the Son have done for us
By this we are thoroughly saved from all old and negative things and made a new creation to obtain the Lord's glory
The sequence is this: God's selection, the Spirit's sanctification, justification, and then subjective sanctification
In time the Spirit came to us to sanctify us, to set us apart from the world, so that we would obey Christ's redemption
In the third parable the prodigal son eventually comes to himself, that is, wakes up, and decides to return to his father
The waking up of the prodigal son in the third parable is the result of the searching of the woman in the second parable
Even before we believed and repented, the Spirit did His sanctifying work to separate us to God and to bring us to repentance
The divine foreknowledge was exercised, and the sanctification of the Spirit followed unto the obedience of faith in Christ
Sanctification brought us to the sprinkling of the blood shed by the Savior on the cross and separated us unto this divine provision
From that time onward, the Spirit has been separating us and saturating us by dispensing the Triune God into us
No matter how experienced we may be in the spiritual life, this process of life imparting must still go on within us
We need to be impressed with the fact that the work of the Spirit in the believers subjectively is for the divine dispensing
Whatever the Spirit does in us is for the dispensing into our being of the Triune God in His life, nature, element, and essence
In the two previous messages we have covered twelve aspects of the work of the Spirit in the believers for the divine dispensing
As we behold and reflect the glory of the Lord, He infuses us with the elements of what He is and what He has done
The result is that we are being transformed metabolically to have His life shape by His life power with His life essence
We are being conformed to the image of the resurrected and glorified Christ ; we are being made the same as He is
The Spirit's work in transforming us involves a change in our whole being-in life, nature, essence, element, form, and appearance
Transformation is not outward change, correction, or adjustment; transformation is altogether an inward, metabolic change of our being
In order for the Spirit to do His transforming work in us, there is the need for a certain essence to be dispensed into us by the Spirit
As the Spirit works to transform us by the divine dispensing, He causes a metabolic, organic change to take place in our whole being
The purpose of sanctification is to separate us from being common unto God for His purpose that we may fulfill His plan
Although sanctification involves separation unto God for His purpose, there is still the need for a metabolic change in our being
Transformation is the changing aspect of sanctification, and sanctification is the separating aspect of transformation
Sanctification and transformation go together: transformation depends on sanctification, and sanctification works for transformation
The purpose of the Spirit's indwelling is to dispense life, which is actually God Himself, into the three parts of our being
In 619 he asks Do you not know that your body is a temple of the Holy Spirit who is in you whom you have from God and you are not your own
In these verses we have two kinds of templesthe corporate temple the church and individual temples which are the believers physical bodies
Both kinds of temples are for the Spirit's indwelling so that He may dispense the Triune God into us individually and corporately
According to 1 and 2 Timothy, this deposit consists of healthy teachings concerning God's economy, God's plan to dispense Himself into us
Timothy had received these teachings as a deposit, and Paul charged him to guard this deposit through the indwelling Holy Spirit
Since the Holy Spirit dwells in our spirit, to guard the good deposit through the Holy Spirit requires us to exercise our spirit
Finally, James 4:5 says, 'Do you think that the Scripture says in vain: The Spirit who dwells in us longs to envy'?
The indwelling Spirit makes His home in us so that He may occupy our entire being for God and cause us to be wholly for our Husband
He is given without measure by the Christ who is above all, who inherits all, and who is to be increased universally
Whenever the New Testament mentions the Spirit, it refers to the all-inclusive compound, life-giving, indwelling Spirit
The words 'in this' mean in the fact that God has given us of His Spirit we know that we abide in Him and He in us
The abiding Spirit, that is, the indwelling Spirit, is the element and sphere of the mutual abiding, the mutual indwelling, of us and God
To abide in God is to dwell in Him, remaining in our fellowship with Him, that we may experience and enjoy His abiding in us
Out of His Spirit' is an expression which implies that the Spirit of God, whom He has given to us, is bountiful and without measure
By such a bountiful immeasurable Spirit we know with full assurance that we are one with God and that we abide in Him and He in us
According to its usage in Acts, pleroo denotes to fill a vessel within, as the wind filled the house inwardly in 2:2
Acts 6:3 says, 'Select seven well-attested men from among you, full of the Spirit and of wisdom, whom we shall appoint over this need'
Full of the Spirit' is one's condition after being filled with the Spirit inwardly and essentially, as mentioned in 13:52
As in the other verses from Acts we have considered, this refers to a believer's condition after being filled with the Spirit essentially
Luke 12:12 speaks of the Spirit's work in teaching the believers: 'The Holy Spirit will teach you in the same hour what should be said'
In particular, the Spirit's teaching of the believers here refers to His teaching them what to say during persecution
In verse 20 He goes on to say, 'You are not the ones speaking, but the Spirit of your Father is the One speaking in you'
The Lord's word in verse 20 corresponds to that in Luke 12:12, where He says that the Spirit will teach us what to say
We should face opposition and confront attack not in ourselves, but by turning to our spirit where the Spirit of God dwells
The Spirit of reality guides us into the reality of justification, holiness, love, and all other divine things
What the Father has becomes the Son's, what the Son has is received by the Spirit, and what the Spirit receives is disclosed to us
The Father is embodied in the Son, the Son is transfigured to be the Spirit, and the Spirit is the reaching of the divine Trinity to us
Now the indwelling Spirit is guiding the believers not into the doctrine of the Triune God but into the reality of the Triune God
As the Spirit works in the believers, He searches and reveals to them all things concerning Christ-the depths of God
Corinthians 2:10 says, 'God has revealed them to us through the Spirit; for the Spirit searches all things, even the depths of God'
The Greek word rendered 'searches' includes active research and implies accurate knowledge not in discovering but in exploring
The Spirit of God explores the depths of God concerning Christ and shows them to us in our spirit for our realization and participation
Christ is the center of God's economy, the portion given to us by God for enjoyment, and the mysterious wisdom hidden in God
If we would know Christ as the depths of God, we need to know that through incarnation God became a man named Jesus
Now, in resurrection, He is the life-giving Spirit who indwells our spirit and who has become one spirit with us
The Greek word rendered 'communicating' literally means mixing or putting together, as interpreting or expounding
The stress is not on the person to whom the speaking is done but on the means by which the spiritual things are spoken
In 1 Corinthians 2:13 Paul says that he did not speak the spiritual things in words taught by human wisdom but in words taught by the Spirit
Spiritual things are both the things given to us by God concerning Christ as our portion and also the words taught by the Spirit of God
When the prophets spoke for God in Old Testament times, the word of the Lord came to them and enabled them to speak on God's behalf
The reason Paul does not use such an expression is that the apostles' teaching in the New Testament is based on the principle of incarnation
All these words indicate the New Testament principle of incarnation, that is, God and man, man and God, becoming one
Genuine comfort, therefore, involves the divine dispensing, the dispensing of the riches of the Triune God into our being
Romans 14:17 says, 'The kingdom of God is not eating and drinking, but righteousness and peace and joy in the Holy Spirit'
Thessalonians 1:6 tells us that the believers 'accepted the word in much affliction with joy of the Holy Spirit'
In these verses the Spirit is revealed as the source, the element, and the sphere of the believers' love toward all the saints in Christ
Romans 5:5 says, 'The love of God has been poured out in our hearts through the Holy Spirit who has been given to us'
From the day we first called on the Lord Jesus, the love of God has been poured out into our hearts through the Holy Spirit
Through the work of the indwelling Spirit we realize afresh that God loves us and that His love has been poured out into our hearts
The best way to be filled with the Holy Spirit is first to make a thorough confession of our sins, failures, and weaknesses
If we do this, the Holy Spirit will pour out God's love into our hearts, and we shall be filled with the Spirit
Vincent says, 'Spirit of faith: not distinctly the Holy Spirit, nor, on the other hand, a human faculty or disposition, but blending both'
If we do this, we shall have the spirit of faith, for the indwelling Spirit will be mingled with our spirit in our faith
In this message we shall cover the remaining aspects of the Spirit's work in the believers in the inner-life-working stage
When the Father works in us, He works through the Spirit, and the Spirit's working in us is the Father's working
It is our spirit regenerated by the Spirit of God , indwelt by the Spirit of God , and mingled with the Spirit of God
Through the Spirit the Father strengthens us into the inner man that Christ may make His home in our hearts through faith
Our heart is composed of all the parts of our soul-the mind, the emotion, and the will-plus our conscience, the main part of our spirit
According to the context of chapter five the Spirit in 516 must be the Holy Spirit who dwells in our regenerated spirit and mingles with it
Paul even had the confidence to say that if we walk by the Spirit, we shall by no means fulfill the lust of the flesh
To walk by the Spirit is to have our practical living and acts in our daily life guided and ruled by the Spirit
The Greek word for walk in verse 16, peripateo, means to have our being, to deport ourselves, to order our manner of life, to walk about
The various aspects of the fruit of the Spirit mentioned in these verses are not unusual things; they are aspects of our ordinary daily life
The Greek word for walk in verse 25, stoicheo, means to march in military rank by keeping step, that is, to walk orderly
It is the verbal form of stoicheion, element; hence, it can be translated 'to observe the elements,' 'to walk according to the elements'
In the second walk we need to walk like an army and keep in step, whereas in the first kind of walk we are free to walk about
We must have the second kind of walk, a walk to fulfill God's purpose and to reach the goal of our life on earth
The flesh lusts against the Spirit for its own desire, and the Spirit fights against the flesh for God's purpose
The fruit of the Spirit, as different expressions of the Spirit who is life within us, is listed here with only nine items as illustrations
It has more items, including lowliness , compassion , godliness , righteousness , holiness , purity , and other virtues
Both in Ephesians 4:2 and Colossians 3:12 lowliness is mentioned as a virtue other than meekness, which is listed here
In Matthew 5:5-9 righteousness, mercy, and purity are reckoned with meekness and peace as the condition of the reality of the kingdom today
After listing nine aspects of the fruit of the Spirit, Paul declares that 'against such things there is no law'
The fact that Paul spoke of 'such things' indicates that there are many more aspects than the nine he uses as illustrations
Whenever we would not be solely for Him but would love the world, this indwelling Spirit will not only be offended but also envious
God as the indwelling Spirit is our Husband and He longs to envy when He sees that we love something, someone, or some matter other than Him
The indwelling Spirit works within us to separate us from everything other than God and to keep us for God Himself
The Spirit works in this way that we may receive the unique dispensing of the Triune God into us for our transformation
The indwelling Spirit is the sword for the believers to fight against their spiritual enemies, the power of darkness and the evil things
The Greek word for 'word' in Ephesians 6:17 is rhema, the instant word spoken at the moment by the Spirit in any situation
The Spirit is the word of God and such a Spirit is a sword a weapon for us to fight the battle against Gods enemy to bring in His kingdom
By praying with the Scriptures in this way, the Spirit within us becomes the sword by which we slay all negative things
In Ephesians 4:30 Paul says, 'Do not grieve the Holy Spirit of God, in whom you were sealed unto the day of redemption'
A proper life according to truth and in grace will always make the Holy Spirit happy and give us the joy of the Spirit
We have been sealed with the Holy Spirit, and this sealing will continue to take place unto the day of redemption
Day by day the divine element is being added into us, and the divine mark within us is being made more evident
Eventually, this sealing will bring us into the redemption of our body, which will be the transfiguration of our body
Ephesians 4:30 tells us not to grieve the Holy Spirit of God, which means to make Him unhappy by disobeying Him
Of grieving, quenching, or insulting the Spirit, we should experience the Spirit as the totality of the Triune God for our enjoyment
The first stage has twelve aspects, from enlightening, sanctification, and regeneration through sanctification
The second stage which we have called the innerlifeworking stage has twentyfive aspects from transformation through not insulting the Spirit
For this reason, 2 Corinthians 13:14 speaks of the grace of the Lord Jesus Christ, the love of God, and the fellowship of the Holy Spirit
The Spirit is the fellowship between the Triune God and the believers and also the fellowship the believers have with one another
The element of each of the twenty-five aspects of the third stage of the Spirit's work in us is the fellowship of the Holy Spirit
According to Jude 20, if we would build up ourselves in our most holy faith, we need to pray in the Holy Spirit
We should keep ourselves in the love of God by building up ourselves in our holy faith and praying in the Holy Spirit
In this way we await the mercy of our Lord that we may not only enjoy eternal life in this age but inherit it for eternity
Because we aim at this goal, we want to be kept in the love of God, pray in the Holy Spirit, and await the mercy of our Lord
The indwelling Spirit works in us to help us in our weakness, especially in our weakness in praying to have fellowship with the Triune God
We should not think that the Spirit is so different from us that when we receive the Spirit we shall be extraordinary people
The interceding Spirit helps us, sympathizes with us, sustains us, comforts us, and supports us by interceding for us
He who searches the hearts knows what is the mind of the Spirit, because He intercedes for the saints according to God'
The Spirit's mind is one with our mind, and this mingled heart, this mingled mind, becomes a part of our spirit
As a result, there was within Timothy a good deposit, a deposit that he was to guard by means of the indwelling Holy Spirit
God's life, God's Spirit, and all the precious truths we have seen in the Lord's recovery have been deposited into our being
If we neglect the Spirit and walk in the flesh and according to our mind, we shall be the same as the nations, who are apart from God
If this is our situation, there will not be any guarding of the good things that have been deposited into our being
Because the Holy Spirit dwells in our spirit, guarding the good deposit through the Holy Spirit requires that we exercise our spirit
To sow unto the Spirit is to sow for the Spirit, with the aim of the Spirit, accomplishing what the Spirit desires
Corruption is of the flesh, indicating that the flesh is corrupted; eternal life is of the Spirit and is the Spirit Himself
It is crucial for us to realize that the Christian walk must be a walk by the Spirit and a life of sowing unto the Spirit
Even a word uttered by us contains seeds that will land in a particular soil, grow, and produce a harvest that we shall reap
Paul charges us to sow unto the Spirit, to live unto the Spirit, to say and do everything with a view to the Spirit
In this message we shall cover more aspects of the third stage of the Spirit's work in the believers for the divine dispensing
John 4:2 says, 'In this you know the Spirit of God: every spirit which confesses Jesus Christ having come in the flesh is out of God'
To confess Jesus Christ coming in the flesh is to confess that He was divinely conceived to be born as the Son of God
If Christ had not become a genuine man, He could not have had human blood to shed for the redemption of human beings
The New Testament makes it emphatically clear that Christ's redemption was accomplished in His human body and by the shedding of His blood
According to the revelation of the Trinity in the New Testament, the Son came in the flesh with the Father and in the name of the Father
In the light of this we see the crucial importance of the Spirit's work in the believers to confess that Jesus Christ has come in the flesh
In our fellowship with the divine Trinity the third, the Spirit, confesses, testifies, that the second, who is our Savior, is still a man
By these three God has testified that Jesus is His Son given to us so that in Him we may receive His eternal life by believing in His name
John 5:7 and 8 say, 'Because there are three who testify, the Spirit and the water and the blood, and the three are for the one'
For the one' also means unto the one, that is, unto the one thing, the one point or purpose in their testimony
In verses 7 and 8 we are told clearly that there are three who testify, and that these three are the Spirit, the water, and the blood
The water of baptism terminates the old creation, and the blood shed on the cross redeems whatever God has chosen of the old creation
It is in the divine fellowship that we through the Spirit as the means take Christ as our righteousness by faith
As we enjoy Christ in fellowship with the Triune God, we realize that every day, even every moment, Christ is our righteousness
In order to have the proper enjoyment of Christ, we need the Spirit as the all-inclusive land and faith as the means to enjoy this land
When our spirit witnesses, that is also the witnessing of the Spirit, for the two spirits have been mingled together as one
The work of the indwelling Spirit in witnessing with our spirit that we are children of God is also a matter of the divine fellowship
According to grammar, the subject of crying in Romans 8:15 is 'we,' but in Galatians 4:6 the subject of crying is 'the Spirit'
Abba' is an Aramaic word, thus a Hebrew word, which means father, and 'Father' is the translation of the Greek word pater
Such an affectionate cry implies an intimate relationship in life between a genuine son and a begetting father
When these two terms Abba and Father are put together, the result is a deep, sweet sense, a sense that is exquisitely intimate
If we do something wrong or are on the wrong standing, the Spirit in our conscience will witness to us in a negative way
We have seen that in the third stage of the Spirit's work in the believers the Spirit works to maintain our fellowship with the Triune God
By applying Himself to us in this way, the compound Spirit teaches us concerning the Triune God and His activities
Only through the Triune God becoming the anointing Spirit can we be taught concerning the Triune God and His activities
We should practice this abiding according to the teaching of the all-inclusive anointing so that our fellowship with God may be maintained
Ephesians 4:30 says, 'Do not grieve the Holy Spirit of God, in whom you were sealed unto the day of redemption'
When we were saved, God put His Holy Spirit into us as a seal to mark us out, indicating that we belong to God
We have a sealing, the saturating, of the Holy Spirit, within us, and this sealing will continue until the day our body is fully saturated
The Greek word rendered pledge also means a foretaste guarantee token payment guaranteeing the full payment a partial payment in advance
Corinthians 5:5 says, 'He who has wrought us for this very thing is God, who has given to us the pledge of the Spirit'
God has wrought fashioned shaped prepared made us fit for the very purpose that our mortal body may be swallowed up by His resurrection life
He has placed Himself as the life-giving Spirit into our spirit to guarantee that one day He will clothe us with a body of resurrection
The pledge of the Spirit is not merely a once-for-all matter, for the Spirit is continually pledging within us
We need both the sealing and the pledging of the Spirit because in God's work on us two kinds of inheritances are involved
Ephesians 1:14 says that the Holy Spirit is the pledge of our inheritance 'unto the redemption of the acquired possession'
The redemption here refers to the redemption of our body , that is, the transfiguration of our body of humiliation into a glorious one
Within us we have the Spirit of God for our enjoyment and this enjoyment is the foretaste and guarantee that we shall have the full taste
The firstfruit of the Spirit is not the foretaste of the coming age but the firstfruit of the rich God to be our portion
The foretaste of the coming age is a taste of outward things, but the firstfruit is the foretaste of the processed Triune God Himself
The Holy Spirit, the all-inclusive Spirit, is the firstfruit of all the riches of God's being for our enjoyment
The Father is the source who planned all things, and the Son is the means, the course, who accomplished the Father's purpose
Christ became the channel in which and by which God enlivened us, raised us up, and seated us in the heavenlies
The Father came to us through the Son in the Spirit, and now the Spirit brings us back to the Father through the Son
In this message we shall cover the remaining aspects of the third stage of the Spirit's work in the believers for the divine dispensing
Hebrews does not say that we are partakers of the all-inclusive Christ but that we are partakers of the Holy Spirit
The reaching of the Triune God is the Spirit, and this Spirit is the reality of the new covenant, which is superior to the old covenant
Eventually, the Spirit is the fellowship, the participation in the enjoyment, of the Triune God to the believers
We have the grace of Christ, the love of God, and the fellowship of the Holy Spirit-the full enjoyment of the Triune God
In this fellowship we enjoy the rich elements of the Triune God, which are the elements for our transformation
We need to be impressed with the fact that in 2 Corinthians 13:14 love, grace, and fellowship are not three separate matters
Love is the source, grace is the expression of the source, and fellowship is the transmission of the expression
While we enjoy the fellowship of the Spirit, we also have the grace of the Lord Jesus Christ and the love of God
Just as the Father, the Son, and the Spirit are not three Gods, so love, grace, and fellowship are three aspects of one thing
We should not think that we successively enjoy the love of the Father, the grace of the Son, and the fellowship of the Spirit
It is revealed or mentioned in regard to the relationship of God with man, especially with His chosen and redeemed people
At the beginning of the Lord's ministry on earth, the Father anointed the Son with the Spirit for reaching men and bringing them back to Him
Such an enjoyment of the Triune God is possible through the Spirit's work in the believers to be the fellowship of the Triune God to them
Unity is formed by many people coming together, whereas oneness is the one entity of the Spirit within the believers making them all one
If we talk about oneness but neglect the Spirit, this indicates that we regard oneness as something separate from the Spirit
In Ephesians 4:4 Paul continues, 'One Body and one Spirit, as also you were called in one hope of your calling'
The Body is mentioned before the Spirit because the oneness among us is related to the Body and is for the Body
Eventually, because the Body is the constitution of the one Spirit, we can say that the Body is one with the Spirit
The Jews were under the bondage of circumcision, the bondage of dietary regulations, and the bondage of the Sabbath
Today, however, is not the age of Moses and of the law in letters, but the age of the Lord Jesus being the Spirit, the pneumatic Christ
Moses, with the letter of the law, put the people under bondage, but with Christ there is no bondage to the law
Formerly we were under bondage to the letters of the law, but now the life-giving Spirit frees us from this bondage
The first tabernacle, the Holy Place, signifies the old covenant, and the second tabernacle, the Holy of Holies, signifies the new covenant
We do not need to remain in the Holy Place in the old covenant in the soul we must enter the Holy of Holies the new covenant in the spirit
The writer's concept is that the Holy of Holies and the new covenant are one; the Holy of Holies is the new covenant
When we come into the Holy of Holies we come into the new covenant and when we come into the new covenant we enter into the Holy of Holies
The Holy Spirit tells us that when the old tabernacle still remained, the way to enter the Holy of Holies was not yet opened
Because we may still remember our sins, we need a supplement telling us that God will by no means remember our sins and lawlessnesses
When we are in the Holy of Holies, that is, when we are in the mingled spirit, we realize that there is such a thing as the law of life
Philippians 33 says We are the circumcision who serve by the Spirit of God and boast in Christ Jesus and have no confidence in the flesh
Those who are the circumcision here are the New Testament believers, the ones genuinely circumcised by Christ's crucifixion
The fact that the Judaizers had confidence in their circumcision was a sign that their confidence was in their flesh
Paul says strongly that we who believe in Christ serve by the Spirit of God, boast in Christ, and have no confidence in the flesh
Peter 4:14 says, 'If you are reproached in the name of Christ, you are blessed, because the Spirit of glory and of God rests upon you'
In the name of Christ' is actually in the person of Christ, in Christ Himself, because the name denotes the person
The believers, having believed into Christ , and having been baptized into His name , that is, into Himself , are in Christ and one with Him
When they are reproached in His name, they are reproached with Him, sharing His sufferings, in the fellowship of His sufferings
We should rejoice when we are reproached in the name of Christ, because the Spirit of glory is resting upon us
In this stage the work of the Spirit mainly concerns the church with the believers' gifts, functions, ministries, and work
Timothy 3:16 says, 'Confessedly, great is the mystery of godliness, who was manifested in the flesh, vindicated in the Spirit
In the church life we need the Spirit's vindicating, verifying, confirming, that what the church does is motivated by the Spirit
Only when we live in the all-inclusive Spirit do we have the vindication that God is manifested in us, the church
The mystery of godliness is the living of a proper church, and such a living is also the manifestation of God in the flesh
The Spirit works in the believers to vindicate, verify, confirm, that the church is the manifestation of God in the flesh
Matthew 2819 says Go therefore and disciple all the nations baptizing them into the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit
Now this Spirit is the consummation of the Triune God for the believers to be baptized into the divine Trinity
The visible aspect is the expression the testimony of the invisible aspect whereas the invisible aspect is the reality of the visible aspect
To baptize the believers into the name of the Triune God is to bring them into a spiritual and mystical union with Him
The Holy Spirit was breathed into the disciples on the day of the Lord's resurrection to be the Spirit of life to them essentially
Acts 10:44 says, 'While Peter was still speaking these words, the Holy Spirit fell upon all those hearing the word'
Acts 19:6 says, 'When Paul laid his hands on them, the Holy Spirit came upon them, and they spoke in tongues and prophesied'
The inward filling Spirit the essential Spirit is in the believers whereas the outward filling Spirit the economical Spirit is upon them
It was the third time for Him to experience the baptism in the Spirit by being outwardly filled with the Spirit
Before Ananias came, he was praying to the Lord , indicating he had believed in the Lord and was calling on Him
In Acts 9:17, after his conversion, Paul experienced the baptism in the Holy Spirit and was filled outwardly with the Spirit
The allinclusive consummated Spirit is the element the divine essence for the apostles to be the sufficient ministers of the new covenant
The apostles became ministers of the new covenant not by human knowledge or natural effort but by the Spirit as the constituting element
Only the Triune God as the all-inclusive Spirit constituted into us is sufficient to carry on the ministry of the new covenant
The letter which kills is the letter of the law, which only requires of man but is unable to supply man with life
We shall be ministers not of letter, doctrine, or theology; instead, we shall be ministers of the living Spirit
Those who want to be co-workers in the recovery today must be constituted of the Spirit with the divine life and the spiritual truths
The Lord's new covenant needs ministry, not work, and ministry is a constitution of the Holy Spirit with the divine life and truths
If we realize this, we shall see that the Lord's recovery will not receive anything that is merely a work or an activity
To work, to minister, for the new covenant does not require that we simply learn how to act, move, and carry on a Christian work
In the book of 2 Corinthians, especially in chapter three, the ministry of the New Testament is strongly emphasized
In 2 Corinthians 3:7 and 8 Paul presents a strong contrast between the ministry of death and the ministry of the Spirit
The Old Testament ministry was a ministry of death; the New Testament ministry is a ministry of life embodied in the Spirit
In every aspect and in every way the New Testament ministry dispenses Christ into us as the life-giving Spirit
In this message we shall cover more aspects of the fourth stage of the Spirit's work in the believers for the divine dispensing
The tongues of fire in verse 3 are a symbol of speaking, symbolizing that God's economical Spirit of power is mostly for speaking
The word 'all' cannot be used as evidence that all the believers who were filled with the Holy Spirit began to speak in tongues
According to grammar, verse 4 is not saying that all were filled with the Holy Spirit and that all began to speak in different tongues
The comma after 'Holy Spirit' may help us to see that 'all' does not modify both 'filled' and 'began to speak'
All' modifies only the first predicate, not the second, indicating that all were filled with the Holy Spirit but not all spoke in tongues
If Luke's meaning is that all spoke in tongues, he should have used the word 'all' a second time, before the word 'began'
The disciples were Galileans , yet they spoke the different foreign dialects of the attendants who came from different parts of the world
Today we, through the all-inclusive Spirit, need to preach the deep things concerning Christ in His resurrection and exaltation
Through the all-inclusive, consummated Spirit as power Paul preached the gospel to the nations in a prevailing way
In his preaching to the nations he ministered Christ as the sanctifying element that can change a person's being
As a result of such gospel preaching, the nations became an acceptable offering, an offering sanctified by the Holy Spirit
We see that the gospel preached by the apostles was preached not only in word but also in power and in the Holy Spirit
If there had been no Spirit, there would have been no reality of the gospel and no genuine joy to receive the gospel
No one who speaks in the Spirit of God would say, 'Jesus is accursed'; he would like to say and he is able to say, 'Lord Jesus'
No worshippers of God should be silent; instead, all should use their voices to speak forth the Lord Jesus in the Spirit of God
The governing principle of the gifts is to speak by our spirit with the Spirit, that is, to utter something with the Spirit in our spirit
When we speak Christ in the Spirit, the Spirit will function for the dispensing of the Triune God into ourselves and others
We should learn from this pattern to pray and keep ourselves in fellowship with the Lord that we may sense His leading at any time
These prophets and teachers were not conferring and organizing; rather, they were ministering to the Lord and fasting
As they were ministering in this way, He as the Spirit came in and spoke to them, saying, 'Set apart for Me now Barnabas and Saul'
If the Spirit is merely the Lord's representative, then in 13:2 the Holy Spirit should not have said, 'Set apart for Me'
All these cases show that in Acts the believers were living, moving, working, traveling, and doing everything by the direction of the Spirit
As a result, they moved, walked, worked, acted, traveled, and did everything by the Spirit as men of the Spirit
To prophesy, according to the biblical sense, is not mainly to predict but to speak for God and to speak forth God
To prophesy, to speak for God and to speak forth God, must be to utter something by the Spirit of God as the means
To prophesy, either to predict something for God or to speak for God and speak forth God, must be a speaking by the Spirit of God
The Holy Spirit told Paul again, not directly but through a member of the Body, what would befall him in Jerusalem
We need to exercise our spirit to listen to the speaking of the Spirit from within the spirit of the Apostle Paul in 1 Timothy 4:1
The laying on of hands denotes identification, signifying that they who laid their hands were one with those on whom they laid their hands
By this they declared to all that they were one with the sent ones in their going to carry out the Lord's great commission
Speaking of Barnabas and Saul, verse 4 goes on to say, 'They therefore, having been sent out by the Holy Spirit'
In verse 3 Barnabas and Saul were sent by the other three, but here we are told that they were sent out by the Spirit
Eventually, by the Spirit working together with the apostles and elders at a conference in Jerusalem this problem was solved
In Acts 15 we have the unique conference held by the apostles of the universal church and the elders of the local church in Jerusalem
Verse 28 says, 'It seemed good to the Holy Spirit and to us to lay upon you no greater burden than these necessary things'
There was no voting, and there was neither autocracy nor democracy, neither of which should exist in the church life
In this message we shall cover the remaining aspects of the fourth stage of the Spirit's work in the believers for the divine dispensing
They passed through the country of Phrygia and Galatia, having been forbidden by the Holy Spirit to speak the word in Asia'
Acts 16:7 continues, 'When they had come down to Mysia, they tried to go into Bithynia, and the Spirit of Jesus did not allow them'
The interchangeable use of the Spirit of Jesus with the Holy Spirit reveals that the Spirit of Jesus is the Holy Spirit
In Acts 16 we see that the move of the apostles in their evangelistic work was strictly speaking not by the Spirit of God
These titles of the Spirit indicate that Paul's move in His evangelical work was not in the way of the old dispensation
If it had been a move in the old dispensation, then the Spirit of God or the Spirit of Jehovah should have been mentioned
The kind of work we do for the Lord depends on the kind of Spirit by whom we are guided, directed, instructed, and constituted
The all-inclusive Spirit should become our constitution, and then our work will be the expression of this Spirit
As a vessel containing the Triune God, Paul was fully constituted of the Holy Spirit and of the Spirit of Jesus
In Acts 20:28 Paul tells the elders of the church in Ephesus that the Holy Spirit had placed them among the flock as overseers
Here Paul, the leading one, who did the appointing says that the Holy Spirit had placed the elders as overseers to shepherd the church
In this way the arrangement of the eldership will be according to the leading and directing of the Holy Spirit
In other words, the work of the apostles concerning the churches should be absolutely the work of the Holy Spirit
Verse 3 says that when we minister by speaking in the Spirit of God, we all say, 'Lord Jesus,' exalting Jesus as the Lord
The Greek word rendered distributions in verse 4 as well as in verses 5 and 6 can also be translated diversities varieties distinctions
If we meet without the exercise of the spiritual gifts, our meeting will simply be a social gathering, not a proper church meeting
Just as we have gifts because we have human life, we also have spiritual gifts because we have the divine life
All the different gifts are the manifestation of the Spirit; that is, the Spirit is manifested in the believers who have received the gifts
For profit' in verse 7 means for the growth in life of the members of the Body of Christ and for the building up of Christ's Body
Verse 8 says, 'To one through the Spirit is given a word of wisdom, and to another a word of knowledge, according to the same Spirit'
The word of wisdom is mainly of our spirit through revelation; the word of knowledge is mainly of our understanding through teaching
After the first two gifts, the word of wisdom and the word of knowledge, Paul mentions certain miraculous gifts
Of course, it sometimes includes an element of prediction, of speaking for, speaking forth, and speaking beforehand
Paul concludes verse 10 by saying, 'To a different one various kinds of tongues, and to another interpretation of tongues'
The genuine and proper speaking in tongues is one of the many gifts of the Spirit one of the many aspects of the manifestation of the Spirit
Some say that speaking in tongues is first the initial evidence of the baptism in the Spirit, but it afterward becomes a gift of the Spirit
Although Paul lists nine manifestations of the Spirit, the manifestation of the Spirit by the believers is more than nine items
The miraculous gifts, especially speaking in tongues and the interpretation of tongues, do not require any growth in life
The more we speak by exercising our spirit, the more the Spirit will function, the Lord will minister, and God will operate
Every church should give heed not only to the epistle written to her particularly but also to all the epistles written to the other churches
When we are in the church and among the churches, we have the right position and angle to hear the speaking of the Spirit
The Spirit is the ultimate expression of the processed Triune God and the bride is the ultimate expression of the transformed tripartite man
By the time of Revelation 22:17, the processed Triune God and the transformed tripartite man are married and become a universal couple
For eternity the tripartite man will enjoy the Triune God and match Him for His full expression and satisfaction
We need the infilling of the Holy Spirit and also the outpouring of the Holy Spirit so that we may have an adequate Christian life and work
