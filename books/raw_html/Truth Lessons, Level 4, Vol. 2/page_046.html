	 <h2 class="head4">b. Israel Praising Jehovah<br />
and Drawing Water with Rejoicing from<br />
the Springs of Salvation</h2>
<p>According to Isaiah 12:1 in that day Israel will say, &ldquo;I will praise You, O Jehovah. You were angry with me, / But Your anger has turned and You have consoled me.&rdquo; The Hebrew word rendered &ldquo;praise&rdquo; can also be translated &ldquo;give thanks to.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Verses 3 and 4 say, &ldquo;Therefore you will draw water with rejoicing / From the springs of salvation, / And you will say in that day, / Give thanks to Jehovah; call upon His name!&rdquo; In that day the children of Israel will receive the Lord as their salvation. To receive the Lord as our salvation is to draw water from the springs of salvation. This is strongly emphasized in the New Testament, especially in the Gospel of John, where the Lord Jesus said, &ldquo;The water that I will give him will become in him a fountain of water springing up into eternal life&rdquo; (4:14). This fountain becomes rivers of living water in those who believe into Him (7:37-38). This indicates that in the restoration the Lord will become Israel&rsquo;s salvation as the living water.</p>
<h2 class="head4">c. There Being Singing in the Land of Judah<br />
and in a Vineyard of Wine</h2>
<p>Isaiah also said, &ldquo;In that day this song will be sung in the land of Judah: / We have a strong city; / He will set up salvation as walls and a rampart. / Open the gates / So that the righteous nation may enter, / They who maintain faithfulness. / You will keep the steadfast of mind / In perfect peace / Because he trusts in You. / Trust in Jehovah forever and ever, / For in Jah Jehovah we have an eternal rock&rdquo; (26:1-4). Previously, the children of Israel were not faithful, but Israel will become a righteous nation that maintains faithfulness.</p>
<p>In that day there will also be singing of a vineyard of wine (27:2). Jehovah is the keeper of this vineyard. He waters it every moment, and He guards it by night and by day lest anyone visit harm upon it (v. 3). Isaiah also spoke of how Israel will be blessed: &ldquo;In the days to come Jacob will take root; / Israel will blossom and bud; / And they will fill the surface of the world with their produce&rdquo; (v. 6). Verse 9 says that the iniquity of Jacob will be expiated, and the fruit of the removal of their sin is that they will make all the stones of their altars like chalk stones beaten to powder such that the Asherahs and sun images will not stand. This means that Israel will be redeemed. Their Asherahs and their sun images will be no more, for all idols and false altars will be destroyed.</p>
<h2 class="head4">d. Gaining Increase</h2>
<p>In the restoration the Holy Land will extend from the Mediterranean to the Euphrates (Deut. 11:24). Isaiah 26:15 says, &ldquo;You have increased the nation, O Jehovah; / You have increased the nation&mdash;You are glorified; / You have far extended all the edges of the land.&rdquo; To increase the nation is to increase the people, and to extend the edge is to enlarge the territory.</p>
<h2 class="head4">e. The Eyes of Those Who See Not Being Dim</h2>
<p>As the King, Christ will bring in the restoration of Israel. Then the eyes of those who see will not be dim, and the ears of those who hear will attend. The heart of the hasty will understand knowledge, and the tongue of those who stammer will hasten to speak elegantly (32:3-4).</p>
<h2 class="head4">f. The Spirit Being Poured upon Them from on High,<br />
and the Wilderness Becoming a Fruitful Field</h2>
<p>Furthermore, the Spirit will be poured upon them from on high, the wilderness will become a fruitful field, and the fruitful field will be considered to be a forest. Justice will dwell in the wilderness, and righteousness will remain in the fruitful field. The work of righteousness will be peace, and the result of righteousness will be quietness and assurance forever. Jehovah&rsquo;s people will live in a peaceful habitation and in secure dwellings and carefree resting places (vv. 15-18). During that time, righteousness will work out peace, and the result of righteousness will be quietness and assurance forever. Thus, there will be a peaceful habitation.</p>
<h2 class="head4">g. Israel Being Made an Eternal Excellency and a Joy</h2>
<p>Isaiah 60:15-18 reveals that in her restoration, Israel will be made an eternal excellency and a joy for generations. Israel will be the excellency of the human race.</p>
<h2 class="head4">h. Israel Enjoying Jehovah as the Eternal Light</h2>
<p>The restored Israel will enjoy Jehovah in Christ, the Servant of Jehovah, as the eternal light. Verses 19 through 21 say, &ldquo;You will no longer have the sun for your light by day, / Nor for brightness will the moon give you light; / But Jehovah will be an eternal light to you, / And your God your beauty. / Your sun will no longer go down, / Nor will your moon withdraw; / For Jehovah will be an eternal light to you, / And the days of your mourning will be ended. / Then all your people will be righteous; / They will possess the land forever, / The branch of My planting, / The works of My hands, / That I may be beautified.&rdquo; Israel will have something brighter than the sun and the moon, for they will have Jehovah as an eternal light. In the restoration Israel will be glorified and beautified to become God&rsquo;s beautification. God will be beautified by the restored and beautified Israel.</p>
