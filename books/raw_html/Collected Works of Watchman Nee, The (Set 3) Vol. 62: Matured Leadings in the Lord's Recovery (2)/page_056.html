<h2 class="head2">The Pattern of Acts 15</h2><p>On what basis then do we serve in the church? The Lord has not left it to us to decide the method of making judgments in the church. He gave us one chapter as a pattern&mdash;the conference in Acts 15. The conference in Acts 15 is spiritual, not worldly. It is neither autocratic nor democratic. In Acts 15 the church discussed and deliberated by spiritual methods. Without the record of this conference, we would not know what to do with our service or the management of our business.</p><p>We should first consider the background of this conference in Acts 15. The church in Jerusalem can be considered the &ldquo;big brother&rdquo; among all the churches. Christ once ministered there, and the twelve apostles labored there for a long time. Even the gospel spread out from the Christians in Jerusalem. Many Christians were produced through Jerusalem. Later, after Paul and Barnabas returned to Antioch from their first mission, they faced a great trial; some from the church in Jerusalem came to Antioch and taught that all believers had to be circumcised according to the law of Moses and that if they were not circumcised, they were not saved. Paul and Barnabas debated with them fiercely. The two were clear that if a man who believes in Christ cannot be justified and remains a sinner, it means that Christ has died for nothing (Gal. 2:17-21). For this reason, the church can never mix salvation with things of the Jewish background, including circumcision, the keeping of the Sabbath, and ordinances related to eating, etc. If such things were allowed to mix with salvation, other teachings would eventually come in. A man would be told that he could not be saved unless he did other things, such as obtain a university degree or practice vegetarianism, etc. In China, if the teaching of Confucius is allowed to come in, many will say that a man cannot be saved unless he honors his parents or practices universal compassion, etc. But this is not the gospel of Christ. The gospel says that anyone can believe in the Lord and be saved. The teaching that one can only be saved through keeping the law came from Jerusalem. Therefore, Paul and Barnabas had to go up to Jerusalem to fellowship with the church. They were not the only ones. Other brothers from the church in Antioch also went with them.</p><h2 class="head3">All the Brothers Can Speak</h2><p>After Paul and Barnabas arrived in Jerusalem, they did not go to Peter immediately. Instead, they went to &ldquo;the apostles and elders&rdquo; (Acts 15:2). &ldquo;They were received by the church and the apostles and the elders&rdquo; (v. 4). Then the apostles and elders invited the brothers to come for a meeting. When something happens, the whole church comes together to fellowship about it. Everyone is qualified to speak. The responsible brothers have to listen to the other brothers and sisters. Decisions are made by the elderly brothers, but these elderly brothers must listen to all the other brothers and sisters, because among the speaking of the brothers and sisters may be found the voice of the Holy Spirit. Because the senior ones have been dealt with by the Lord, they can make the decisions before the Lord after listening to the brothers and sisters. In this conference, some believers who were Pharisees first stood up and said, &ldquo;It is necessary to circumcise them and to charge them to keep the law of Moses&rdquo; (v. 5). Around this point there was much dispute. This means that many brothers spoke and expressed their views.</p><h2 class="head3">Peter Spoke</h2><p>&ldquo;And when much discussion had taken place...&rdquo; (v. 7a). All the arguments were presented, and then Peter stood up and spoke. He told everyone of his experience at the house of Cornelius. He was saying that Paul was not the first one to preach to the Gentiles. Rather, &ldquo;from the early days God chose from among you that through my mouth the Gentiles should hear the word of the gospel and believe&rdquo; (v. 7b). Following this, it seems Peter was saying, &ldquo;We the Jews have our religious background. We think that it is a small thing to be circumcised and to keep the Sabbath. But to the Gentiles, this is an unbearable yoke. We should not place such a yoke upon these Gentiles&rdquo; (v. 10). In the house of Cornelius, the Gentiles first received the Holy Spirit, and then Peter baptized them. The Lord did something first. He confirmed what He did by the outpouring of the Holy Spirit. Peter testified that as soon as he opened his mouth, the Holy Spirit descended upon them just as He descended upon the disciples at the beginning (11:15). At Pentecost the order was reversed; Peter finished his preaching, followed by the disciples&rsquo; baptism, and then they received the gift of the Holy Spirit (2:38). If what happened in the house of Cornelius was the same as what happened at Pentecost, it would not have been that miraculous. But in Cornelius&rsquo;s house, Peter had barely opened his mouth before the Holy Spirit poured Himself out. This proves that the Holy Spirit was eager to do this. The Jewish Pharisaical believers were arguing about dead doctrines. Peter was talking about the work of the Holy Spirit.</p>
