<p><I>I experience Christ and I do like to be in the meetings, but sometimes I get tired of having so much preaching.</I><p>Let me say something further regarding the Old Testament type. In addition to the eating of the offering, there was always the teaching of the law. The feasts lasted seven days, and part of the time was spent hearing the teaching of the law, which corresponds to today’s ministry.<p>If we met together only for praying, praising, and testifying the year round, with no ministry, we would be without the proper knowledge of God’s regulation and intention. The males of the children of Israel had to appear before God three times a year, not only to feast, but also to be educated and infused with the knowledge of God.<p>If we have five meetings a week, at least two should be for the ministry. This gives three meetings for all the saints to share. For the ministry, when the church is strong, there should be some local teachers, just as there were in Antioch (cf. Acts 13:1). If the church here had no one who could teach, how poor the church would be. Our meetings need the balance between the eating in fellowship by the offering of our experiences and the teaching. These two go together like husband and wife. Without the sharing, the church is a widower; without the teaching, a widow! It is the balance of these two that makes the church life normal.<p>Suppose these past five years the church had had no ministry. You just came together, sang some hymns, and had some sharing. I wonder if the church would still be here! If you say you have had enough of the life messages and enough of the ministry, that they are all stored within you and that you have reached your capacity like a camel, then I would propose that we suspend the life supply for four years or so. What do you think would become of the church?<p>For an adequate balanced church we must have the eating as the wife and the ministry as the husband. This is included in the heavenly vision.<p><I>I’ve been separated from my husband for two years, and when he comes to visit our two boys, I don’t know how to handle the situation. Sometimes his worldly ways and plans harden my heart. Other times I feel sorrowful and want to pray for him, because he is really good with the boys.</I><p>It is very sorrowful to be separated and have two children, but I trust you can learn to take your environment from the Lord. I have never been in a situation like yours, but still I do have my problems. Possibly mine are deeper and heavier than yours. Don’t think that my situation is so excellent and that everyone appreciates my ministry! If my sufferings are not greater than yours, at least they equal them. The Lord has a measure for all of us. According to the Bible, sufferings are not as bad as they seem; rather, they are a great blessing under a poor cloak. A favorable environment can be a good cloak to cheat us. The sufferings are the real dealings. Romans 8:28 reminds us that, for those who love God, all things work together for good. Whatever our environment may be, it is under the Lord’s sovereignty. I believe that the good is that we may gain more of Christ. Our circumstances open the way. Instead of thinking that you are suffering, change your concept and thank the Lord for your environment. It is a good opportunity for you to receive more of Him.<p>As to the outcome of your married life, just trust in the Lord. He knows. Give up your expectations. Be content with whatever the Lord has given you and rest assured that He has your situation in His hand. The Lord may after a while recover your marriage. I don’t know, but He knows what you really need.<p>We all need to understand these principles. Take every circumstance from the Lord’s hand, believing that it was ordered by Him. Day by day receive grace and be satisfied with whatever the day brings forth. Don’t expect your situation to improve. With us no circumstance is bad; even the worst environment is good, because God causes all things to work together for our good. Take every occasion to experience the Lord, and you will gain more Christ.<p><I>How can we be kept from repeating the mistakes of the past two years?</I><p>The primary safeguard is that you have no particular fellowship with certain ones. In your body every part is common to every other part. The blood circulates throughout the whole body, supplying every cell, not a special few. The sisters’ fellowship must be in common with all the sisters. The brothers too must be common in their fellowship with one another. To have preferences for certain ones damages the Body. Be careful that your fellowship does not become friendship. You must regard all the brothers and sisters as equally lovable. This is what Paul meant when he wrote to the Philippians, “Fulfill ye my joy, that ye be like-minded, having the same love” (Phil. 2:2). Having the same love means that your love for everyone is on the same level. You have no particular love for a few. You don’t contact certain ones for the purpose of having special fellowship with them. Try to have just one level of fellowship, including all the saints equally.<p><I>Since you encouraged us to eat the manna by regularly spending time in the morning with the Lord and His Word, I have been doing this, and it has had a real effect on my relationship with the Lord, though I haven’t sensed anything special. But how can I, practically speaking, keep this up during the day?</I><p>Just continue in the Word. In addition to your ten minutes in the morning, read a chapter at noontime and three chapters in the evening. Also, keep praying throughout the day, “Lord, take away any veils. Keep my whole being open to You.” Don’t try to analyze your situation. If you will eat the Word faithfully three times a day and keep opening to the Lord by praying unceasingly, coming to Him just as you are, you will find that your life will be changed and that when you come to the meetings you will not be empty-handed.
