<h1 class="msg">CHAPTER FIFTY</h1><h1 class="title">GOD'S WAY OF ACCOMPLISHING HIS PURPOSE IN CREATING MAN</h1><h1 class="title">(1)</h1><h1 class="scripture">Date: December 13, 1936, evening<br />Place: The Savior's Church, Foochow<br />Scripture Reading: Gen. 2:7-9, 16-17; Rom. 8:29-30; Heb. 2:9-11</h1><h2 class="head1">GOD'S ORIGINAL PURPOSE IN CREATING MAN</h2><p>Beginning from tonight we will study God's purpose in man in a systematic way and show how He accomplishes such a purpose. God's Word shows us that His purpose is to have many sons, that is, a group of men who will have the life of His Son (Heb. 2:10).</p><p>In Genesis we see God creating the heavens and the earth, and then creating man. After this He put the man He created in the garden of Eden. God's purpose in preparing the garden of Eden and putting man in it was not that man would merely be a gardener, but that he would eat the tree of life and receive His life. Human beings work according to a purpose and a plan. God, being much wiser than man, works even more according to a plan. God did all these things according to a plan. His plan is that man would have His life and become His many sons.</p><p>God wants many sons. Yet Adam did not have such a thought. Adam's goal might have merely been to become a perfect man. But even if he had become perfect, he would still have fallen short of God's purpose. A perfect man cannot fulfill God's purpose. In reality Adam did not become a perfect man; he became a sinner instead. Today man has two problems. First, he is a sinner, and second, he is a man. As a sinner, he needs salvation, and as a man, he also needs salvation. A person needs to be saved because he is a sinner. A person also needs to be saved because he is a man. The forgiveness of sins merely recovers man to Adam's original position in the garden of Eden. As a "man," he still needs to receive God's life before he can become a son of God and before God's purpose can be accomplished in him. In order to accomplish His purpose in man, God has to do two things. First, He has to save the sinner and deliver him from sin. Second, He has to save the "man" himself. Since man fell through sin, he became a sinner estranged from God on the one hand, and a man who had fallen short of God's purpose on the other hand.</p><p>We are sinners, and as sinners we need forgiveness. We are also men, and as men we need God's life. Only when we have both of these things can God's purpose be fulfilled. Man's problem is not one of being good or bad, sinful or sinless, perfect or imperfect. Man's problem lies in what he is. As long as he is simply a man, he needs God's work, and he needs God to dispense His life into him. Only then will he be able to fulfill God's purpose. God's forgiveness of man's sin is an incidental work&mdash;it is not His goal. Man's sin is something negative, something incidental. In order for God to achieve His purpose in man, He first had to solve the problem of sin, but His ultimate goal is to dispense His life into man.</p><h2 class="head1">GOD'S PURPOSE BEING FRUSTRATED</h2><p>We know that Adam ate of the fruit of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil. As a result he became independent, knowing good and evil. There was no more need for man to ask God or to trust in Him; he became independent. Adam became an independent sinner estranged from God. What is a sinner? A sinner is simply one who is separated from God and independent of God. Being separated from God and independent of God is sin. Hence anything that originates from man is sin, and any act that is done independent of God is sin. A man does not have to commit fornication, robbery, murder, or arson. As long as he is separated from God, he is a sinner. Originally Adam was innocent. He was not able to differentiate good from evil. He had to ask God for everything and find out from God whether something was good or bad, right or wrong. After he ate of the fruit of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, he was able to know good and evil by himself. There was no more need for him to seek after God or to trust in Him. He became independent from God. Through the knowledge he acquired, he became a man who was independent of God. In this way, God's purpose could not be fulfilled and His will was frustrated.</p>
