   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE PRIESTHOOD AND THE HOLY OF HOLIES</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>I am not talking about doctrine.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>By His mercy I am trying to impress you that all these dealings with sin, the world, and the self are vital to the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Whenever we are with the brothers, the self must be crossed out.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The veil has to be torn down and broken.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>If it is not, there is no way for us to practice the priesthood.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The priesthood, strictly speaking, is not in the outer court or the Holy Place, but in the Holy of Holies.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>It is only in the Holy of Holies that the priests can be saturated with the shekinah glory of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>In the outer court the priests are enlightened by the sunshine.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>In the Holy Place they have the light from the lampstand.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>But in the Holy of Holies, there is no sunshine and no lampstand.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>There is no natural light or humanly manufactured light.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>There is only the Lord Himself as the shekinah glory, shining and saturating them with Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>When they become the real priests in the priesthood, they have the real expression of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>This expression is not just some kind of good behavior or good conduct.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>It comes from dealing with sin, the world, and the self.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Then we are with the Lord in the Holy of Holies, where nothing as a veil or covering can keep us from being thoroughly saturated with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>It is not that we are adjusted, corrected, or balanced by Him.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Instead, we are saturated with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>We must be so saturated with His shekinah glory that He will shine through us.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Then His very expression will be upon us, and this expression of Christ is the genuine church life.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>For more than twenty years I have been trying to find the best utterance to speak about the genuine church life.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>I believe that the best expression and definition of the church life is the priesthood.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>When the priests are full of Christ, then He becomes their garments, their outward expression, and on their garments are all the precious stones built up together as a body.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The building up of the Body is in the expression of Christ, and the expression of Christ comes from the inner enjoyment of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>When we have passed through all these dealings, we are spontaneously in the Holy of Holies, and we are at the mercy seat.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>We will obtain mercy and find grace.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The mercy and grace are the hidden manna and the budding rod.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The rich, hidden supply of the all-inclusive Christ and His resurrection power is the mercy and grace, and it is also the flow of the living water.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>In Hebrews the mercy and grace flow out of the throne of grace, and in Revelation the water of life flows out of the throne of the Lamb.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The water of life in Revelation is the mercy and grace in Hebrews.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>These are the hidden manna and the budding rod, the unsearchable riches of Christ and His resurrection power.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Let us go back to the illustration of arguing.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>We have made it quite clear that the more we argue, the more we lose the mercy seat.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>That means that the flow within us is stopped, and we lose the mercy and the grace.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>In other words, we lose the bountiful, rich supply of Christ and His resurrection power.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>But suppose we learn the lesson of dealing with the self, and crossing out the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Outwardly, we may suffer by not arguing, but inwardly, we are in the Holy of Holies.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>We are at the mercy seat, and the rich supply of Christ becomes our portion, with the resurrection power strengthening, sustaining, and uplifting us within.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>We are enjoying the budding rod and the bountiful riches of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>He is so sweet, so rich, so strengthening, so satisfying, and so refreshing.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>This is the mercy and grace.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>However, many times when we pray we do not have the sense that we have the inner flow.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Instead, we sense that the flow within us is stopped.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>There is some blockage within, because we are hindered by sins, the world, or the self.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>We may have done nothing wrong or worldly, but each has his self.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The self is the problem.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The self is the separating barrier.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>So we must learn the lesson of crossing out the self.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>The first time I spent a few months with Brother Watchman Nee, he said to me concerning a certain matter: In any case we must lose the case.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>We shouldn t try to win the case, for if we do, the flow within will be stopped.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Are we going to win the case or keep the flow within?</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Do not try to win the case with your dear wife.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Do not try to win the case with your husband.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>We may win the case, but we will lose the inner flow.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>To win the case means to treasure the self.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>The self has to be crossed out.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Do not hate others, but hate the self.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Do not hate your husband or wife, but hate your self.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Do not hate your brothers or sisters, but hate your self.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Do not condemn others, but condemn your self.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>To say or read this is easy, but when the case or cases really come, it is not so easy.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Then we will be exposed.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Many times we are simply in the self, not in the Holy of Holies.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>I have the sense that if only this one message were engraved into us, all the problems in the church would be gone.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>When the self is gone, we are not in the wilderness, but in the good land of Canaan.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>When the self is gone, we are in the heavenlies, and the real expression of Christ will be our genuine church life.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>The church is in the Holy of Holies under the mercy seat, enjoying the bountiful riches of Christ and His resurrection power.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>We must all keep ourselves in the Holy of Holies at the mercy seat, enjoying the hidden manna and the budding rod all the time.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Then we will be so rich and powerful in the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Therefore, to be practical priests is to experience these three categories of dealings.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>There is no other way.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>We must have our sins dealt with at the altar by the blood, and our worldliness dealt with by the working and washing power of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>Then we must have our self dealt with by the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>Spontaneously, we will be in the Holy of Holies at the mercy seat enjoying Christ as the hidden manna and resurrection power.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>Here we receive mercy and grace which flow within us all the time as the water of life.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>Here we have the expression of Christ and the genuine church life.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>May the Lord be gracious to us that we all may be willing to be such priests.</S>
