   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>God s power toward us is the same power that operated in Christ.</S>

   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The surpassing greatness of God s power has also seated Christ at God s right hand in the heavenlies, far above all rule and authority and power and lordship, and every name that is named, not only in this age, but also in that which is coming vv.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>20-21 .</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>God s right hand, where Christ has been seated by the surpassingly great power of God, is the most honorable place, the place with supreme authority.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The heavenlies refers not only to the third heaven, the highest place in the universe, where God dwells, but also to the state and atmosphere of the heavens, in which Christ was seated by God s power.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>In verse 21 Paul says that Christ has been seated above all rule, authority, power, and lordship and above every name that is named.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Rule refers to the highest office; authority, to every kind of official power Matt 8:9 ; power, to the mere might of authority; and lordship, to the preeminence which power establishes.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The authorities here include not only the angelic, heavenly authorities, good or bad, but also the human, earthly ones.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The ascended Christ has been seated far above all rule, authority, power, and lordship in the entire universe.</S>

   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Thirdly, the great power that operated in Christ has subjected all things under His feet.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>For Christ to be far above all is one thing; for all things to be subjected under His feet is another.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The former is Christ s transcendency; the latter is the subjection of all things to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Here we see the subduing power, the power to subdue all things.</S>
