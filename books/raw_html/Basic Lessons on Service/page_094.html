<H1 CLASS=MSG>LESSON NINETEEN</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>THE DENIAL OF THE SELF</H1><H1 CLASS=SCRIPTURE>Scripture Reading: Matt. 16:23-26; Luke 9:25; Gal. 5:16b, 24; Rom. 7:18-21; Matt. 19:16, 20</H1><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>OUTLINE</H2><ol class="upper-roman"><li>The difference between the self and the flesh:</li>	<ol class="upper-alpha">	<li>The flesh being the corrupted and transmuted body&#151;Gal. 5:16b, 24.</li>	<li>The self being the fallen and rebellious soul&#151;Matt. 16:26; Luke 9:25.</li>	</ol><li>When the flesh dominates the self, the self becomes an evil person&#151;Rom. 7:18-21.</li><li>When the self subdues the flesh, the self becomes a "good" person&#151;Matt. 19:16, 20.</li><li>The self being independent of God&#151;Matt. 16:23-24.</li><li>The self being the embodiment of the soulish life, one with Satan, and expressed through the mind&#151;opinionated thoughts&#151;Matt. 16:23-24.</li><li>The self being the hidden, damaging factor of our service in the church.</li><li>The self needing to be crossed out&#151;Matt. 16:24-25.</li></ol><P>In the foregoing lessons on service, beginning from lesson thirteen, we have dealt with many negative things that frustrate and damage our service. Lesson thirteen is on the danger and loss of not using our gift. Lesson fourteen is on the strange fire. Lesson fifteen shows us that we need to take heed how to build. We should not build with wood, grass, or stubble, but with gold, silver, and precious stones (1 Cor. 3:12). Lesson sixteen speaks of the impotence of our natural being in the things of God. Then we saw in lessons seventeen and eighteen that we need to know the flesh in a thorough way.</P><P>We have to help the saints realize that in the service of the church we must know all these negative things. If we are not clear about these negative things and do not have a thorough clearance from these negative things, we can never have a proper church service. If we are not cleared up from all these negative things, we are still in Christianity in nature. So it is worthwhile for us to stay with the saints on all these negative points.</P><P>In this lesson we want to see the need for the denial of the self in our service to the church. The outline for this lesson is simple, but there is the need for much development, labor, and prayer on our part to enter into its intrinsic significance.</P>
