   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>III.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>GOD'S EXPLANATION</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The Holy Spirit coming to man and entering into man is not just for the infilling and the outpouring.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>It is also for Him to become the indwelling words of God.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>If God's coming to man is merely His coming, with no words, there would be no way for man to understand His intention.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>There is no way His intention can be explained without words.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Suppose someone comes into my home, but he does not say a word.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>That would be quite difficult for me.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>John 14:17 says that when the Spirit comes, He enters into us; 15:4 says that we abide in the Lord, and the Lord also abides in us.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Then, verse seven says, "If you abide in Me, and My words abide in you " Here the Lord becomes the words and explanation in us.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Likewise, in Colossians it says that our giving thanks and our praises are due to the word of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>In Ephesians it says that we thank and praise due to the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>If there is only the filling of the Spirit but there is no word, how can you have psalms and hymns?</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>You cannot, for there is only the stirring but not the explanation.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>For example, this morning I may feel the need to pray, but there is no word or explanation in me telling me what to pray for or how to pray.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The best I could do would be to weep or to shout a few hallelujahs.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>I could not pray thoroughly.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Hence, the Spirit that comes to us must become the explanation in us.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Once it becomes the explanation, it is the word.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The Gospel of John tells us clearly that the words which the Lord speaks to us are spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>When the Spirit in us causes us to understand, then it is the word.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Sometimes we may have inspiration inside, but we cannot understand because the Spirit has not yet become words and there is a lack of explanation.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Then, one day He explains it to us, that is, the Spirit becomes the word.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Then, and only then, can we understand His intention.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>One who ministers the Word usually has this experience: when he is about to stand up to speak a word, he feels he has the inspiration and the burden within him.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>However, he still does not know specifically what he should speak.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Then, as he stands and speaks, he has an inner sense, and the more he speaks the clearer he becomes.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The Spirit within has become the word.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The same is true with prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>For example, someone waking in the morning may feel the burden to pray, but he does not know for what he should pray.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>He thus goes before God, and as he prays, he tries to sense his inner feeling.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>As a result, the inner consciousness becomes the word, and the word is then expressed.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>One sentence comes forth, and the next one follows immediately.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>After the prayer is finished, the inner burden has been discharged.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>This means the Spirit has become the word.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Real prayers, therefore, are the outcome of God's moving within us.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>This moving is carried out through the Spirit, and the Spirit needs to become the word, the explanation.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Thus, we are able to express our prayers.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>IV.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>GOD'S EXPRESSION</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Explanation is an inward understanding, whereas expression is an outward declaration.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Every true prayer is just like a weighty message, all the words of prayer being the expression of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>It can almost be said that the words of prayer are the very Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>No wonder the Lord Jesus said His words are spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>For whatever He speaks, it is the expression of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>In principle, our prayers should be the same.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>In prayer we have often really touched the spirit, enjoyed the Lord's presence very much, and had the anointing of the ointment.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>At other times we would have to admit that our prayer was not so good.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>The more we prayed, the more dry and dead we were inside.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>The more we prayed, the fewer words we had.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Where does the difference between these two conditions lie?</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>The basic issue is: while we were praying, did the Spirit come to us and explain God's intention to us?</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>If we have such an explanation, then we can express it accordingly.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Thus, the more we pray, the more we are inspired.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>The more we pray, the more we have the anointing.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>The more we pray, the more we touch the spirit, and the fresher and livelier we are.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>For in that prayer the Spirit comes forth with the words that we express.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>On the contrary, at other times there may be no moving of the Spirit while we pray, and thus our words are not the expression of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Then it is simply we ourselves speaking, and such a prayer will spontaneously be dried up.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Real prayers are the result of God's moving in us.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>God's moving starts with the Spirit first coming to us and then going a step further to become the explanation.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>The explanation is the word.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Once the words are present in our consciousness, they must be expressed.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>When we speak forth those words, that is prayer.</S>
