Since the new man is the Body of Christ, the church, in the Body of Christ there is nothing but Christ Himself
The more we apply the cross to our old nature, our old man, the more we will experience Christ in a genuine way
We need to be impressed that the church life is not a matter of doctrine; rather, it is Christ Himself realized by us in our daily life
Although we may know this already, it is one thing to know something, and it is another thing to realize it in our experience
If we experience Christ in a real and living way, we will be in the church life and will never be individualistic
The more we live Christ, the more we will long to be one with others, and the more we will be willing to be dependent on others
The more we live by Christ, the more we will realize that we are just one member of the Body and that we can never be complete in ourselves
In our physical body each individual member needs the whole body, but a complete body as a whole does not need anything else
When we are living in Christ, we long for the Body of Christ and for a relatedness between us and the other members
Answer: We have to look at this portion of the Word with the view of the entire Scriptures, from beginning to end
The Scriptures reveal to us that God's intention in this universe is to have His house, His dwelling place, built up among the human race
The adamic race failed God in this matter, and God called Abraham in order to have a new beginning with a new race
The Lord's intention was that Israel would build a more permanent dwelling place, the temple, in the land of Canaan
Only after all the enemies had been defeated and terminated was it possible for the Lord to build up His dwelling place among His people
Before the building up of the temple could take place, there was first the need of fighting to remove all the enemies of God
Eventually, the ultimate consummation of the entire Scriptures is the New Jerusalem as the eternal tabernacle and dwelling place of God
The more a person loves the Lord, seeks the Lord, walks in the Lord, and lives by the Lord, the more he longs to have a church life
Answer: On the one hand, to carry this out in practice seems very complicated, especially in view of today's confusing situation
Just as our physical body rejects anything foreign to it, we must reject anything that is foreign to the Body of Christ
As living members of the Body of Christ, we know what is foreign to the Body and therefore does not belong to the church
To satisfy this longing we must simply come together with others and take the ground as the expression of the Body of Christ in our locality
On the island of Taiwan there are many local churches, none of which was built up by a pastor or a full-time worker
We should remember that we are believers, members of the Lord's Body, and come together with others in the simplest way
The church is a new creation created by Christ, in Christ, and with Christ, and is actually Christ Himself realized within us
In the matter of denying the self, do not try to do anything by yourself, but simply accept what the Lord reveals to you
The Lord has to discipline us again and again in order to subdue and break us so that we may be able to give up our self
Many saints who seek the Lord are very much disciplined by the Lord because they are too strong in doing good for Him
The Lord has to raise up certain circumstances to press them, break them, and force them to give up their self
The more we are good, the more we will be independent, but the more we are spiritual and in the Lord, the more we will be dependent
Question: Is there any difference between what Watchman Nee proposes and what has been attempted by the Brethren?
In the New Testament there is never more than one church in any locality , but the open Brethren have neglected this matter
The different meetings are not called the church in that locality but are referred to as local chapels on certain streets
After five months, three of the saints may no longer agree with the meeting because they have a difference of opinion
According to their practice, the first meeting will be called the Twenty-first Avenue Chapel, and the second, the Eleventh Avenue Chapel
Answer: In order to answer this question adequately, we need to review the history of the Christian denominations
In the Reformation the state churches came into being, which were churches for the people but not of the people
Today the king of Denmark is the head of the Church of Denmark, and the queen of England is the head of the Church of England
After the state churches the private churches such as the Presbyterian Church the Baptist Church and the Methodist Church came into being
In the early nineteenth century, through brothers such as John Nelson Darby, Benjamin Newton, and others, the free churches began
Today in Christianity there are the Catholic Church, the state churches, the private churches, and the free churches
Verses 15 through 17 say, 'Moreover if your brother sins against you, go, reprove him between you and him alone
If he does not hear you, take with you one or two more, that by the mouth of two or three witnesses every word may be established
According to the context, therefore, the two or three in verse 20 are the two or three witnesses mentioned previously in verse 16
There is no basis in the Lord's teaching in this passage for anyone to begin a meeting with just two or three in a home and call it a church
In order to keep the oneness of the church in the locality where we are, we must be one with all the children of God in that locality
Answer: In today's situation everything is complicated and confused, but we do not take responsibility for this
Question: Suppose there is such a group of believers, but some of the things they believe or practice are peculiar
When a difference concerns something that does not damage the oneness, when it is only a difference of thought, we need to be patient
None of us will insist on anything, but we will bring everything to the Lord in fellowship to seek the Lord's mind
We should simply take Christ as our life and come together as a genuine local expression of the Body in the place where we are
Whenever anything happens, we need to come together to seek the Lord's mind by reading the Word, by prayer, and by fellowship
Answer: We must realize that human beings love to set up certain rules, doctrines, and teachings and live by them
Similarly, when they wrote the Epistles under the inspiration of the Holy Spirit, the apostles did not write in the way of setting up rules
The first was with the Moravians under the leadership of Count Zinzendorf at the beginning of the eighteenth century
The intention of the Presbyterians was not primarily to practice the church but to practice the Presbyterian system
The body is the outermost part of man's being, the spirit is the innermost part, and the soul is the medium between the body and the spirit
The three parts of man correspond to the three realms in the universe: the physical realm, the spiritual realm, and the psychological realm
If we were to lose our sight, we could not substantiate color, and it would seem that such a thing as color did not exist
Although we might know that color exists, to our senses it would not exist, because we would not have the organ to substantiate color
If we would know God, touch God, contact God, sense God, and substantiate God, we must use the right organ, that is, our spirit
For this reason, when we pray, we need to stop our whole being and exercise our inner organ, that is, our spirit
We should pray not by our memory, nor by our mind, will, or emotion, but by the deepest and innermost part of our being, our spirit
If we exercise our mind and our reasoning too much, we may reach the point where we doubt that the Lord exists
When our spirit was regenerated, the Holy Spirit of God came into our spirit to enliven it and bring the Lord Jesus Christ into it as life
After God formed man's body from the dust of the ground and breathed into it the breath of life, a living soul came into existence
Before we were regenerated, we lived by the soul, by the human life, using the body as a vessel and the spirit as an organ
Our spirit is now a new man; hence, we must deny our self and live by the divine life in our spirit, which is to live by the new man
We have a mind to think, to consider; an emotion to love and hate, to be happy and unhappy; and a will to make decisions and choices
By the spirit, which has the divine life, the life of the Triune God, through regeneration, we can live as the new man
On the negative side, we must deny the old man, the soul, which means to deny the mind, the will, and the emotion
In order to pray by exercising the spirit, we must forget about everything and come to the Lord to contact Him
Sometime during the day or in the evening we may contact that person not by our mentality or our emotion but by our spirit
When we minister by our mentality, we can touch only people's mentality; we can never touch the spirit within them
Because we have two lives, the soulish life and the divine life, there are always two ways for us as Christians to do things
The way to live for the Lord, following and obeying Him, is to not exercise our soul-our mind, emotion, and will-but to exercise our spirit
In order to live and walk by the spirit, we must learn to reject, to deny, the mind, the emotion, and the will
Education teaches people how to exercise their mentality, but today we must realize that we need to learn how to exercise our spirit
Usually, when Christians come together, very few are strong in their spirit to utter a prayer or a praise to the Lord
When we come to the meetings, it will be easy for us to express something either by giving a short word or by offering a prayer or a praise
The normal Christian life is a life lived in the spirit, where there is victory over sin, the self, Satan, the world, and worldly things
All the things that the Lord has accomplished on the cross can be realized only in and through the Spirit, who dwells in our spirit
When we are in our spirit, all the divine facts that the Lord accomplished through His death and resurrection become real to us
If we are not in our spirit but in our self, it is not possible for us to experience what the Lord has accomplished on the cross
The genuine love of a wife for her husband can be seen when the wife lives not by her own life but by her husband
It is at this time that the Holy Spirit in our spirit intercedes for us with groanings which cannot be uttered
When we utter that interpretation in words we pray a genuine prayer a prayer initiated by the throne of God and transmitted into our spirit
Our mind, emotion, and will must always be secondary, and our innermost part, our spirit, must always be primary
We will be spiritual and have power, energy, strength, light, and life because in our spirit we will experience all the riches of Christ
The Lord today is within us as life and as everything hence there is no need for us to struggle in order to be victorious holy or spiritual
In France and all the southern European countries, from Portugal to Greece, there is nearly nothing for the Lord
The Pentecostal movement in that country is quite prevailing, and it is better than in other places because it is not so wild
In England, Scotland, and Ireland, although there was something for the Lord thirty years ago, the situation today is pitiful
Even though there have been revivals in these places throughout history, none of the revivals lasted very long
In 1949 there were more than five hundred local churches there and approximately one thousand full-time co-workers
We praise the Lord that today throughout America there are many Christians, and among them a good number are genuinely seeking
To be on the right track is first to know Christ and experience Him as life and everything not in doctrine or teaching but in daily practice
Following this, Romans reveals that not only our works and deeds are sinful, but even our nature, our very being, is sinful
While we are walking, living, and doing things in the Spirit, we are members of one wonderful, universal, mystical Body
It is an eternal plan made in Christ, with Christ, through Christ, and for Christ according to God's desire and pleasure
Now these people must be built up together as a living Body a corporate vessel to contain express and exhibit Christ to the whole universe
God needs an expression, one that is in Christ and through Christ, and also one that is through a Body of regenerated human beings
Romans 9:21 says that we are vessels of clay, and 2 Corinthians 4:7 says that we are earthen vessels that contain a priceless treasure
The human mind is needed as a container for the mind of Christ, and the human emotion is needed as a container for Christ's emotion
We are not vessels for milk, eggs, or bread; we are vessels for Christ so that we might contain Him and express Him
Only when every finger has been fitted exactly inside the glove can we say that the hand is formed in the glove
All the things on the earth and in the heavens, with man as the center , are for the purpose of expressing Christ through His Body
Degrees, what the meaning of the universe is or what the meaning of human life is, they will tell you that they do not know
They are only figures, types, or symbols that signify and point to something real, that is, to Christ as our real life and our real food
As an old man he knew that every material thing was not trustworthy and that the eternal habitation of God's people is the Lord Himself
He is our life, our food, our drink, our light, our way, our wisdom, our knowledge, our strength, and our power
You have believed in Jesus Christ, but now you must know that when Christ was crucified on the cross, you were included in Him
According to 1 John 1:1-9, when we receive the divine life, the eternal life, we also have the fellowship of the divine life
When we confess our sins, the blood of Jesus the Son of God cleanses us from all defilement and recovers the lost fellowship
Judaism has always told people that one day the late rain will come , in other words, that there will be a great revival
Although for many centuries people have been talking about the late rain, the anticipated revival has still not come
From the past centuries up to the present the Lord has done many things not in the way of a revival but in the way of life
The apostle Paul told the Corinthians, 'For indeed Jews require signs and Greeks seek wisdom, but we preach Christ crucified'
There is always a certain kind of sense, feeling, or consciousness within us, and we must simply go along with that sense
Christ will energize and strengthen us to do many things, and it will not be we who do those things; it will be Christ who does them in us
Eventually, however, we will discover that the more we endeavor to control our temper, the more we will lose it
We are not concerned with a religion of dead letters or even with Christian teaching, but rather with Christ Himself as the living reality
The most urgent need among the Lord's people today is not more teachings; it is the real application and the living realization of Christ
In this way we transfer our knowledge from the mind to the spirit, and then the knowledge of the Word becomes living food to us
Real prayer is not to ask the Lord Jesus to do something for us; real prayer is to contact the Lord and absorb Him
May these days be full of light and life that we may be brought into Your vision to see something heavenly and eternal
By Your headship and lordship we claim all the seeking saints for the recovery of the testimony of the church in these last days
We say today that we are nothing; we are impotent and incompetent, but we trust in You and put our confidence in You
In these messages we are covering the line of Christ as life and the church, the Body of Christ, as the expression of Christ
When we turned to the Lord, immediately we exercised our natural understanding to comprehend and apprehend the divine and spiritual things
Although the natural concept seems good, it is very dangerous and is a great hindrance to our seeing God's eternal plan
To hold such concepts is to be taken advantage of by the enemy, who would hinder us from knowing the Lord in a real and spiritual way
The Lord has a plan, and the center of this plan is that God in Christ as the Spirit desires to mingle Himself with us
We were created as vessels for God, but God did not create us as vessels without life, feelings, intentions, desires, or understanding
To fill a glass with water is easy because the glass is without any understanding, desire, thought, or intention
God made us as living vessels, but when He comes to fill us with Himself, many times we do not cooperate with Him
The most glorious and pleasing thing to God is our cooperation with Him in allowing Him to fill us with Himself
We need a revelation that God's eternal purpose, His ultimate intention, is to mingle Himself with us and work Himself into us
Once we have this thought, our concept, nature, conduct, and even our whole being will be changed, transformed, and revolutionized
After being regenerated, many Christians become like Saul of Tarsus, doing what he did before he was regenerated
Before that time he always took the lead to move and to act, but after the Lord met him, he needed someone to lead him
God wants to fill us with Himself; He wants to enter into us to saturate us with His element and permeate us with all His riches
There are a good number of Christians who have been saved and who have a sincere heart and desire to seek the Lord
When we see God's eternal purpose, the only thing that counts is God mingling Himself with us by working Christ into us
We will also be prevailing and powerful in our prayer and service, and we will be full of life in our work and in our daily living
Question: Galatians 6:2 says, 'Bear one another's burdens, and in this way you will fulfill the law of Christ completely'
How and in what attitude should we bear one another's burdens, and what is the law of Christ and its fulfillment?
The verse concerning bearing one another's burdens is in the sixth chapter of Galatians, not in the first chapter
What is mentioned in these verses should not be considered nine kinds of fruit, but one kind of fruit with nine aspects
At the end of the book the apostle tells us that neither circumcision nor uncircumcision is anything, but a new creation is what matters
In the New Testament there is a very small phrase of just two words, but it is the most important phrase in the universe
If our intention is genuinely for the Lord and we are doing too much, the Lord will come in to stop us from our doing
There are a good number of seeking Christians, yet among them the concept of doing something for God is very strong
Question: How does a person get out of the religious 'rat race' of always going around in a circle as in a cage?
We need a revelation to see that God's intention is to work Christ into us as our everything and to work Christ through us and out of us
All of our daily walk, living, working, service, and activity must be an issue, an outflow, of the divine life
Although the Body is revealed in the Scriptures, the way to practice the Body life, the church life, is rather difficult to see
Beside the tree there was a river, and along the flow of the river there were gold, bdellium , and onyx, a precious stone
The pictures at the two ends of the Scriptures correspond with each other; both pictures portray life and building
The pictures at the beginning and the end of the Scriptures may be likened to the beginning and end of an architectural plan
The picture at the beginning of the Bible is like an architectural drawing, a blueprint, that shows the intended building
In God's intention the tree of life had to enter into man to be man's life, and the river had to flow in man and out of man
The Lord Jesus confirmed God's intention when He changed Peter's name from Simon to Peter, which means 'a stone'
Later, Peter wrote that the believers in Christ are living stones who are being built up into a spiritual house
In the New Testament the building work is carried out by the Triune God as gold pearls and precious stones being wrought into the believers
At this point the tree of life, the river of water of life, and the precious materials have been wrought into and mingled with man
Christ is life for the purpose of producing the materials that will be built up as a spiritual building, a spiritual house
The ultimate issue of such a process is a building, the holy city, New Jerusalem, which is the tabernacle of God and the wife of the Lamb
When the Lord instituted the table with His disciples, He said, 'This is My body which is being given for you; do this in remembrance of Me'
Whenever we come to the Lord's table to break the bread and drink the cup, we need to receive the Lord once more by exercising our spirit
The remembrance of the Lord is not merely a human remembrance by using our mind to consider and remember what the Lord is to us
By such a life we are gradually transformed, and our nature is changed from clay into stone and from stone into precious stone
We need a certain amount of burning and pressing; otherwise, we will remain created material that has not been transformed
In order to be transformed from clay into precious stones for God's building, we must pass through a process of burning and pressing
Answer: Most Christians think that they must be spiritual, not realizing that eventually they need to be built up with other Christians
Today many Christians merely seek a certain kind of spirituality and do not know anything about being built up
He will find that he is a most unspiritual person and that whatever spirituality he thinks he has is false and is simply in his imagination
Question: Is it not true that before the Lord's coming, it will be impossible for the church as a whole to actually be His Body?
Answer: In the Scriptures, especially related to the matter of the church, there is the principle of the overcomers, the remnant
As a whole, the church has failed the Lord, but today, before His coming back, the Lord is calling the overcomers
There the Lord spoke many things concerning the churches, and at the end of each epistle He issued a call for the overcomers, the remnant
The woman symbolizes the totality of God's people on earth, and the man-child is the stronger part of God's people
The majority of the church, signified by the woman, is weak, and only a small part, signified by the man-child, is strong
Although they may not know what they hunger for, we know that they hunger for Christ as life and for the real expression of the church
We must minister Christ as life to these hungry, seeking saints and afford them a spiritual home, that is, the church
By the new birth Christ is increased, and this increase is a corporate bride who will marry Christ as His counterpart to match Him
The one original grain is the Lord Jesus Himself, and the many grains are we, the Lord's believers, who are the increase of the one grain
The next verse tells us what the one new man is: 'And might reconcile both in one Body to God through the cross'
Because this one new man is the Body of Christ, the church, each believer is only a part, a member, of the unique new man
If we remember what the new man in chapter 2 is, we can understand the right meaning of putting on the new man in these verses
In order to have the church life, that is, to put on the Body of Christ, the new man, we need to put off the old man
Where there cannot be Greek and Jew, circumcision and uncircumcision, barbarian, Scythian, slave, free man, but Christ is all and in all'
There is no Greek or Jew, no circumcision or uncircumcision, no barbarian, Scythian, slave, or free man, but Christ is all and in all
God's eternal purpose is to work Christ into us, to have Christ wrought into us, and to make Christ life to us
If we experience Christ as life, automatically we will have the church life; we will realize the life of the Body of Christ, the church
If we love the world or live in sin, we will have no desire to see the believers or fellowship with the brothers and sisters
We will come together in the name of the Lord and in the Lord Himself to have Christ as our center and as everything to us
Whenever a sinner receives Christ as his Savior, the Holy Spirit brings Christ into this person to be born once more, in him
We have pointed out that the church is the resurrected Christ as life being born into us, lived out from within us, and expressed through us
To put on Christ with the church and to put on the church with Christ requires us to be renewed in the spirit of our mind
When we reject our self and deny the old life, this spirit expands into our mind and becomes the spirit of our mind
By such a spirit we are delivered from our old mind, our old concepts, and our mind becomes a new mind, a renewed mind, with a new concept
The church life depends on our putting off the old man and putting on the new man, having our mind renewed by the spirit
He may realize that to be a Christian is not to live by the old man but to live by the new man, that is, by the regenerated spirit
As a result, whenever he comes to the church meetings and whenever we meet him, we sense that there is something of Christ in him
We have the reality of the church life and are in the Body life because our entire concept has been transformed
The old thought, the old concept, and the old way of thinking are gone, and there is something new in our thinking
It is easy to speak of the church, but the church requires us to die, to be crushed and broken, and to lose our individuality
If we remain individual grains, we will always compare ourselves with others and be aware of the differences between ourselves and others
After a number of grains have been crushed and ground into flour, there is no longer any possibility of discerning which is which
All have become flour to be blended together and made into dough, which is then put in an oven and baked to become one loaf
If we would pay the price to realize the genuine church life, we could never imagine what kind of gain we will have
If all the believers would pay the price to realize the church life, the whole world would be turned upside down
My ministry is to minister Christ to people, to help them to know Christ and to realize the genuine church life
If we love the Lord and take Him as our life, experiencing Him day by day, we will be outside the denominations
Merely to leave the denominations and attempt to practice the Body life is empty, and it is not what we are seeking today
When those in the Pentecostal movement speak of the Holy Spirit, it is not related to the experience of Christ in daily life
Apparently, in their meetings they were powerful, but as soon as they went home, the husbands lost their temper with their wives
One brother has compared the situation among the Pentecostals to the time when Abraham sent his servant to find a wife for his son Isaac
The servant gave Rebecca many gifts for the purpose of leading Rebecca to Isaac so that she might be married to him
Not only was it short-lived; it also caused much damage to the preaching of the gospel because those in that movement went to extremes
Because they felt that they were filled with the Holy Spirit, they did peculiar and even shameful things in their meetings
With the Pentecostal experiences, some part is genuinely of the Holy Spirit, but a great part is of human emotion
We may worship and serve God, but many of us simply do not realize that the God whom we worship and serve is a Spirit
Since God is Spirit, if we desire to contact God, the divine Spirit, we must contact Him in and with our spirit
The Lord clearly tells us in John 4:24 that God is Spirit and that to worship God, to contact God, we must be in spirit
The Holy Spirit of God enters into our spirit to enliven our dead spirit and also to bring the Lord Jesus as life into our spirit
Regeneration means that the Holy Spirit comes into us to impart life to us, to give us life, and to make us alive
When the Holy Spirit comes into us and enlivens our spirit, He makes our spirit alive and also imparts the Lord Jesus as life into us
We have pointed out that regeneration is the enlivening of our spirit by the Holy Spirit with the imparting of Christ as life into us
We have an inner witness which testifies that we are children of God, and nothing in the universe can ever take this away from us
According to his mind, he thought that he was not a child of God, but another part of him gave him the sense that he was a child of God
Romans 8:16 is a verse that shows us the two spirits, the Spirit of God and our spirit, working together as one
1 Corinthians 15:45 says, 'The first man, Adam, became a living soul; the last Adam became a life-giving Spirit'
At the time that He enters into us, He joins Himself with our spirit and makes our spirit and Himself as the Spirit one spirit
Our spirit and the Lord Spirit mingle together as one spirit, with the result that we become one spirit with the Lord
The fact that the Lord is the Spirit is also clearly seen in 2 Corinthians 3:17, which says, 'The Lord is the Spirit'
The Spirit referred to in 2 Corinthians 317 is the Holy Spirit the unique Spirit of God the same Spirit as mentioned earlier in the chapter
The second part of 2 Corinthians 3:17, and verse 18, continue, 'Where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is freedom
According to verse 18, we can be transformed into the image of the Lord by the Lord Spirit, and this Spirit is the Lord Himself
If we are asked where the Lord is today, we should answer not only that He is in us but also that He is in our spirit
We also need to see what our spirit is and what the difference is between our spirit and our mind, emotion, will, and heart
The spirit is the innermost part, the body is the outermost part, and the soul is in the middle as a medium between the spirit and the body
Besides the physical and the spiritual realms, there is another realm, which we may call the psychological realm
Not only are there three realms, but God has created three parts for us that we may contact these three realms
Another life, a second life, has come into our spirit, and this life is the life of God, which is Christ Himself
Once we are regenerated and the Lord Jesus as life has come into our spirit, we have another person, another life, in our spirit
If we live by our natural human life, we are a natural man, a soulish man, but if we live by our spirit, we are a spiritual man
On the day that we received the Lord Jesus, He came into our spirit as life to regenerate our spirit and cause it to be born again
We have a mind to think to consider and we have an emotion to love and to hate to like and to dislike and to be happy angry and sorrowful
As regenerated Christians, we should live, walk, and do things by our spirit, not by our mind, our emotion, or our will
To live by the mind, the emotion, and the will is to live by the soul, and to live by the soul is to live by the old self, the old man
Of living by the soul, we should live by the spirit, which is much deeper than the mind, the emotion, and the will
In order to live by the spirit, we need to see that the old man, the soulish life and nature, and the self have been crucified
As believers, we must realize the fact that our old man has been put on the cross and has thus been put to death, terminated
The Lord said in Matthew 16:24, 'If anyone wants to come after Me, let him deny himself and take up his cross and follow Me'
On the one hand, we must keep ourselves on the cross and not put the cross away; on the other hand, we must deny our self
We need to recognize this fact and apply to our self, our old man, and our old nature what the Lord has accomplished on the cross
In other words, we must reject the old man absolutely and not live by the old man, that is, by the mind, the emotion, or the will
As Christians, we need to discern what is of our spirit and what is of our soul, because we need to reject the soul
We must realize that we have already been put to an end and that our self, the old man, is good for nothing other than to be crucified
In the foregoing chapters we have seen how to apply and experience Christ and how to have a church life to realize the Body of Christ
The base of this word is of the same origin as that for pasture in John 10:9, implying a distribution of the pasture to the flock
In Gods economy in this divine household administration there are three main ministries the priesthood the kingship and the prophethood
According to the natural human concept, a priest is a professional person, a person whose profession is to serve God
The Scriptures reveal that before the ages, in eternity past before the foundation of the world, God had a good pleasure, a heart's desire
According to His good pleasure He made a purpose an intention to gain His hearts desire and He also made a plan to accomplish His purpose
In this plan He determined to work Himself into a group of people so that He might be their life and they might be His expression
Although a priest is a person who serves God, this does not mean that he works for God and does something for God
To serve God is to flow God out and, in this flow of God, to be built up with others as a corporate expression of God
We should not do anything for God but should open ourselves to Him so that He may come into us, fill us, and even flood us
When our whole being is taken over by Him, possessed by Him, and saturated and permeated with Him, we will be one with Him
When we are one with God and are in the flow of God, we will be one with one another and will be built up together in this one flow
Until we are one with the Lord, we can do nothing for Him; we can neither work for Him nor be a genuine priest
God planned to have a corporate man who would not be engaged in doing something for Him but who would be filled with Him
Even though Adam did not need to offer any sacrifices before the fall, he was continually in the presence of God
The priests who served in the tabernacle and the temple offered sacrifices in the outer court, but that was only a part of their service
The animals had to be slain, and certain parts of their bodies, with the blood, had to be offered on the altar
In the Holy Place they spread the bread on the table, lit the lamps, and burned the incense on the golden altar
All of these items-the bread, the shining of the light, and the incense of sweet odor-are related to the finer experiences of Christ
After completing his service in the Holy Place, on certain occasions the high priest entered into the Holy of Holies
In the same principle, when Moses spent forty days in the presence of Jehovah , in reality he was in the Holy of Holies
As a result, he was filled, saturated, and permeated by and with God so that eventually he became one with God
Although in a legal sense there were no other priests, in a spiritual sense many of the saints in the Old Testament were priests
When we read their writings, we realize that they were genuine priests because they spent much time in the presence of God
It is not a matter of working in this or that way; it is not a matter of method, form, or any kind of teaching or gift
Rather, it is a matter of being filled and possessed by the Lord and of being fully, thoroughly, and wholly permeated by and with Him
In this flow we have our work and service to the Lord, the church life, the Body life, and the building up of the Body
We all must be filled with God, taken over by Him, possessed by Him, and saturated and permeated with His shekinah glory
All Christian work and service, the building of the church, and the reaching out to others must come forth from this priesthood
For this we must spend adequate time in His presence, allowing Him take us over, possess us, and even saturate us with Himself
Now the church is but the priesthood Thus the priesthood formed we need When the priests are knit together Then the church is built indeed
Through the church's degradation, Saints this office desolate; Through the weakness of their spirits Preaching doth predominate
Most are leaning on the message And the preaching emphasize, Yet neglect the priestly praying And their spirits' exercise
Only serving by our praying Will our spirits mingled be; Stressing prayer as much as preaching- Thus the church is built for Thee
