   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Leadership Depending upon Teaching</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Paul s leadership goes through the second section of Acts to the end of Hebrews.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>His leadership was altogether based upon his divine revelation because in the divine revelation the design can be seen.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In other words, the divine revelation is the blueprint, the design.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Regardless of how much Barnabas could do or Apollos could teach, they never put out a design, a blueprint.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>We cannot read one chapter of Barnabas s or Apollos s writings in the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>But Paul has fourteen Epistles in the Scriptures.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>His blueprint is perfect, completed, and finished in all details.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>We do not have another blueprint.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>If there were two blueprints and two designers in the building work, this would create trouble and confusion.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Some would build and others would tear down.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>While the building is going on, there would be fighting.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Paul s leadership was based upon his divine revelation, which is the real design of God s building.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The designer s instructions concerning the building are according to his blueprint.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>In the Lord s move on this earth from Acts through Hebrews, there was one teaching and one leadership based upon this one teaching.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>In the first twelve chapters of Acts was the teaching given by Peter, and the leadership was based upon his teaching.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Thus, the leadership was with Peter.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>In the last sixteen chapters of Acts was the teaching and the revelation of Paul, and the leadership was based upon his teaching.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Thus, the leadership was with Paul.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>TAKING THE WORD OF THE LEADERSHIP</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>In both of these leaderships, there was the practice of taking the word of the leadership.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Paul told Timothy to go somewhere and he went 1 Cor 4:17 .</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Paul told another one to stay in a certain place and he stayed Titus 1:5 .</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Today s practice is that the one taking the lead would not dare to say, Brother so-and-so, go to that place.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Today s leaders would not do this.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Everybody pretends to be so spiritual.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>A brother in the leadership may tell another brother, In these days I have been very much with the Lord concerning your future.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>I feel that you need to go to the Lord and see what he will tell you concerning going to Greece.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Then the brother may respond that he is not clear, so he will go to the Lord and pray.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Actually, this brother has already decided that he would never go to Greece.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Greece was not his choice, but he was pretending to be very spiritual.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>He would not say that he did not like Greece.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Instead he would say, I will bring this matter to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>I will pray and seek the Lord s leading.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Deep in his being, though, he has already made the decision not to go.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>He may wait for a whole week before he would let the brother who is taking the lead know what his decision is.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>When he comes back he might say, I have been praying desperately, day after day, and I was made clear that the Lord does not want me to go to Greece.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>This is very spiritual.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The leader is spiritual and the follower is spiritual, but there is no spirituality.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Then who goes to Greece?</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Maybe only a brother who could not do anything would feel burdened to go.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>This is today s poor situation.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>From 1932 to 1949 in mainland China I had no thought about being in the leadership and I never wanted to be a leader.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>In this matter of sending others, not only did others pretend to be spiritual but I did also.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>I may have been so sure that a certain brother should go to Greece, but I did not want to be considered as a dictator or be misunderstood as being a pope who gives decrees to others.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>I may have said to a brother, Do you realize that in Greece there is some need?</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Would you please pray about this, and pray to the Lord to see if you are the right person to go?</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Actually within me, the brother I was talking to was the right person already.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>I confess that I was timid because I was quite concerned about being designated as a dictator or controller.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>I can boast that no church in the United States has ever received a letter from me telling them what to do.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>The leading ones in the churches can testify this for me.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Whenever the brothers came to me, I always told them to go back to the Lord and pray.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Some have said that there is no need to go to Brother Lee because he always answers the same way Go to the Lord and pray.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Seemingly I was spiritual, yet there was some pretense.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>I must confess that none among us, including me, dared to practice the truth in the genuineness of the proper way.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>In the Acts and the Epistles Paul told Timothy and his other co-workers to go to certain places, to remain in other places, and to come to him Acts 17:14-15; 19:22; Phil 2:19, 25; Col 4:7-8; 1 Tim 1:3; 2 Tim 4:9, 11-12, 21; Titus 1:5; 3:12 .</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>He gave the orders.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>There was not one among his co-workers who received an order from him that would say, Let me pray for a couple of days and I will let you know.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Their practice was absolutely different from our present practice because they all honored the same leadership based upon the same divine revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>We have not practiced in this way because of the strong background and heavy surrounding of Christianity.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>On the one hand, control is practiced along with hierarchy, especially in Catholicism with the pope as the highest authority.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Then there is the so-called freedom, which is actually a kind of scattering or dispersion.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>This kind of so-called freedom, which is actually a dispersion or scattering, is worse than controlling because it does more damage to the church, the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>To some extent controlling is always hated.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>But the dispersion or scattering under the cloak of freedom is somewhat welcomed.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>In Protestantism both control and dispersion can be seen.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>A capable minister, a strong and knowledgeable teacher, might exercise control.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Others would not go along with this kind of control.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>They want to stay in a kind of dispersed freedom.</S>
