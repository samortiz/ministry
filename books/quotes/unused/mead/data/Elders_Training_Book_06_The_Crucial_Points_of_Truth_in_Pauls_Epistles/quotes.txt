[1]  Elders Training, Book 06: The Crucial Points of Truth in Paul s Epistles CONTENTS
[2]  CHAPTER ONE THE CRUCIAL POINTS OF THE TRUTH GETTING PREPARED FOR THE MEETINGS
[3]  All of the elders need to take the way of labor to bring all the saints into the truth and into their function in life for the Body of Christ.
[4]  We should still meet at the same time on the same day, but before we go to any meetings we need to get ourselves prepared.
[5]  They should concentrate themselves on Christ being God s wisdom and power to us and God having put us into Christ, who became wisdom to us as our righteousness, sanctification, and redemption.
[6]  Romans 1:3 and 4 tell us that the gospel of God is concerning His Son, Jesus Christ our Lord, who came out of the seed of David according to the flesh, and was designated the Son of God in power according to the Spirit of holiness out of the resurrection of the dead.
[7]  First, the gospel of God is concerning a Person and this Person is Jesus Christ.
[8]  Christ as the righteousness of God is given to us, so the power of the gospel of God is actually Christ as the righteousness of God.
[9]  For the wrath of God is revealed from heaven upon all ungodliness and unrighteousness of men who hold down the truth in unrighteousness, because that which may be known of God is manifest among them, for God has manifested it to them.
[10]  God s eternal power and His divinity, which is the divine characteristics of God manifested in His creation, is a very good point for gospel preaching.
[11]  Romans 3:23-26 says, For all have sinned and come short of the glory of God; being justified freely by His grace through the redemption in Christ Jesus: whom God set forth a propitiation-cover through faith in His blood, for the showing forth of His righteousness in respect of the passing by of the sins that occurred before in the forbearance of God; for the showing forth of His righteousness in the present time, that He should be just and justify the one who is of the faith of Jesus.
[12]  Romans 4:17 says, As it is written, I have appointed you a father of many nations, before the God whom he believed, who gives life to the dead and calls the things not being as being.
[13]  In Romans 7 and 8 there are four laws.
[14]  The law of God is the outward law written in letters 7:22 .
[15]  For this crucial point we have to read 9:14-18.
[16]  By studying these verses along with the Life-study Messages, you will get a clear picture of God s selection in His mercy.
[17]  Romans 9:16 tells us that it is not of the one who wills, nor of the one who runs, but of God, the One who shows mercy.
[18]  Romans 14 is a chapter on the church life.
[19]  Verse 17 says, For the kingdom of God is not eating and drinking, but righteousness and peace and joy in the Holy Spirit.
[20]  If we do not have such a surpassing righteousness, we cannot enter into the kingdom of the heavens v. 20 . Matthew 5 also tells us, Blessed are the peacemakers, for they shall be called sons of God v. 9 . Our Father is the God of peace Rom 15:33; 16:20 , having a peaceful life with a peaceful nature.
[21]  Romans begins from the designation of Jesus Christ to be the Son of God for the mass production of the many sons of God to be the components of the church, the members of the Body of Christ, and ends with the practice of the local churches as the expressions of the Body of Christ in many localities.
[22]  To pick up the crucial points in the New Testament books is the way for us to uplift the standard of the truth in the Lord s recovery.
[23]  Christ as the deep things of God is Christ in God s mystery as the divine blessings dispensed to us which eye has never seen, ear has never heard, and which have never come up in man s heart.
[24]  First Corinthians 4:9 says, For, I think, God has set forth us the apostles last of all, as doomed to death; because we have become a spectacle to the world, both to angels and to men.
[25]  In chapter nine the point we should pick up is the matter of running the race to obtain the reward.
[26]  In verse 17 Paul says that if he preaches the gospel voluntarily he has a reward; but if not of his own will, he has been entrusted with a stewardship.
[27]  That in preaching the gospel I may make the gospel without charge, so as not to use to the full my right in the gospel v. 18 . Then he continues in verses 24 through 27: Do you not know that those who run in a racecourse all run, but one receives the prize? So run, that you may lay hold.
[28]  Chapter twelve is mainly on the divine Trinity in the divine operations, ministries, and gifts.
[29]  Verses 4-6 say, But there are distributions of gifts, but the same Spirit; and there are distributions of ministries, and the same Lord; and there are distributions of operations, but the same God, who is operating all things in all.
[30]  This is the Triune God moving in the believers for the accomplishment of His eternal purpose to build up the church, the Body of Christ, for the expression of God.
[31]  The apostles, who preached Christ according to God s promises and lived Christ according to their preaching, and the believers who received Christ according to the apostles preaching, are attached, joined to Christ, becoming one with Him.
[32]  Second Corinthians 3:3 says, Being manifested that you are a letter of Christ ministered by us, inscribed not with ink, but with the Spirit of the living God; not in tablets of stone, but in fleshy tablets of the heart.
[33]  We, the New Testament believers, are living letters of Christ.
[34]  A letter of Christ is one composed of Christ as the content to convey and express Christ.
[35]  All believers of Christ should be such a living letter of Christ, that others may read and know Christ in their being.
[36]  The Spirit of the living God, who is the living God Himself, is not an instrument like a pen for writing, but the very element, like the ink, with which the apostles minister Christ as the content for the writing of living letters that convey Christ.
[37]  The glory here is the glory of God manifested in the face of Christ, which is God Himself shining forever in the hearts of the apostles 4:6 , surpassing the glory of the Mosaic ministry of the old covenant v. 10 . The ministry of the old covenant became one of death because the old covenant brought in condemnation unto death Rom 5:13, 18, 20-21 and death unto condemnation.
[38]  A very crucial point, the ministry of reconciliation, is found in 2 Corinthians 5:16-21.
[39]  In verse 2 Paul said, I know a man in Christ, and in verse 9 he said, And He has said to me, My grace is sufficient for you.
[40]  The next crucial point is found in 13:4 which says, For indeed He was crucified out of weakness, but He lives by the power of God.
[41]  Apparently this portion of the Word is easy to understand.
[42]  In 1:4 Paul says that Christ gave Himself for our sins, that He might rescue us out of the present evil age.
[43]  God s heart s desire is to reveal His Son in us that we may know Him, receive Him as our life John 17:3; 3:16 , and become the sons of God John 1:12; Gal 4:5-6 .
[44]  The next crucial point is in verses 19 and 20 of chapter two where Paul says, For I through law have died to law that I might live to God.
[45]  I have been crucified with Christ, and it is no longer I who live, but Christ lives in me; and the life which I now live in the flesh I live in faith, the faith of the Son of God, who loved me and gave Himself for me.
[46]  The crucial point here is that we have died to law so that we might live to God.
[47]  These messages especially point out that the Christian life is not an exchanged life, the exchange of a lower life for a higher one, but a life in union with Christ, a grafted life, the grafting of the human life into the life of Christ.
[48]  Law was the basic term of the relationship between man and God in God s Old Testament economy 3:23 ; faith is the unique requirement for man to contact God in His New Testament economy Heb 11:6 that we may participate in God s promised blessing and live Christ.
[49]  The New Testament tells us how Christ was God from the beginning, how as the Word He was incarnated to be a man, how He lived on this earth, how He died an all-inclusive death to solve all the problems and to release God s divine life, and how He resurrected to become a life-giving Spirit to enter into us.
[50]  In Galatians 3:14 Paul says, In order that the blessing of Abraham might come to the nations in Jesus Christ, that we might receive the promise of the Spirit through faith.
[51]  This verse tells us that the Spirit is the blessing of the New Testament gospel.
[52]  This is the blessing promised by God to Abraham for all the nations of the earth Gen 12:3 .
[53]  The context of 3:14 indicates that the Spirit is the blessing which God promised to Abraham for all the nations and which has been received by the believers through faith in Christ.
[54]  The Spirit is the compound Spirit, and actually is God Himself processed in His Trinity through incarnation, crucifixion, resurrection, ascension, and descension, for us to receive as our life and our everything.
[55]  Actually, the Spirit as the realization of Christ in our experience is the good land as the source of God s bountiful supply for us to enjoy.
[56]  In Galatians 1 Christ is revealed in us v. 16 , in chapter two Christ is living in us v. 20 , and in chapter four Christ is being formed in us v. 19 . Christ was born into the Galatian believers, but not formed in them, when they were regenerated through Paul s preaching of the gospel to them the first time.
[57]  The last crucial point in chapter four is the two women symbolizing the two covenants vv.
[58]  In this chapter we want to see the crucial points in Paul s Epistle to the Ephesians.
[59]  Ephesians 1:3 says, Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who has blessed us with every spiritual blessing in the heavenlies in Christ.
[60]  Paul s prayer in Ephesians 1 is a prayer for revelation.
[61]  We need to experience Christ making His home in our heart, that is, Christ settling down within us.
[62]  We are eventually filled unto all the fullness of God v. 19 . In chapter one the church is the fullness of the One Who fills all in all v. 23 and in chapter three the church is the fullness of God v. 19 . Both of Paul s prayers in chapters one and three of Ephesians are great crucial points.
[63]  The text for this crucial point is in Ephesians 5:1-15.
[64]  Verse 2 tells us to walk in love, and verse 8 tells us to walk as children of light.
[65]  In Ephesians 5:18 to be drunk with wine is to be filled in the body, whereas to be filled in the spirit our regenerated spirit, not God s Spirit is to be filled with Christ 1:23 , unto the fullness of God 3:19 .
[66]  To be drunk with wine in the body dissipates us, but to be filled with Christ, the fullness of God, causes us to overflow with Him in speaking, singing, psalming, and giving thanks to God 5:19-20 and to subject ourselves to one another v. 21 . The issue of our being filled in spirit is that we will have spirit-filled ethical relationships for the expression of the Body in the normal church life v. 22 6:9 . The proper daily life and family life is the issue of being filled in spirit.
[67]  In this chapter we shall consider the crucial points in the books of Philippians and Colossians.
[68]  The Spirit here is not merely the Spirit of God before the Lord s incarnation, but the Spirit of God, the Holy Spirit with divinity, after the Lord s resurrection, compounded with the Lord s incarnation, human living under the cross, crucifixion, and resurrection.
[69]  The second crucial point for our experience of Christ in Philippians 2 is found in verse 13.
[70]  This verse says, For it is God who operates in you both the willing and the working for His good pleasure.
[71]  The word for in verse 13 connects this verse to verse 12, and the phrase so then in verse 12 connects this portion to verses 5 through 11, which tell us to let the living mind of Christ be in us to transform us that we may live a mingled life of God and man.
[72]  Verses 10-11 say, To know Him and the power of His resurrection and the fellowship of His sufferings, being conformed to His death, if by any means I may attain to the out-resurrection from among the dead.
[73]  To know Christ here is by experience to have the experiential knowledge of Him, to experience Him in the full knowledge of Him.
[74]  The power of Christ s resurrection is His resurrection life which raised Him from among the dead.
[75]  The first crucial point of the truth in Colossians is found in 1:12.
[76]  This verse says, Giving thanks to the Father, who has qualified you for a share of the portion of the saints in the light.
[77]  In 2:16 and 17 Paul says, Let no one therefore judge you in eating and in drinking or in respect of a feast or of a new moon or of Sabbaths, which are a shadow of things to come, but the body is of Christ.
[78]  All these items of the ceremonial law are a shadow of the spiritual things in Christ, which are the things to come.
[79]  Because our life not our natural life, but our spiritual life which is Christ has been hidden with Christ in God, who is in the heavens, we should no longer care for things on the earth.
[80]  If you have ever studied 1 and 2 Thessalonians with adequate attention, you could see it is hard to separate these two books.
[81]  The second crucial point in these Epistles is at the end of 1 Thessalonians 5 a spiritual life for our full sanctification.
[82]  The items listed in verses 12-24 of chapter five show the believers cooperation in living a spiritual, separated, sanctified life, and God s operation in sanctifying and preserving the believers.
[83]  In these verses are seven points of the spiritual life: always rejoice v. 16 , unceasingly pray v. 17 , in everything give thanks; for this is the will of God in Christ Jesus for you v. 18 , do not quench the Spirit v. 19 , do not despise prophecies v. 20 , prove all things; hold fast what is good v. 21 , and finally, abstain from every form of evil v. 22 . These are the seven items that constitute a spiritual life.
[84]  In 2 Thessalonians the most crucial verse is 2:13 which says, But we ought to thank God always concerning you, brothers beloved by the Lord, because God chose you from the beginning unto salvation in sanctification of the Spirit and belief of the truth.
[85]  First Timothy unveils to us God s dispensation, His New Testament economy, concerning the church.
[86]  God s dispensation v. 4 or God s household economy Eph 1:10; 3:9 is God s household administration to dispense Himself in Christ into His chosen people, that He may have a house, a household to express Himself, which household is the church, the Body of Christ 3:15 . The apostle s ministry was centered upon this economy of God Col 1:25; 1 Cor 9:17 , whereas the different teachings of the dissenting ones were used by God s enemy to distract His people from this.
[87]  The church functions as the house and household of the living God for His move on the earth, as the supporting pillar and holding base of the truth, bearing the divine reality of Christ and His Body as a testimony to the world, and becomes the continuation of Christ s manifestation of God in the flesh.
[88]  In 1 Timothy 4:6-8 there are two important matters, the nourishing words and the exercise unto godliness.
[89]  To minister Christ to others first requires ourselves to be nourished with the words of life concerning Christ.
[90]  Having been nourished with Christ, we shall then have Christ as the food, the life-supply, the nourishing words, to minister to others.
[91]  Second Timothy is an inoculation against the decline of the church.
[92]  The way to inoculate the churches against their decline is by teaching the truth.
[93]  The crucial point in 2:18-22 is a vessel unto honor.
[94]  Honorable vessels are of both the divine nature gold and the redeemed and regenerated human nature silver .
[95]  The last point is in 4:22: The Lord be with your spirit.
[96]  In the beginning it emphasizes that a strong, loving, and sound spirit has been given to us by which we can fan the gift of God into flame and suffer evil with the gospel according to the power of God and the Lord s life-imparting grace 1:6-10 .
[97]  In the conclusion it blesses us with the emphasis of the Lord being with our spirit that we may enjoy Him as grace to stand against the down current of the church s decline and to carry out God s economy through His indwelling Spirit 1:14 and equipping Word 3:16-17 .
[98]  This grace, which is in the indestructible life, is nothing less than Christ the Son of God, who is the very embodiment of the divine life, dwelling and living in our spirit.
[99]  In Titus, for our present need, I would only cover one crucial point in 3:4-7 But when the kindness and love to man of our Savior God appeared, not by works in righteousness which we have done but according to His mercy, He saved us, through the washing of regeneration and renewing of the Holy Spirit, whom He poured out on us richly through Jesus Christ our Savior, that, having been justified by the grace of that One, we might become heirs according to the hope of eternal life.
[100]  IN HEBREWS AN INTRODUCTION TO HEBREWS God Speaking in Son
[101]  The real subject of the book of Hebrews is God speaking in the Son.
[102]  In other words, the whole book is the Son speaking God.
[103]  There are at least thirteen crucial points in the book of Hebrews which I consider to be thirteen mountain peaks.
[104]  Every chapter has a peak and we must have the view to see these peaks in Hebrews.
[105]  The crucial point in chapter one of Hebrews is that the very Son in whom God speaks is the very God v. 8 , the Creator of the universe v. 10 , the effulgence of God s glory and the express image of His substance v. 3 , God s anointed One v. 9 , and also God s firstborn Son v. 6 . When God will send the Son back He will be the firstborn Son of God.
[106]  7, 9 , a man with blood and flesh who destroyed the Devil, who has the might of death, on the cross v. 14 . He made propitiation for the sins of God s people v. 17 . He was made a little inferior to the angels, yet He destroyed the Devil and He was glorified, crowned with glory and honor v. 7 . He also produced many brothers or many sons in addition to Himself as the firstborn Son of God, and He made them a church vv.
