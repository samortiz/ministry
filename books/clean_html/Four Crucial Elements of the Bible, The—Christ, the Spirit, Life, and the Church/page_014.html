<p>In the record of the four Gospels the Lord Jesus twice fed, in a miraculous way, the crowds who followed Him (Matt. 14:14-21; 15:32-39; Mark 6:30-44; Luke 9:10-17; John 6:1-13). On the first occasion there were five thousand, counting only the men. At that time John the Baptist had been beheaded. The Lord Jesus withdrew to a deserted place, but a great crowd followed Him. He was moved with compassion for them and healed their sick. He also spoke the word of God to them all day until evening. The disciples came to Him, saying, “This place is deserted and the hour is already late. Send the crowds away that they may go into the villages and buy food for themselves” (Matt. 14:15). However, the Lord had mercy on the crowds and told the disciples to prepare food for them. The disciples were troubled, saying, “We do not have anything here except five loaves and two fish” (v. 17). The Lord told them to bring the five loaves and the two fish to Him, and He commanded the crowds to recline in companies, by hundreds and by fifties. Then the Lord “took the five loaves and the two fish and, looking up to heaven, He blessed and broke the loaves and gave them to the disciples to set before them; and the two fish He divided among all. And they all ate and were satisfied” (Mark 6:41-42). The disciples took up what was left over of the broken pieces, which were twelve full handbaskets. This shows us that the Lord Jesus conducted Himself in a way that was not only wise, skillful, fine, and dignified, but also extraordinary and excellent beyond the description of any human language.<p>Today those of us who have some amount of experience of the Lord can testify that when we love Him, pursue Him, and fellowship with Him, we spontaneously live in a condition that is beyond human description. We can endure what others cannot, and we can live a life that others cannot, even a life that goes beyond humility and meekness. We can live such a life because we live by the Lord. The Lord Jesus was a great mystery when He was on the earth. Hence, as the followers of Jesus, we also become a mystery which is incomprehensible to others. At times they think that we should lose our temper, yet we behave as if nothing has happened. At other times, they think that we should jump with joy, yet we act as usual. When they think that we should weep, we still can praise, and when they think that we should exult, we bow down in worship. We live not according to the environment but according to the Lord’s moving and leading within. Sometimes our environment is very good, and apparently we should be happy and rejoicing. Nevertheless, within we feel that we have fallen short of the Lord’s glory, that we have not sufficiently caused those who are around us to know the Lord, and that we have not adequately expressed Him and lived Him out before them; therefore, we weep in self-reproach. This is the mystery of being a Christian, which is incomprehensible to the Gentiles.<p>The Lord Jesus appeared before men truly as a genuine man. He was not only transcendent and unparalleled but also full of emotion. When He went to the tomb of Lazarus, He wept in front of the people. The Jews said, “Behold how He loved him!” (John 11:35-36). The Lord Jesus wept, however, not because Lazarus had died but because no one there knew God or God’s heart, and no one was truly united with God to live with God and live out God. Not only the Jews, but even the disciples and the family of Martha, Mary, and Lazarus, who were with the Lord for such a long time and were very much acquainted with Him, did not know God’s doings. Being grieved in spirit and unable to utter anything, He wept. There are many illustrations in the Gospels showing us that the Lord lived a human life, yet it was a life that surpassed humility, meekness, kindness, and holiness. His life was transcendent yet truly human.
