[1]  The Conclusion of the New Testament #276-294 CONTENTS
[2]  276: Experiencing and Enjoying Christ in the Gospels and in Acts 12
[3]  The Word became flesh and tabernacled among us v. 14a . For the Word as God to become flesh, that is, to be incarnated, is for God to have the human life and the human nature.
[4]  John 1:30-33 indicates that we may experience and enjoy Christ as the Baptizer.
[5]  In verse 33 John the Baptist said, He who sent me to baptize in water, He said to me, He upon whom you see the Spirit descending and abiding upon Him, this is He who baptizes in the Holy Spirit.
[6]  The Holy Spirit, into whom Christ has baptized the believers, is the Spirit of Christ and the Spirit of God Rom 8:9 .
[7]  The dove signifies that Christ, the One who became the tabernacle and who is all the offerings, has become a life-giving Spirit to impart God into all those who accept the offerings in order to enter into God.
[8]  After speaking about His body being destroyed, the Lord Jesus said, In three days I will raise it up v. 19b . The words in three days signify in resurrection.
[9]  After Satan destroyed the Lord s physical body on the cross, His body was put into a tomb and rested there.
[10]  John 3:19 through 21 speaks of Christ as the light.
[11]  According to the context, truth here denotes uprightness as opposed to evil , which is the reality manifested in a man who lives in God according to what He is, and which corresponds with the divine light, which is God, as the source of the truth, manifested in Christ.
[12]  In John 3:30 John the Baptist said, He must increase, but I must decrease.
[13]  For Christ to increase and for John the Baptist to decrease means that John had to withdraw from the scene and from having a following; he had to allow Christ to be the only figure on the scene and to have all the following.
[14]  Christ increases Himself by speaking God s word to spread God and by giving the Spirit of God to be the reality of what He has spoken in order to dispense the eternal life into people, making them Godkind, the children of God, the species of God, the family of God, to be Christ s increase.
[15]  Our thirst can be quenched only by the living person of Christ, the Son of God, who has been given to us by God.
[16]  John 3:16a says that God so loved the world, that is, sinful, fallen people, that He gave His only begotten Son, His expression, that they might obtain His eternal life to become His many sons and be His corporate expression for the fulfillment of His eternal New Testament economy.
[17]  In John 4 Christ is also presented as the Messiah.
[18]  The Samaritan woman said to the Lord Jesus, I know that Messiah is coming He who is called Christ ; when He comes, He will declare all things to us v. 25 . Jesus responded by saying, I, who speak to you, am He v. 26 .
[19]  In 5:17 the Lord Jesus declared that the Father was working and that He also was working.
[20]  In verse 19 He went on to say, Truly, truly, I say to you, The Son can do nothing from Himself except what He sees the Father doing, for whatever that One does, these things the Son also does in like manner.
[21]  Although God s work in creation was finished Gen 2:1-3 , the Father and the Son were still working for redemption and building.
[22]  Neither did they know that the Father and the Son were still working for fallen man s redemption in order to fulfill God s original purpose, which is the building of God s eternal habitation.
[23]  John 6 reveals that we may experience and enjoy Christ as the Passover Lamb and the bread of life.
[24]  He is the redeeming Lamb of God John 1:29, 36 slain for us that we may eat His flesh and drink His blood, taking Him in as our life supply that we may live by Him.
[25]  2 Imparting His Life into Us for Our Nourishment
[26]  As the Passover Lamb Christ not only shed His blood for our redemption; He also imparts His life into us for our nourishment.
[27]  Concerning this, in verse 51 the Lord Jesus said, I am the living bread which came down out of heaven; if anyone eats of this bread, he shall live forever.
[28]  In John 6 there are six sections related to Christ as the bread of life vv.
[29]  In this message we will consider the aspects of the experience and enjoyment of Christ revealed in chapters seven and eight of the Gospel of John.
[30]  The Spirit of God was there from the beginning Gen 1:1-2 , but at the time the Lord Jesus cried out at the feast, the Spirit as the Spirit of Christ Rom 8:9 , the Spirit of Jesus Christ Phil 1:19 , was not yet because Jesus had not yet been glorified.
[31]  After Jesus resurrection the Spirit of God became the Spirit of the incarnated, crucified, and resurrected Jesus Christ, who was breathed into the disciples by Christ in the evening of the day on which He was resurrected John 20:22 .
[32]  After He became the Spirit of Jesus Christ through Christ s incarnation, crucifixion, and resurrection, the Spirit had both the divine element and the human element, with all the essence and reality of the incarnation, crucifixion, and resurrection of Christ.
[33]  As the I Am, the Lord Jesus existed before Abraham.
[34]  The Lord Jesus as the great I Am is the eternal, ever-existing God.
[35]  John 9 also reveals that we receive light for our sight through our obedience, which washes away our old humanity.
[36]  In verse 7a the Lord Jesus said to the blind man whose eyes had been anointed with the clay, Go, wash in the pool of Siloam which is interpreted, Sent .
[37]  Verses 1-4 and 9 show us that Christ is the door of the sheep.
[38]  Christ is the door not only for God s elect to enter into the custody of the law, as did Moses, David, Isaiah, and Jeremiah in the Old Testament time, before Christ came, but also for God s chosen people, such as Peter, John, James, and Paul, to come out of the fold of the law now that Christ has come.
[39]  Christ is the pasture of the sheep for the Old Testament saints, who go out of the custody of the law, to feed on.
[40]  The one flock signifies the one church, the one Body of Christ Eph 2:14-16; 3:6 , brought forth by the Lord s eternal, divine life, which He imparted into His members through His death and resurrection.
[41]  As the One who is the Shepherd, the door, and the pasture, the Lord Jesus forms His sheep into one flock, the one universal church, the one Body of Christ, consisting of all the believers in Christ.
[42]  For us to be fed with Christ as the rich pasture of life is for us to be flocked together with God s other sheep to be His organic Body to arrive at the ultimate goal of God s economy the New Jerusalem.
[43]  The Grain of Wheat and the Light a. The Grain of Wheat
[44]  John 12:23-24 reveals that Christ is a grain of wheat for His divine multiplication.
[45]  As such a grain of wheat, Christ is the divine seed to produce many grains the people who receive Him to become His many members who constitute His organic Body which consummates in the New Jerusalem.
[46]  4 The Believers Enjoying Him as the Life Essence
[47]  The believers may enjoy Christ as the life essence through His death and resurrection; that is, they may enjoy Him as the life essence released through His death and dispensed through His resurrection.
[48]  The Lord, as a grain of wheat falling into the ground, lost His soul-life through death that He might release His eternal life in resurrection to the many grains.
[49]  To lose our soul-life is to follow Him that we may serve Him and walk with Him on this way, the way of losing the soul-life and living in His resurrection.
[50]  In this message we will consider the aspects of the experience and enjoyment of Christ in chapter thirteen of the Gospel of John.
[51]  Verse 3 indicates the reason why the Lord washed the disciples feet: He knew that the Father had given all into His hands and that He had come forth from God and was going to God.
[52]  3 With the Spirit, the Word, and the Life,
[53]  The Lord Jesus washed the disciples feet with water v. 5 . Water here signifies the Holy Spirit Titus 3:5 , the Word Eph 5:26; John 15:3 , and the life 19:34 . The Lord washes us spiritually by the working of the Holy Spirit, by the enlightening of the Word, and by the operating of the inner law of life.
[54]  In the next four messages we will consider the aspects of the experience and enjoyment of Christ in chapters fourteen through seventeen of the Gospel of John.
[55]  Furthermore, the many abodes in John 14:2 are the many members of the Body of Christ v. 23; Rom 12:5 , which is God s temple 1 Cor 3:16-17 . The Father s house is the resurrected temple Christ raised up with His members, His believers John 2:19-21 . According to Ephesians 2:6 and 1 Peter 1:3, we, the members of Christ, have been raised up with Him.
[56]  It was through His death and in His resurrection that Christ was enlarged with His believers to be the Father s house a mutual abode where God abides in man and man abides in God.
[57]  Christ as the Father s house the mutual abode of God and man was enlarged with His believers to be God s full expression not only through His going His death, but also in His coming His resurrection.
[58]  Speaking of His resurrection, the Lord said in verse 3, I am coming again.
[59]  This word refers to Christ in His resurrection coming to His disciples.
[60]  According to verse 6, Jesus said to Thomas, I am the way and the reality and the life; no one comes to the Father except through Me. This verse reveals that Christ the Son is the way and that the Father is the where destination . Therefore, both the way and the where are living persons; Christ the Son, the living person, is the way, and the Father, the living person, is the destination.
[61]  b The Reality to Make the Way Real for Us
[62]  This chapter unfolds that the Triune God the Father, the Son, and the Spirit is dispensing Himself into His believers in Jesus Christ.
[63]  Hence, this Triune God the Father in the Son and the Son as the Spirit dispenses Himself into us to be our portion that we may enjoy Him as our everything in His Divine Trinity.
[64]  However, Philip replied, Lord, show us the Father and it is sufficient for us v. 8 . To this the Lord Jesus answered, He who has seen Me has seen the Father; how is it that you say, Show us the Father? v. 9 . In the Son the Father is expressed and seen, for the Son is the expression of the Father.
[65]  John 14:16-20 reveals that Christ as the expression of the Father is realized as the Spirit.
[66]  The Father is embodied and expressed in the Son among the believers, and Christ the Son is realized as the Spirit entering into and abiding in the believers.
[67]  As the expression of the Father realized as the Spirit, Christ comes to us with the Father and makes an abode with us vv.
[68]  In John 15 we see that Christ as the embodiment of the Triune God is the true vine.
[69]  Christ the Son as the true vine with the believers as its branches is the organism of the Triune God in God s economy, the divine dispensing, to grow with His riches and express the divine life.
[70]  John 15 reveals not only Christ the Son as the vine but also the Father as the husbandman, the Body of Christ as the branches of the vine, and God the Spirit as the Spirit of reality.
[71]  Christ as the true vine, with His believers as the branches, is the organism of the Triune God.
[72]  As the branches of the true vine, we are the multiplication of Christ, the duplication of Christ, the spreading of Christ, and the enlargement of Christ.
[73]  Just as our human body, as an organism, functions to contain us, express us, and take action for us, Christ as the organism of the Triune God functions to contain the Triune God and express the Triune God.
[74]  Whom the Son Sent from and with the Father
[75]  According to John 15:26, the Spirit of reality whom the Son sent from and with the Father testifies concerning the Son as the vine; hence, the Spirit testifies to the branches and through the branches to the world.
[76]  In 15:26-27 the Lord Jesus said, But when the Comforter comes, whom I will send to you from the Father, the Spirit of reality, who proceeds from the Father, He will testify concerning Me; and you testify also, because from the beginning you have been with Me. This indicates that the Holy Spirit is the reality of all things, and we are to be witnesses of the Spirit of reality.
[77]  In eternity Christ was the only begotten Son of God, in incarnation He was born of Mary to be the Son of Man, and in resurrection He had another birth to be the firstborn Son of God Rom 8:29b .
[78]  Thus, 1 Peter 1:3 says, Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who according to His great mercy has regenerated us unto a living hope through the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead.
[79]  In resurrection Christ was born as a newborn child to be the firstborn Son of God with His believers to be His many brothers.
[80]  According to John 16, it is by the work of the Spirit that we become the many brothers of Christ, the members of Christ.
[81]  It is also through the transmission of the Holy Spirit that we become the many brothers, the members of Christ as the newborn child.
[82]  As we have seen, the first category of the Spirit s work is to convict people, that is, to convince sinners to repent, believe, and be regenerated.
[83]  The second category of the Spirit s work is the Holy Spirit s dwelling in the regenerated believers to reveal Christ, to glorify Christ, and to make Christ real in the believers 16:12-15 .
[84]  In John 16:13-15 the Lord says, But when He, the Spirit of reality, comes, He will guide you into all the reality; for He will not speak from Himself, but what He hears He will speak; and He will declare to you the things that are coming.
[85]  The work of the Spirit is not only to convict the sinners that they might believe in Christ and be transferred out of Adam into Christ; it is also to reveal Christ with the fullness of the Father to all of these transferred believers that they might be built up with all the fullness of the Godhead in order to express the Triune God and to glorify the Son with the Father.
[86]  In the foregoing messages, we saw three aspects of Christ as the embodiment of the Triune God: the Father s house John 14 , the true vine John 15 , and the newborn child John 16 .
[87]  Christ is the house for God to have a mutual abiding place for His rest, satisfaction, and manifestation.
[88]  Christ was glorified by the Father with the divine glory in His resurrection.
[89]  John 7:39b says, The Spirit was not yet, because Jesus had not yet been glorified.
[90]  Many readers of the Bible might find this verse easier to understand if resurrected were used instead of glorified, for then the verse would say, The Spirit was not yet, because Jesus had not yet been resurrected.
[91]  This refers to His resurrection v. 46 , which brought Him into glory 1 Cor 15:43a; Acts 3:13a, 15a . For Christ to enter into His glory, into His glorification, was for Him to enter into His resurrection.
[92]  2 Through the Organic Union of Christ s Believers
[93]  In John 15 the fact of our being in Christ and Christ being in us is clearly revealed vv.
[94]  He prayed so that we would realize that we are in Him just as He is in the Father, and He is in us just as the Father is in Him.
[95]  The experience and enjoyment of Christ as the redeeming and life-imparting One is based upon the two aspects of the Lord s death: the redemptive aspect signified by the blood and the life-imparting aspect signified by the water in John 19:34.
[96]  In John 20 Christ is revealed as the resurrected One who brought His believers into God the Father and breathed the Holy Spirit into His believers.
[97]  The Lord s word to Mary indicated that in resurrection His disciples had become the same as He insofar as they also were sons of God.
[98]  By making His Father and His God theirs, He has brought them into His position the position of the Son before the Father and God.
[99]  First, He took the step of incarnation to become a man in the flesh v. 14 , to be the Lamb of God to accomplish redemption for man v. 29 , to declare God to man v. 18 , and to manifest the Father to His believers 14:9-11 . Second, He took the step of death and resurrection to be transfigured into the Spirit that He might impart Himself into His believers as their life and their everything for the building up of His Body, the church, the habitation of God, to express the Triune God for eternity.
[100]  It is as the Spirit that He can live in the disciples and they can live by Him and with Him v. 19 . It is also as the Spirit that He can abide in the disciples and they can abide in Him v. 20; 15:4-5 . It is as the Spirit that He can come with the Father to the one who loves Him and make an abode with him 14:23 . It is as the Spirit that He came to meet with His brothers as the church to declare the Father s name to them and to praise Him in their midst Heb 2:11-12 . And it is as the Spirit that He can send His disciples with His commission, with Himself as life and everything to them, in the same way that the Father sent Him John 20:21 .
[101]  In John 21:15-22 Christ is unveiled as the Chief Shepherd.
[102]  In resurrection Christ worked and walked with the believers as the Chief Shepherd to build up the church by shepherding His flock 1 Pet 5:4 .
[103]  As the great Shepherd in resurrection Heb 13:20 , the Lord charged His disciples to feed and shepherd His lambs and sheep at the cost of their life and to glorify God by following His pattern of laying down His soul-life for the sheep John 21:19b-22; 10:11, 15b .
[104]  In saying this to Peter, the Lord was signifying by what kind of death he would glorify God v. 19a . After predicting Peter s martyrdom, the Lord said to him, Follow Me v. 19b . We all must follow the Lord as the good Shepherd who laid down His life for the sheep 10:11, 15b . Our following Him even unto death is to glorify God 21:19 . This shows us that after we have been regenerated and commissioned by the Lord, we must love the Lord at any cost and follow Him to the end at any sacrifice.
[105]  During these forty days, Christ as the One in resurrection also spoke to the disciples the things concerning the kingdom of God.
[106]  Eventually, it will consummate in the New Jerusalem as the eternal kingdom of God and the eternal realm of the eternal blessing of God s eternal life for all God s redeemed to enjoy in the new heaven and new earth.
[107]  The disciples must have begun to see that the kingdom of God is the spreading of Christ as life to His believers, that it is the propagation of Christ as life to His believers to form a realm in which God rules in His life.
[108]  As the One in ascension, He was made Lord the Lord of all to possess all 10:36 and Christ God s Anointed to carry out God s commission Heb 1:9 .
[109]  In fact, the pouring out of the Holy Spirit is a proof that God has exalted the Lord Jesus and has made Him both Lord and Christ.
[110]  Acts 2:36 says, Therefore let all the house of Israel know assuredly that God has made Him both Lord and Christ, this Jesus whom you have crucified.
[111]  But as man, He was made the Lord in His ascension after He brought His humanity into God in His resurrection.
[112]  After Jesus was crucified and buried, God resurrected Him and set Him at His right hand, making this Jesus, a Nazarene, the Lord of all the universe.
[113]  He was called Christ from His birth, was anointed at His baptism 3:13-17 , and was called the Christ by Peter: You are the Christ, the Son of the living God 16:16 .
[114]  OF THE NEW TESTAMENT MESSAGE TWO HUNDRED NINETY-TWO EXPERIENCING AND ENJOYING CHRIST
[115]  In Acts 5:30-32 Christ is revealed as the Leader and Savior: The God of our fathers has raised Jesus, whom you slew by hanging Him on a tree.
[116]  Jesus incarnation made Him a man, His human living on earth qualified Him to be man s Savior, His crucifixion accomplished full redemption for man, His resurrection vindicated His redemptive work, and His exaltation inaugurated Him to be the ruling Leader so that He might be the Savior.
[117]  In Acts 10:36 Peter speaks of Christ as the One who is Lord of all.
[118]  Christ in His ascension is the Lord not only of the Jews but also of the Gentiles.
[119]  Acts 10:39-43 indicates that Christ was done away with on a tree by the Jews, raised on the third day by God, and designated by God to be the Judge of the living and the dead; whoever believes in Him receives forgiveness of sins.
[120]  The Gospel of John emphasizes that Jesus Christ is the Son of God and that as the Son of God He is the embodiment of the divine life 1:4 .
[121]  In 13:34 Paul speaks a further word regarding the resurrection of Christ: As to His having raised Him up from the dead, no longer to return to corruption, He spoke in this way, I will give you the holy things of David, the faithful things.
[122]  Verse 33 indicates that Christ s resurrection was His second birth to bring Him forth as the firstborn Son of God.
[123]  The phrase the holy things of David, the faithful things indicates that Christ was of David, for it was out of David s seed that God raised up such a One.
[124]  The Spirit of Jesus is not only the Spirit of God with divinity in Him that we may live the divine life but also the Spirit of the man Jesus with humanity in Him that we may live the proper human life and endure its sufferings.
[125]  In Acts 16 we see that the move of the apostles in their evangelistic work was, strictly speaking, not by the Spirit of God.
[126]  Rather, it was by the Holy Spirit, who was involved with the Lord s incarnation and birth, and by the Spirit of Jesus, who was involved with the Lord s humanity, human living, death, resurrection, and ascension.
[127]  When we have this Holy Spirit and the Spirit of Jesus, we have Christ in His incarnation, in His humanity and human living, and in His death, resurrection, and ascension.
[128]  The Spirit of Jesus is the Spirit of the One with humanity, who lived a human life on earth for thirty-three and a half years, who died an all-inclusive death, who resurrected from the dead to propagate the divine life by imparting it into all His believers, and who ascended to the heavens to be made Lord and Christ.
[129]  In Acts 20:28 we see Christ as God: Take heed to yourselves and to all the flock, among whom the Holy Spirit has placed you as overseers to shepherd the church of God, which He obtained through His own blood.
[130]  This verse reveals that Christ as our God is the Purchaser of the church, having obtained the church with His own blood.
[131]  God s own blood is the blood of Jesus Christ 1 John 1:7 .
[132]  God s purchasing the church with His blood indicates the precious love of God for the church and the preciousness, the exceeding worth, of the church in the eyes of God.
[133]  In his defense before Agrippa, Paul says that he did not testify anything apart from the things which both the prophets and Moses said were about to take place, that the Christ would suffer and that He, being the first to rise from the dead, would announce light both to the people and to the Gentiles v. 23 . Literally, the Greek words rendered would suffer mean was to be subject to suffering.
[134]  The word light here indicates the enlightenment of God, who is light 1 John 1:5 , shining in Christ, who is the light of the world John 8:12; 9:5 , through the preaching of the gospel of the glory of Christ 2 Cor 4:4, 6 .
[135]  In Acts 26:18 we see that when our eyes are opened and we have a turn, a transfer, from darkness and satanic authority to light and God, we may receive forgiveness of sins.
