Fortunately, under the Lord's sovereignty, we have with us the remaining manuscripts of the brief records by Brother Weigh and his wife
Except for some slight adjustments in sentence structure, the majority of the material is presented as found in the manuscripts
The first section comprises notes of private fellowship between Brother Nee and Brother Weigh in Foochow during September of 1947
It includes four conference meetings, four fellowship meetings, one gospel meeting, and one account of private fellowship
The main burdens of these meetings are the believers' living by the life of God and the proper way to serve in the church
The fourth section comprises fellowship and messages of a nationwide co-workers' conference in Shanghai during April and May of 1948
During this period, most of Brother Nee's talks were given in the co-workers' meetings rather than in the church meetings

It is a small thing for you to answer my question today, but how would you answer the Lord that day at the judgment seat?
There are many who have proclaimed themselves to be believers, and it is not necessary for you to tell others that you are zealous

If you practice this, after a while, your emotions, desires, and thoughts will become one with God, and spontaneously God will fill you up
To be a Christian, a person must not only walk according to the teachings of the Bible, but walk according to the inner feeling
A weighty and proper Christian is one who reads the Bible, on the one hand, and walks according to the inner feelings, on the other hand
While you are helping such a one, you do so by trusting in the strength of the Lord all the time and acting according to the inner feeling
Day by day, you will have more of the Lord, and gradually your thoughts and your natural disposition will decrease
When you have God's life, nature, thoughts, and love within you, and when you are filled with Him, God's desire will be accomplished

In reading the Bible, in praying, and in working for the Lord, the most important thing is that the person has to be right

The important thing is not that your prayer be beautiful, but that while you pray, God has one more chance to pass through you
Pay attention to what lies behind the thing itself, to whether or not in doing such a thing, you are allowing the Lord to be the Head

If you love enough, you will be able to obey what others cannot obey, and you will be able to do what others cannot do
The Lord's abiding in us is based upon our abiding in Him, while our abiding in Him is based upon our being in Him

Brother Ho asked: How can we tell the difference between the feeling of the spirit and the feeling of the conscience?

One day, when the time came, all the brothers and sisters rose up to preach the gospel, and we baptized one hundred two people
Three or four of these denominational churches could seat over a thousand people, yet their numbers were still less than ours
My hope is to fellowship with the brothers and sisters, and especially with those who are involved with the Lord's service
Today, we are not merely hoping to see many people saved and revived; what we hope to see is not that kind of work of the Holy Spirit
When that happens, God will have a way, and He will be able to flow out of us, and others will receive the blessing
Within us, we do not have to pray for others, or to pray for this meeting, and we do not have to pray for the Lord to bless this meeting

We are not doing a mortician's job here, improving men's outward appearance a little and eventually burying them in the ground
In order to learn to serve God and to work for Him, a Christian must learn to stay away from the tree of the knowledge of good and evil
Suppose a brother or a sister is very meek, submissive to his or her parents, and full of all kinds of virtues
The love and humility that issue from the tree of the knowledge of good and evil will result in the lake of fire
Man is divided into three parts, which are, from the inside to the outside: the spirit, the soul, and the body
There is warring because the body wants to sin while the mind wants to do good and in making up ones mind to do good there is the conflict
It also mentions to 'delight' , which is a question of the emotion, and 'to do the good' , which is a function of the mind
The 'reason' there is the law of good in the created life, and the 'lust' there is the law of evil in the body
The conflict between reason and lust as described by the Chinese is similar to the conflict described in Romans 7
Although the law of the mind tells him not to take opium, once the opium-burner is lighted, he begins to take the opium again
Then when they are stirred up again, their faces turn red, and they are led to do things against their will again
When the law of evil in their body is activated, they lose their temper again, and the reason is once more overcome by the lust

When a wife submits to her husband, and children submit to their parents, these submissions may be something according to the first law
There are those who say that if others hit them, they would surely retaliate, and they would retaliate in a stronger way than they were hit
If you can hit your wife in peace, and if by hitting her, you can be brought to God, go ahead and hit her some more
On the other hand, if by loving your wife you can gain the peace and can bring God into you, you should go ahead and love her more
At the end, they would point out how one can obtain such truth, what one should do first, and what he should do next
In preaching the Lords word we have to look to the work of the Holy Spirit and our being has to go out with the release of the Lords word

A Christian does not smoke, not because smoking will not glorify God, but because smoking is contrary to his taste within
You do not have to teach him not to swallow it; it is not a question of mental knowledge, but a question of life-taste
If you have life, you will surely have the taste, and once you have the taste, you will surely have the feeling
Although the child could not distinguish between salt and sugar with his eyes, when he ate it, his taste told him the difference
They live according to the outward standard of good and evil, and not according to the inner sense, taste, and law
There was a story in The Christian magazine which said that once, after Moody preached the gospel, a lady told him, 'I am a Christian

His only intention is to work Himself into you and to fill you up, so that day by day and year by year He would become ripened within you
To turn our hearts to the Lord means to have a pure heart for the Lord; only people with such a heart do not have veils
The artificial flower cannot withstand the scorching of the sun or the beating down of the rain, whereas a real flower can withstand them

Our work today is to maintain a testimony of the church, which is why we have to build up everything at the same time

You may be serving God, building up churches, helping the brothers and sisters, and bearing some responsibilities in the church
After a brother has been saved for five years, if he grows spiritually, it would be like building a wall two feet high
After a brother is saved, he may become clearer concerning all kinds of scriptural knowledge from Genesis to Revelation
Because of this, after five years, the wall will remain two feet high, and God's life will not have grown in that brother
After much speaking, the brother may confess that he is wrong, and he may agree that he will no longer lose his temper with his wife
We now commit him to the Lord's hand, and we pray that the Lord will cause him not to lose his temper anymore'
They may cut a person's hair today, but soon afterward, that person's hair will grow back, and they will have to give him another haircut
If we take the Bible as a means for teaching others or improving others, we are taking the Bible as mere teachings only
Ordinarily, when a man hears such a word, he would go to exhort the husband, with the hope that the husband would change his ways
You can only do such a thing because you are a person who is given to exhorting others and helping others to improve themselves
Today, our work is not to teach others according to the Bible, but to plant God's life contained in the Bible into others
In eternity God will say O man you have Gods nature while you can say O God the majestic God You also have our nature the human nature

All successes failures sweet experiences and bitter experiences are for the accomplishment of Gods goal which is to work Himself into us
In order for us to be a Christian who lives according to the peace within, we have to realize that the greatest enemy is our mind
If we do this, day by day God's content and His fullness will fill us up, and we will have God's nature within and His image without
If half of the money that went into the purchase of that chair was stolen from others, this person will surely not have peace
After a person is saved, he will be enlightened, and his conscience will show him that what he did before was wrong and unrighteous
It is true that after we have believed in the Lord, the blood cleanses us from our sins, and the Lord's grace is sufficient for us
Although the dealing with the conscience cannot be considered as something directly spiritual, it is a bridge to the spiritual matters
They come to listen to messages, to act like Christians, to read the Bible, and to pray, but they are the same all year round
Many people's consciences are like the soles of those who walk around barefoot; their soles have become thickened and have lost all feelings

Gold signifies the divine nature, and pearl signifies the result of the transformation of God's life within man
All those who will not allow the river of life to flow through them will have the river of fire flowing through them
Everything that will not give way to the flow of the river of life will eventually pass through the burning of the river of fire
Some people have told us that when the atomic bomb was dropped in Hiroshima, Japan, even the iron and steel were melted
Only by allowing the river of life to flow through us will there be the gold, the pearl, and the precious stones
The table is placed in the sitting room, and the remaining chaff and odd pieces are taken to the stove in the kitchen
These things are not the gold, the pearl, and the precious stones, because God's life has not passed through these things
The fire does not remove defilements; it only removes that which is not holy, and that which does not belong to God
God's fire not only burns away everything bad; it also burns away everything that is not according to God's nature

What should have been consumed by the river of fire is merged into the river of water by passing through the river of blood
Of course, before that time there were the Nestorians in the Tang Dynasty, which cannot be considered as part of God's work
The first period is the period of the gospel, which lasted from the Ching Dynasty to the beginning of the Chinese Republic
During this period the Western missionaries could only do some rudimentary works in China such as running elementary schools in the villages
From the beginning of the Chinese Republic to the end of the Second World War, there was a period of twenty to thirty years
The change from the previous period to this one can be likened to a change from an elementary school to a high school
God's work during this period is to deal with all the human elements and to remove them from our heart through the cross
The first is the level of salvation, the second is the level of revival, and the third is the level of the way of the cross
The elementary school and the high school are not the goal; they are there to prepare a person to get into the goal, which is the university
If a student remains in the kindergarten all the time, even up to twenty or thirty years of age, there is something wrong
It does not mean that the former works were not good; it merely means that they cannot meet the demand of this age

With some people, God has not assigned them to take the same way as we do, and we dare not say anything to them
Lee answered Terms such as provision in the environment and the leading of the Holy Spirit have all been used in a loose way in Christianity
In the Bible, you find very few cases of people getting clear about God's will through going along with environmental provisions
The relationship between the leading of the Holy Spirit and the provision in the environment can be illustrated by the riding of a bicycle
We need to aggressively follow the leading of the Holy Spirit but at the same time we also need to accept the limitations in the environment
With some people, right after they are saved, they begin to deal with their conscience before God in a thorough way
If a man wants to go to a place by train, he has to buy his ticket at the station, and he has to board the train
May the Lord be merciful to us that many of us would be raised up to be the peanut seeds who supply life to others
May the Lords word not only be spoken through man but may every one of the words spoken be filled with light and may they shine within man
These three things need to be developed in a balanced way, and neither of the three should be given less emphasis than the others
Concerning the preaching of the gospel, we have to do it frequently, do it well, do it in a widespread way, and do it in a weighty manner
If a church does not increase in number, it is because it has slackened in the matter of the preaching of the gospel
All the schools, homes, and institutions should be filled with gospel posters, and we should all beget many spiritual children

From January 1, the whole church rose up to preach the gospel, and at least eighty percent of the saints were mobilized

Later, after the Communists took over Chefoo, our brothers and sisters were still bold to preach the gospel just as before
That boy happened to have stolen a piece of chalk from his school and was indeed using it to draw circles at home
After people have believed, we have to lead them, old and young, to love the Lord and to have concrete expressions of love
The few years when we were in Chefoo, the number of saved ones increased, and we began to have many home meetings
Up to a certain point, the brothers and sisters dared not even open up their chests in their homes, or touch their clothes in their closets
During that period in Chefoo, we met every day from ten in the morning until six at night, and time was still too short for us
Revivals mainly cause a person to love the Lord, but there are many revivals that only stir up an exciting atmosphere
When a man believes in the Lord Jesus, his sins are forgiven before God, but these sins may not be forgiven before man

Psalm 19:14 says, 'Let the words of my mouth, and the meditation of my heart, be acceptable in thy sight, O Lord'
In chapter six, the Lord Jesus knew very well how to take care of the crowd, yet He asked the disciples what to do
What the Lord wants us to learn is to accept His timing in all things, to allow Him to be the Lord, and to fellowship with Him
Prayer: May we receive grace from God, and may the brothers and sisters meet You, and may the eyes of their hearts be opened
When the Israelites were in the wilderness, God led them by day and by night with the pillar of cloud and the pillar of fire
The pillar of cloud is the Holy Spirit speaking to us, and the pillar of fire is the Holy Bible speaking to us
If you ask others if they are satisfied, most people will tell you that they neither feel satisfied nor feel dissatisfied
If a man feels thirsty and dissatisfied, as if he lacks something, it proves that God is working within such a person already
As he grows, he will need more food; he will need to have the rice, the vegetables, and the meat before his hunger can be satisfied

At the end of chapter one of the Song of Songs we see the result of the Lords leading which is the seeker sitting at the table with the Lord
Every time she was hungry and restless, it was God's speaking to her for the purpose of drawing her to the Lord
When we pray, we cannot pray according to our mind or our memory; we have to pray according to our inner feeling
They pray for their husbands and they pray for their sons from the first one to the last one and ask God to protect them from car accidents
The real prayer is not a matter of kneeling down or saying the right words, but of praying according to the inner feeling
God has no intention for us to know the methods, but He intends for us to have the knowledge of the spiritual things
At present, our knowledge concerning spiritual matters, such as loving the Lord or consecration of material things, is not genuine enough
It is not sufficient for a person merely to know that there is air and light; he has to have a genuine realization of what air and light are
In the past seven or eight years, many times we have probed for ways; we hoped to find out the proper way to do things
As far as our function is concerned, we are the members, not the sons, the workers, or the brothers and sisters
Today, many people talk about Romans 12, verses 1 and 2, but they separate these verses from the Body mentioned in the following verses
Chapters one through eight of Romans speak of God's work, and chapters nine through eleven speak of God's mercy and selection
On the other hand, other people may be small members, but they can never be so small that they cease to be members
You can ask a medical doctor, and he will tell you that if the coordination in the body is out of order by a little, the body will be sick
If one member is separated from the other members, and if he refuses to receive the supply from others, he will become isolated
When the hands, the feet, or the face is in motion, the blood in the whole body directs its supply to these working members
You must first be dealt with yourself, and you must first learn to listen to others, before others will listen to you and submit to you
If we talk about mutuality day after day, yet never listen to others, the coordination of the Body will be but an empty term
Men on the streets do not fight with each other day after day, yet there is absolutely no coordination or relatedness among them
In Acts Paul charged Timothy to come and go; he did not leave any ground for Timothy to pray or to seek for God's will
In the meeting hall in Chefoo, there is a fixed place for everything, including the rags, the toilet paper, the pencils, and the nails
If you want to be a proper brother or sister, you have to declare that we who serve the Lord are people who would listen
When a decision has been made by the elders concerning ushering, none of the brothers can act any longer according to his own wish
If you can neither take orders nor give orders, then you can only be one that takes candies; you can only do what you like to do
While the brothers and sisters were cleaning, they would pray that those who put their feet on that floor would be saved
Some time after that dream, the church had a gospel meeting, and this sister's husband invited this friend to go to the meeting
When the friend stepped into the meeting hall, what he saw was exactly the same as what he experienced in his dream
Another time in Shanghai, we baptized one hundred thirty people in a little over an hour; it took only one minute to baptize each one
Those in the world are used to meetings without discussions, and discussions without decisions, and decisions without actions
In order for the church to be built up in every aspect, both the human affairs and the things of God as well have to be up to the standard
The secret to all the blessings in the church is to be in one accord and to take the Lord as the center in everything
Today the gospel is preached by the church, and everyone has a part in it; everyone can give themselves to this work
In the work of gospel preaching, the delivering of the message occupies only a small part of the various responsibilities
There is a big difference between a gospel preaching that is done in coordination and one that is done individually
Some who come from distant localities bring their own food with them, while the church provides only water and tea for them
In this demonic festival, theatrical groups would be set up in front of the idol temples and would sing to the idols
When a co-worker goes out to work and to build up a church, he should pass on all his work to the brothers and sisters
A few years have elapsed, but today the brothers and sisters are still serving in the same way as they did then
He would come every Saturday to mop the floor, and he would find out in detail from the responsible brothers how to mop it
If you think that this is not the right place for you, you can go to some other place, some Christian organization
If we are merely 'running' churches, organizing Sunday services, and producing 'pew-members,' we might as well close our doors
If the brothers and sisters would take up all the services in oneness, they will realize the sweetness in serving the Lord
In serving the Lord we need grace on both sides on the side of the brothers and sisters and on the side of the responsible ones the elders
When the Gentiles do the right things, they are right only with respect to the things themselves; they are not right with respect to God
Matthew 7 describes a group of people who have done many things for God, but their hearts are not right toward God
They will not treat others well when others treat them well, and treat others in an evil way when others treat them in an evil way
A person who has learned the lessons is one who is always fearful of God and who always fears Him in everything
Whether or not a man fears God depends mainly on whether or not he does things by himself or by the life of God
Our hearts must be calibrated on God, in the same way that the needle of a meter should be calibrated to the scale
If a person's heart is not right, even if he were to accomplish monumental works, others will still not receive the blessing
The heart of the fox was not right, for after the visit he intended to swallow the chicken down into his stomach
In all the churches, the attendance is high, and those who come to listen to messages are many, but you cannot find the suitable persons
If we are to preach the gospel and save sinners, we have to do it in such a way that some men are perfected in our work before God
To be extraordinary, a person has to be able to cause others to do the same thing that he is doing, and even to do it better than he does
A person does not have to be a scholar himself, but he has to be able to produce an apprentice who is a scholar
In the same way, a person does not have to be a performer himself, but he has to be able to train others to become performers
If you are truly good at doing something, you can pass on the skill to others and can help others to become just as good
If you would do this, it shows that you are one who has learned the lessons and has been dealt with by the Lord
Our work today cannot be like that of traditional Christianity; we cannot have a pastor to take over everything any longer
In the church in Chefoo, once over sixty people migrated west from Chefoo to Inner Mongolia and the Ningsia regions
If some have passed through some serious dealings in the basic matters, the work ahead will have a free course
We left the denominations not only because they are wrong, but because they have not come up to God's standard
If there were the possibility of joining or uniting with them, there would not have been the need for another group
A person who does a scattered work is one who does not know what kind of ground he stands on or what work he is doing
Those who are engaged in serious work will not walk into another's office asking for help, for they know that others are busy also
You may say that the work of sweeping the streets and hauling fertilizer is low, but some people are doing this work also
When we preach the gospel tonight, may others receive mercy through seeing the love that the brothers and sisters express toward You
To remain in a place to serve the Lord properly, be coordinated together, and fulfill the function of each one, is a very difficult thing
It is not right for the co-workers to see results only when they themselves are working, but not to see results when they are not working
The co-workers must have an adequate amount of spiritual life, and they must have a proper view to promote this matter
In serving the Lord, the main thing is not our work, but to learn to be a proper person through doing the work
In the Old Testament, Abraham was called to leave Ur of Chaldea to go to the place that God had prepared for him and to serve Him there
As a result of that revival, many people went out from that place to North America, the Pacific regions, and the Atlantic regions
Although the gospel has come to the East, it was difficult for the Westerners to spread the gospel to the interior of China
During the revival in Chefoo, of the eight hundred or more brothers and sisters, almost ninety percent of them consecrated everything
The Holy Spirit was working, and everyone was enlightened to repent in tears and to vow that they would never hold back the gospel again
Some saints dared not open up their closets when they went home, for when they did, a voice within would say, 'Consecrate'!
The first group consisted of over seventy people, among whom over sixty of them had their traveling expenses taken care of by the church
At that time, our meeting on Fourth Street became the subject of conversation for many people, and some rumored that we had a sack of gold
Although they offer larger amounts, the percentage of offering compared with their profits becomes less and less
Migration is an uprooting in which a person sells all he has and moves to another place to live for the gospel
The Lord's word says that the gospel would be preached from Jerusalem, through Judea, unto the remotest part of the earth
In order to practice this, first we must recover the preaching of the gospel, and we must have a revived living
These brothers moved out from Chang-chia-kou, station after station, and went all the way from Chefoo to Sui-yuan province
Prayer: Lord, what we need is not some passing excitement, stirring up, or exhortation, but the remaining work of the Holy Spirit within us
If we do not realize this, we will still trust in our own strength, and we will work according to our own preference
After we are saved, the Lord's love revives us and causes us to live for the Lord and to consecrate ourselves to Him
There is a world of difference between revival and life; this difference is greater than the difference between high school and college
Brother Mak, if others oppose you or criticize you, you do not need to require them to come to you and explain to you what they are doing
If you do this, you will see that you do not have to do anything; the Lord has done everything for you already
In Galatians 615 Paul told the Galatians that it was not a question of circumcision or uncircumcision but a question of being a new creation
If we do not do this, we will not be able to mingle with other Christians, and we will only be an individual Christian
In the process of grafting such a one must endure pain for the old skin to be removed and the new skin to grow together with the other parts
In our serving together with the brothers and sisters, we have to spend time with them to learn together and to practice together with them
We should be a person who is living before the Lord, and we should produce men instead of merely producing works
In this way the saints are raised up and educated in the church and eventually they will graduate to become doctors to take care of others
By that time, when God gives the leading and the direction, some will be able to go to migrate for the gospel's sake
We need to reject all outside voices and the so-called lights, and we should pay attention to the inner feeling and the anointing
Corinthians speaks of the service that comes by the gifts, whereas 2 Corinthians speaks of the service that comes by the ministry of life
The teachings of many Western missionaries are like the sofa chair; they are comfortable to sit on, but they are too soft
Some brothers are like a concrete wall; when you meet them, they make you feel uncomfortable, yet they render much help to you
In the same way, a person must pass through deep digging before God's grace can have the opportunity to flow into the church
After this, three or four elders can discuss among themselves to see which of the saints are more worthy of trust
Sister Pearl Wang: For example, in the church in Shanghai, every aspect of the hospitality service has its specific assignments
There are people responsible for the linens, people responsible for the laundry, for patching, for the storage, and for the housekeeping
At least a year will be needed before the various areas of services in the church in Swatow will have some direction
Other than the work that absolutely requires hiring someone to do it, all the rest should be done by the brothers and sisters themselves
Some who are so-called unpromising should not necessarily be rejected, and some who are promising should not necessarily be taken
When someone comes to our city, we hope to receive some help, and we expect the visitor to come with an abundance of grace
A way affords a person a path to follow, whereas doctrines can only afford a person something to listen to and to talk about
If a man does not want to study the Bible properly but desires only to be zealous and to listen to messages whatever he does will be useless
If we have not thoroughly dealt with our conscience, what is the use of coming and listening to more messages?
If everyone would bring one person to the Lord per year, in ten years there will be one hundred fifty thousand people saved
If you walk on the street today, you can see many advertisements, but you do not find one gospel advertisement
We have to learn the proper lessons in the practical services before we can learn the lessons in the spiritual matters
Only by experiencing the Lord in such a practical way will we know what humility is and what it is to serve the Lord
We confess that we love the world, that we indulge ourselves in the flesh, that we do not have love, and that we have sinned much
Brother Weigh: It would be best if some co-workers can come from Shanghai and work in these three places, which can serve as stations
He has received no commission to do what you are doing now, but neither can his burden be released among the ordinary brothers and sisters
In the same way, the life that a person receives at regeneration, the second life, also has its definite needs
Among all the spiritual things that the Holy Spirit has led us to know, do we know this one particular thing the service?
If the service in the church is prophetic in nature, then all the brothers and sisters would have to be prophets
The service in the church is composed of the speakers, plus the piano players, plus the janitors, plus the window cleaners, and so forth
A sacrifice should be one that is dead, but a living sacrifice means sacrifices that are offered up to do some works
The question is not one of outward eating, but one of the Lord's being satisfied and man's being satisfied through the small matters
In every age, there are different recoveries of the truths, such as the truth concerning justification by faith, the truth of sanctification
In the end, the apostle John also declared that antichrist has come, and he warned the believers to be watchful
In Ephesians 4, we see that the Body requires all kinds of gifts, the goal of which is the perfecting of all the saints
In the Bible, there are such things as individuals receiving grace from the Lord, and there are such things as individuals being sanctified
In addition, there is one characteristic that is lacking the most among them, which is the realization of the Body of Christ
When he stood up to speak, the message may have been only fifteen minutes long, but there was something real in what he said
Today, a believer must catch up with God's work and must go on with Him, and he should not be one who is falling back
There was a brother who once preached the doctrine of justification unceasingly; he had never heard of the doctrine of regeneration
After three years, he began to hear about the doctrine of regeneration, and he realized that he was regenerated
From that time on, whenever he preached the gospel, he would always tell others that a man is first justified and then regenerated
Because our individual experiences are partial and fragmentary, we do not have a complete, overall view of God's word
Most people like to arrange the truths in a sequence, such as putting justification first and sanctification afterwards
Not only should we be delivered from doubting God's word; we must also be delivered from jeopardizing God's word
We cannot make the truth of an age become an error just because we do not have enough knowledge about that truth
Due to the fact that some truths were recovered first and some later, men set a sequence to the order of the truth
A person who has not seen the Body will feel that he is not much different from a person who has seen the Body
In the Body, the first thing we have to learn is to find out who are those whom we have to submit ourselves to
If you go to another person's house to be the maid, you do not first ask who the children are, but who the lady of the house is
The real submission is not one that is imposed from without, but one that comes as a result of the operation of the life within
On the other hand, however, we have to see that after the Lord met Saul, He did not speak to him again directly
Although we live under the New Testament, and although we have the Lord within us, we are at the same time living in the Body
In the same way, if a person acts independently and is not joined to the Body, he will become a most ugly member
If you say that in addition to being a hand, you want to see also, you will not succeed even if you try it as long as you live
Those who realize their own limitations will fellowship in everything and will seek help and counsel in everything
The Bible says that we have to submit to our husband and our rulers, and the younger ones have to submit to the older ones
In the work of the Lord, we should find out who is ahead of us, and we have to seek for the opportunity to submit
The reason he could say this is that he was a proper apostle, and he had the greatest ministry and the greatest gifts
Building means that one stone is laid on top of another, and desolation means that no stone is laid on top of another
A typical Christian is not only one who is a Christian individually, but one who is involved in the testimony of the church
Our ministry today is the ministry of the church, which is one that brings in a testimony of the church for the Lord
Although the truths were buried for such a long time, when they were recovered, they immediately became actualities
When Paul spoke concerning the truth in the first century, those truths were spiritual realities, yet they were not actualities
The problem with all the places today is that we only maintain a local church without maintaining a ministry that is for the Lords testimony
The unique ministry is for the unique testimony, and the content of the unique testimony is fulfilled in the local church
The Body described in 1 Corinthians 12 is a testimony that a local church should have; it is the testimony of the Body
In this Body, the eyes cannot say to the hands, 'I have no need of you,' nor can the head say to the feet, 'I have no need of you'
Concerning the question of the desolation of the church, we must first consider the way of the church on earth
At the time the Israelites went to war with the Philistines, the two sons of Eli had sinned, and Eli himself had become foolish and corrupt
He still tried to use the ark to fight for them, with the hope that through the ark they would win the victory
Jeremiah 7:12 and 14 speak of how God dealt with Shiloh, and Psalms 78:60 and 1 Samuel 4:3 speak of how the ark had left the tabernacle
God dealt with Shiloh not in the way of burning it down with fire, nor in the way of destroying the people there, but by removing the ark
It is like Christianity having only the name of the church, but the central testimony of the church is lost and God's testimony is removed
According to 1 Kings 3:4 and 2 Chronicles 1:3, the Gibeonites still made sacrifices and sought for God at the tabernacle
Although in Gibeon there was still the outward human worship, all those who had received wisdom would never go back to the tabernacle
Under normal circumstances, every brother and sister should be serving God; this should be their proper occupation
Although the churches in the various localities are different as far as their localities are concerned there is nevertheless only one church
The descriptions in Peter's epistles are no exception; they all mention the desolation of the church toward the end of the apostles' time
It is true that among all the denominations in Christianity, there are God's people who are still performing worship to God
The position that we should take should be one of spiritual reality, that is, the position typified by the temple
In the Old Testament, the temple and the kingdom are linked together; the temple is the most crucial element in the kingdom
God not only requires that man be delivered from sin, the world, and the flesh; He also asks that man be delivered from his individualism
Right from the very beginning, this realization has been wrong, and the way a person takes subsequent to this is also wrong
Man thinks that as soon as he believes in the Lord, all he has to do is to be zealous, to consecrate himself, and to give up everything
A man must realize that he is not only a man of unclean lips, but he also dwells in the midst of a people of unclean lips
While it is wrong to have unclean lips individually, it is equally wrong to dwell in the midst of a people with unclean lips
When a new believer is joined to the Body through the laying on of hands, he can no longer be an individual Christian
Problems arise in the church because some people think that they are all-inclusive; they want to do everything by themselves
Do not think that you are so capable or clever, and do not think that you will never be wrong and that others are always wrong
We all have to humble ourselves and be delivered from our pride and our individualism to receive the supply from others
All those who are accustomed to their cleverness and who think highly of themselves should make a turn and have a change
There is no one in the church who does not have to submit to anyone; everyone has to submit to those assigned by God
The problem today is that many brothers and sisters think that the supply others have received will not work in them
If God wanted to control anything, He could remove the tree of knowledge of good and evil, or He could put a fence around the tower of Babel
We have to be a person who has learned the lessons, and we have to reject and restrict all forms of individualism
Today in the whole world in all the nations and among all the societies there are all kinds of opinions voices expressions and arguments
It is a matter of being willing to submit to the arrangement of the Head, as opposed to being free to make one's own choices and decisions
If we will not receive from others, probably we will end up fifty years from now having the same as what we have now
If they wanted to keep the goats, they should not lay their hands on the goats, because they were not willing to hand the goats over
They do not see that the laying on of hands is an acceptance of God's authority that He establishes in the church
If a man is willing to hand himself over to the serving ones, it will become easy for the serving ones to do their job
The co-workers in all the places should first hand themselves over and place themselves under the Head and be directed by the Head
Their hearts were not broad enough and did not include all the believers; they did not see the unique Body of Christ
The way the Body will be manifested in the future is determined by the nature of the testimony of the local churches today
Corinthians 12 speaks of the universal Body, on the one hand, and on the other hand, the Body life in the local churches
The tabernacle and the temple in the Old Testament both typify the church, the Body of Christ, in the New Testament
Not only should the co-workers do this, the brothers and sisters should also consecrate themselves fully in this way
If we do not do this, the work will belong to the local church again, and the Lord will have no way to go on among us
Brother Witness Lee: Between 1940 and 1943, by the mercy of the Lord, we did quite a work there in Chefoo, Shantung
With these migrating ones, their traveling expenses, ninety-five percent of them, were taken care of by the church
In the New Testament, the first thing that the Lord wants is the kingdom of God, or the kingdom of the heavens
Others when they read the four Gospels find such things as the miracles the healings the casting out of the demons or the virtues of Christ
You have to realize that the main theme of the four Gospels, and especially that of the Gospel of Matthew, is the kingdom
The first word that Christ uttered when He came out to preach was also, 'The kingdom of the heavens has drawn near'
It is to deal with the fact that the kingdom is ahead, and that we need to be regenerated to enter into this kingdom
The Lord also said that unless a man turns and becomes like a little child, he shall by no means enter into the kingdom of the heavens
If a man believes in Christ and is forgiven of his sins merely for the sake of going to heaven, such a standard is too low
If salvation is merely for the forgiveness of sins, at the most it is to bring a person up to the standard of the law
Suppose two brothers are engaged in a business together, and suppose the first brother has taken advantage of the second brother
A Christian should say that if the first brother does not return what he has taken, he is not behaving like a brother
The kingdom requires that the second brother, in addition to giving up his reasoning, give another piece of clothing to the first one
Man's view is to remove sin and to go to heaven, but the requirement of God's word in the New Testament is much stricter than this
God's requirement is not a question of morality, law, the conscience, or justice, but a question of the rule of the heavens
Those who have a high moral standard may be justified before the law, but they come far short of the requirements of God
In order to satisfy God's requirement, a man cannot take the law as the standard, but he must take the kingdom as the standard
If the standard of a Christian's living is his conscience, he will not be able to sell everything and give to the poor
Regeneration is for a person to receive and to possess this life, and this life meets all the demands of the kingdom
God gives to us a high life right from the beginning, so that we can live a high living of entering into the kingdom
The kingdom life is able to take care of everything both great and small, and it is able to overcome everything
After half an hour to an hour, while they are still talking, they may be provoked to argue with each other again
If we are only concerned about the conscience, the moral standards, and the public opinions, we are still not qualified to enter the kingdom
The life of Christ helps us not only to meet the standard of the conscience or of morality, but to meet the requirements of the kingdom
They begin to lose their patience and may even begin to lose their temper uncontrollably, or backslide or fall suddenly
The prevailing thought at that time was that the church ruled over the world; it declared that the whole world belonged to God
In the church, those who receive little should not be in want, and those who receive much should not have an excess
The number of those sent out from them exceeds that sent from any other group and ranks highest in terms of percentage
Once the principle of economy comes in, everything will be reckoned according to value, and the Lord will have no way to go on
The one contributed Germany whereas the other contributed the doctrines, and the result was the national churches
To stop these small churches from being established, the English Parliament even passed a law to unify all the churches in England
The government persecuted them and ordered them to take jobs five miles away from their former places of occupation
They could not work for the government, and all of them who were government officers were removed from their posts
After this, there were the Mennonites, who were the first group of believers to realize the error of a hierarchy
They saw the error of infant baptism, and they taught that a man must first be clear about the truth of baptism before he can be baptized
If he is the right person and he preaches the right doctrine, even if his quotations are wrong, the mistake is not fatal
We would rather see the person right and the quotations wrong, than to see the quotations right and the person wrong
During the last century, God enlightened men concerning the matter of consecration and its importance through the brothers we have mentioned
Darby told others that consecration is based on the casting off of the man of flesh and the removal of this man
The gospel saves not merely by forgiving the sinner and delivering him from perdition, but by crucifying the sinner with the Lord
All spiritual lessons, including obedience and our service to the Lord, must be practiced in accordance with this principle
Even lessons as spiritual as those taught by Madame Guyon must be pursued according to the principle mentioned here by Darby
Roberts himself was confined to his bed because of illness between 1903 and 1904, and he was not released until 1909
In her illness, she experienced spiritual warfare, and she saw that many people were deceived through their ignorance of spiritual warfare
Later, in collaboration with Evan Roberts, she wrote the book War on the Saints and released the truth concerning spiritual warfare
If we see this fact, all those who will be saved after us will immediately see the reality of this fact and enter into it
With each step that the Lord has taken in His recovery, the content of His recovery has become richer and richer
In the Body, sometimes we become more clear when we do not know something, and we become unclear when we know too much
There is nothing better in the whole world than submission, and there is nothing more beautiful in the whole world than order
Witness Lee once said to me You are very severe when you speak on the platform but you are not so severe when you step off the platform
Any time a person is free from any authority, he has no way to go on, and he does not have the reality of the church with him
Whether or not God will find a way in this generation depends on whether or not there are absolute people in this generation
In the early churches, although the number of saved ones was not too great, they were all men who were on fire
If God gains His way through us, those who are saved after us will not be like the saved ones we see today; a better breed will emerge
Formerly, we may have exhorted others to believe in the Lord by giving them a pat on the back and saying nice words to them
Formerly, we were begging others to believe; it was as if they were granting us a favor to believe in the Lord
At the same time, all the brothers and sisters should learn to receive the portion of the ministers of the word
The local churches should pay much attention to the newly saved ones, to properly equip them and to render them the clear teachings
Others do not have money to provide education for their children or adequate support for their family's livelihood
Only those who have passed the Red Sea can employ their money to the proper use for the building up of the tabernacle
As long as there is a group of people who will go on in this way, wherever they may be, we will see the emergence of Acts 2 Christians
Brother Chu-en asked: Will the church in Jerusalem and the church in Antioch become another form of a 'central' church or 'head' church?
As such is the case, our work cannot be carried out individually, but it must be carried out in a corporate way
Only by working with others will we realize whether there is true progress and whether the self is truly dealt with
What we have to do today is not a matter of repeating others' ministries, like copying writing with carbon paper
Although the position of the hand dictates that it cannot be the speaking member, as long as the mouth can speak, the hand is satisfied
Some would not be subdued even when others have pointed out the error in their teachings; they would still insist on speaking
Even when the congregation is not able to discern, the words of the prophets must still be judged by the Spirit of the Lord
Antioch was not a center, because it was not the product of an organization, but the product of the Holy Spirit
Once the church is separate from the Holy Spirit and once it has lost its spiritual reality, it becomes the Roman Catholic Church
Whether or not a local church can become a central church depends basically on whether or not that church is spiritual
An accusation cannot be based on rumors or hearsay; there must be witnesses, and the accusations must be presented to Timothy
He will lead us to the point where we will not be able to go on or even to live if we do not take the way of the Body
Although it shines in many places, the electricity in these many places is under the control of the same power plant
If we make the churches in our localities little kingdoms and territories bounded by their own 'turfs,' we are wrong
The Lord did not pay much attention to these ones; He only paid attention to the workers from Jerusalem and those from Antioch
The Lord emphatically placed in the Bible two lines composed of two groups of workers, the line of Paul and the line of Peter
The reason there is the need for such a make-up lesson is that the matter was not taken care of properly at the beginning
After a man is saved, he should immediately consecrate himself , and he should not have to wait until a later date to make it up
Many Christians have not done this properly, and the church has not presented this need to them properly right from the beginning
We can say that today the church has given the believers a 'bonus ride'; they board the train without paying for the ticket
The standard of salvation is not high enough today, and many of the items a person should have acquired at the time of salvation are lost
Strictly speaking, when a man is saved, he should be fully consecrated and should be a person who lives fully for the spread of the gospel
One day, when everyone is consecrated as soon as he is saved, there will be no need for anyone to 'hand themselves over' any longer
Although these have boarded the train without any ticket, they cannot go on with their free ride the rest of the time
As long as the beginning is clean-cut, that one can go on properly no matter how little he understands and sees at the beginning
Once a person sees the gospel whether it is through the preaching of love righteousness or judgment he will surely be softened and subdued
If a man is not willing to take this way or to accept the Lord and be baptized, we will not force him to do so
As soon as a person is saved, we have to tell him that from now on he is no longer an individual person, but a member in the Body
A young thirteen-year-old boy sitting close by heard this word, and he was greatly moved to believe in the Lord
If we preach the gospel in this way, a fleshly man will not even be able to come into the church, let alone to go on afterwards
If He does not get through with us, He will not be able to solve the problems separately in the different localities
If one individual has some problem, he can ask for help from the church; a few others can come along to help him to hand himself over
The handing over that we speak of today is not an individual handing over, but a handing over that is done in fellowship
The thing that causes the most suffering is for a person to come with a burden and to go home with the same burden on him
In the Body, we should not be a brother or sister who consumes others' supply; we should have a clear realization of the Body
In the days ahead, perhaps there will be the opportunity for us to speak about them in a clearer and more precise way
At the same time that this was going on, many churches around the world had the feeling that something was happening
In God's work, no one can keep his money, on the one hand, and say that his heart loves the Lord, on the other hand
Today, when we speak of handing ourselves over, we are not talking about what we have to do to take care of our money
In order to fill up the gap of these two hundred workers, there must be a group of people who would go to make money
All the brothers and sisters have to see that everything is for the Lord and that everything has to center around the Lord
We can only keep the occupations that God approves, and we can never engage in works that God does not approve
May we find men who would submit under Your mighty hand, so that we can serve You together with all the saints
May more people put themselves into Your hands, so that their jobs, positions, and living can become worthy of the gospel
May there be young ones raised up to work for You, and may all the brothers and sisters rise up to match the move of the gospel
May You do a greater work, and may You raise up more men to give all their time to serve You and to go out with the gospel
There is the need for a certain degree of openness before there can be the capacity to receive a certain kind of words
To have to say something under such circumstances does not touch even the surface of the issue much less can there be any deep or open words
The 'ministry' in Ephesians 4 is singular; it is the same ministry as the apostles' ministry of the word and prayer as recorded in Acts 6
Some will exercise their flesh and they will have to be told that the way they laugh for example is wrong and that they should not do this
Brother Witness Lee: The situation today is that only a few co-workers and responsible brothers and sisters are serving
Even their salvation experiences in many cases are weak experiences of salvation; they are not rich and absolute cases of salvation
Today the condition among the saints is poor, but the responsibility is not on them; it is on the responsible ones
If the spiritual condition of the responsible ones is progressive, the spiritual condition of the saints is also progressive
If there is no authority in the church, where will the brothers and sisters go for the proper authority to submit to?
Without authority, there can be no orders, and without the orders, there cannot be those who follow the orders
If the coordination among the co-workers is not smooth, you cannot expect the coordination among the brothers and sisters to be smooth
If real coordination is not established in the work, we cannot expect the local churches to have the real services
If a brother mops the floor in the church for two years and is still the same person, he should not come any longer
In the church it is not the main emphasis to get the work done, but to learn to be the proper person through doing the works
Every time we engage in any work, we have to learn coordination, and we have to ask the church about everything
Those who have the ministry are responsible for speaking up, and others are responsible for putting aside their own ideas
If the church does not learn this lesson, it will become the same as the denominations and other social groups
Not only should the responsible ones learn to give orders, the brothers and sisters also should learn to follow orders
The saints should present all the problems to the elders, and the elders should present the problems before God
In this way, the saints can come to God through the elders, and God's authority can be realized among the saints
In the matter of preaching the gospel, we have to recover the kind of preaching that is done by the whole church
There is a difference between inviting people through the advertisements and inviting them individually through the brothers and sisters
If one day we see the whole church rising up to preach the gospel, we will realize what a beautiful and powerful picture it will be
When a person steps up to the platform to preach today, he only needs to speak the first sentence, and everyone knows what will follow
Although there are very few spiritual giants, two or three one-talented ones and two-talented ones will make up for a Paul
The next generation that we bring in must not be made up of three or five serving ones, but must be made up of the whole church serving
Many brothers and sisters feel that since they make mistakes no matter how they work, they may as well not work at all
From the garden of Eden, through the tabernacle and the temple, God is gaining the church, which will usher in the holy city
By that time, God will be able to dwell in the city, and Satan will not be able to come into that place any longer
What is needed today is men who can lead others into the services, and not men who will replace others in their services
Brother Chang Yu-chi asked: What is the relationship between submitting to the authority in the Body and personal submission before God?
The former emphasizes the knowledge of spiritual senses, whereas the latter emphasizes the knowledge of God's law
It is not by outward regulations, but by the responses of the inner life that we make judgments concerning everything
In the same principle, it is not by outward teachings, but by the anointing that we come to know what is of God and what is not of Him
In addition, the Epistles to Timothy and Titus are also epistles on the work, and they follow the same principle as Acts
From Acts and these Epistles we can see that there is the side of individual leading, and there is the side of corporate leading
Real leading does not come through committees, resolutions, and debates, but in a spontaneous, unorchestrated, yet harmonious way
Here was Paul, who was zealous in serving God, who shed others' blood and thought that by so doing he was serving God
John's ministry is on God's house, Peter's ministry is on God's kingdom, and Paul's ministry is on God's church
With Paul, we see that from the first day on, he touched something, which is the oneness of the Lord with His church
We have to ask God to do one thing today: If a person rejects the leading in the Body, he will be deprived of all leadings
We can ask ourselves: Do we have leadings in our individual works, and have we ever made any mistakes in those leadings?
It is possible for individual leadings to be wrong, and it is equally possible for corporate leadings to be wrong
We should accept the judgment of the brothers ahead of us and should take their judgments as our own judgments
Sometimes an individual may feel very strongly and convincingly about something, and the feeling may differ from that of the Body
In the Bible there is no such thing as the minority going along with the majority; there is only the one accord
If he does not have absolute confidence that what he has is of the Lord, it is better for him to submit to the others' feelings
If all the one talents are dug out, and everyone is a submissive one, the authority in the church will be able to deal with the flesh
Brother Nee answered: For all the time that the church has been on this earth, God never asks man to direct the church
We may think that those brothers who have good behavior and who have in addition some gifts are the best candidates for services
Those who appear to be qualified do not have the gifts, and those who do not appear to be qualified have the gifts
If you were to ask the people in Jerusalem at that time, everyone would tell you that they were afraid of Saul
The revival of the church does not come through man's arrangements, but through the sovereign operation of the Holy Spirit
Many people think that the matter of service is the work of a few people, but true service is that in which the whole Body is involved
The work of the priests is to serve God, and the holy place is the dwelling place for the priests; it is also the dwelling place of God
In the book of Judges, even when men had money, they could only hire the Levites as priests for them; they themselves could not be priests
We have become the Jewish nation of today, with only one tribe serving, while the other eleven tribes rely on the service of the Levites
Our occupation is only to keep ourselves alive and to sustain our body to live on this earth the purpose of our occupation is for the gospel
If every brother and sister hands himself or herself over, the next generation will not need such a word any longer
When a person comes out of the water, he should know that henceforth he does not belong to the world any longer
At present, the services in the church in Foochow are divided into two areas, the spiritual part and the human part
With the spiritual part, at present we have two categories of services: the preaching of the gospel and the perfecting of the believers
On the perfecting side, there are the care for the elderly ones, the care for the young ones, and the visitation services
They are the cleaning group, the ushering group, the office group, the purchasing group, the accounting group, and the maintenance group
Other than the different items of services, the church is divided up into different districts for its meetings
Every district has some responsible brothers who share the responsibility of taking care of the brothers and sisters
The receiving of a person for the Lords table is not simply a matter of asking questions but a matter of the condition of a persons spirit
If a person requests to be received at the Lord's table, and you feel that his spirit is not right, you should deal with the matter
If a person should not be received, we only need to tell this one alone; there is no need to pass this word around to another person
The focus of the New Testament ministry is the beholding of the glory of the Lord with an unveiled face as recorded in 3:18
Corinthians 4 tells us the result of having this ministry, and it goes on to tell us our relationship with the Lord
We are not only giving the treasure to others, but we are giving the treasure that is hidden in the earthen vessels to others
It does not mean that when a person no longer tries to say anything, hear anything, see anything, and do anything, he becomes spiritual
It does not matter how much an earthen vessel is improved, for improvement only produces one result: to draw others' attention to itself
Our problem lies in the fact that we do not know how to differentiate between the outward earthen vessel and the inward treasure
After this she wrote a second one, only to find that she did not have the peace either, and she had to throw that one away also
Many people seem to have burnt-up earthen vessels; they appear unnatural to others and give others an uneasy feeling
God did not send the angels to preach the teaching of sanctification; He used ordinary men to preach such words
When a person does not have anything inside him, but tries to assume something on the outside, he is deceiving himself
Witness Lee asked Is the coordination among the coworkers based on the ministers in the Body only or is it based on some other things
Authority is not a thing; the Lord did not give Peter a bundle of authority and ask him to come back for more when he used up that bundle
The Scriptures clearly state that the work that went out from Antioch was initiated by the commissioning of the Holy Spirit
The failure of our work in these years is that we pass on the authority to the local churches before they are matured
Later, when they went out, it was not because of persecution, but because everywhere there were those who called on the name of the Lord
If the co-workers will first drop their personal works and will come together in Jerusalem, the Lord will have a way
The reason for this is that we lacked some fundamental arrangements, and we have not provided these ones the proper education
In the matter of preaching the gospel, no two persons have the same kind of footsteps, and no two persons have the same kind of testimonies
In putting this into practice, we must be a person who is living, and we must have an adequate measure of life
If we want to see the work in Shanghai built up, we have to put all the brothers and sisters here into function
We hope that our conference here will end in May, after which some will remain in Shanghai, while others will go to Fukien
Because the truth becomes involved with man, when a man does not experience a truth, he feels that he cannot speak that truth
A person has to realize that it is not because he has the experience that he is qualified to speak concerning a truth
If we have to ask whether or not a thing ought to be done, then we have to put the same question to everyone involved in similar cases
Some people lower down the truth a little when they are wrong, and lift up the truth a little when they are right
Otherwise, you will end up thinking that you are the only right Christian on earth and that everyone else has to go along with you
Those who cannot go along with the truth, but instead lower the standard of the truth, will forever live in darkness
The Body life that we are speaking of does not start from the Catholic Church, but from the corporateness of the Body
Today, man thinks that the life he received is individual, the experience he has is individual, and the conscience within him is individual
If a person comes up to any major decision, he has to learn to follow the Body and to fellowship with the brothers ahead of him
At such times, someone can say, 'We are not interfering with the way you dress, but this is something that is damaging the Lord's testimony'
No one is born a Chief of Police; he has to receive the responsibility first, before he can execute his authority
We must see the Head first, and we must first realize that He is behind us, before we can have the assurance to speak
All those who are interested in touching others' affairs, who like to be the head, and who like to express opinions, have to be stopped
Those who by their natural disposition do not like to be involved with others and who do not like to speak should be strong to speak
We think that first we have to concentrate our efforts together to maintain the testimonies along the coastal provinces
We should concentrate on Foochow and Shanghai, and we should have a start in these two places at the same time
To maintain a local testimony, there is not too much difference between the effort of ten people and that of twenty people
If the Lord is merciful to us, Hong Kong can be linked up with Canton, in the same way that Nanking and Hangchow are linked up with Shanghai
The editing and compilation of the hymnal will be taken care of by Brother Tang, Brother Chow, Brother Lee, and myself
To all the other brothers and sisters: The money that you have earned in the past, you can keep it for your own use
From now on, all the money that you make, other than what you need for your own expenses, should all be given to the work of the gospel
There is a great possibility that in the future all of you will have to give up everything to preach the gospel
The meeting hall in Foochow, the guest halls, and the place for the long-term training in Kuling all need money
Among all the passages in the Bible, Romans 12:1 and 2 speak of consecration in a most explicit, thorough, precise, and definite way
The consecration spoken of here is too precise, definite, and explicit; there is no way for anyone to avoid it
With those who have only consecrated themselves in an inward way, their consecrations are intangible and impractical
If we have not settled the question of the consecration of our bodies, we have not yet settled the question of consecration at all
Heart consecration is the preacher's consecration, whereas body consecration is the consecration according to God's word
What is really precious is for a person to set aside two hours a week to devote himself fully to the service of the Lord
Suppose the responsible brothers would take up a job in the morning and would devote themselves to serving the Lord in the afternoon
Even if you are without food and without clothing, you nevertheless have to set aside this one-tenth to the Lord
When the Brethren were raised up in England in the nineteenth century, everyone put in their hearts and their time
There are different ages, such as the age of the Ching Dynasty, the age of the Chinese Republic, and the age of the 'May 4th movement'
The presenting of the time and the dropping of the age are like the left and right hands; neither one can be missing
The wonderful thing is that this God who dwells in eternity one day came to earth to become a man and to dwell among men
Even if the head of a nation were to walk with us, that glory would not be a glory when compared with the glory of Christ
The church is the enlargement of the principle of Christ which is God living in man becoming mans content and expressing Himself through man
If we read carefully from Genesis to Revelation, we can see that God has only one desire to gain a group of people to be His habitation
Although God has His habitation in heaven, and although He has His habitation in eternity, He is not satisfied with this
Whether it is the tabernacle or the temple, the principle is the same: they are there for men to touch God Himself
We have to realize that our Christ today is not merely the Savior; He is not merely forgiving men's sins and saving them to go to heaven
When men build walls, first they fill up these blocks with cement, then put cement outside the blocks to join the blocks together
What we have received within from the Lord is the Holy Spirit, and the nature of our oneness without is also the Holy Spirit
An individual before God is like a one-dimensional plane, whereas the Body before God is like a three-dimensional object
If you only exist as an individual member, it would only be a question of you individually being useful or not
It is difficult to put into practice many things in the Bible unless these things are placed in the right position
Brother Witness Lee asked: What is the difference between the way of the church and the way of the co-workers?
It is wrong for us to pay attention to the difference between the church and the work before the church is ever built up
Before the Lord, there is first the church, and then the giving of the gifts of the apostles and the prophets, and so forth
The prophets there do not include such prophets as Elijah, nor do they include such people as Peter before the Lord's death
Today the co-workers should come together and work in one place, whereas the brothers and sisters should be sent out
At present, small meetings have already started everywhere, and we have to go back and deal with every one of them
Our problem lies in the fact that we did not pay attention to the sending out of the workers right from the beginning
It is true that the apostles should remain and work in Jerusalem, but their view should be enlarged to include other places
Antioch is the case of the church producing the work, whereas Jerusalem is the case of the work producing the church
These are works such as the bringing of friends to the gospel meetings, the visitation of the new believers, and so forth
When the new ones stand up in the meetings to answer the call, the speaker will not necessarily notice them, but you will
You can be very sure that certain ones are saved or not saved, and it will not be easy for false believers or false brothers to slip in
Brother Cheng, if you are the one responsible for the make-up lessons, and others do not come to the meetings, you cannot sit there and rest
No matter how high a position a person occupies, or how reputable is his name, he has to learn to be led away to the lowly
If we do this, one day we may not be able to find any used items in the church any longer; all the old things will have been given away
In order to make our service truly church service, everyone has to be living, and everyone has to take up some responsibility
If we do not do this, we will not know how the other churches are doing, and we will not know whether they are doing well or not doing well
At the same time, we hope that these brothers who are sent out will have the same footsteps and will set up a high standard
Today, unless we are fully brought back to the beginning in our living and our practice, we are not doing any meaningful work
Only when the co-workers are absolute in their consecration can such consecration be wrought into the other working brothers and sisters
Consecration is not simply for us to hand ourselves over to the Lord, but for us to hand ourselves over to the church
Only the consecration that is done under the authority of the church is solid, and only this kind of consecration will last
If a man says that he is consecrating himself, yet has not handed himself over to the church, such a consecration is not solid
The worship of God lies on one side of all things, and the worship of mammon lies on the other side of all things
From the people in Asia to those in Africa, from the scientists to the most superstitious people, everyone worships mammon
Unless God's people are delivered from the power of mammon, they will not have a proper testimony and cannot be proper Christians
By the time we come to the Epistles, we see Paul saying, 'He who gathered much had no excess, and he who gathered little had no lack'
Men think that it is wrong to make money by unrighteous means and that it is right to make money by righteous means
Suppose there was only one stalk of wheat, and through my farming there are now thirty stalks, or one hundred stalks
Those occupations that do not increase the value of goods make a poor testimony before God and even before Satan
If there is a group of people who are delivered from money and on whom money has no effect, God will have a way through these ones
Those who are on the jobs need to be coordinated in the same way as those in the Lord's work need to be coordinated
A man cannot say on the one hand that he is learning to serve God, while holding on to money on the other hand
The long-term way for the church to deal with money is different from the way it takes during the time of revival
Our occupation must be such that we earn our wages through labor and through increasing the value of the goods
Only those who save for God, who labor for God, and who increase the value of goods will have true joy in their hearts
Today, the occupations of the working brothers and sisters have to be coordinated, and the work of the co-workers also has to be coordinated
If the coordination is solid and good, all the brothers and sisters who are holding jobs will become our true co-workers
If the Lord delays His coming for another one or two hundred years, those coming after us will watch the way we conduct ourselves today
We saw that as long as money has not been released from the brothers and sisters, there is no way for there to be a genuine revival
From that day on, we saw that as long as the problem with money is not settled, God's gospel can never be released
Today, God cannot be released because the gospel cannot be released, and the gospel cannot be released because money cannot be released
Some sisters had to take up embroidery work, which required fine labor, but which did not allow them to earn much money
By the next Lord's Day, the 27th, the Lord's work was even stronger, and we felt that we had to meet every day
When the first group moved out, it shocked the whole city of Chefoo, for the outsiders had reckoned that we would never be able to do this
For two nights, we waited on the Lord until after midnight, and we discussed again and again what we should do
Some people should consecrate themselves for the gospel, whereas others should offer up themselves in their occupations
Outwardly, you may be managing your own business, but in reality and spiritually, you are doing everything for the church
Brother Nee: When we offer up all our money and then receive it back again from the Lord, the money will be very different
If we are a steward, yet waste our master's money, the Lord's illustration says aptly that some will accuse us
In the same way, when we speak of the need of the church, different people have different thoughts and reactions
It is not a question of myself as a person individually; it is a question of myself being a member in the Body
If a man does not hand himself over, it is meaningless to receive a few dollars from him; it is better to return such money back to him
In all the past years, all of us have suffered so many dealings, made so many sacrifices, borne so much hardship, and paid so much price
When two or three brothers go into business together, they invariably say at the beginning that they are doing this to glorify the Lord
If the brothers will be faithful to the Lord in their jobs and if they are coordinated together, there will be the blessings
Brother Watchman Nee answered: We have to ask first of all if the church has taken a different stand with respect to its service to the Lord
Many people do not realize that, on the one hand, the church is in desolation and that, on the other hand, the church is advancing
On the one hand, the way the church has taken for the past two thousand years is one that has become progressively poorer
In Philippians, Paul said that all were seeking after their own things and no one was seeking after the things of Jesus Christ
It was not carried into Babylon at the fourth century; even at the time of the apostles, it had already fallen into desolation
All the way from the degradation of Ephesus to the Lord's vomiting of Laodicea out of His mouth, there was a continuation of degradation
When a man sins and does not have the realization that he is sinning, he has fallen into the principle of Cain
Among the faithful lovers of the Lord, God's recovery works have become deeper and deeper, and more and more numerous as time has gone on
Even Augustine's Confessions and Thomas a Kempis's On the Imitation of Christ do not contain as much truth as we have seen today
Outwardly, we should learn to condemn the desolation around us, and we should be separated from it and be delivered from all degradations
We cannot say that everything is all right; we have to separate the vessels of honor from the vessels of dishonor
All those who will not separate themselves from dishonor, who are not serious about anything, will be vessels of dishonor
At the same time, we have to learn to live in the Body, to learn to be the sons of God, and to learn to take the way of recovery
They think that the tabernacle and the temple are more or less the same thing, and that they are repetitive types
God did not try to protect the Israelites for the sake of the ark, nor did He need the Israelites themselves to protect the ark
By that time there will no longer be any need for any lastminute work all that will be needed will be for the materials to be put together
God's work today is the perfecting of the Body of Christ, and it is for the arriving at the oneness of the faith
A Christian should not only consider it wrong to make money by unrighteous means, but should realize that making money itself is improper
After they became degraded and were scattered into the nations, they became the most numerous and powerful merchants on earth
In the Old Testament, God allotted the lands to the Israelites and charged every one of them to work on their own land
The Jews learned the lesson through this, and they would not want to work for others or to have others work for them
After this, the Lord teaches us to bring people into the eternal tabernacle with the mammon of unrighteousness
In the parable itself, it says that the procedure is unrighteous, but in the teaching it says that the money is unrighteous
During these years, concerning money, the co-workers can boast that they have not been tied down with jobs for a living
We do not expect anyone among us to be a steward for his whole life and yet find nobody to receive him into the eternal tabernacle
Money that we gain through righteous means can be kept, but money that we gain through unrighteous means should be returned
With some kinds of money, it is all right to make it as a businessman, but not all right to make it as a friend
In short, we can only deal with this question by taking care of the principles; we cannot deal with it in detail
If a man moves some goods from one place to another, it is a work of labor, and there is nothing wrong with it
The main thing is that our occupations should not be a mere increase in dollars, but should be an increase in the value of goods
A carpenter improves on something from nature, whereas a store owner merely sells woodware; the latter is commercial in nature
Now, other than the seventy-three thousand dollars that we owe to others, there is still in our hands over two hundred thousand dollars
One sister, Amy Carmichael, who went to India to preach the gospel, was much helped financially by some others
If my co-workers have to do the same thing again, the responsibility falls on the shoulders of you brothers who are in business
We have to admit that God's blessing is among us, and it has exceeded the financial limitations that we have put on Him
If we had three to four hundred gold bars in our hands, the new meeting hall would have been finished nine months ago
If you make money, it is God who is making the money; and if you lose money, it is God who is losing the money
If our service is for the church, we will be able to give up even the things that we could not otherwise give up
The sisters had given up all their savings, and some sisters had to stay in the hospital and could not go home
Brother Nee said, 'The magistrates are the only ones that can light a fire; the common folks should not even light a lamp'
Brother Nee answered: In the past, the brothers in all the localities gave the co-workers quite a lot of headaches
The brothers in those localities went ahead and acknowledged such ones as coworkers and they received such ones as coworkers on our behalf
A servant of God ought to know, when others are speaking, whether the speaker's spirit is in accord with him or is in contradiction to him
May You work more and more in our brother that his spirit will become stronger and stronger that his eyes will become brighter and brighter
The Lord is responsible for meeting His demands, because whatever comes from God, God Himself will be responsible for fulfilling it
In order for God to take the fast way, and in order for the work to reach a high standard, we must have such a kind of consecration
When the disciples took care of the problem of money, the one accord followed, and God's work was realized in a marvelous way in an instant
If a Christian has not been terminated by God with respect to money, he cannot serve the Lord along with other members
If the question of money is not settled, we cannot expect to have good coordination, and we cannot expect that we can serve God
In Kutien, one brother had to travel seven days to visit another brother and had to spend eight days for the return journey
On the other hand the food that you like such as chocolate oranges or peaches may not be appealing to the pig when they are placed before it
We act righteously, live a holy life, and walk in the light because we feel uncomfortable within if we do not do these things
Some have said that, after a person has been a Christian for a long time, meetings will become tasteless to him
If you have lost your taste for the meetings in Shanghai, try to go to Soochow to study the Bible and to pray alone
A soldier who saw the glorious expressions on the faces of the martyrs ran up and asked to fill in the place of the one who had withdrawn
You can be zealous and eloquent, but you will not be satisfied, because today is not the day for new teachings any longer
We have to have a clear dealing concerning everything related to us before we can consecrate ourselves to the Lord
My concern is this: It is one thing to have a heart to serve the Lord; it is another thing to be willing to hand over everything
If a newly saved believer offers up everything, the church should mark his condition and should accept all his offerings
The church should say to such a one that the church has accepted one hundred percent of what he has offered up
Soon after that, the church should return to him ninety percent of what he has offered up and should only take ten percent
Later, when this brother is strengthened in grace and grows in life, the Lord will provide other measures to take care of him
The mother only takes ten percent of what the child offers and returns the other ninety percent back to the child
In Paul's Epistles to Timothy and in Acts, we see that Christians have to be responsible for their own household
If everything comes under the church's name, whatever a person needs, he will have to ask for it from the church
You can leave a line there for you to give something to the Lord, and another line for you to take care of your family's living and career
Through practicing this way during the past few years, we have found that the brothers and sisters all received the protection
If we are faithful before the Lord, twenty years from now the brothers and sisters after us will see a highway opened up before them
At present, among God's children there seems to be a common phenomenon that only a certain group of people are serving
God delivered them out of Egypt and through the Red Sea for the purpose that they would serve Him in the wilderness
As many as there were who were redeemed, that many served God in material offerings, and that many followed the tabernacle
Both in the Old Testament and in the New as well, there was not a distinction between the serving ones and the non-serving ones
The priests' eating, their living, and their slaughtering of the bulls and the goats were all for the purpose of serving God
Exodus 19 tells us that God intended that all the Israelites, old or young, great or small, male or female, were to be the priests
The blood of the Passover lamb delivered the Israelites with the goal of obtaining and ushering in a kingdom of priests
The eleven tribes became those who could only come to God indirectly, whereas the Levites were the ones who could come to God directly
The book of Judges shows that the Levites became excessively honored because the Israelites could not serve, even if they had money
The Israelites had to ask the Levites to serve for them , and it took a great effort for men to invite a Levite to serve in their house
All of this time, eleven out of twelve tribes were kept outside the tabernacle, and only the tribe of Levi was admitted into the tabernacle
Christianity thinks that a man is first saved through the Lord's blood and by His grace, and then goes on further to forsake the world
According to God's word, as soon as a man is saved, and as soon as he steps into the entrance, the Lord tells him to take up the cross
The only difference between them and the young ruler is that they have not returned home yet; they are still meeting here
Those who are joyful before the Lord are the ones who, after being hit on the right cheek, turn their left cheek to the enemy
Not only the co-workers need coordination in their work; every brother and sister needs to be coordinated also
Since the time you have been a Christian, have you ever inquired of the Lord concerning your job, your house, and your business?
Today, our co-workers cannot seek for their own convenience in the work; they cannot freely choose their own field
We cannot have part of the people offering up themselves, while part of the people are not offering up themselves
If we do not believe in a thorough gospel, and if we do not have a thorough consecration, it will be difficult for the Lord to use us
All the brothers and sisters have to participate in the spiritual work, and all the possessions have to be offered up
If you pay attention to the word of the serpent in Genesis 3 you will notice that his words are the same in nature as the words in Isaiah 14
Brother Witness Lee: When Satan's rebellious life and nature entered into man's flesh, man's flesh became Satan's armor
The most wonderful thing today is that, although Satan entered into man's flesh, Christ also put on the human flesh
Sisters, when you put on your dress, when you choose the fabrics and the styles, is there any element of your own will there?
If there is, you are setting aside the cross, and the effectiveness of the death of the cross will not work in you
When you take up the cross willingly, you will find that you are not bearing the cross; rather, the cross is bearing you
It is not because we are similar in our disposition, or because we are from the same school or born in the same place that we are related
If we fellowship with a weak brother, we have to help him, instead of falling into the same situation that he is in
Those who love to acquaint themselves with the rich and the influential people have lost their standing as a worker of God
Both the Lord and the apostles as well rebuked the rich and the influential ones more severely and sharply than they did others
Many people hear the wrong things because, while they are listening, they are at the same time speaking within
In the same way, if a man cannot listen to others, it is because he himself is also speaking while they are speaking
Whether or not a worker is strong in his work depends on whether or not he is able to touch others' spirit with his spirit
Whether a man's spirit is rebellious, defiled, strong, weak, or in any other kind of condition, it is expressed through his words
Science is accurate, and every bit of knowledge in science is acquired through numerous experiments and verifications
Concerning our personal life, the Lord's principle is first that our personal belongings have to be simple when we travel
When he had to work in a place that had a lower standard of living, he found that he could not handle the situation
If you practice living in a low way at home, even when others put you in a lower place, you will be able to stand it
Brother Nee's word of exhortation: We hope that Brother Hsia can leave his job and be free from the bondage of money
Outwardly, everyone was touching Him, but if one were to dig deeper, he would discover that there was another world
We should not think that the first century Christians were required to pay a great price and that today we do not need to pay the same price
There is, of course, a difference between putting a lamp under a bushel and putting it on the lampstand, but the lamp itself has not changed
The beauty of the church on the first day at Pentecost was comparable to the beauty of Eve on the day of her creation
Suppose someone says that he has believed and asks what he should do if he still has not received eternal life
Brothers and sisters, we believe that there will be a day when God's recovery will reach the fulfillment of Ephesians 4
God's leading today is to bring us back to the beginning, and to be recovered to the condition of the beginning
Neither is there such a thing as one group of brothers and sisters serving while another group of brothers and sisters is being served
We have to see that service to God is not a question of three or five people serving, or thirty or fifty people serving
Today, we see the work of gospel preaching being done not through the so-called great evangelists, men like Charles Finney and Stanley
Previously, we had to invite famous and eloquent speakers to come to preach the gospel, and we had to conduct much propaganda
Those brothers and sisters who brought their friends along with them knew if their friends sitting next to them were saved or not
The speaker on the platform could be deceived, but the brothers and sisters were clear about the condition of their friends
Today, the church is not a few special brothers rising up to preach the gospel; it is the whole church rising up to preach the gospel
We have divided up all the streets in the city, and we have assigned definite brothers to take care of every district
Perhaps here is a group of brothers and sisters who spend some money to hire a pastor and who ask the pastor to do everything for the others
As soon as human zeal comes in, the flesh comes in also, and as soon as the flesh is stopped, the service stops also
Although the one-talented ones are not worth much, when a few of them are put together, they equal a five-talented one
In the church, one cannot find anyone who does not have even one talent, unless, of course, such a one has buried his talent
In terms of function and result in the work, the great gifts are surely good when they are coordinated together
In serving the Lord, on the one hand, the brothers and sisters have to learn to be obedient and to take the cross
In order for the work of the church to be recovered, there is first the need for the recovery of the one-talented ones
It is not enough to recover the one-talented ones alone, and it is not enough to recover the authority of the church alone
According to our disposition, we do things when we feel like doing them, and we go home and sleep when we do not feel like doing them
We cannot leave a person alone for three to five months after baptism without rendering the proper care to him
Whether in the east or in the west, most of the ones who are actually doing some kind of works are our brothers and sisters
By that time, even if all the young saints put themselves into the work, there will still be a shortage of manpower
In reading the Bible, many people think that the twelve disciples were supposed to go to the ends of the earth
The Bible shows us that the twelve apostles were to remain in Jerusalem, and that Samaria should be taken by Philip
The apostles should remain in Jerusalem and work there, and all the brothers and sisters should receive training from the church
Not only do the apostles have to preach the gospel; all the brothers and sisters have to preach the gospel as well
Philip was not specially ordained to be an evangelist, in the same way that Stephen was not specially ordained to be a martyr
All the brothers and sisters must have the Lord as their center, and they have to offer up everything for the gospel and for the service
Brother Weigh Kwang-hsi prayed: May the Lord forbid that tonight's words be merely mysterious words in our heart
It is wrong for a man to view all things from the side of money; he should view all things from the side of God
God has reserved for Himself teachers, who can make decisions concerning the interpretation of the Bible and judgments on the Scriptures
There is one thing very strange in 1 Corinthians 12: although the eyes and the ears are on the head, they are not the head
The minute a brother stands up to speak, one can tell right away whether he is a brother with a gift or a brother with a ministry
On the other hand, you may see a brother who is not eloquent; you may be concerned for him and may wonder if you should do his job for him
It is like Balaam's donkey speaking human words; one cannot say that because of this, the donkey has become human
The first thing we have to see is that a person who is rebellious in his speaking is one who has given himself away
If you are an inquisitive person and one with an itching ear, you would want others to talk to you and to entertain you
There is a basic difference between a Protestant's understanding of the Bible and a Catholic's understanding of the Bible
It claims that as many Christians as there are, there are that many popes, and that everyone can read the Bible and interpret it
In the Body, the Lord has only arranged for certain members to have the authority to make judgments on the interpretation of the Scriptures
If any of the brothers have any question concerning the way of life, they can go to these brothers to seek for help
If you want to receive help from them, you have to realize that they have the ministry and that they have the authority
If any member of my body argues with my mouth or my eyes, it is arguing with the head who establishes those ministries
Because he had been dealt with by the Lord in many things, he could speak according to the principle by which he had been dealt with
If you are a person with your head removed, you will immediately sense when others' heads have asserted themselves
Once you touch them, you will realize that they have asserted their headship, and that in certain matters they have rebelled
Witness Lee In our contact with the brothers and sisters if we pay much attention to the outward methods we will become a movement
It is somewhat like the last Chinese Emperor Pu-yi, who had lost his empire already, but who continued to claim himself to be the emperor
The Roman Catholic church says that Peter was the first Pope, and that all subsequent popes are the representatives of Christ
As members our experience of coming into the consciousness of the Body is just as definite as our individual experience of touching the Head
When a man travels overseas, he may be a foreigner in another land, but he is still under the headship of his own country
A Chinese who loves China and who lives in a foreign land may tell others that he is China; he does not say that he is a Chinese
Then, some foreign students are ashamed to be known as a Chinese; they often say negative things to the foreigners about China
The more they deal with them, the more they build up the self, their own righteousness, their goodness, and their holiness
In the Bible, when it says 'the faith,' it means the saving truth, whereas 'faith' without the article refers to the act of believing
Wherever there are two persons who are one, they can drive out ten thousand, eight thousand of which they gain as extra profit
Today, God wants to see the church preaching the gospel, the church teaching the truth, and the church making the money
We have to learn to speak as one who is taught, to think as one who is taught, and to act as one who is taught
If our physical body can have such a wonderful coordination, how much more wonderful should the coordination in the Body of Christ be?
In the first verse it mentions the eye being single, and in the next verse it mentions the service being single
It is more difficult for a rich man to enter the kingdom of the heavens than for a camel to go through the eye of a needle
The founder of the Moravian movement, Count Zinzendorf, was an educated person, and he offered up all his material possessions
The number of missionaries this group sent out ranks the highest among all missionary groups during the past few hundred years
In this way, no false brothers will dare to come into the church, for once they come, they will have to sacrifice themselves
If those who gather much have excess and those who gather little have lack, it means that there is no coordination
Today, some people are bound by the world, but the bondage of money is more serious than the bondage of the world
If we do not get this question settled, we will not be able to do a proper job, not to mention the possibility of being punished
Whenever any brother or sister or co-worker goes to a place, he or she has to find out who his or her authority is
If a brother or a sister has never learned to submit to every deputy authority assigned by the Lord, he is under the greatest deception
Not only should we not be selective in our submission; we should be actively seeking after the ones we should submit to
Christians ought to learn to submit one to another, and to be delivered from rebellious acts, critical words, and reviling conduct
One brother asked: If there are government-enacted laws which the government itself does not keep, should a Christian still keep them?
In the New Testament, when Peter and John disobeyed the order of the high priest, they were acting under the same principle
Perhaps some indeed touched His back, held His hand, or tore His garments; yet they had no relationship whatever with Him in life
Among the many who thronged Jesus the woman with an issue of blood was not the only one who was ill but she was the only one healed in life
They may be able to expound the Scriptures and may cause others to become truly fervent in their hearts; yet it is all to no avail
Brother Nee answered: The one talent refers to the gift that the believers receive through the Lord's redemption
Brother Chu Cheng asked: Is the coordination of the Body something spontaneous, or is there some kind of arrangement?
Their work and conduct are limited by their judgments, and their judgments are limited by the light they have received
If all the one-talented ones will submit to authority, they will not have one talent only, but will make a profit
Because Jonathan's relationship with the first ministry was too deep, he could not disentangle himself from it
Whether or not a man's ministry can be released depends not only on whether such a one knows life, but whether his outward man is broken
Strictly speaking, for a Christian there is no such thing as the environment; with him, there is only the discipline of the Holy Spirit
A person whose outward man has not been broken may use the same terms and may speak the same thing; his words may even mean the same thing
A man who is capable of thinking and scheming, and who is clever in his mind, is not very useful in spiritual things
The more we go on, the more we have to see that there can be no real ministry unless the outward man is broken
Once the outward man is broken, the inward man can be released, and a person's word will be able to reach others' hearts
One day, when you receive God's mercy, you will be able to say that at last you understand what it is to be a broken man
When we are smitten by the Lord day by day our knowledge of the Lord will increase day by day and we will see how His life replaces our life
It is only when our outward shell is broken that we realize how rich the Lords life is and how it can achieve things that we cannot achieve
Trials are there not only to test a man's faith; the purpose of these trials is for the Lord's life to be expressed
God measures to us all kinds of circumstances and environments in order that we will receive the benefit of knowing Him
Only those who have passed through the dealings will know God, and only those who know God will be able to serve Him
Those who went to Samaria were one group, and those who go to the uttermost part of the earth are another group
Brother Witness Lee will take up the responsibility in Shanghai, and Brother Chen Keh-san will take up the responsibility in Foochow
We admit that the principle of Antioch is still very necessary in the future, but the way we should take at present is the way of Jerusalem
Every believer should have his living centered on the gospel and his work occupation dwelling and livelihood should all be for the gospel
After we finish the building of the meeting hall, in a month or so, it will not be difficult to see the number double
In addition, there are certain problems with the brothers who are speaking for the Lord; none of them want to say the same thing twice
In this way, some brothers and sisters have been Christians for over eight or ten years, yet they still do not know the basic truths
Our understanding of subjects such as the gospel, the law, death, sin, righteousness, and grace is different from that of others
We have divided the whole of Shanghai into thirteen districts, and we have started the perfecting meetings in every district
There is urgent need in the publication of books, and the cost will run up to a few hundred millions or even a billion dollars
At the same time, if you are a person who is not serious, and who is loose and irresponsible, you cannot serve God
If a man cannot be negligent in serving the earthly things, how much more must he not be negligent in serving God?
Every week we should have a gospel meeting, and every brother and sister should go and invite people to come to this meeting
Now that you realize that it is a gospel meeting, you have to rise up immediately, because you have a part in this meeting'
Many people were quite alive when they first believed, but after waiting for a while to be baptized, they became dead
When the whole church is involved in this kind of work, everyone who comes into the church will be up to the proper standard
Everyone who is born this way will be an eightto ninepound baby and no one will be a twelveounce baby that has to be kept in an incubator
After he finishes his message, he still has to go to the home of a brother who is absent from the meeting to give him a make-up lesson
Someone besides that other brother may say, 'Look, Brother Cheng has put in so much effort to give his message already
Everywhere you go you will find out right away the things that are wrong with that place and right away you will be able to make up the lack
Strictly speaking, it is a small thing for a poor person to eat more or eat less, to have more clothing or less clothing
Caring for the poor is not just the work of the church at the time of a revival; it is also a normal work of the church
Every time the church receives some money from the offering box, it should set aside a certain amount for the poor
We hope that the following brothers and sisters will bear the responsibility of the visitation of the new believers
When you receive some light from the Lord, we hope that you will make adjustments according to the light you receive
The responsible brothers will help the saints to make proper arrangements for the possessions that they have handed over
In addition, the brothers and sisters have to learn to follow the Lord's guidance in giving personal gifts to individuals
If everyone gives up all his excess, those who gather much will not have excess, and those who gather little will not have want
On the other hand, we do not want to see any excess in money, and we do not want to see the work falling behind the supply
At present, the fund for the work in Shanghai is under the management of Brother Witness Lee and Brother Tang Shou-ling
We hope that we will do a proper job before the Lord in all these matters, and we hope that we will see God's blessings
The Lords Day May 2 1948 PlaceHardoon Road Shanghai SpeakerBrother Chang Yutze conducted the singing Brother Witness Lee gave the message
Egypt signifies the flesh, Babylon signifies corruption, and Jericho signifies the place of a curse, which is the world
In addition, there are problems such as famines, wars, pestilences, unemployment, sickness, old age, death, and so forth
Although man can sit in a sofa chair and sleep in a soft bed, and although he can enjoy comfort outside, he has no comfort within
Some people wish that the sun would not move and that the earth would stand still, so that they could remain young
When they wake up in the morning and look into the mirror, they cannot help but find more gray hairs and wrinkles
It does not say that He had passed through, or that He will pass through, but that He was then passing through
Those who could not sit down were able to sit down after the preacher prayed, and those who could not stand were able to stand
If you see your own sins, and if you know that the Lord can deliver you out of your sins, and you call on Him, He will surely save you
In order to believe in the Lord, the first thing we have to do is to see the Lord, and the second thing we have to do is to receive Him
If you seek after education, education may end up hurting you; you may contract tuberculosis while you are seeking after education
Brother Nee: Last night there was one thing that we did not announce, which is the arrangements concerning the future of the co-workers
They thought that to be zealous or not was one's own business, and to serve or not was also one's own business
If there is the coordination, and you are in trouble, other brothers and sisters beside you will not let you fall
If they give up their jobs and offer up themselves full-time, their support will be on the shoulders of you brothers who are holding jobs
When the brothers come together to discuss matters, and when a decision has been reached, you cannot draw back
If you make only eight million, the church will gladly give up two million to make up enough to meet your need
If you make eleven million, you can only keep the ten million that you need, and you have to offer up the remaining one million
Brother Miao said that he has been to many places and that nowhere is the meeting hall as bad as the one here in Shanghai
What the brothers and sisters have offered up in these days is not enough to take care of these three meeting halls alone
There are some houses there, but the preparation work is only half complete; there are still many things that are not yet ready
Some had to sleep in the hospital nearby like patients on hospital beds, because the hospitality was not adequate
At the same time, we need a few hundred or even a few thousand brothers who are holding jobs to provide the support
Today, all those who are in their jobs, in their occupations, in their schools, or in their homes have to offer up themselves
If anyone wants to inquire about the accounting of the money for the work, you can go to Brother Lee and Brother Tang
A doctor can use instruments such as the thermometer and the blood pressure cuff to measure the temperature the blood pressure and the pulse
If our spirit has been dealt with, we will know what kind of persons others are as soon as their spirit touches ours
If you are a piece of rough stone, and another rough stone is put on top of you, the roughness of the other stone will not be accented
Today in some places some brothers have accepted co-workers on our behalf and have created quite a lot of problems for us
Originally, we thought that as long as we had ten or twenty that were willing to be baptized, we would baptize them
In Chiao-tung University, National Medical University, and Shanghai Medical University alone, we have enough work to do already
In the past, when the Western missionaries came to preach the gospel, they had to build their own houses and hire their own people
After these brothers and sisters receive four years of spiritual education, they can become our 'commando' units when they graduate
You have charged us to pray for those who are over us and who are in authority, that we may lead a tranquil and quiet life
Although some may kill Stephen, You can still say to the Saul who fell on the ground, 'It is hard for you to kick against the goads'
May the Lord grant him peace, and bless all the works that are related to him, so that he can spread abroad what he has received here
The voice here is not just the voice of the redeemed, but the voice of the whole heaven plus the heavenly hosts
Each tongue' in stanza two matches the 'Lamb,' while 'every knee' in stanza three matches 'the Father's throne'
God said that the first handful should be set aside for His use, and the second handful set aside for her own use
The first, third, fifth, seventh, and so forth, are for God, and the second, fourth, sixth, eighth, and so forth, take care of us
If the widow did not have faith, she might say, 'Here is a person who has been starving for three and a half years
No matter how much a man sets his hope on the uncertainty of riches, in the end he still has to turn around to set his hope on God
Tonight, we have something to say to those brothers who are engaged in business and who have handed over themselves
We have gathered together these brothers who have handed over themselves in order to have some fellowship with you
The reason for this is that your goal and their goals are not the same, and sooner or later there will be conflicts of interests
After a while, each one began to have some possessions and works of his own, and some degradations set in with respect to money
Still later the brothers and sisters began to form partnerships in investments and business enterprises and the situation became even worse
If those brothers who are in business indeed realize the great need in the gospel, they should rise up to do something in an aggressive way
All that the brothers need to do is to keep enough for their own use; the rest they should offer up to the work
Today, in the north and in the south, a few dozen brothers are ready to give themselves full-time for the gospel
On the other hand, we find that it is very simple for men to be saved among us, and the price we have to pay is very little
One brother asked: What should be our relationship with our family: Should we contend with them, or should we yield to them?
You cannot measure others by your own spiritual standard, and you cannot require others to be the same as you are
The more her husband wanted her to do it, the more she would oppose, and the more she would give her husband a long face
When the husband came home at night, she would not open the door in order to let him know that she was not happy with him
Date:Evening, May 8, 1948 Place:Hardoon Road, Shanghai Note:Testimonies by all the brothers and sisters who have handed over themselves
Prayer: Lord, help us not only to remove the world, sin, and the flesh, but help us not to come with our mind or our will
Turn the darkness within us into light, the foolishness into clearness, so that our spirit can meet You face to face in the Holy of Holies
To the Chinese, to be bright means to be good, righteous, moral, law-abiding, and just; brightness to them means cleanliness
You can even find people who are willing to give up everything, but it is difficult to find one or two persons who are as clear as crystal
Even when many have handed over themselves, it is still difficult to find a few among them who are transparent
Among them, two are like smoking chimneys; not only are they not transparent, but they are full of foul air and smog
Clearness and transparency here refer to a person's knowledge of spiritual things and his discernment of the spiritual way
On the other hand, as the Lord Himself is the light, and salvation brings the Lord into us, it also brings light into us
Today men think that it is normal for Gods children to be dark and when one or two of them are shining others think that they are abnormal
The spirit of man is the lamp of the Lord it allows God to shine forth in the same way that the light bulb allows electricity to shine forth
If a man drops the world, casts aside his sins, deals with his flesh, and turns his heart to the Lord, he will be able to see
Today, although many believers have dropped the world, cast away their sins, and dealt with the flesh, they have not lived in the spirit
When they read the Bible, pray, or listen to messages, they will nod their heads, receive everything, and approve everything
Today, God is Spirit, and we have to learn to reject our own thoughts and to exercise ourselves to live in the spirit
The trouble with us is that many times when we meet the brothers, we exercise our mind without exercising our spirit
If you go to see a brother and you prepare a speech first before you go, your speaking will surely be from the mind
All spiritual persons are people with strong emotions but at the same time all spiritual persons are those who do not live by their emotions
If you hold them up by the middle, the two sides flop, and if you hold them up by the two sides, the middle flops
If we want to be delivered from darkness and be a transparent person, we have to keep ourselves from touching any right or wrong
If you make judgments based on right and wrong you yourself will also fall into the same entanglements and you will end up being in darkness
The book of Acts shows us that the first group of workers went from Jerusalem to Samaria, and then to all the other places
In the Bible, there is not only the company of Peter preaching the gospel; there is also the company of Barnabas preaching the gospel
The elders are responsible for the church in the localities , whereas the apostles are responsible for the work in the region
All the money that the brothers and sisters designate for a local church should be placed in the church offering box
You can separate the offerings for local use and for the work by using two offering boxes, or the two can go into the same offering box
The universal church is the general church, which includes the church of yesterday, today, here, and elsewhere
One aspect refers to the church that includes all God's children both yesterday and today, both here and everywhere
As long as such an individual believer is one with the general church, he can have the authority also, and he can even be the authority
In the Bible, not only can an individual represent the church; the principle of two or three can also be a principle of the church
The only difference between that and the church actually dealing with the matter is that the church has not said anything directly
A believer should learn submission in the church to such an extent that his submission means more than his sacrifice
If they do this, others will see that here is a group of people who bear a proper testimony in the schools, the hospitals, and so forth
As long as there are four or five brothers living together, some have to learn to exercise headship, and some have to learn submission
In Revelation 7, it mentions that those who are clothed in white and who stand before the throne are countless in number
If among all the Chinese, three thousand of them would set up a flag and declare that they are China, is that not a joke?
If there is no oneness of the church, even if the number is ten times sixteen hundred, there is still no church
Only those who receive, who are humble, and who step down from their throne can identify themselves with others and with the church
We cannot withdraw ourselves simply because of our unwillingness to submit in certain matters, and we cannot fall behind or draw back
Why do we not say that we should be identified with the Head, but rather that we should be identified with the Body?
Whenever we do not submit to the discipline of the Holy Spirit through our circumstances we will fall behind in the matter of identification
If a man does not submit himself to the discipline of the Holy Spirit, he will come into conflict with the brothers
Once something is turned from a mystical one to a practical one, it will not be so easy to dispense with the matter any longer
If a man says that he is identified with the Head, yet does not identify himself with the Body, he is living in deceit
Last Lord's Day, at the end of the message, we mentioned the matter of avoiding right and wrong, but we did not explain the matter clearly
If two persons are fighting with one another, and they come before you, you should not deal with the matter according to right and wrong
You should turn to your inner being and should exercise your judgment before God and touch their spirit with your spirit
A judge is only concerned about the legal arguments of matters; he is not concerned about the matters themselves
We must not be concerned with the arguments only, but we must touch the matters themselves, and even more, we must touch others' spirit
For this reason, many times, the discernment of many who know God becomes the source of misunderstanding for those who do not know God
It was like a child who would not drink the water from the gutter because he did not want to be punished by his father
Today, just as we condemn the world and evil, in the same way we have to condemn our mind, emotion, will, and the right and wrong
Whenever we come across something, the first thing we have to do is not to exercise our mind, our emotion, or our will
God's salvation has transferred us from darkness into light, so that we would become those who live in our spirit
When we stop exercising our mind and our emotion, and when our will becomes softened, our spirit will grow and will rise in stature
