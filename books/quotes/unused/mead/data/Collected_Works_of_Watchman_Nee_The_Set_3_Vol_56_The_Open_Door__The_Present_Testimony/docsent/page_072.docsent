   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Paul in 2 Corinthians</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>As we read 2 Corinthians carefully before God, we seem to meet two persons Paul in himself and Paul in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Everything Paul speaks of, from chapter one to chapter thirteen, is all according to this principle.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>If we summarized Paul's message in this book, we could cover everything with his words in chapter four, "We have this treasure in earthen vessels."</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>In chapter one we see this treasure being put into the earthen vessel.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>From 3:1 through the end of the book, we see the earthen vessel on the one hand and the treasure on the other hand.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>After reading these words before God, we spontaneously will see under His enlightenment that the earthen vessel does not hinder the treasure from shining.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The earthen vessel does not bury the power of the treasure.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Here we see a person.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>We have mentioned before that 2 Corinthians is the most personal book in the New Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Many Epistles are filled with doctrine, truth, and revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Many Epistles move from God's point of view to our point of view.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Second Corinthians, however, is the only book in the New Testament which shows us the very kind of person whom God used to pass on His revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>If we did not have the book of 2 Corinthians, we would never know Paul himself.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>We would know what he accomplished, but we would never know this ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Second Corinthians shows us his ministry, and from his ministry, we meet the man.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>We see that he was an earthen vessel.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The Ideal Christian</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>When I first became a Christian, I had my own concept of the ideal Christian, and I tried my utmost to be that kind of Christian.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>I thought that if only I could attain to the ideal I had conceived, then I would attain perfection.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>I wanted to be perfect, but I had my own ideal and standard for being a perfect Christian.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>I thought that if I could reach this standard, I would be perfect.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>I thought a perfect Christian should smile from morning to night.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>If he shed tears, I thought he was not victorious, but a failure.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>I would even say he was wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>I thought a perfect Christian should be bold, unafraid, and courageous in every situation.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>If he was fearful in anything, I would say he did not have faith.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>I would say he was not perfect because he did not trust in the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>I also thought the perfect Christian was never sad.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>If a person was sad, I doubted that he was perfect.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>I could mention many other criteria, but I do not need to mention too many of these concepts to you.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>I believe that many of the younger brothers and sisters have ideals of what a Christian is.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>I am not criticizing because I used to think the same way myself.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Paul Was a Man</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>One day I read the passage in 2 Corinthians where Paul was sorrowful.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>I asked, "Was Paul sorrowful?"</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>I read that he shed many tears.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>I asked, "Did Paul cry?"</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>I read that Paul suffered and was sad.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>I asked, "Did Paul suffer, and was he sad?"</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>I read that he was burdened and despaired even of his life.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>I asked, "Did Paul despair?"</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>As I continued reading, I saw that there were many things of which I had never thought.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>I had never considered that a person like Paul would have these problems.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>I began to realize that Christians are not another type of angel.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>God has not put a race of angels on the earth and said, "These are Christians."</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>I also began to see that Paul was very close to us; he was not so far off.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Paul was someone I know; he was not a stranger.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>I know him because I saw that he was a man.</S>
