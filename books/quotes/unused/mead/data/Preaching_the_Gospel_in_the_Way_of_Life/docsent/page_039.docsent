   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>OUR PREACHING REQUIRING MUCH PRAYER</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>This will be a real test of our prayer life.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Do not think that to save a soul is an easy task.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>It requires a certain kind of prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>When we pray much for a certain person, that person will be saved.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>We may compare this to a balance.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The person is on one side of the balance, and our prayer is on the other side.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The more prayer we add, the more weight we have.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The weight of the prayers will balance the person, and he will be saved.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>There is no such thing as fortune in the preaching of the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>We cannot expect fortune.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Rather, we have to spend much time to pray, to kneel before the Lord for a certain need.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>This is a real test.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>NEVER ESTIMATING THE RESULT OF OUR PREACHING</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>No one can tell what the real result of our gospel preaching will be.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The brothers and sisters throughout the centuries who did much work of preaching eventually learned one thing.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>At first, they liked to estimate, to reckon, what kind of result their work would have, but after going on with the Lord for twenty, thirty, or forty years, they eventually came to the point that they would no longer estimate.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>This is because the results of our work cannot be clear to us.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Strictly speaking, we can never know the result of our work.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>In our preaching of the gospel we may work on six unbelievers in a diligent way.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Eventually, three may be saved, while the other three remain stubborn.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>We cannot do anything with the stubborn ones, so we may become disappointed.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>It seems that the first three are wonderful, but that is their condition today.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>After another fifteen years, they all may become backsliders.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Of the second three, however, one may become an apostle, and two will become the most profitable elders.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>If we would ask them how they were saved, they may say, "The first time I heard the gospel was fifteen years ago.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>At that time I was very impressed, yet I was too stubborn.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>However, that impression never left me, and after many years, I was saved."</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Out of six persons who are saved, two may be weak and four are strong.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>After only a few years, though, the four strong ones may be very troublesome in the church, but the two weaker ones will become so living with much spiritual understanding.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>If we knew these stories, we would never estimate the result of our work.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Our responsibility is to work and to pray.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>As to the result, we must leave this matter to the Lord and to time.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>I can never forget what C. H. Macintosh said: It will only be in the presence of the Lord one day that we will know the real result of our work.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The proper way to work is simply to bear responsibility.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Never estimate the result.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>If you estimate the result, you will be either disappointed or proud.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Learn the lesson to fellowship with the Lord, to work for Him, and to work in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>That is good enough.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>BEING IN ONE SPIRIT AND WITH ONE SOUL</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>We must learn always to be in one spirit and with one soul with the brothers and sisters.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>To have one soul, to be joined in soul, and to be like-souled are repeated several times in Philippians 1:27; 2:2, 20 .</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Chapter four speaks of two sisters, Euodias and Syntyche.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>These two were good sisters, but they had a problem.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>They were not in one spirit and with one mind.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Paul told them to think the same thing in the Lord v. 2 .</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Philippians is a book on the experience of Christ, and along with the experience of Christ there is the preaching of the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>This book tells us clearly that the preaching of the gospel is a matter of fellowship.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>In fellowship, the most needful thing is the harmony.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>You can never play good music on the piano if all the keys are not in harmony.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>In order to work together shoulder to shoulder there must be harmony.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Someone may be an extraordinary ball player, but he is useless if he does not stay in harmony with the team; he even becomes a damage to the team.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>There is the need of real harmony, especially in preaching the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>The more tender and delicate something is, the more it needs harmony.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>We especially need harmony in the things of the spirit, because the spirit is tender and delicate.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>The church life, the Body life, is something in the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Do not think that the preaching of the gospel is merely a kind of activity to be carried out in a rough, crude way.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>We cannot preach in this way.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Rather, preaching the gospel is a matter in the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>We must have the tender harmony, not only in one spirit, but also with one mind and soul.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Many people have been brought to the Lord through a certain brother.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>He is not eloquent in speaking, but many persons have been saved through him.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>The special characteristic of that brother is that he always keeps the harmony.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>He opens his home to invite people to come.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Then he never speaks, but he invites other brothers to speak.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>What harmony, meekness, and humility is in his spirit!</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>This paves the way for the Holy Spirit to convince people.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>If among us there is no harmony, no tenderness and humility, we cannot expect people to be saved.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>We simply kill the saving Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>I have seen a group of brothers who meet together.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>They cannot preach much, but they have the harmony in tenderness and humility.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Among them there is not much preaching, not even much speaking, but people are saved through them.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Preaching the gospel is a matter absolutely in the spirit, not in the mentality and not in argument.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>Therefore, we need the harmony.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>All the foregoing matters require our real practice.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>We cannot expect something according to our imagination.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>We cannot expect that today we will do something so successful, and then tomorrow we can forget about it.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>The preaching of the gospel is a lifelong matter.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>The word of the prayer of the apostle is that He who has begun in you a good work will complete it until the day of Christ Jesus 1:6 .</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>We have to keep going on and on.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>We must pray that the good work that has begun and been established among us by the Lord would keep going on and on, and that we all will learn the lessons.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>Not only must we preach the gospel to save others, to bring souls to the Lord, but we ourselves must learn the lessons.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>Then we will be built up together by the outreach of the gospel.</S>
