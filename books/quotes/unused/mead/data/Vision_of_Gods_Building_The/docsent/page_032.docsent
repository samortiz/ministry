   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE BREADTH OF THE BOARDS</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Each board is one and one-half cubits wide Exo 26:15-16 .</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>This is exceedingly significant.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The numbers three and five are the main numbers in God's building, and one and one-half is half of three.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>This means that neither you nor I are a whole unit; we are just a half of a unit.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>We need another half to match us.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>When the Lord Jesus sent out His disciples, He sent them two by two: Peter was one and one-half, and John was one and one-half.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>When they were put together, they equaled three cubits, or a whole unit.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>We can never be independent; we must have someone else to match us.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Many times when we observe a husband and wife, they look just like two halves of one whole.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>In the home, a husband needs his dear wife, but in the church he needs someone else to match him.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The sending forth of the New Testament disciples two by two clearly reveals that they were not individualistic persons, but members one of another.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Not one individual Christian is a whole body.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>We are but members, and we need other members to match us.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The primary factor in the church life is that regardless of what kind of person I am, I am still only one and one-half cubits wide.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Someone may be as big as the Apostle Paul, but he must still remember that he is only one and one-half cubits.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Most of us believe that the Apostle Paul wrote the book of 1 Corinthians alone.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>However, if we look closely, we will see that someone else, one who is unknown by most Christians, was his other half writing with him 1 Cor 1:1 .</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The Apostle Paul was not independent; he did not write in an individualistic and uncoordinated way.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>We must be definitely and practically related with other Christians.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>This is why there were forty-eight rather than forty-seven or forty-five boards in the tabernacle.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>There was an even number, not an odd number.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>We cannot have any odd brothers or sisters in the church; we must all constitute an even number.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Thus, we must constantly realize that we in ourselves are not complete; we are just half a unit.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>We must always be related to someone else.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>For many years I have never dared to act in an individualistic way.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Praise the Lord, under His authority I have always had some brother or sister to match me.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>We must be matched with others.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>THE TENONS</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Every board has two tenons Exo 26:17 .</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>This is quite interesting.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Why do we have two feet rather than one?</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>It is because with only one foot a person would be unbalanced, unstable, and without confirmation.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Likewise, a board may easily turn on just one tenon, but with two tenons it is fixed.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Many brothers are indeed precious, but they turn so easily.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>They are constantly turning.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Last week they were so positive toward the Lord, but this week they have changed, they have turned.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Oh, there is no turning with God!</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>James 1:17 .</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The reason many dear Christians are continually turning is because they have one tenon instead of two.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>With two tenons we are always balanced and fixed.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>If you are such a turning brother, you had better find another brother to be a tenon to you.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>You are short of one tenon; so you must borrow a tenon from someone else.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Whenever you begin to turn, you must seek fellowship and confirmation from your brother.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Go to him and ask whether or not he agrees with what you are doing.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>If he does not, then you must not turn.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Learn to have another tenon and be confirmed by others.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>THE SOCKETS</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>The two tenons are fixed in two sockets Exo 26:19, 21, 25 .</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Each board, therefore, has two tenons fixed in two sockets.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Each socket weighs one talent of silver, or approximately one hundred pounds.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>That means that under each board there is a base of two hundred pounds.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>It is impossible for a board to turn or fall with such a base.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Thus, each board is exceedingly stable and fixed.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Yet there is something more.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>THE RINGS AND BARS</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Upon the gold overlay of each board there are rings, and through the rings are bars joining all the boards together Exo 26:26-29 .</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>There are five bars on each side connecting the twenty boards.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>It is indeed interesting.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Note how these five bars on each side of the twenty boards are arranged.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>A single bar extends from one end of the twenty boards to the other and is the middle bar of the five bars.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>The other four bars are divided into two broken rows of two bars each, with one row above and the other row beneath the middle bar.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Thus the five bars are arranged in three rows.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Again we see the numbers three and five.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Three signifies the Triune God, and five is the number of the creature plus the Creator to bear responsibility.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Therefore, the uniting power of the church is the Triune God mingled with the creature.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>The bars, which signify the uniting Holy Spirit, are made of wood overlaid with gold.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Not only is there wood within the boards, but there is also wood within the bars.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>This signifies that in the Holy Spirit, who unites us together, there is also the human element.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>This is very meaningful.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>In chapter five of Andrew Murray's book, The Spirit of Christ, there is a statement concerning the Spirit of the glorified Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>He says there that the Holy Spirit is not only of the divine nature, but also with the human nature.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Hence, wood is used in the type of the uniting Holy Spirit, because He is not only the Spirit of God, but also the Spirit of the glorified man, Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>Included in the Spirit of Jesus today are the divine nature and the human nature.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>Today, the Holy Spirit of Christ is such an all-inclusive Spirit!</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>It is this Holy Spirit, the Spirit with both the divine and human nature, that unites the saints together.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>The boards of the tabernacle are not united by the wood, but by the gold.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>If the element of gold were removed, all the boards would fall apart.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>In the boards alone, there is no oneness.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>The unity is in the gold, in the divine nature.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>The rings typify the Holy Spirit in regeneration, the very initial experience of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>The bars are the uniting Holy Spirit, with both the divine and human natures.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>The bars unite all the parts together as one body.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>When we remain in the divine nature, in Christ, in God, then we are one.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>The unity of the church is in the divine nature, in God and Christ as the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>There are three groups of bars: one on the north side, another on the south side, and the last on the west side, at the rear of the tabernacle.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>Again, this typifies the three persons of the Godhead.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>The expression of the Triune God is continually seen in the tabernacle, God's building.</S>
