   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Paul Being beside Himself</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>in Preaching the Gospel</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>During May and June of 1935 I returned to Chefoo, and that summer Brother Watchman Nee stayed in my home.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>During that time we held a week-long conference in Chefoo.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>One day Brother Nee released a message from 2 Corinthians 5:13: Whether we were beside ourselves, it was to God.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>To be beside oneself means to be seemingly foolish.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>He also used Acts 26 where, after Paul defended himself before King Agrippa, Festus the governor said to him, You are insane, Paul.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Much learning is driving you insane v. 24 . Paul said that it was not much learning but that it was God in him who emboldened him to speak freely so that he was beside himself.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>For this reason Brother Nee said, Brothers and sisters, I want to tell you that if your believing in Jesus is not to the extent of being foolish, your believing is still not up to the standard.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Believing in the Lord to Be beside Ourselves</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>This message touched me, so when I went home, I knelt down and asked the Lord to forgive me because for ten years, from 1925 to 1935, I had believed in Him but not to the extent of being beside myself.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Later I learned that if we are up to the standard, we will always be beside ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>We are fools for Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Once we are beside ourselves, we will also be foolish.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>We must believe to the extent that we become foolish.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>When we get on a bus, we should testify to people.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Some will regard us as fools, but we must remember that Christ is the meaning of our human life and that we are the meaning of society.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Without human beings, the universe has no meaning; without Christians, our communities have no meaning; and without Christ, Christians have no meaning.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Hence, Christ is the meaning of the universe.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The meaning of the universe lies in those Christians who have Christ operating in them.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>BEING FILLED WITH CHRIST Christ Being Revealed in Us</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>In Galatians 1:15-16 Paul said, It pleased God...to reveal His Son in me.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Prior to his salvation Paul was zealous for religion, but he did not have Christ in him.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Then one day he met God on the way to Damascus, and Christ came into him.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Hence, in Galatians he testified that it pleased God to reveal His Son in him.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>We have Christ in us; therefore, we should rejoice and leap for joy.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>However, we should not merely have Christ within us but also let Christ fill us inwardly.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Once we are filled with Christ, we will be beside ourselves whenever we speak of Him.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Christ Living in Us and Being Formed in Us</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>After Christ was revealed in him, Paul did not want to live himself.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Galatians 2:20 says, I am crucified with Christ; and it is no longer I who live, but it is Christ who lives in me.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Paul did not want to sin, but neither did he want the world, position, or money.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>He did not want religion or even his self, because he was crucified with Christ, and it was no longer he who lived, but it was Christ who lived in him.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Paul seemed to be saying, Christ is not only my life; He is also my person.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>I am crucified and buried, and now it is He who lives in me.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>In 4:19 Paul said that he travailed again in birth for the Galatians until Christ would be formed in them.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>In other words, Christ should not only be revealed in us but also be formed in us.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Walking according to the Spirit</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>How can Christ enter into us and be formed in us?</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>In Galatians 5 Paul stresses the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>We may say that Paul turns to the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Verse 16 says, Walk by the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Then verse 25 says, If we live by the Spirit, let us also walk by the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>In these verses the Spirit refers to the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The Holy Spirit in chapter 5 is Christ in the previous chapters.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>First Corinthians 15:45 says, The last Adam became a life-giving Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Our Savior, the Lord Jesus Christ, is the last Adam.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>He died and resurrected to become the life-giving Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Hence, in 2 Corinthians 3:17 Paul says, The Lord is the Spirit; and where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is freedom.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Do you have freedom?</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>The way we conduct ourselves says that we still do not have freedom.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>We still feel shy and self-conscious when we sing hymns in public.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>We are not thick-skinned and bold; instead, we are still afraid of many things.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>This shows that we are not free.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>We need to be freed.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is freedom.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Those who are truly free should be able to declare anywhere that Jesus is Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>According to 2 Corinthians 3:18, when we are truly free, our face will be unveiled toward the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>An unveiled face means a face without any veils.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Once our face is unveiled toward the Lord, we will behold His glory.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>As we behold His glory, we will also reflect His glory.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Such beholding and reflecting will transform us into His image.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>If we are willing to let go of our face, be emboldened, and declare that Jesus is Lord, we will no longer have a long face.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Not only so, our face will also be shining.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>We will be transformed into the image of the Lord from glory to glory, even as from the Lord Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Being Conformed to the Image of God s Son</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>When we are being transformed, the words in Genesis 1:26 and Romans 8:29 will be fulfilled.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Genesis 1:26 says, Let Us make man in Our image.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Romans 8:29 says, Those whom He foreknew, He also predestinated to be conformed to the image of His Son.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>As long as we behold the Lord with an unveiled face, we will be transformed into His image.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Christ is the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>As we fellowship with Him and behold Him, we will be transformed into His image.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>We also will live out the meaning of human life in a real way and become the meaning of our society.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>In this way our society will be blessed by the Lord.</S>
