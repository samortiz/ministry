After discovering that he had a lump in his chest, he dropped everything, returned home, and had dealings with the Lord. Thank the Lord that the lump in his chest has gradually softened, and he is healthier now. He has consecrated his whole being to the Lord once again, asking the Lord to trim him and perfect him. He is waiting in peace for the Lord's leading, no longer acting according to his own will.</p><p>(2) Brother Chen Meng-tsao wrote on June 29: "Brothers Lin Mei-seng and Hu Bu-dao have been preaching the gospel in Lan-Si. Brother Ma Chuan-foo released messages for five days in the Jin-Hwa Congregational Church. Recently, I preached the gospel in Dah-Tang-Jen, Lan-Bei, Chen's house in Lung-Yu, and Chien-Men-Jang in Tang-Si. Please pray for me when you remember me."</p><p>(3) Brother Lan Tsi-yi wrote on July 19 that there are now eleven students and teachers in his orphanage. He has recently admitted seven more, who have yet to arrive because of difficulty in transportation. In his letter on August 18 he wrote: "The children in the orphanage are preserved by the Lord's grace and are all safe. They are all lively and happy. They are totally different from the day they entered the orphanage. There are only two who are older; the rest of them are all eight to ten years old."</p><p>(4) Brother Han Fu-shen wrote from Yuan-Ling on July 18: "I came to Yuan-Ling on the fourteenth (walking for three days from Chi-Li to Ch'ang-Teh, resting for one day in Ch'ang-Teh, and then taking a bus the rest of the way). Yuan-Ling is undamaged, but the dispersion of inhabitants has decreased the population....There are quite a number of students who have been saved at the Fu-Siang Girls' School. The two meetings last Lord's Day were quite good. We hope that we can conduct a conference soon."</p><p>(5) Sister Luk Tsi-tsien wrote on July 8 that she is in the Gospel Village in Fu-Hu-Chiao.</p><p>(6) A letter from Luh-Liang, Yunnan indicated that three brothers and two sisters were baptized in Luh-Liang in June.</p><p>(7) Sister Peace Wang wrote on August 15: "Brothers Philip Luan and Faithful Luk went to Penang on the third of this month.

The Lord led Brother Witness Lee to conduct a conference for believers last month in Tsingtao. Thank the Lord for gracing us and for guiding us to the way of obedience and submission to His authority. Although the Lord has gained me, I am quite weak spiritually. I hope that the brothers and sisters in Shanghai will pray much for me. My greetings to the saints in Shanghai."</p><p>(9) Brother Wu Wei wrote from northern Kiangsu on July 13 and sent his greetings to the brothers and sisters in Shanghai.</p><h2 class="head1">NEWS OF THE CHURCHES</h2><h2 class="head2">Gao-Mi, Shantung Province</h2><p>Thank the Lord, even though we are weak to the uttermost, He sent four of His workers, Brothers Witness Lee, Chang Tze-jieh, Chao Chi-gwang, and Liu Bei-min from Tsingtao. We had six days of meetings. God released the truth through the mouth of Brother Lee. The cold ones were revived, and the stubborn ones were turned. We truly saw the Lord's provision and blessing. Two brothers from Ping-Du were able to stay together with Brother Lee, and their hearts were deeply touched. The Lord's testimony was brought to the villages of Pin-Du through them. Brother Hsu Yi-min of Ju-Cheng and Brother Hu Yee-tzi of Jiao County were both revived at the Tsingtao conference. Please pray for the brothers and sisters in these four counties. Enclosed please find X dollars from the offering box in Gao-Mi for The Christian, the gospel work in the Chekiang-Fukien area, and the needy saints. Please distribute it on our behalf.</p><p>Brother in the Lord,<br />Hu Shen-fu, July 8</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_113.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_115.html">Next</a> </body></html>
