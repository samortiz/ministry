   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>SOME PUZZLING VERSES</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>" Every one that doeth righteousness is born of him" 2:29 .</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Do not misunderstand and think that doing righteousness is a condition, or term, of being born of God.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The meaning here is that if you are born of God, you will surely do righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>This doing is an expression of your being born of God.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Why, then, I used to wonder, did I sometimes act unrighteously?</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Surely I was born of God, yet on one occasion after another I could be found doing what is not righteous.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>If we go on to 3:9, we shall be bothered even more!</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>"Whosoever is born of God doth not commit sin; for his seed remaineth in him: and he cannot sin, because he is born of God."</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>How can the Bible say that the one who is born of God cannot sin?</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Surely all of us can testify that our experience contradicts this!</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Now look at 4:7: "Beloved, let us love one another: for love is of God; and every one that loveth is born of God, and knoweth God."</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Again, the meaning here is not that if we love others, we shall be born of God; rather, the evidence of our being born of God is that we love.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Is this true of us?</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Honestly speaking, sometimes it is, and other times it is not.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Since we are not always loving, can we say that we are born of God?</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Then we come to 5:1: "Whosoever believeth that Jesus is the Christ is born of God: and every one that loveth him that begat loveth him also that is begotten of him."</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>I surely like the first part of this verse.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>From my youth it has been an encouragement to me to know that because I did believe that Jesus is the Christ I was born of God.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>However, the second part of the verse troubled me.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Yes, I did love some of God's children, but there were others that were not to my liking.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Those I simply could not love.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Verse 4 goes on to say, "For whatsoever is born of God overcometh the world."</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Notice here that we have "whatsoever," not whosoever.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Whatever is born of God overcomes the world.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Is it true of you that you have overcome the world?</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Verse 18 reads, "We know that whosoever is born of God sinneth not; but he that is begotten of God keepeth himself, and that wicked one toucheth him not."</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Let us now sum up what this Epistle tells us about the one who is born of God.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>1 He does righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>2 He does not and cannot sin.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>3 He loves the brothers.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>4 He overcomes the world.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>5 He keeps himself.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>6 He is not touched by the evil one.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>How are we to reconcile these facts with our experience?</S>
