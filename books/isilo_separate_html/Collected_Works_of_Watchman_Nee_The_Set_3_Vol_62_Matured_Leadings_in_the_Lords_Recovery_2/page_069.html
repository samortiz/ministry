The church has to continue in this work patiently. It should not only arrange transportation for the visiting brothers and sisters but should provide hospitality for them as well. Ten years ago in Manchuria, the rural churches were very good at hospitality. They might not have known you, but as long as you were a brother or a sister, they would receive you freely. The church in Shanghai is not that attentive to the needs of the brothers and sisters from North China and Manchuria. But the Manchurian brothers and sisters are all very hospitable. People dwelling in big cities generally have less of a heart for hospitality. The church in Hong Kong may have the heart, but it may also have obstacles. The Bible is full of records of hospitality. We have to be zealous in this work. If a Christian does not open his home for visitors, he is either short of love or has problems with his family. Giving hospitality brings light into our homes. If there is nothing wrong with our homes, why should we be afraid of light? If we say that our home is too modest, this is understandable; the church can then pick up the burden of hospitality. But church hospitality is like hospitality in a hotel; it does not have the same taste as staying in a home. It does not give others the taste of Christ's love and the blessing of heaven. If possible, we should even practice foot-washing. Suppose a worldly brother comes to Hong Kong and a family receives him. If this family is led by the Lord to wash his feet, I believe not only will his feet be washed, but his whole being will be washed as well. But the prerequisite to all this is a mutual love one for another. Today when we call each other brothers and sisters, we do not have the same feeling as the first church. Perhaps the underlying reason for this absence of feeling is our lack in hospitality. Church hospitality must be handled properly. On the one hand, this will help our guests to love the Lord. On the other hand, this will keep us from being drawn away to the world by our friends and relatives.</p><p>One basic hidden work we have to do in the gospel propagation is the receiving of out-of-town visitors. In 1934 a sister's husband and son returned from overseas. Neither of them were saved. The way they were sent away by the church touched the husband, and the way they were received by the church touched the son. In the end both were saved. Some brothers and sisters have been saved through hospitality. Hence, the church has to be diligent to practice this.</p><h2 class="head2">Visitation by Correspondence</h2><p>The third kind of visitation is visitation by correspondence. When brothers and sisters go abroad or move to another locality, the church must not only write a letter of recommendation for them and inform the destination churches about them, but the church must appoint some saints to correspond with them. In particular, those who send them off should also be responsible for corresponding with them. Their responsibility in this matter remains and continues until such saints have established fellowship with the destination churches and are fully settled down. If a brother or sister goes to a place that does not have a church, others should communicate with him and bring the church to him, thus taking care of his spiritual condition before the Lord.</p><h2 class="head2">Love Feasts</h2><p>The fourth kind of visitation and care is love feasts. It is scriptural for believers to come together often to eat. When they come together to eat, it is easy for their hearts to be kindled and for their spirit to mingle together in fellowship. In Acts 2, at the beginning of the church life, the believers came together often to eat. Eighteen years ago in North China, I experienced this all the time. When the brothers and sisters come together in joy and bask in mutual fellowship, much profit and blessing follow. Therefore, I encourage the brothers and sisters to have love feasts all the time.</p><p>The elders and the responsible brothers should urge the saints to have love feasts all the time. We have to ask them, "Have you made arrangements for a love feast today?" If they have not, we have to ask if they have a desire to hold such a feast. If they have such a desire, we have to ask them when they will have it. If they have not set a date, we have to ask approximately when they will have it. If they say they will have it in a few days, we have to ask if they can have it the following day. If they say yes, we have to ask whom they will invite. They may say that they want to invite certain familiar ones or certain brothers and sisters. If we feel that this is not wise, we should suggest a few other brothers. In this way, we will help the brothers and sisters know each other and provide them more opportunities for fellowship.</p><p>Suppose eighty people come to a gospel meeting and are baptized. If many brothers and sisters voluntarily invite these baptized ones for a love feast, and if each baptized one has five or six people joining him for a love feast, I believe the invited ones will have no choice but to love the Lord, come to the meetings, and remain. The brothers and sisters have to look for and create opportunities for love feasts. They can set up appointments after the Lord's Day meeting. During the week they should prepare extra seats at home. If our home is open all the time for love feasts with the brothers and sisters, it will be easy for our family members to become saved. Of course, it is not enough for the responsible ones to promote this; they must practice it themselves.</p><p>In the church in Taipei, we have pre-printed invitation cards for inviting people to love feasts. If necessary, we can ask the deacons' office to take the initiative to make arrangements to have love feasts in various saints' homes. In this way the brothers and sisters can get to know each other, pray, testify, and fellowship during their meal. It is more casual and intimate to eat at home than at restaurants. During the love feasts, we can ask the brothers and sisters to give their testimonies. Some may say, "I am very happy to be invited by our host to this dinner. Since he wants me to say something, I guess I have to say something." Some may say, "Tonight I am very grateful for your love. I highly treasure your warmth and sincerity in inviting me here. It is not right for me to be on the receiving end all the time; I feel that I have to give a testimony." Others may say, "I came from a small place, and I am not used to such large gatherings. Please bear with me if my fellowship is not too good." Whatever the guests say, their hearts will be warmed up and everyone will be refreshed.</p><p>Our love feasts should take care of nutrition, not extravagance. If we are too extravagant, we cannot have such feasts often, and some may be too intimidated to come. If our love feast is too sumptuous and extravagant, others will not dare to do the same, and they will be discouraged from coming. Try as much as possible to not spend too much money on love feasts. If we can save a little, we can offer up what we have saved for greater needs elsewhere. We should restrict our spending in everything and should save our money for more important needs in the church. We should not live one day in ease and comfort. We should save as much as we can for the gospel's sake. We have to conduct love feasts frequently and make this our habit. But we should only serve ordinary food; there should not be any excess. Since we need to eat three times a day, we might as well eat in each others' homes.</p><p>The best kinds of people to invite to a love feast are gospel friends and saints whom we are unfamiliar with. If brothers and sisters invite the same familiar ones to the same houses day after day, the money spent on these love feasts will be wasted on each other. In reality this money belongs to the Lord. We must invite those brothers and sisters whom we do not know more frequently. Such love feasts are worthwhile. A love feast that is filled with love will incite us to love even more. If the brothers and sisters prepare such love feasts all the time, more testimonies will come out of the saints when the church comes together for fellowship, and they will render more praises and thanksgiving in their remembrance of the Lord and their worship of the Father. Those brothers and sisters who are responsible for the love feasts must remember to remind the saints of this practice.</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_068.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_070.html">Next</a> </body></html>
