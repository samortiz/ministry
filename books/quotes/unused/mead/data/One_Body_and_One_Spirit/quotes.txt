[1]  This small book is composed of messages given by Brother Witness Lee to the elders and co-workers in Atlanta, Georgia on November 29, 1992.
[2]  One incarnation God mingling Himself with man John 1:1, 14.
[3]  Ephesians 4:3-4 says, "Being diligent to keep the oneness of the Spirit in the uniting bond of peace: one Body and one Spirit."
[4]  The expression one Body and one Spirit is very crucial.
[5]  We should endeavor to keep the oneness of the Spirit because there is one Body and one Spirit.
[6]  The one Body is also based on the one Christ in His incarnation Matt 1:16 .
[7]  Matthew 1:18-20 says, "Now the origin of Jesus Christ was in this way: His mother, Mary, after she had been engaged to Joseph, before they came together, was found to be with child of the Holy Spirit.
[8]  There are not only one God, one incarnation, and one crucifixion; there is also one resurrection.
[9]  For the one Body there is also one Christ in His ascension Acts 2:32-36 .
[10]  The one Body of Christ is the one fullness as the unique expression of the unique One who fills all in all Eph 1:23 , leaving no ground for anyone to make any kind of division under any kind of excuse Rom 16:17 .
[11]  The one Body of Christ is also the organism of the processed and consummated Triune God Eph 3:17-19 , constituted with all the members of Christ Rom 12:5; 1 Cor 10:17 .
[12]  The local churches are many in existence but are still one Body universally in element Eph 4:4 .
[13]  THE PRACTICES OF THE LORD AND THE APOSTLE A. The Lord's Blending the Seven Churches
[14]  ALL THE LOCAL CHURCHES ON THE ENTIRE GLOBE SHOULD BE ABSOLUTELY ONE A. By Being in the Oneness of the Spirit and
[15]  in the One Accord of Our Spirit, Soul, and Mind
[16]  All the local churches on the entire globe should be absolutely one by being in the oneness of the Spirit and in the one accord of our spirit, soul, and mind.
[17]  CHAPTER TWO ONE SPIRIT Scripture Reading: Eph 4:3-4a; 1 Cor 12:13 OUTLINE The Spirit of God in God's creation Gen 1:2.
[18]  The Spirit of Jehovah in God's relationship with man Num 11:29; Judg.
[19]  Ephesians 4:4 says that there is one Body and one Spirit.
[20]  The one Spirit is the reality of the one Body.
[21]  This all-inclusive Spirit is the life-giving Spirit 1 Cor 15:45b; 2 Cor 3:6b , the Spirit of life Rom 8:2 , the Spirit of power Luke 24:49; Acts 1:8 , the Spirit of Jesus in His humanity with His suffering Acts 16:7 , the Spirit of Christ in His divinity with His resurrection Rom 8:9b , the Spirit of Jesus Christ in both His suffering and resurrection Phil 1:19b , and the Spirit of the Lord 2 Cor 3:17-18 as the Lord Spirit in the transformation of the believers of Christ.
[22]  In this one Spirit, the all-inclusive Spirit, the believers in Christ were all baptized into one Body and were also given to drink one Spirit 1 Cor 12:13 .
[23]  To be baptized in the Spirit is to get into the Spirit and to be lost in Him; to drink the Spirit is to take the Spirit in and to have our being saturated with Him.
