   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>MESSAGE EIGHT THE PATHS TO HELL</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>2 Issue No. 16 FIVE MORE WAYS OF GOING TO HELL</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Last time I spoke on five ways of going to hell.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The first was suicide, the second was refusing to remove sin, the third was pride, the fourth was adultery, and the fifth was disobeying the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Anyone who does any of these five things, no doubt, will go to hell.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Therefore, take heed and examine yourself.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>You should ask yourself, "Am I walking on the way to hell?"</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>One can take any way in the world.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>But concerning the way that leads to destruction, I advise you to be careful and not to run on it, or you will end up in the place of eternal perdition.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>I am afraid that among those who are sitting here today, there are still some whose deeds and thoughts are leading them toward hell.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Therefore, I want to speak about five more ways of going to hell.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>If you do not want to go to hell, please do not fulfill these five requirements.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>However, if you wish to go to hell but do not know the way, perhaps I can clearly present a road map to hell before you so that you may follow it and go to your destination.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>But how dreary and miserable it is for someone to go to hell.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>My real intention and desire is that you would turn back and not walk on the way of destruction.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Even if you intend to go to hell, even if you have decided to perish forever, I still hope that the Holy Spirit will use the word that I am going to say today to make you feel alarmed and unwilling to be a man of destruction, and make you fear the punishment of hell and be willing to turn back and no longer walk on the dangerous way that leads to destruction.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>I beseech you, at this moment, choose which way you want to go.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The First Way to Hell:</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Covetousness</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>I want to read a verse from the Bible to prove that coveting after riches is one way of going to hell.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>What I am going to say is not something spoken lightly; this teaching is truly in the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>If it were just my own words, they would not be as sure and factual; but if it is mentioned in the Bible, then it must be very accurate because it is the Word of God.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Now let us read the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>First Timothy 6:9 says, "But those who intend to be rich fall into temptation and a snare and many foolish and harmful desires, which plunge men into destruction and ruin."</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Listen!</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The end of those who covet riches is destruction and ruin.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Why are they destroyed?</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Why do they perish?</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>They perish not because they are sinful and wicked; but because they covet riches.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Covetousness is sufficient to bring people into destruction and ruin.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>What is destruction and ruin?</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Destruction and ruin are clearly another name for hell.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Therefore, please listen!</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Covetous men will perish; they will go to hell.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>This is not my word.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>If it were my word, then on the day of judgment, when you if there are covetous men here meet me, you certainly can say to me, "Mr. Preacher, you said that I would go to hell, but now I am here in heaven." Can covetous men go to heaven? You may say that covetous men can go to heaven, but do you all believe it? The Word of God says that those who covet riches will go to hell.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Today is the age of money.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>We often hear people saying that money is all-powerful, and that having no money is the same as having no power.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>If one has money, we think he can do anything.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Is not money very important?</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Men often think that "money can move the gods."</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>But what they call god is actually the devil.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Therefore, they really mean that money can move the devil!</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>This is true because those who covet riches eventually dwell with the devil forever.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Money indeed takes one to the devil!</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The Bible teaches us that covetous men will go to hell.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Many people are willing, at first, to believe in the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>But covetousness forces them to say, "Believing in the Lord Jesus is good, but I do not have time now; let me wait until the future."</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Where will you wait?</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Eventually you will go to hell.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>You will wait there forever and never have another chance.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Are there many sitting here who are in business?</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>I have met many businessmen, and they have a common excuse: "I cannot be a Christian now because I am a businessman.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>If I avoid deception while doing business, I will not have anything to eat.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Therefore, I cannot believe in Christ."</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Alas!</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>How cheap is your soul!</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Are you willing to suffer in hell just for the sake of one meal?</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Very well, if you choose wealth and forsake Christ, you will indeed have food to eat.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>But after you have eaten, you will go to hell.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>There was a man engaged in a small business.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>His store only had incense candles and paper money for worshipping idols.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>After he had heard the gospel, he said, "With a few hundred pennies a day, I can make a living.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>It is good to believe in the Lord Jesus and be saved, but once I believe in Him, do I need to close my store immediately?"</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>One who believes in the Lord Jesus certainly cannot open a store that sells incense candles and paper money.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>For the sake of riches actually, a few hundred pennies a day cannot be considered riches he would not believe in the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Indeed, eternal life was worth less than a few hundred pennies a day to him.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Whenever I walk by the stores, it seems that every store has advertisements posted outside that say, "Great Sale, Great Auctions."</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>What is really on sale?</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>And what is being auctioned away?</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>The soul of the store owner is being auctioned away.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>One soul has already been auctioned away for a few hundred pennies a day.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Was not that soul cheap?</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>Perhaps you would say to me, "That man was really foolish.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>For just a few hundred pennies a day, he would not believe in Jesus Christ and was willing to go to hell.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>But my business is worth tens of thousands of dollars a year.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>Or, my business is worth hundreds of thousands of dollars a year."</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>While your business is bigger than his, is your soul worth only hundreds or thousands of dollars?</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>If this is true, then your soul is also very cheap.</S>
