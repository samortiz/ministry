   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>C. Realizing His Inability</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Moses also had to realize his inability 4:10-13 .</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>He came to fully realize that in himself he was not the right person to answer God s call.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Perhaps during the forty years in the wilderness he even experienced failure in shepherding the flock.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>God sovereignly might have created certain circumstances which Moses was not able to overcome.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>All this was designed to help Moses realize his inability.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>D. Considering Himself Good for Death</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>At the time God called him, Moses considered himself good for nothing but death.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Remember, when God appeared to Moses in chapter three, Moses was eighty years of age.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>In Psalm 90, written by Moses, he says, The days of our years are threescore years and ten; and if by reason of strength they be fourscore years, yet is their strength labor and sorrow; for it is soon cut off, and we fly away v. 10 . This indicates that, at the age of eighty, Moses considered himself ready for death.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>When God called Moses, Moses might have said within his heart, Lord, why didn t You use me when I was forty?</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Then I was capable, active, and fresh.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>But now I am ready to die.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>I am eighty years old, and the time of my death is at hand.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Nevertheless, here You are coming to me and asking me to do something.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>It seems to me that You are coming at the wrong time.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Lord, I am no longer capable or useful.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>I am just an old man good for death.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>This was Moses feeling about himself when God came to him to call him to deliver the children of Israel from Egypt.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>In 1950 I gave a message along these lines to the young people in Manila.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The next day, the young people began to pretend that they were aged and ready to die.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Although many of them were still teen-agers, they acted as if they were eighty years old.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>This behavior, however, lasted only a few days.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>If we are old, we are old, and if we are young, we are young.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>There is no point in pretending or performing.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>We can only be what we are.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>If you are like Moses smiting the Egyptian, then that is where you are.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>And if you are like Moses at the age of eighty, then that is where you are.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>One day we all shall reach the point where we consider ourselves good only for death.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Everyone called by the Lord must pass through a period of time in which he loses his confidence, realizes his inability, and considers himself good only for death.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Eventually, we shall have the same realization about ourselves that Moses had at the age of eighty.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>E. Charged to Be a Sent One,</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Not the Sending One</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>At the very time Moses considered himself ready for death, God came in to charge him to be a sent one 3:10, 15 .</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>God was the sending One, the Initiator, and Moses was to be the sent one to carry out the wishes of the sending One.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>To emphasize this point, the word send is used a number of times in chapters three and four.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>In His calling of Moses, God seemed to be saying, Moses, I, the Lord, am sending you.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>You are not to be the sender or the initiator.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>You are to be the sent one to carry out My will.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>In a forthcoming message we shall see that when Moses confronted Pharaoh, he did nothing on his own.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>On the contrary, he acted as the Lord s sent one, doing whatever God charged him to do.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>To be a sent one means that we do nothing by ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Instead, we simply carry out the wishes of the one who has sent us.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>To be a sent one is blessed and brings us fully into rest.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>In order to be a sent one, we must pass through a great deal of training and discipline.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>A number of times I have sent people to do some specific task for me.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Although they said they were clear about what I wanted them to do, they eventually did things according to themselves.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>This indicates that it takes training to be a sent one.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>F. A Thorn-bush Burning but Not Consumed</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Before God spoke to Moses, He showed him the sign of a burning thorn-bush.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>He appeared unto him in a flame of fire out of the midst of a thorn-bush v. 2, Heb , a bush that burned with fire without being consumed.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Seeing this burning thorn-bush, Moses said, I will now turn aside, and see this great sight, why the thorn-bush is not burnt v. 3, Heb . The thorn-bush represented Moses himself.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>This indicates that everyone who is called of God must realize that he is just a thorn-bush with a fire burning within him and that this fire is God Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Although God desires to burn within us and upon us, He will not burn us; that is, He will not use us as fuel.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>According to Genesis 3, thorns signify the curse that came because of sin.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>This indicates that, as God s called one, Moses was a sinner under God s curse.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Moses was a thorn-bush, not a cedar of Lebanon.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>The fire burning within the thorn-bush signifies the manifestation of God s holiness.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Genesis 3:24, the first mention of fire in the Bible, speaks of a flaming sword which turned every way, to keep the way of the tree of life.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>This fire appeared after man fell by eating of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>This flame excluded man from the tree of life; it kept him from even touching it.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>In Exodus 3 fire is mentioned again.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Here the fire does not exclude man from anything; rather, it indicates that the glory of God s holiness should burn within Moses and upon him, even though he is a thorn-bush, a sinner under God s curse.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>How is it possible for God s holiness to burn within us?</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>This is possible only through God s redemption, which fulfills the requirements of God s holiness.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Therefore, today God s holiness no longer excludes us from the tree of life; it burns within us, although we once were sinners under God s curse.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>The holy fire is now one with the cursed sinner and even burns upon him.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>The fact that the thorn-bush burned without being consumed indicates that the glory of God s holiness should burn within us, but that we should not be exhausted.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>If a servant of God is exhausted, it may mean that he is using his own energy to do something for God.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>God does not want to use our natural life as fuel.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>He will burn only with Himself as fuel.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>We are simply to be a thorn-bush with the divine fire burning within it.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>I believe Moses never forgot the sight of that burning thorn-bush.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>The memory of that vision must have worked within him to constantly remind him not to use his natural strength or ability.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>Through the sign of the burning thorn-bush, God impressed Moses that he was a vessel, a channel, through which God was to be manifested.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>It is not easy to learn that we are simply a bush for the manifestation of God.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>Throughout the years I have been learning one lesson: to work for God without using the natural life as the fuel, but letting God burn within me.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>In Mark 12:26 the Lord Jesus refers to the bush of Exodus 3:2.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>In his translation Darby adds the words the section of before bush ; the American Standard Version adds the place concerning.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>The record of the burning thorn-bush is to be a continuing memorial and testimony to God s called ones.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>It bears witness to the fact that we can be nothing other than thorn-bushes.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>In these days we have seen that all the saints can be apostles, prophets, evangelists, and shepherds and teachers.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>However, if we would function as such gifts to the Body of Christ, we must first be burning thorn-bushes, those, like Moses, who have no confidence in themselves and who do not burn for God according to their natural energy.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>From the time God called Moses, Moses no longer had any confidence in himself.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>When others rebelled against him, he did not argue with them; he went to God and fell down before Him.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>In doing so, Moses showed that he was a burning thorn-bush.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>As Moses prostrated himself before God, God came forth as flaming fire, manifesting Himself from within Moses as the thorn-bush.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>May this record of the thorn-bush make such a deep impression upon us that we never forget it.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>In ourselves, we are nothing; we are mere thorn-bushes.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>But God still treasures us and desires to manifest Himself as a flame of fire from within us.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>We should treasure His burning by never putting any trust in what we are according to the natural man.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>Our natural man with its energy, strength, and ability must be terminated and forgotten.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>Our ability and strength mean nothing.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>What can a thorn-bush do?</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>Nothing.</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>Although you may consider yourself to be capable, you will eventually realize that you are merely a useless thorn-bush.</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>We all must have such a view of ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='98' RSNT='1' SNO='98'>Thank God that He visits us, stays with us, and burns upon us.</S>
   <S PAR='99' RSNT='1' SNO='99'>Although the divine flame burns within us and upon us, we ourselves are not consumed.</S>
   <S PAR='100' RSNT='1' SNO='100'>After God called Moses and sent him to Pharaoh, it was not Moses but God Himself who did everything and who was glorified.</S>
   <S PAR='101' RSNT='1' SNO='101'>Moses had no weapon; he had only a rod.</S>
   <S PAR='102' RSNT='1' SNO='102'>With that rod he went to Pharaoh at the word of the Lord, and God did everything.</S>
   <S PAR='103' RSNT='1' SNO='103'>Therefore, the glory was manifested not for Moses, but always for God.</S>
   <S PAR='104' RSNT='1' SNO='104'>Within Moses and upon him the glory of God was manifested.</S>
   <S PAR='105' RSNT='1' SNO='105'>We all should be called ones like Moses.</S>
   <S PAR='106' RSNT='1' SNO='106'>Sooner or later, we all shall behold the very sight Moses saw in chapter three of Exodus, the vision of a bush that burns without being consumed.</S>
   <S PAR='107' RSNT='1' SNO='107'>This vision needs to be stamped upon our being.</S>
   <S PAR='108' RSNT='1' SNO='108'>Then whenever we touch the work of God or the service of the church, we shall be reminded that we are nothing more than a thorn-bush.</S>
   <S PAR='109' RSNT='1' SNO='109'>The day is coming when we all shall realize this.</S>
