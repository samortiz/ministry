   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>God, however, can never accept this.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>One man has some talent and thinks that he can preach after he has studied a little theology.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>What is this?</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Bricks!</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Another man who is very clever receives some help and possesses some knowledge and then becomes a Christian worker.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Again, what is this?</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Bricks!</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>A certain man is capable of doing things, so he is asked to come and manage the affairs of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>What is this?</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Bricks!</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>All of these things are man's endeavors to build something from earth to heaven by human ability, by bricks.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Again we must emphasize that there is no place for man in the church.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Heavenly things can only come from heaven; the things of this earth can never go to heaven.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Man's difficulty is that he does not see that he is under judgment, nor does he see that he is just dust and clay.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Man may build high, but heaven is higher than man's highest height.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>No matter how high men may build their tower, they still cannot touch heaven.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Heaven is always above man.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Though man may climb and build and though he may not fall, he still will not be able to touch heaven.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>God destroyed man's plan to build the tower of Babel in order to show man that he is useless in spiritual matters.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Man cannot do anything.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>There is another incident in the Old Testament which outstandingly manifests this principle.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>When the Israelites entered into the land of Canaan, the first person to commit sin was Achan.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>What was the sin which Achan committed?</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>He said, "When I saw among the spoil a beautiful mantle of Shinar...I coveted them and took them" Josh 7:21 .</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>A Babylonian garment seduced Achan to commit sin.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>What does this beautiful garment imply?</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>A beautiful garment is worn for the sake of appearance.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>When one puts on a beautiful garment, it means that he adorns himself to improve his appearance and to add a little luster to himself.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Achan's coveting of the Babylonian garment meant that he was seeking to improve himself, to make himself look better.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>This was Achan's sin.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Who were the first ones to commit sin in the New Testament, after the church began?</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The Scriptures reveal that they were Ananias and Sapphira.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>What was the sin that they committed?</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>They lied to the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>They did not love the Lord very much, but they wanted to be looked upon as those who greatly loved the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>They were just pretending.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>They were not willing to offer everything cheerfully to God.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Before man, however, they acted as if they had offered all.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>This is the Babylonian garment.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The principle of Babylon, therefore, is hypocrisy.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>There is no reality, yet people act as if there is in order to obtain glory from man.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Here is a real danger to God's children pretending to be spiritual.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>There is a great deal of spiritual behavior which is acted out in falsehood.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>It is put on as a veneer.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Many long prayers are counterfeit; many prayerful tones are unreal.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>There is no reality, but it is made to appear as if there is.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>This is the principle of Babylon.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Whenever we put on a garment which does not match our actual condition, we are in the principle of Babylon.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>God's children do not know how much falsehood they have put on in order to receive glory from man.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>This is entirely opposite from the attitude of the bride.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Everything done in falsehood is done in the principle of the harlot, not in the principle of the bride.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>It is a great matter for God's children to be delivered from pretending before man.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>The principle of Babylon is to pretend in order to receive glory from man.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>If we set our sight upon man's glory and man's position in the church, we are participating in the sin of the Babylonian garment and the sin committed by Ananias and Sapphira.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>False consecration is sin, and false spirituality is also sin.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>True worship is in spirit and truthfulness.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>May God make us true men.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Another condition of Babylon is seen in Revelation 18:7: "For she says in her heart, I sit a queen, and I am not a widow."</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>She sits as a queen.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>She has lost all of her character of being a widow.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>She has no feeling about the Lord Jesus being killed and crucified on the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Rather, she says, "I sit a queen."</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>She has lost her faithfulness; she has missed her proper goal.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>This is the principle of Babylon, and this is corrupted Christianity.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Chapter eighteen shows us many other things about Babylon, especially regarding the luxuries she enjoyed.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Concerning our attitude toward the inventions of science, we can use many things when we have a need.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Just as the apostle Paul spoke of using the world 1 Cor 7:31 , our purpose with these things is simply to use them.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>However, luxurious enjoyment is another matter.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>There are some Christians who refuse all luxury and all things which contribute to the enjoyment of the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>We are not saying that we should not use certain things at all, but we are saying that anything in excess is luxury.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Regardless of whether it is clothing, food, or housing, if it is excessive or beyond our need, it is luxury and in the principle of Babylon.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>God allows all that we need, but He does not permit things which are beyond our necessity.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>We should order our living according to the principle of need; then God will bless us.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>If we live according to our own lust, we are in the principle of Babylon, and God will not bless us.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>We have seen that the principle of Babylon is mixing the things of man with the Word of God, and the things of the flesh with the things of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>It is pretending that something of man is something of God.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>It is receiving man's glory to satisfy man's lust.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>Therefore, Babylon is mixed and corrupted Christianity.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>What should our attitude be toward Babylon?</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>Revelation 18:4 says, "And I heard another voice out of heaven, saying, Come out of her, My people, that you do not participate in her sins and that you do not receive her plagues."</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>Second Corinthians 6:17-18 also says, "Therefore come out from their midst and be separated, says the Lord, and do not touch what is unclean; and I will welcome you'; and I will be a Father to you, and you will be sons and daughters to Me.'"</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>According to God's Word, His children cannot be involved in any matter containing the character of Babylon.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>God said that we must come out from every situation where man's power is mixed with God's power, where man's ability is mixed with God's work, and where man's opinion is mixed with God's Word.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>We cannot partake of anything that has the character of Babylon.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>We have to come out of it.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>God's children must learn from the depths of their spirit to separate themselves from Babylon and to judge all her actions.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>If we do this, we will not be condemned together with Babylon.</S>
