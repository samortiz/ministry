   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>EXPERIENCING THE DIVINE ATTRIBUTES</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In the Bible light is one with life, life is one with love, love is related to holiness, and holiness, to righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>When all these are put together, we have power.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>These divine attributes light, life, love, holiness, righteousness, and power are actually the Triune God Himself coming to us as the Spirit through the Word.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>When we contact the Triune God as the Spirit through the Word, we experience Him as our light, life, love, holiness, righteousness, and power.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>This is Christ in our experience.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Experiencing Christ in such a subjective way, we spontaneously live Him.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The word of life is not only identical to Christ; it is identical also to these divine attributes.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>From experience we can testify that whenever we strike the Word with our spirit, we have light.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The word of life becomes light to us in our experience.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Furthermore, the Word becomes life, including love, holiness, righteousness, power, strength, and might.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>This is the word of life being identical to the living Christ and also to the various attributes of the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>TAKING THE WORD AS THE TREE OF LIFE</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>We should not regard the Bible simply as a book of theology revealing who God is, what God is, and what God wants us to do in order to contact Him.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The Bible is not just an objective revelation of God and His requirements.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The Bible should also be the tree of life for us to eat.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>To us the Bible may be either a book of knowledge or a book of life, either the tree of knowledge or the tree of life.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The tree of knowledge brings death, but the tree of life brings the divine life supply.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>I can testify that in the past I acquired a great deal of knowledge by approaching the Bible as the tree of knowledge.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The result was that I was deadened, even killed, by the Bible in black and white letters.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>This is according to Paul s word, The letter kills 2 Cor 3:6 .</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The Scripture in letters can kill.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>This comes from taking the Bible as the tree of knowledge.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>But if we exercise our spirit to feed on the Word, the Bible will become in our experience a book of life, even the tree of life.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>We shall then be supplied with life through every verse.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Many Christians have been killed by the Bible in dead letters.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>What they need is not more doctrine, but the life of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>They need to come to the Bible as the tree of life.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>THE LORD AND HIS WORDS ABIDING IN US</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>I can testify that I am living and energized because I receive the life supply from the Word as the tree of life.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The Word is the embodiment of the very Lord whom I love.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Because I love Him, I contact Him through the Word, which is identical to the Lord Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Two verses in John 15 indicate this.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>In verse 4 the Lord Jesus says, Abide in Me and I in you.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>But in verse 7 He says, If you abide in Me and My words abide in you, ask whatever you will, and it shall come to pass to you.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Notice that in verse 4 it is the Lord who abides in us, whereas in verse 7 His words abide in us.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>This indicates that the Lord s words abiding in us are equal to the Lord Himself abiding in us.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>If we do not have His words abiding in us, it will be difficult for us to experience Him abiding in us.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The Lord is abstract, but His word is concrete.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>We need to contact the Word not only with our mind, but also with our regenerated spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>When we exercise our spirit to contact the Word, the Word becomes identical to the Lord Himself in our experience.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Then the Word is living, energizing, and filled with the divine attributes of light, life, love, holiness, righteousness, and power.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>By taking the Word in this way, we live Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>THE PROPER CHRISTIAN LIFE</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>I have no doubt that Paul s life was a life of living Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>He could say, To me to live is Christ Phil 1:21 .</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>He also charged us to let the word of Christ dwell in us richly Col 3:16 .</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>As we have pointed out, the word dwell in Colossians 3:16 means to inhabit, to house itself, in us.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>To let the word of Christ house itself in us is to let the Word saturate our whole being.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Eventually, when in our experience the Word, Christ, and the Triune God are mingled together as one, we live Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>We have a life full of the divine virtues of light, life, love, holiness, righteousness, and power.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>This is the proper Christian life.</S>
