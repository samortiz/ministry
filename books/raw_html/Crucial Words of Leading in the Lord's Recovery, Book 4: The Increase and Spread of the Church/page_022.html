	 <h2 class="head1">FORMING SMALL GROUPS</h2>
<p>The first realm of our life is our family; the second realm is our meetings. When we meet, we should not follow Christianity by keeping religious rituals. In Christianity the pastors give sermons, designated persons offer prayers, and the believers do nothing. This is not the way of the Lord&rsquo;s recovery. Every one of us should be able to read the Word, pray, call hymns, and sing hymns. Moreover, everyone should be a prophet and an apostle. Everyone should function in the meetings.</p>
<p>However, many of us have been meeting regularly for many years, but we are like a basketball team that is not well coordinated. A family also requires coordination. Even though everyone is willing to eat, some in the family must be willing to cook and wash dishes. When meals are properly prepared and dishes are properly washed, a family will be healthy. Our problem is that our meals are not well prepared and our dishes are not washed properly. Therefore, we must study our way of meeting, especially our small groups.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Small Groups Being<br />
a Gathering of Neighborhood Believers,<br />
Not a Unit of Formal Organization</h2>
<p>A small group is a gathering of a small number of neighboring believers. This is not a unit of organization; it is only a gathering of eight or ten brothers and sisters who live close to one another.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Attending Any Small Group<br />
for the Sake of Convenience,<br />
according to the Lord&rsquo;s Leading</h2>
<p>For the sake of convenience, a brother or sister can attend any small group according to the Lord&rsquo;s leading. Even though I have previously said that our small groups should be formed according to geography, it is permissible to go to another neighboring small group. There are no ironclad rules in this regard. Some may think that this will result in disorderliness, but this kind of &ldquo;disorderliness&rdquo; needs to be analyzed from the standpoint of whether or not the saints are living. It is not necessarily good to be so &ldquo;orderly&rdquo; but so dead. We should enliven the saints, not kill them.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Avoiding and Rejecting Natural Preferences<br />
and Fleshly Choices</h2>
<p>Even though a saint can follow the Lord&rsquo;s leading and gather with another small group for the sake of convenience, he should absolutely avoid and reject natural preferences and fleshly choices. Even though a saint can choose, his choice must be according to the leading of the Spirit. The leading brothers should not create ordinances but rather lead the saints to know the flesh and the natural man. Christianity regulates people so that they will not be disorderly, but the church must emphasize spirit and life.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Not Being a Religious Organization</h2>
<p>A small group is not a religious organization; consequently, there are no leading ones in a small group. All the saints have equal obligations, equal responsibilities, and an equal opportunity to minister to others. I hope that we would pay attention to this point and fully emphasize it. When eight or ten saints gather together, everyone is a leading one with equal opportunities and equal responsibilities.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Not Emphasizing Religious Rituals</h2>
<p>In the small groups we should sing hymns and pray according to inspiration and feeling, and we should read and speak the Word according to burden and need. In the small groups there are no religious rituals or set practices such as first singing a hymn and then praying. Our hymn singing and praying should not be based on rituals but on our inspiration and feeling, and our reading and speaking of the Word should come out of a burden from the Lord and the needs of the brothers and sisters.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Providing for Spiritual Fellowship</h2>
<p>The gathering of the small group is for spiritual fellowship. In this fellowship there should be an emphasis on shepherding and teaching one another. There should be a mutual shepherding of one another. Someone asked me whether it was possible for sisters to shepherd brothers. During the time in a small group gathering, the sisters should forget that they are sisters and remember that they are members. However, at other times, when the gathering is concluded, it is good for the sisters to remember that they are sisters and not be so bold. Boldness in a small group is welcome, but boldness in other situations can result in trouble. The protection of a woman is to be hidden and to not assume the headship. But in a small group gathering, the sisters do not need to be hidden. Everyone can speak one to another in earnestness. However, there is still a need for order.</p>
<p>The group gathering is a home meeting. In the home young and old alike can speak. When we come into a small group, we should be free to share our feelings and our needs with others. We should also minister what we have received from the Lord to others. This is to show care and concern for one other.</p>
<p>In big meetings it is difficult for us to have fellowship with one another. However, when seven or eight brothers and sisters gather as a small group, there is time for fellowship about many matters. We can fellowship concerning our problems and burdens, having an intimate care for one another. Since we are members one of another, we should share our joy as well as our sufferings. This can be put into practice only in the small groups.</p>
<p>Before taking the way of the Lord&rsquo;s recovery, I attended Sunday services in a big chapel. After the service no one ever came to greet me, and I also did not seek out others. I knew many people by their last name, and many knew my name, but we never conversed with one another. This is not a normal condition. In the church the brothers and sisters must know one another, bear difficulties together, and share in joy together. Hence, there is a need for the small groups. If we gather in groups for six months, we will feel the sweetness of the small group and enjoy an intimate supply from one another. This will edify all the saints.</p>
