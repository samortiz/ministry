   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Suppose one first hears a truth, such as how to overcome his temper or his rashness, or the truth of Romans 6:6, about the crucifixion of the old man by the Lord's death for the annulling of the body of sin, so that one will no longer be a slave to sin.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>As a result of hearing this, he becomes happy.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>He goes home and tells others that from now on, he will no longer lose his temper, for he has received an overcoming truth.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>He seems to have reached the top of a mountain.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>He may think that he has reached the peak experience.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>If he is a husband, he may go home to find his wife doing this and that thing wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The first two times, he may hold back his temper.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>But in the end, he will not be able to hold it back anymore.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Now he is bewildered.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>He thought he understood the truth and would never lose his temper again.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>But he lost his temper again.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Does this mean the truth is unreliable?</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>At such times the environment seems to have made a hole in his boat of truth; all the truth seems to have drained away.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Such a person may ask God once more to apply His Word in him so that he will be able to overcome once again.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The next time he encounters some frustrating thing, he tries to hold back again.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>He does this until he can hold back no longer, and he falls again.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>He cannot understand why the truth that gave him so much joy is all gone.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Such trials become more and more severe, and he might think that Romans 6:6 does not work in him anymore; then he becomes disappointed.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>At such times he sees no light at all; everything is in darkness.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>When he is standing on the mountaintop, he seems to be able to talk about everything.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>But now he no longer thinks that those truths are the sword of the Spirit; they seem to be weapons of reed and are completely powerless when he holds them in his hand.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>What does this all mean?</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>This is like coming down from the mountaintop and entering into a tunnel.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Suppose that there are three mountains.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Through the second mountain there is a tunnel.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>When you think you have the experience of the first mountain, God will bring you down to the plain and put you in an environment in which everything is dark.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>You will enter the tunnel of the second mountain.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>After a while, God will lead you out of the tunnel, and you will again experience the joy of the first mountain.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>But then, you will be on the third mountain.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The law of spiritual progress is to go from mountaintops to tunnels and from tunnels to mountaintops.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Every time you hear a truth, you will feel that you have obtained it.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>For example, I may speak on the Lord's teaching on the mount in Matthew 5 to 7, which covers the conduct of Christians.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>After you hear and receive it, you may think you have reached the peak and are above the world.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>But you have to remember that this truth is not yours.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>You only feel this way.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>In God's eyes you have not attained yet.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>God has prepared an excellent way; He takes you from a mountaintop down to a plain, and He puts you in your family, your school, your hospital, or in other environments.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>He puts you in a very dark place, so that you must undergo trials.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>He brings you down from your idealistic peak experience into a dark tunnel.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>All the teachings, truths, and feelings which you received the first time will go with you into the tunnel.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Then you will say to God, "God, I cannot lay hold of Your truth.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>May the truth lay hold of me."</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>When you hear a truth for the first time, you think that it is yours and that you have laid hold of much of the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>You try your best to lay hold of it, understand it, and practice it.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>After you make up your mind to do this, God will test you by putting you in many different environments like your family or school.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>He will permit your family members to disturb you, your colleagues to trouble you, and many other events to surround you.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>At that time you will see that the truth you once held onto has become like a reed; it seems that it has flown away.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>You feel that your weapons have been confiscated and everything is lost.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>You will think that Romans 6:6 cannot be applied to you and slowly lose your grip on the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>In the end, you give up altogether.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>This opens the opportunity for God to lay hold of you with His truth.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Do not think that this kind of tunnel experience will last for two or three days or for three to five months.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Sometimes it lasts for three to five years.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>At least it is possible for it to last for a year or two.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>While you are in such trials, you might think that all is lost.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>After one or two days, one or two months, or even one or two years, you will not remember the truth anymore, and your hand will lose its grip.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Then God will remind you of the truth you once heard, the truth which once gave you an exciting mountaintop experience.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Then a small voice may say, "Does not Romans 6:6 say that our old man has been crucified with the Lord, and that the body of sin is annulled, that we should no longer serve sin as slaves?"</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>By then, God will bring you to the point where you can believe.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>At first you may wonder, "Is this real?</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Perhaps I have not received it.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Perhaps I do not yet understand."</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>You dare not be as bold as the first time and try to act calmly as if nothing has happened.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>But the same word comes back and reminds you again.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Then God will remind you little by little that this is God's Word.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>You will respond, "Although I still fail, God's Word is sure."</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Now you find that you can believe.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>You have come out of the tunnel of the second mountain and have come to the third peak.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>This will not give you the same feeling you had at the first peak.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Without the experience of the tunnel, you cannot have the experience of the third peak.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>The darkness is past, but trials and difficulties are still there.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Nevertheless, you have overcome.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>The truth you acquire this time is really yours.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>The truth you received at the first peak was only in your feeling.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>This is why God disarms your self-confidence at the first peak.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>He is delivering you from a life of feelings into the realm of living by faith.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>The order of receiving any truth from God is this: first He conveys the truth to you through His servant, through some books, or He may give you the understanding directly through reading the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>After He gives you the truth, He will immediately begin working and create a sense of need for this truth in you.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>He will cause something to happen in your environment or work through other things.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>You will find that unless you experience the deliverance of this special truth, you will not be able to get through.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>In the beginning, you may think that the truth you understand can save you.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>Only when you are put in a trial do you realize that the truth is not yours.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>After this, you gradually forget this truth.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>But in your hour of darkness and forgetfulness, the Lord begins to work.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>Without realizing it, He begins to constitute you with the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>By the time you come out of the tunnel, you will rediscover that the truth which you forgot in your dark hours has now become ours.</S>
