For us to come together means that all the members, not only a few responsible brothers, need to share the responsibility of the meeting
In these messages we will also consider how to reach people, how to have an outreach, that is, how to preach the gospel to the unbelievers
According to Deuteronomy 12 to 16 the first main item was the place appointed by God as the center of worship which eventually was Jerusalem
All the worshippers of God in the Old Testament time had to go to Jerusalem, to the very spot chosen and appointed by God
The unique, central place was the very factor which kept the unity of the people of Israel for all their generations
All the people of Israel knew that no one had the right to choose any other place as a ground, a site, to raise up a temple
Later on, after the captivity, the Jewish people had many synagogues, but they never dared to have a second temple
Out of that land came many different lives-the vegetable life, the animal life, and the human life, which is in the likeness of God
In this way the people of Israel being brought into the good land typifies that we today have been brought into Christ who is our good land
After being brought into the good land, the people of Israel lived in the land, by the land, and with the land
If we tell a little child about a dog, he may not know what a dog is, but if we show him a picture of a dog, he will right away understand
We need to spend time to meditate and pray about the good land and how much the good land meant to the people of Israel
The record of the good land speaks of many things including vegetables animals minerals such as brass and iron mountains rivers and springs
In this way, whenever they came together to worship God they brought a surplus of the produce of the good land to God
The surplus of the produce of the good land typifies Christ, and the way to have the surplus is to labor on Christ
Moody, who throughout his life brought myriads of people on two continents to Christ, said that he never saw a lazy person get saved
If we are diligent and industrious to labor on the land God allotted to us, we will have much produce from this rich land
Some may say that we should not use the word labor because today is the dispensation of grace; they say everything is of grace, not of works
We need to rise up a little earlier contact the Lord read the Word and pray a little to till the ground sow the seed and reap the harvest
Even our family, friends, relatives, neighbors, colleagues, classmates, and roommates are problems we have to deal with
As we have seen, there were two main items related to the worship in the Old Testament: the central place and all the types
If you spend time to read the Scriptures, the Holy Spirit will lead you to understand the background of the worship in the Old Testament
Along with the types there were also regulations, rules, and laws related to the worship in the Old Testament time
God is seeking to have people who worship Him in spirit not at Jerusalem and in truthfulness in reality no longer in types and regulations
All the offeringsthe sin offering the trespass offering the peace offering the burnt offering and the meal offeringare types and shadows
In the ancient times, people also worshipped God by keeping the commandments, such as those concerning loving God and loving their neighbors
We must realize that worship today-our service, work, and activities-must be in the human spirit and in Christ as the reality
It may not be in the spirit; it may be done according to a program, not a program printed on paper but one printed in our mind
In order to be trained in a proper way in the Lords service in the church life the first matter is that we must learn to exercise our spirit
We always should stress that we must help the brothers and sisters to learn how to exercise their human spirit
When we are accustomed to exercising our wrist, we can play tennis, but if we do not exercise in this way, how can we play the game?
For this reason, the Epistles, particularly those of the apostle Paul, tell us that the Lord is with our spirit
There are many expositions of the book of Galatians, but it is hard to find one that speaks on the last verse of that book
The last two chapters, however, deal with the spirit: walking by the Spirit and the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ being with our spirit
As we have seen, the other aspect of the New Testament worship is to worship in truthfulness, that is, in reality, in Christ
When we come to the meetings, we have to exercise our spirit, but what should we exercise to do in our spirit?
The people in the ancient times had to bring all their surplus to Jerusalem to offer it and enjoy it with one another in the presence of God
If this is so, we are worshipping in spirit but not in reality; we are in Jerusalem, but we do not have a surplus in our hands
Many seeking believers start to meet together, but after a certain time they disband and dissolve their meeting
They do not know how to exercise the spirit, how to exhibit Christ, and how to come together with the surplus of Christ
The basic principle for Christian service is to exercise the spirit and to have Christ as our surplus to minister to others
For the whole year they labored on the good land, so they had produce from the land as a rich surplus to bring for the Lord's worship
We need to learn how to trust in the Lord, abide in Him, fellowship with Him, and deal with Him and be dealt with by Him
We will know Christ in a practical way and experience Him in our spirit, and when we come to the meetings, we will have something of Christ
When we simply open our mouth to praise and thank the Lord, we will be rich in our praise and thanks because we have something of Christ
The only way to worship is with Christ as our experience, with the spirit as our means, our instrument, and in coordination
If we have these three-Christ, the spirit, and coordination-the meetings will be wonderful and rich, full of Christ and living
We all have to learn how to exercise our spirit in the meeting to be active, not inactive, and positive, not negative
We can be assured that if we put them into practice, the meetings of the church will be enriched, living, edifying, and very attractive
Or perhaps we will be ready to continue his ministering by offering a prayer to praise and thank the Lord that He is our patience
We may have nothing to say concerning Christ as patience, but we may have something to say about Christ as our strength
If we know how to discern, we can tell that many meetings are poor; we play with 'ball' after 'ball,' not like a team but like naughty boys
One hymn is about the 'air force,' and the other is about the 'marines'; after being 'in the air,' we immediately dive 'under the sea'
A brother may realize that a hymn is too high, so he may have the intention to adjust the meeting and have a new start
After singing a hymn the best way is to continue by reading praising and praying with paraphrases of the verses in order to digest the hymn
In the Lord's table meeting, in the section for the remembrance of the Lord, a brother may offer a prayer of praise to the Father
On the other hand, however, the three brothers should not have hesitated; they should have served their dishes more quickly
Hymn 495 in Hymns says, 'Christ is God's centrality / And His universality; / He is God's delight and joy / Throughout all eternity'
According to the understanding, it is good, but according to the sense, it does not fit the atmosphere of the Lord's table meeting
After a while we will graduate from our study of the meetings, but after that we must go on to 'graduate school' and even get a 'Ph
When we offer a prayer, give a testimony, or minister in another way in a meeting, it seems that there is no need to be related with others
Before we are going to serve or do anything as living members of the Body, we first must be related with others
We can say that we are members in the Body, but we must know what members we are directly and definitely related to
On the right there is one piece, on the left there is another piece, on the top is another, and beneath is another
It is not good enough to be related to only one or two others, because these one or two may merely be our favorites
Many people say they are seeking the Lord's leading, but to have six brothers or six sisters to balance us is the best leading of the Lord
An entire building, however, can stand against the strong wind and the heavy rain, against the blowing of the strongest storm
As we have said some brothers need to have at least four or six brothers related with them while other brothers need ten twelve or even more
The more we are related to others, the more strength we have, the more victory we have, and the more protection we have
No one can arrange some brothers or sisters for us to be related with; we need to go to the Lord and seek His guidance for this
For the church to be built up, the responsible brothers, the leading ones, should help the brothers and sisters to be related to others
Two or three leading brothers can spend time with a brother to fellowship with him, saying, 'Brother, what do you feel?
After a short time, they can help another brother to be related, and after a few days they can help a certain sister to be related
In this way there is the real building of the Body, not as an organization but as something related in life and in the Spirit
That the Lord can build us up together, we must be definitely related with at least four, five, six, ten, or twelve brothers and sisters
Unless the brothers and sisters are built up in this way, there is no possibility that a local church can be built up
Before we start to minister, to serve, to do our duty as living members, we need to solve the problem of being related with others
If we have the choice to be related according to our taste, we eventually will be related to no one but ourselves
With nearly every matter, people in Christianity today have gone to extremes, some to one extreme, and some to the other
To wait and not act without the Lord's guidance in this way is something human, soulish, and natural; it is not something of the Lord
These so-called, self-named spiritual persons have been waiting for years, but they never have the guidance from the Lord
There are many reasons why, but one of the most important reasons is that we are not rightly related to the other brothers and sisters
In this way others can help us to convince our relative, and then we with the others will help to convince his neighbor
To preach in the way of inviting someone to come to our home for dinner is more practical than public preaching
Sometimes after the Lord's table, a brother in Taipei would stand to say that he had a neighbor who needed to be saved
We know how to fellowship with the Lord, and we know how to fellowship with the saints and to be built up in the Body
The more we love others, the more we love sinners for the Lord's sake, the more we will be strong in the spirit
In Song of Songs 1:7 the seeking one asks the Lord, 'Tell me, you whom my soul loves, / Where do you pasture your flock?
The seeker is telling the Lord that she needs His feeding and rest, and she wants to know where she can find it
The seeking one is taking care of herself, but the Lord's answer is to remind her to take care of her young ones
When Peter and Andrew were called they were casting a net into the sea to catch fish so the Lord told them I will make you fishers of men
In the service of contacting people the first aspect is to cast the net, and the second aspect is to mend the net
The apostle John was the last of the writers of the books of the New Testament, and his writings always brought people back to the beginning
It is very interesting that at the beginning of the Lord's ministry He called these two kinds of disciples to follow Him
It is not right for a group of believers to have meeting after meeting, but after one or two years their number still remains the same
We must learn how to take care of at least one or two younger ones in the church as our spiritual 'young goats'
You will have the position, the ground, the standing, to claim the riches of Christ and the power of the Holy Spirit
Acts 2:47 says of the church in Jerusalem, 'And the Lord added together day by day those who were being saved'
We often have the wrong concept that people are brought into the church through a gospel campaign or a certain kind of gospel activity
For this reason, we stress that every member of the Body has the function, duty, and responsibility to bring people to the Lord
We will know what we have to do, whether it is to write them, send them booklets or testimonies, or visit them
Of course, we know that we must pray much, trust in the Lord, and claim His power; there is no need to speak much about this
Many times the technique paves the way for the Lord to move; it is a good cooperation with the power from on high
He had been with the Lord for three and a half years; when the Lord was on the earth, He purposed and intended to train Peter
We should not think that even if we know nothing one day, overnight we will receive power from on high to be more wonderful than an angel
If this were the case there would have been no need for the disciples training for the three and a half years prior to that day of Pentecost
Even after the Lord resurrected, He spent forty days with the disciples before His ascension, perhaps mostly to train Peter
We may look to the Lord for His guidance, but without training and technique, it is hard for the Lord to guide us
Almost two thousand years ago the Lord said that the gospel must be preached to the uttermost part of the earth
The Lord has been ready, but why have almost two thousand years passed and the gospel has still not been preached to the uttermost parts?
After we have the burden for someone, pray for him, and receive the anointing and the power from on high, what shall we do with him?
In order to deal with a person, we must know how to categorize or classify him, just like a fisherman knows the categories of fish
We should realize that many times when an atheist is saying there is no God, an inner voice within him is saying, 'Suppose there is a God
Even atheists have a conscience, and in their conscience there is the consciousness that they are wrong in certain things
A young man may be able to boldly say that there is no God, but the older he becomes, the more weakly he will say this
Sometimes a strong person can say that for many years he was not convinced, but this inner voice was always speaking
He needs to receive this redemption and stand on the ground of redemption; then he can claim and enjoy the deliverance of Christ
The best way is to admit that we need morality, but that morality is like the fruit of a tree; it comes out of a certain life
In principle, we must find the way to help this kind of person to realize that he is saved, to have the assurance of God's salvation
Rather, we may use Romans 1:19-20, which says, 'Because that which is known of God is manifest within them, for God manifested it to them
For people who live in sins without the consciousness of sin, the best word is Romans 6:23, which says, 'For the wages of sin is death'
For a person who senses the vanity of life, we can use Ephesians 2:12, which says, 'Having no hope and without God in the world'
We need to find the proper passages to convince people, not by our reasonings or arguments, but by the written word
The life is in the seed, but there is the need for the cooperation of the farmer; that is, there is the need for a technique
If we know the principle of how to handle different situations a seed will be sown into peoples hearts and the Holy Spirit will work in them
If we all practice this for the long run, people will be brought into the church; every month we will bring forth new fruit
It may seem that there is no result for a long time, but sooner or later something will come out if we sow the seed and labor on people
There are many different aspects to a proper church life, and one aspect is that we must bring people to the Lord
Even if we are young and weak, we still have to do something to bring people in; then we will be balanced and strengthened
If in a few months ten or twenty are baptized and added to the church, we all will be strengthened by the addition of these new converts
Sometimes we say that we do not have time to invite unbelievers, but we seem to have time to invite the ones familiar to us
In Shanghai in the 1930s there was an elderly sister named Miss Groves, a British missionary who had been working in China for many years
Regardless of how busy she was or what the weather was like, every day except the Lord's Day, after tea time at 3:00 P
In those years many Western missionaries went to China, especially young women in their twenties and early thirties
Whenever a group of new missionaries came to China, most of them would stay in Shanghai as their first station
After serving tea, she sat down with them, and while sitting she kept adjusting her skirt over her legs, although her skirt was already long
In the Old Testament time the people of Israel were charged to go to the mountain to bring material for the building of God's house
If we have this understanding, aim, and burden in reaching people, our results will be one hundred percent different
It may be that in a local church the increase comes mainly from brothers and sisters who immigrate from the Far East
These believers are like children born in someone else's home; they are the 'adopted children' of that local church
If we start with fifty persons, in two years we will have only one hundred, and in four years we will have two hundred
What is its balance, profit, loss, and liabilities, and what kind of turnover has it had in the past ten years?
In order to go on with the Lord in the way of His recovery, we need to be balanced by stressing all the above matters
When the first pair was called, they were fishing by casting a net, and when the second pair was called, they were mending their nets
The fishing ministry is to open the front door, while the mending ministry is to close the back door, to keep people in to be built up
It is only right if they are conscious that they are sinful and to some degree desire victory over and deliverance from their sin
If we are familiar with the best passages, they will be ready and handy to us to deal with this kind of person
Salesmen know the secret of making a deal and then not talking too much; if they talk too much, they will lose the deal
After making a deal, a salesman gets the buyer to sign and pay; for us this means that we ask the sinner to pray
If a person is conscious of his sins and is more or less afraid of the result, we should take advantage of this
In the present age, one who sins in dancing, drinking, and gambling will suffer physically, financially, and in other ways
The other kind of suffering as a result of sin is from the judgment and punishment after death, which we can show from the Scriptures
If they have Christ, they have God, and their life will be full and their sense of vanity will be swallowed up
When we talk with a person, we should sense whether he is one who has this sense about God, whether he fears God or desires to know God
We should take this way with persons experiencing trouble sickness loss and sufferings persons who are disappointed suppressed and oppressed
The people of high class and standard, the highly cultured and educated people, have a certain philosophy of human life
We should simply speak about Christ as the goal, the aim, the standard, the center, the element, and all things
In every place there are people who are conscious that they are sinful, and they are struggling and seeking a way to be saved
If we live on or close to a campus and have a way to contact people, it is easy to bring them to the Lord by inviting them to our home
There is also the need, especially for the young brothers and sisters, to have the habit of distributing tracts
We should always have a tract or booklet in our pocket, and whenever there is the opportunity, we can give one to someone
A church should also have gospel preaching on the street or in the park, not every day but once every one or two weeks
If we always have someone under our care in this way, we will see how much we will learn and how much growth in life we will have
It will enlarge our heart and capacity, not to care for our business, family, home, studies, or future, but to care for others
We should not say that we are too shallow and young in life, so we should concentrate our attention only on life
If we pay attention not only to life but also to truth, to the church meetings and service, and to the gospel, we will rapidly grow in life
Some may go to the east coast, Canada, Mexico, or South America, not as missionaries but simply as disciples going out for the gospel
If we do the first year we may have fifty meeting with us the next year fiftyone the third year fortynine and the fourth year fortyfive
We need to come to the meetings to exercise, minister, contribute, function, and do everything we can to partake of the service
If we do this, whatever the Lord has shown us will constantly increase, spread, and expand, as it did in the book of Acts
We need to be balanced in several directions-in life, truth, service, gospel preaching, and in going out for the gospel
When we have the burden and the heart to reach unbelievers to bring them to the Lord, we must first learn how to pray for them
If today we have twenty persons, next year we have eighteen, and the third year we have fifteen, we will eventually disband
We should pray that the Lord will give us some definite persons, such as our classmates, roommates, neighbors, relatives, and friends
Rather, we should pray to seek the Lord's guidance and that He would give us two or three persons to care for at the present time
If we trace the record of the New Testament, the history of the church, and the stories of many saints, we will find this principle
Because this is the New Testament time, God will never do anything directly by Himself, although He is able to
God could send an angel to prepare Cornelius, but He would not send an angel to preach the gospel to him and his family
The angel came to Cornelius, but he did not preach the gospel because that was not within his limit; it was not his obligation
God could send the angel to tell people how to find an evangelist, but He would not send the angel to preach to them
Ananias, the small disciple who was sent to confirm Saul of Tarsus, received the vision of the Lord's sending in prayer
Within those one or two years, close to two hundred students were brought to the Lord, almost entirely through him
If someone went to the campus and the halls, he would see the students doing almost nothing but reading the Bible and kneeling to pray
They had no seats; they would tell people that whoever came to listen to the gospel had to bring their own seat
The Lord Jesus told us clearly that we have to bind the strong man who is the enemy Satan in order to release the wealth usurped by his hand
We must deal with our sins and worldliness and consecrate ourselves to the Lord again for the purpose of gospel preaching
After we consecrate in this way and gladly deal with all our sins and worldliness, we must claim the power from on high
We should leave experience, feelings, and manifestation in the hands of the Lord and simply claim the power from on high by faith
Rather, we must simply consecrate ourselves to the Lord, be willing to deal with all the things He condemns, and claim His power by faith
Whenever we go to contact people, even twice a day, morning and evening, we must consecrate ourselves and claim the power from on high
When we speak with people, we come to a certain point at which we should not talk any more; we should simply use the Word to close the deal
We may talk with a person and bring him to the point where he realizes God's love and that he needs the Son of God
We can point out item after item of the verse in a living way to impress him God loved He gave we believe we have and we will not perish
To be sure, if we put the Word into people and help them to apprehend it in a living way, they will be saved by this word
The Holy Spirit who works within people will honor this, and we ourselves will honor the Word of God and make it real
He asked her if she was a believer, and she said that she was; she had come to know Jesus when she was a child
He asked her to recite it and then told her that she had recited it wrongly; perhaps nine out of ten people recite verses wrongly
If we confess our sins, He is faithful and righteous to forgive us our sins and cleanse us from all unrighteousness'
We may also use 1 John 5:11, which says, 'And this is the testimony, that God gave to us eternal life and this life is in His Son'
We can help him to realize that since he has prayed to receive the Lord, he now has the Son and therefore has the life
We can read this to someone and explain, 'To the Lord we are like sheep who have gone astray and turned to our own way
If we learn to use the verses of the Scriptures in a living way, we will know what verse is fit for certain persons
Another verse is Romans 1:19, which says, 'Because that which is known of God is manifest within them, for God manifested it to them'
We can add, 'We can say, 'Excuse me,' to people, but we cannot excuse ourselves before God; we have no excuse'
He had a certain intention to be saved, but all those brothers fought with him for hours without getting through
The five or six brothers worked for hours without getting through, but with Brother Nee he was saved immediately
The four foregoing main points are the main things that can help us to be very prevailing in the outreach to unbelievers in gospel preaching
Because of the redemption of Christ through the cross, we have life, which we receive through repentance by faith
We need to use these ten points to 'attack' people with the gospel; we must be an army to defeat Satan by hitting people's weak point
The fruit spoken of by the Lord in John 15, that is brought forth by the branches of the vine, are the souls saved through us
The principle of the New Testament is that the Lord never does things by Himself; rather, He always does things with us
He is more than able, but He has delayed for this long because the New Testament principle is that He needs human cooperation
By Himself in His old creation He said, 'Let there be light,' and there was light, but in His new creation He needs human cooperation
We have pointed out ten ways to contact people for the gospel, but regardless of which way we take, we must keep the goal in mind
Rather, the gospel in Christianity is mostly along the line of peace, happiness, eternal blessings, justification, and salvation
Whenever we bring someone to the Lord, we should help him or her to realize that the central point of God's salvation is life
Neither justification, redemption, cleansing, holiness, nor sanctification is the goal; they are the process for the goal, which is life
It is of eternity because from eternity and for eternity God's intention is to impart Himself as life into man
After God's creation of man, God put man in front of the tree of life with the intention that man would receive Him as life
Christianity today, however, neglects the central aim and intention of God and pays its full attention to the mending aspect
Matthew deals with the kingdom of the heavens, showing that the fallen human race is rebellious to the heavenly rule
In Matthew there is the subjection needed for the kingdom of the heavens, and in Mark there is the absolute obedience
Many children, for example, are forced to subject themselves to their parents, but they are not very willing to be obedient
Daniel's three friends were subject to the government of Nebuchadnezzar, but they were not obedient to his decree
In each of the twenty-four chapters of this book there is a man who is one hundred percent in harmony with God
Until life is ministered to us by the Gospel of John, we can never be subject to the heavenly rule, obedient to God, and in harmony with God
Since the Gospel of John is a Gospel of life, it is easy to find verses there that speak of life, such as verses 16 and 36 of chapter three
Acts 13:46 and 48 say, 'And Paul and Barnabas spoke boldly and said, It was necessary for the word of God to be spoken to you first
The Gentiles, hearing this, rejoiced and glorified the word of the Lord; and as many as were appointed to eternal life believed'
Justification is not for itself; it is for life to be given to us, and through righteousness by justification we can reign in life
Verse 23 continues, 'Having been regenerated not of corruptible seed but of incorruptible, through the living and abiding word of God'
Similarly, 2:2 says, 'As newborn babes, long for the guileless milk of the word in order that by it you may grow unto salvation'
Verses 11 through 13 of chapter five say, 'And this is the testimony, that God gave to us eternal life and this life is in His Son
We have to bring people to life and help them to realize that to believe in the Lord Jesus as our Savior is to receive Him as our life
Unless we help people to realize that they have received Christ as their life, our work with them is not yet completed
After we bring people to the Lord, we need to continue to spend time to help them to realize how the Lord Himself is life to us
To help people realize Christ as their life requires not merely that we give them doctrine but that we have a certain amount of experience
We need to spend time on these verses to read, re-read, meditate, and pray about them until they become living to us
When we contact people and help them to realize that Christ is their life, we will be able to use all those verses in a living way
As we have pointed out, to help people to realize Christ as life should not be the beginning of our gospel preaching
We have been helped to know this for a long time, but many of us are still not clear how to exercise our spirit
When many old Chinese come to America, they are slow in learning the language, but their children learn quickly
When we go out to preach the gospel in this new way, we will see some newborn babes who will go on in a fast way
Regardless of which way we contact them to bring them to the Lord, we must right away help them to realize life
He may say, 'I don't know how to pray,' so we can tell him to call on the Lord Jesus with his mouth and from his heart
In order to receive a religion, one must learn many things, such as regulations, doctrines, teachings, philosophies, and performances
When they pray about this and put it into practice, they will be burdened to care for two or three particular persons
After a certain time perhaps one or two months the church will need to have a baptism because ten twenty or even forty people will be ready
Once after he had gone to bed he realized that he had not preached the gospel that day so he rose dressed again and went out to the street
