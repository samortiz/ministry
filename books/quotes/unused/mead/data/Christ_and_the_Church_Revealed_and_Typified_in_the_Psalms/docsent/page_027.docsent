   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Verse 6 speaks of His kingdom: "Thy throne, O God, is for ever and ever: the scepter of thy kingdom is a right scepter."</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>No doubt this is the kingdom age.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>After His riding, fighting, and coming back, we have the kingdom with the throne.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>His throne is for ever and ever, the eternal throne.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The authority, the scepter of His kingdom, is a right scepter.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>This is His reigning.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>He is God Himself; He will be the King, and He will reign over the entire earth.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Following this, the Psalmist comes back to Christ's character, to His being.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>"Thou lovest righteousness, and hatest wickedness."</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Righteousness represents everything related to God; anything righteous is related to God.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Wickedness represents everything related to the wicked one, Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>This means that the Lord loves all the things related to God and hates everything related to the evil one; He loves God and hates Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The Psalmist continues, "Therefore God, thy God " In verse 6 he says, "O God," but in this verse he says, "thy God."</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>This means that Christ is God, and God is Christ's. "O God, thy God!" Praise the Lord, it is wonderful; we cannot explain it.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>"Thy God hath anointed thee with the oil of gladness above thy companions."</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Because He loves righteousness and hates wickedness, God has anointed Him with the oil of gladness above His companions.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>This verse does not mean that His companions are not anointed, but that they are anointed under Him.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>We are His companions, His anointed companions.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>He is anointed above us, and we are anointed under Him.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>He is the Anointed One, and we are the anointed ones, His anointed companions.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Verse 8: "All thy garments smell of myrrh, and aloes, and cassia."</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Garments in typology signify deeds or acts.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>So here we have the Lord's deeds and actions, which smell of myrrh and aloes.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>In John 19:39-40 we see that Christ was buried with these two spices myrrh and aloes.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Hence these signify the preciousness and sweetness of the Lord's death.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Cassia is a kind of root that produces a fragrant oil which is good for healing.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Therefore, cassia signifies the fragrance of Christ's resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Thus, with all the doings of the Lord, there is the sweet fragrance of His death and resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Whatever He does, whatever He works, is filled with the savor of His death and resurrection the myrrh and the aloes plus the cassia.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The Psalmist continues, "Out of the ivory palaces stringed instruments have made thee glad."</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Ivory is a kind of bone, and bone in typology signifies the unbroken, resurrection life of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Not one of Christ's bones was broken John 19:33, 36 ; His bones were unbreakable.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>This signifies that His life can never be broken.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Hence, the ivory palaces signify that all the local churches are built up with His resurrection life.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Out of these palaces, stringed instruments make Him glad.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>All these verses are poetic expressions.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Therefore, the stringed instruments speak of the sweet, melodious, harmonious praises.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Whenever we meet in all the local churches, the first thing, the main thing, the central thing, must be the singing, the praising.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The outstanding feature of Christianity today is teaching.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Henceforth, we must downgrade teaching and give first place in our meetings to praising the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>In all the local churches praising must be the central feature, because out of the ivory palaces stringed instruments make Him glad.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>In Psalms 42, 43, and 44 we have the appreciation of the house.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Now in the house the saints experience Christ in a deeper way.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Hence, following Psalms 42 to 44, we have Psalm 45.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Everything concerning Christ here is deeper in our experience.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>We do not have adequate utterance; we can only indicate a little.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The first section of Psalm 45 is praise to Christ as the King.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>He is a King who is so precious to His people, yet One who is so mighty, so awe-inspiring to His enemies.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>He is riding on, He is riding back, and He is riding into His kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>And all of His doings are full of the fragrance of His death and resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>He is really worthy of our praise.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>We must fill all the local churches with praises to Him; then we will make Him glad.</S>
