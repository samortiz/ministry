<H2 CLASS=HEAD1>VII. JEHOVAH'S PUNISHMENT AND JUDGMENT<br>UPON KEDAR AND THE KINGDOMS OF HAZOR</H2><P>In Jeremiah 49:28-33 we are told of Jehovah's punishment and judgment upon Kedar and the kingdoms of Hazor.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>A. Kedar and the Kingdoms of Hazor<br>Being Arabia, Which Typifies the World<br>That Mixes with the People of God</H2><P>Kedar and the kingdoms of Hazor are Arabia (Ezek. 27:21). The people of Kedar were the descendants of Ishmael (Gen. 25:13), and they were nomadic (Psa. 120:5; S.S. 1:5; Isa. 60:7). Hazor was very much involved with Israel (Josh. 11:10-13; Judg. 4:2-3; 1 Sam. 12:9). Arabia typifies the world that mixes with the people of God.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>B. Jehovah Sending the Chaldeans<br>to Strike Down Kedar and the Kingdoms of Hazor<br>and Destroy the Children of the East</H2><P>Jeremiah 49:28-32 reveals that Jehovah sent the Chaldeans to strike down Kedar and the kingdoms of Hazor and destroy the children of the east. The Chaldeans would take away their tents, their flocks, their curtains, all their vessels, and their camels. Terror would be on every side. Nebuchadnezzar had taken counsel against them and had devised a plan against them.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>C. Hazor Becoming a Habitation of Jackals,<br>an Eternal Desolation</H2><P>Verse 33 declares that Hazor, which once was a good place for flocks, would become a habitation of jackals, an eternal desolation. No one would dwell there; neither would a son of man sojourn in it (cf. Isa. 21:13-17).</P>
