<p>Acts 18:8 says, &ldquo;Crispus, the ruler of the synagogue, believed in the Lord with his whole household...and were baptized.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In the Bible there are individuals who believed in the Lord and there are households which believed in the Lord. Notice how easy it is for God&rsquo;s grace to come to a household. The whole household of Crispus believed and was baptized.</p>
<h2 class="head3">7. The Promise of Pentecost<br />
Being Given to You and Your Children</h2>
<p>Let us consider the condition at Pentecost. Acts 2:39 says, &ldquo;For to you is the promise and to your children, and to all who are far off, as many as the Lord our God calls to Himself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The promise of Pentecost includes the forgiveness of sins and the receiving of the Holy Spirit. It was given &ldquo;to you&rdquo; <em>and</em> &ldquo;to your children&rdquo;; it was not merely given &ldquo;to you.&rdquo; Those who are heads of the family in particular should lay hold of this promise and say, &ldquo;Lord, Your promise is for me and also for my children. It cannot be mine without my children also being included. I want it for myself, and I want it also for my children.&rdquo;</p>
<h2 class="head3">8. Peace to a House</h2>
<p>Luke 10:5-6 says, &ldquo;Into whatever house you enter, first say, Peace to this house. And if a son of peace is there, your peace shall rest upon it; but if not, it shall return upon you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Lord says that when a person sets out to preach the gospel, he should say as he enters into a house, &ldquo;Peace to this <em>house.&rdquo;</em> This shows that God&rsquo;s peace comes to man by households. It is not just given to individuals, but to households. If anyone is worthy of peace in a house, peace will come to his entire household. This verse is clear enough. God deals with man by households. Thank God, peace comes to man household by household.</p>
<h2 class="head3">9. The Household of Stephanas</h2>
<p>First Corinthians 1:16 says, &ldquo;I did baptize the household of Stephanas also.&rdquo; Here Paul said that he baptized every member of the household of Stephanas. Like the jailer and the house of Lydia, Stephanas&rsquo;s whole household believed and was baptized.</p>
<h2 class="head3">10. The Household of Onesiphorus</h2>
<p>Second Timothy 4:19 says, &ldquo;Greet Prisca and Aquila and the house of Onesiphorus,&rdquo; and 1:16 says, &ldquo;May the Lord grant mercy to the house of Onesiphorus, for he often refreshed me and was not ashamed of my chain.&rdquo; Here was a family that took care of Paul, a household that was not ashamed of his chain. Notice again that it was not an individual matter but something to do with a household.</p>
<p>These numerous cases provide ample proof in both the Old Testament and the New Testament that God deals with man by households. This is particularly true in the case of salvation; God takes the household as a unit.</p>
<h2 class="head1">III. THE HOUSEHOLD BEING ALSO THE UNIT<br />
OF GOD&rsquo;S PUNISHMENT</h2>
<p>We need to see some verses which show that the unit of God&rsquo;s punishment is also the household. When man rebelled against God, God was provoked and He judged man. In judging man He took the household as a unit. God&rsquo;s judgment comes through one man to the entire household, just as God&rsquo;s blessing comes through one man to the entire household. Once we see this, we will take a stand for our household and declare that our household is for the Lord.</p>
<h2 class="head2">A. Pharaoh and His House</h2>
<p>Genesis 12:17 says, &ldquo;The Lord plagued Pharaoh and his house with great plagues, because of Sarai, Abram&rsquo;s wife.&rdquo; The sin of Pharaoh brought God&rsquo;s plague to his whole household. God punished his whole household. If God&rsquo;s judgment comes to a household, we should expect that His blessing also will come to a household. We are not those under condemnation but those under His blessing.</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_017.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_019.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Messages for Building Up New Believers, Vol. 2 &nbsp; pg 18</div><br></body></html>
