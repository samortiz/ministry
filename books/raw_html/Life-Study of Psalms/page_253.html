<H2 CLASS=HEAD1>IV. SOME FURTHER MATTERS</H2><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>A. Our Shield and God's Anointed</H2><P>Psalm 84:9 says, "Behold, our shield, O God,/And look upon the face of Your anointed." Here the "shield" and the "anointed" refer to David the king, who typifies Christ.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>B. Standing at the Threshold of the House of God</H2><P>Verse 10 speaks of standing at the threshold of the house of God. It is better to stand at this threshold than to dwell in the tents of the wicked. However, we should not be satisfied to stay at the threshold of the house of God but should enter into His house.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>C. Those Who Walk Uprightly<br>and the Man Who Trusts in Jehovah</H2><P>Verse 11 speaks of those who walk uprightly, and verse 12 concludes, "O Jehovah of hosts, blessed is the man/Who trusts in You." Here "those who walk uprightly" refers probably, in the sentiments of the psalmist, to those who keep the law. The "man who trusts in You" refers probably, in the sentiments of the psalmist, to the man who dwells in the house of God.</P>
