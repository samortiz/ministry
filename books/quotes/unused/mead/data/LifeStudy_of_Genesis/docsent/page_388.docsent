   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>4 Receiving a Hundredfold Harvest</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>and Becoming Great</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Isaac received a hundredfold harvest and became great 26:12-14 .</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The word great in 26:13 means rich.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Isaac "became great and continued to grow great until he became very great" Heb .</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>He became rich by fulfilling the regular duty of sowing and through the Lord's blessing.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>This also was a matter of enjoyment, but this enjoyment was not on the proper standing.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Isaac might have said to himself, "My standing must be right.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>If it were not right, how could the Lord have blessed me with all these riches?"</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>But God might have said, "Isaac, you are settled here and have gained great riches, but I do not agree with your standing.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>I shall raise up the circumstances to force you to leave this place."</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>May the Holy Spirit show us such a vivid picture here.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>On the one hand, there is the proper enjoyment; on the other hand, there is the improper standing.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Even if we lack the proper standing, we may continue to have the enjoyment.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>But do not think that this enjoyment justifies your standing.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>As long as we have the enjoyment, our need is met.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>But for the fulfillment of God's eternal purpose, we need to get on the proper standing.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Nevertheless, even if we are not on the proper standing, God still grants us His rich provision.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>This is wonderful.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>What a wonderful God!</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>What a wonderful provision!</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>We have been destined for the enjoyment.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Even when we are wrong in our standing, we may still have the rich enjoyment.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>But God will not let us go.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>He will use our circumstances to bring us back to the proper standing that the fulfillment of His purpose might be realized.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>5 Finding the "Well of Living Water"</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Before Isaac came back to Beer-sheba, he had enjoyment after enjoyment, grace upon grace.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>After receiving the hundredfold harvest, he found the "well of living water" and came into the "broad places," the "broad ways" Rehoboth, 26:15-22 .</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Although he had enjoyment in such a rich way, his standing was not right and he was forced to leave the broad ways and to come back to Beer-sheba.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>6 Coming Back to Beer-sheba</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>When Isaac returned to Beer-sheba 26:23-33 , the Lord immediately appeared to him, speaking to him and confirming His promise, saying, "I am the God of Abraham thy father: fear not, for I am with thee, and will bless thee, and multiply thy seed for my servant Abraham's sake" 26:24 .</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Then, here in Beer-sheba Isaac began to have the proper testimony.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>He built an altar, called upon the name of the Lord, and pitched his tent 26:25 .</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Here in Beer-sheba he had a life for the fulfillment of God's eternal purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Eventually, here in Beer-sheba the opposers were subdued 26:26-31 .</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Beer-sheba is the right place, the place where we can have the proper standing, and the proper standing means a great deal both to God and to us.</S>
