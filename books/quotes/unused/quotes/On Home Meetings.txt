The messages contained in this book concerning the home meetings were given as a series of training messages in April 1985 in Taipei Taiwan
On the one hand, on the administrative side, we arranged to have over forty elders to take the lead in the halls
We fought and struggled most vigorously around 1930, because it was not an easy thing to have the Lord's recovery in China
It is not hard for you to find out from Acts how the three thousand and five thousand met after they got saved
Acts chapter eight says that a great persecution arose in Jerusalem not too long after the three thousand and the five thousand were saved
It was very difficult to bring people to salvation during those days in mainland China, and there were no big meetings at all to rely upon
It was because of the increase in number that there was the need to meet in homes but we did not go to the extent of meeting in small groups
The churches on the whole island of Taiwan increased from four or five hundred to forty or fifty thousand in the period from 1949 to 1957
When we first escaped from the big meetings in the denominations to climb this mountain, we climbed to the home meetings
When we raised our heads the first thing we saw was the hymn numbers posted on the board so we knew which hymns were to be sung that morning
After the singing, someone would preach the sermon and then someone would make announcements about certain things
Where were the mutual fellowship and communication, and the steadfast continuing in the teaching of the apostles, as recorded in the Bible?
The condition of fallen Christianity is that it relies on big meetings, on human capability, and on eloquent speakers
Sixty years ago, the Lord showed us that the truth of the Bible was not to take this way, but rather to emphasize mutual fellowship
If the way is through big meetings, then it is not easy to talk once to every member, even after meeting for ten years
On this land there will be not only a meeting hall, but also a place for activities which may serve as a weekend camp
Based on our past experience, the most effective way to work on the campuses is through the summer and winter camps
Out of the ten we bring up the mountain, even though not all ten will be baptized, at least there could be seven or eight
Those of you who are at least somewhat involved in the campus work all know that this is the most effective way
Particularly in Central and South America, the rate of increase has been very fast, and it is still increasing
Otherwise, the Lord will have to look for some other people, and we will go downhill, becoming yet another group in Christianity
We had to learn to pray, read the Word, know the truth, grow in life, experience Christ, gain Christ, and enjoy the riches of Christ
The left side is the big meetings and the right side is the home meetings; thus the big meetings and the home meetings are balanced
If we only pay attention to big meetings and neglect the home meetings, we are reenacting the story of the age of the judges
Today, is it easier for you to follow Christ, experience Christ, enjoy Christ, or for a Dutch man like him to learn Chinese?
A church meeting like this will have turned from building on the wrong foundation to building on the right foundation
We should preach the gospel and lead the brothers and sisters to stand firm, so that everyone is a soldier and our army is everywhere
If your small family has not been evangelized and your relatives have not been evangelized, it is impossible to evangelize Taiwan
In your home meetings now, there is some giving of testimonies and some calling of hymns, but this is mostly done in a natural way
You must stay home to pray more read the Bible more fellowship with the Lord more have more experience of life and seek more light and truth
If you are like this every day, when you stand up to speak, what you say will not be natural or by way of regulation
With Peter in the beginning in Acts 2 and 5, the church meetings consisted of both big meetings and small gatherings
Whatever was spoken and taught in the big meetings-was it left unspoken, or was it changed, in the small meetings?
These are the contents of the church meetings and the basic principle of the church meetings, which principle is just Christ
The three thousand believers then continued steadfastly in the teaching which they had heard when they were saved
For generations the Jews had been preaching Moses the Ten Commandments offerings gifts worshipping God in the temple and burning incense
The practice in that day was that what Peter spoke the first day was taken back and repeated from house to house the following day
The meeting was good the first time, the second time, the third time, but by the fourth time it had become tasteless
When you come to a meeting, before leaving home you already have a psalm or a revelation; therefore, you bring them to the meeting
It is that before you leave for the meeting, you are one who already 'has,' as described by a hymn: 'Whene'er we meet with Christ endued
The riches of the produce that they brought to the feast typifies the Christ brought to the New Testament meetings
We know this because in his Epistles he mentions the church in the home of a certain brother at least four times
From this you can see that there were big meetings and home meetings under the ministries of both Peter and Paul
After the irrigation they had to weed further and nurture their fields, staying busy daily for about three to four months
At this time they still had to reap the harvest and dry the grains in the field before storing everything in the barns
God told the people that they must come to worship Him three times a year, but they should not appear before Him empty
Do you fellowship with Him every morning, worshipping Him, praying to Him, reading His Word, and waiting in His presence?
The harvest is not for your own enjoyment, but for you to offer to God and to share with your fellow members in the presence of God
If we should go back to repeat the history of Christianity, then the Lord would say, 'All right, that is enough
When we are sick, we go to the doctor; when we are sued, we go to the lawyer; and when we need prayers, we go to the pastor
Even though everyone has been endeavoring to testify for the Lord, unconsciously we have been going downhill on a seemingly level road
By comparison, the effort spent saving people in the home meetings is more dependable than that spent in the big meetings
If we should totally depend on the big meetings as in the past, we would give up the future of the Lord's recovery
Acts 2:46 says, 'And day by day, continuing steadfastly with one accord in the temple and breaking bread from house to house'
We see a clear picture that the church meetings include on the one hand the big meetings and on the other hand the small gatherings
When it came to the meetings from house to house, there must have been a good number of people sharing what they had heard in the temple
They did not speak of their own things but they continued steadfastly in the teaching of the apostles and spoke whatever Peter had spoken
Within one to two days one speaking brother, Peter, was propagated into hundreds of speaking brothers and sisters
The danger of the home meetings is that while the capable ones are holding back, those who speak nonsense will speak in the meetings
History tells us that the piece in Mu Zha became a church the piece in Shi Lin became a church and the piece in Pei Tao also became a church
We hoped that the big meetings would be attractive and that the number attending the big meetings would increase
After twenty-seven years of labor the actual number of those attending the meetings was lower than it was over twenty years ago
It does not matter how capable Billy Graham is; he cannot compare to those thousands of teachers, each one teaching twenty-five students
In Taiwan civilization is highly developed, education is widespread, the economy is prosperous, and public safety is well maintained
In the business world making money does not prove everything, but in the church the number of people means everything
As long as the number decreases, it does not matter how much you say a certain aspect is doing well, it is still not doing well
Now the home meetings have started, and now one meeting place has been distributed into more than twenty places
He said the word 'has' in Greek does not mean that we are going to have or that we will have, but that we already have in our hands
He said that this 'has' means that as you fellowship with the Lord day by day and read the Word of the Lord at home, you have the knowledge
They labored all year and were able to bring something from their herds, their flocks, and their fields to the feast
In the brothers' meeting there was no chairman or preacher, but they were to practice together 1 Corinthians 14:26
It is just like a Chinese saying, that in order to have a strong society and a strong nation the homes must first be kept in good order
Do not speak when you are not sure that your speaking is from the spirit or that it will supply Christ to others
When our number is not increasing we need to wake up to find a way out, like a businessman when the business is not making money
If there were outstanding ones among those eight thousand, they would not have been omitted by Luke, the author of Acts
From this we can see that at that time, besides Stephen, Philip, and Barnabas, the believers were all more or less at the same level
By reading the Bible in this way, we discover that what the Bible does not record is more meaningful than what is recorded
The strength or weakness of a local church does not depend on spiritual giants, but on each small brother or sister
The more ordinary the saints are, the more normal the church will be, and the longer its good spiritual condition will last
A few months ago, when we just began to promote the home meetings, the testimonies we heard were as pleasant as eating ice cream
Every church has its eyes on the church in Taipei, because Taipei was the origination of the overseas churches
Even if you do not know how to cook, you have to go shopping and prepare meals at home that the whole family may eat and be healthy
You may read a Bible verse in a dead way, reading only the black and white letters, or you can read the same verse in a living and rich way
If you have this kind of living, you will be living not only when you come to the home meeting but even when you are at home
At that time, when we read the Bible and came to a difficult word, we would go from reference book to reference book
Thank the Lord in 1974 in the United States because of the rapid increase in number among us the Lord led us to begin the Lifestudy Messages
If you read the Bible in this way, you will find that every sentence in the Life-studies supplies the Bible to you
In every line of the Life-studies the Bible as the ingredient has been cooked just as raw rice is cooked for you to eat
If you would try it, you would find that to read the Bible with the Life-studies does not waste any time at all
The regular home cooking is produced out of your spending half an hour or twenty minutes every day to read the Bible
If the churches all practice this, and every home group practices this, would not the content of the home meetings be rich?
If a brother comes in and says hello to you, you should stand up quickly and shake hands with him and talk with him
Sometimes, it just happens that everyone in a home meeting is a weak one, while in another group there are more strong ones
Ephesians covers the church as the Body of Christ, whereas Colossians deals with Christ as the Head of the Body
The book of Ephesians covers the church as the Body of Christ, whereas Colossians deals with Christ as the Head of the Body'
Because the Peking cooking does not depend on seasonings to enhance the flavor of the food but it brings out the original flavor of the food
In addition, one principle we should keep well is that the older ones should not assume their seniority by speaking without ceasing
One principle which is universally agreed upon is that the progress of human society depends on the second generation
We have coined more than a hundred new terms, such as the essential Spirit, the economical Spirit, the Spirit of power, and many others
We believe that the future of the church and the freshness and livingness of the meetings all depend on the young ones
On the one hand, the Bible says that the church is God's family; on the other hand, it says that the church is God's kingdom
Since we divided into individual halls, we have not emphasized the family; therefore the increase has been very low
Sometimes we would like our home meetings to be like an army, with all the members being orderly and each one being a fighter
In Christianity, as a pastor or preacher goes out to establish churches, the more he does, the more the churches end up on his own shoulders
When he leaves that place, immediately the people who remain become a group of orphans, without a father and without a mother
Among us there are some elders who, when they administrate the church, the more they administrate, the more the church becomes theirs
The New Testament shows us that the church is the church of God, the church of Christ, and the church of the saints
In Matthew 20 the Lord Jesus said that among the nations those who are great exercise authority over them, but 'it is not so among you'
In Matthew 23 the Lord Jesus said that the Pharisees love to take the chief seats, but that we should not be so
As the Lord was giving these teachings, Peter must have witnessed with his own eyes and heard with his own ears
The ones who administrate the church, lead the church, and even those who raise up the churches, are all slaves
When you know that you are the owner of the church, you will certainly do your best to preserve your possession
The big meetings are for the producing of saints, from which the individual saints are to be built up into a family
Acts 14 records that the Apostle Paul went out to Iconium, Lystra, and other places, preaching the gospel in every place
As a result, these sons or daughters actually do not know how to do anything; everyone is like a handicapped person
He did appoint twelve apostles, but He did not appoint a chief apostle, nor did He appoint one to call a meeting
In Acts 6 the church appointed seven brothers to serve tables, yet among these seven we cannot find out who was the leader
Their thought of asking God for a king offended God very much, because that meant that they denied God as their King
Please remember that when you administrate the church you are not administrating for that local church but for Christs universal Body
When we administrate the church, we must have a Body-consciousness and not use our personal judgment to judge anything
According to our way, we want to administrate well the church we are in, but God wants to put South America in good order
When we go to a home meeting we should never have an attitude that when we go to raise up that home meeting, we go to take the lead
We do not have the higher-ups controlling the people below, nor do we have the people below following the higher-ups
The stronger ones will bear more responsibility, while the weaker ones will also take care of their portion of the responsibilities
The basic supply in a meeting comes from God's Word; the basic vitality, motivation, or power in a meeting comes from the Holy Spirit
Whether it be a big meeting or a small meeting, for the meeting to be rich and strong there must be the word of the Lord and the Spirit
The Life-studies can assist us in our Bible study in the same way that a good machine can assist us in accomplishing something
Or perhaps some, after hearing the words of the message, may recall their past experiences and offer some fellowship
Or some, having eaten and having been satisfied, may recall a song with grace in their hearts, and everyone may sing together
The responsibility for keeping the people must rest on the home meeting, that is, on all the brothers and sisters
