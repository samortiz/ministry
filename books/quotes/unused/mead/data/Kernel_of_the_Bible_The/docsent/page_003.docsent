   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE MYSTERY OF GOD S WILL</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In order to know what the kernel of the Bible is, we need to consider Ephesians 1:9.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>This verse says, Having made known unto us the mystery of his will, according to his good pleasure which he hath purposed in himself.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>This verse speaks of the mystery of God s will.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>God s eternal will has a mystery.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>A mystery is something that cannot be understood, for anything that is easy to understand is not mysterious.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>If you were to ask the angels what the mystery of God s will is, they would answer that they do not know.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>They are simply our servants, and they do not know what the will of God is, much less the mystery of God s will.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Since the angels do not know what the mystery of God s will is, we must consult Paul s Epistle to the Ephesians.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>In chapter one of this Epistle Paul indicates that if we would know the mystery of God s will, we need a spirit of revelation Eph 1:17 .</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The mystery of God s will is revealed to our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Therefore, instead of overly exercising your mentality in this matter, you should exercise your spirit to pray and ask the Lord to show you the mystery of God s will.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>We all need to say, O Lord, show me the mystery of Your will.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>For this, I need a spirit of revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Lord, I don t just want to know I want to see.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>I thank You that You have given me a good mind, but my mind is not adequate to know the mystery of Your will.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>O Lord, reveal this matter to me.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>If you pray like this, the Lord will surely answer your prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>THE MYSTERY OF GOD S ECONOMY</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>In Greek, Ephesians 3:9-11 speaks of the mystery of God s economy.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>This word economy is rather troublesome, for its meaning in the Bible is different from its meaning in present usage.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The economy in the Bible is not a matter of finance; it is a matter of God s administration, God s arrangement, and God s dispensation.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>This economy of God also has a mystery.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Furthermore, God s economy is related to His eternal purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Hence, it is important to know three things: the mystery of God s will, the mystery of God s economy, and God s eternal purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>If we know these three matters, then we shall know what the kernel of the Bible is.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The kernel of the Bible is the mystery of God s will, the mystery of God s economy, and the eternal purpose of God.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>CHRIST AND THE CHURCH</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Ephesians 5:32 reveals that the kernel of the Bible is Christ and the church.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>According to this verse, Christ and the church are a great mystery.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>This great mystery is the kernel of the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Taking Christ and the church out of the Bible would be like removing a man s heart from his body.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>However, although Christ and the church are so crucial, this kernel is very hidden.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>CHRIST AS THE IMAGE OF GOD</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>In the first three chapters of Genesis, Jesus Christ is not mentioned by name.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Apparently, there is no reference to Christ in this portion of the Word.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>However, actually Christ is found in these chapters.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The light in Genesis 1 denotes Christ, but this is not the crucial aspect of Christ hidden in this chapter.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>There is something hidden in this chapter referring to Christ, and that is the image of God spoken of in verse 26.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>In this verse God says, Let us make man in our image.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Verse 27 says, So God created man in his own image, in the image of God created he him.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Verse 26 speaks of our image, and verse 27, of his own image.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>In whose image was man created, and who is the image of God?</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Colossians 1:15 says that Christ is the image of the invisible God, and 2 Corinthians 4:4 speaks of Christ, who is the image of God.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Although the word Christ is not found in Genesis 1, we do have the word image.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>If we have the revelation, we can see that the image of God mentioned in Genesis 1:26 is Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Man was made in the image of God, and the fact that the image of God is Christ indicates that man was made according to Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Man was made in the image of Christ just as a glove is made in the image of a hand.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>A glove is made in the image of the hand for the purpose of containing the hand.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>In like manner, man was made according to Christ for the purpose of containing Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Thus, we see a hidden aspect of Christ in Genesis 1:26.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Writing the word Christ above the word image in this chapter will help you realize that man was made in the form of Christ and according to Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>However, this image is merely the outward form; we have not yet come to the matter of inward life.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>CHRIST AS OUR INWARD LIFE</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>The inward life is found in Genesis 2, where we see the word life v. 9 . After God created man, He placed him in a garden.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>In the center of this garden there was the tree of life.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>God s intention in putting man before the tree of life was that man would receive the divine life.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Who is this divine life?</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>The answer is in Colossians 3:4, which says that Christ is our life.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Therefore, Christ is both God s image and our life.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>We were made according to Christ that we might contain Christ, and Christ is destined to be our life.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>If we do not have Christ, we do not have the divine life 1 John 5:11-12 .</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Although we may have the outward form of the image of God, without Christ we do not have the inward life.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Therefore, we need Christ to be our inward life.</S>
