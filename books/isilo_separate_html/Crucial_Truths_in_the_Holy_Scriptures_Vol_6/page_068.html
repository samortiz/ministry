<h2 class="head2">The Hidden Aspect</h2>
<p><strong>1. &ldquo;In the clouds...in the air&rdquo;</strong> (1 Thes. 4:17; see also Psa. 18:9, 11).</p>
<p>The Lord will return to the clouds in the air during the hidden aspect of His coming. Before the Lord descends to the clouds in the air, He will rapture the overcomers to God&rsquo;s throne in the heavens (Rev. 12:5). When the Lord descends from the heavens to the clouds in the air, the overcoming believers will descend with Him.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Open Aspect</h2>
<p><strong>1. &ldquo;His feet will stand in that day on the Mount of Olives, which is before Jerusalem on the east&rdquo;</strong> (Zech. 14:4).</p>
<p>The Lord will return to the earth during the open aspect of His coming. When the Lord returns, His feet will stand on the Mount of Olives, which is before Jerusalem. This is His descent to the surface of the earth. This is different from His descent to the clouds in the air. He will descend to the clouds in the air from the throne in the heavens, and then He will descend to the surface of the earth from the clouds in the air. His descent from the throne in the heavens to the clouds in the air is His <em>parousia.</em> Only the overcomers who have been raptured will participate in it. His descent from the clouds in the air to the surface of the earth is His <em>epiphaneia,</em> the manifestation of His <em>parousia.</em> All believers who are raptured at the end of the great tribulation will participate in it.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE SIGNS OF THE SECOND COMING</h2>
<p><strong>1. &ldquo;What will be the sign of Your coming?&rdquo;</strong> (Matt. 24:3).</p>
<p>There are signs related to the Lord&rsquo;s second coming. When the disciples asked the Lord what the sign of His coming would be, the Lord gave them some signs. These signs remind us to be watchful and ready while we wait for the Lord. When we see these signs, the Lord&rsquo;s second coming will be near, and we should be watchful and ready, waiting for Him to come.</p>
<p><strong>2. &ldquo;Nation will rise up against nation, and kingdom against kingdom; and there will be famines and earthquakes in various places. All these things are the beginning of birth pangs&rdquo;</strong> (Matt. 24:7-8).</p>
<p>These verses speak of three signs related to the Lord&rsquo;s second coming: wars, famines, and earthquakes. Nation (people) fighting against nation denotes civil war, and kingdom fighting against kingdom denotes international war. These two types of fighting will occur frequently in the last days. History also shows that famine follows war. In the last days there will be many wars and severe famines. Over nineteen hundred years ago, when the Lord spoke this word concerning earthquakes, there were very few earthquakes, but now earthquakes occur almost daily. It is common to read about earthquakes in the newspapers today. Geologists tell us that the movement of the earth is increasing. The appearance of these disasters on the earth are signs that the day of the Lord&rsquo;s second coming is drawing near.</p>
<p><strong>3. &ldquo;Difficult times will come. For men will be lovers of self, lovers of money, boasters, arrogant, revilers, disobedient to parents, unthankful, unholy, without natural affection, implacable, slanderers, without self-control, savage, not lovers of good, traitors, reckless, blinded with pride, lovers of pleasure rather than lovers of God, having an outward form of godliness, though denying its power&rdquo;</strong> (2 Tim. 3:1-5).</p>
<p>These verses describe the condition of human society at the end of this age. Each of the things spoken of here can be called a sign of the Lord&rsquo;s second coming. The first condition is that men will be lovers of self and lovers of money. Today it is hard to find anyone who does not love himself or love money. In the last days men will love themselves the most, followed closely by money. Man&rsquo;s &ldquo;lover&rdquo; will be money. There also will be boasting, arrogance, reviling, and the blaspheming of God. People today are more boastful, arrogant, reviling, and blasphemous than they ever were in the past. Being disobedient to parents, unthankful, unholy, without natural affection, and implacable are also special characteristics of society in the last days. Today there are people who teach and without natural promote disobedience to parents and being unthankful, unholy, affection, and implacable. Such ones are nearly the same as beasts. Today there are also many who are slanderers, without self-control, savage, and nonlovers of good, who are traitors, reckless, and blinded with pride. People today do not want to be restricted; they all do things recklessly and arrogantly under the guise of freedom. It is also a particular characteristic of people today to be lovers of pleasure rather than lovers of God. Pleasure is simply entertainment, involving all kinds of amusement. People today are lovers of pleasure. Movie theaters are full for almost every show, and often there are no empty seats at bars and dance halls. Gambling and travel are also frequent pleasures among people today. There are pleasures for those in the upper class and pleasures for those in the lower classes. People love every kind of pleasure, but they do not love God. Furthermore, they have an outward form of godliness but deny its power. These are all signs of the Lord&rsquo;s second coming, and they should remind us that we must watch and be prepared for the Lord to come.</p>
<p><strong>4. &ldquo;You have stored up treasure in the last days&rdquo;</strong> (James 5:3).</p>
<p>In the last days people will love to store up treasure because they will be lovers of money. This is a sign of the Lord&rsquo;s second coming.</p>
<p><strong>5. &ldquo;Even as it happened in the days of Noah, so will it be also in the days of the Son of Man: they were eating, they were drinking, they were marrying, they were being given in marriage...Likewise, even as it happened in the days of Lot: they were eating, they were drinking, they were buying, they were selling, they were planting, they were building&rdquo;</strong> (Luke 17:26-28).</p>
<p>These verses describe the condition of the people in the days of Noah: they were eating, they were drinking, they were marrying, and they were being given in marriage. When speaking of the condition of the people in the days of Lot, the condition of buying, selling, planting, and building are added. According to the Lord, the condition of the people in the day of His return will be the same as it was in the days of Noah and Lot. Eating, drinking, marrying, being given in marriage, buying, selling, planting, and building seemingly are the most important matters in human society today. People strongly promote these matters. Nothing that a person does today can be separated from these things. The emphasis on these matters is a strong sign that the day of the Lord&rsquo;s second coming is near.</p>
<p><strong>6. &ldquo;Some will depart from the faith, giving heed to deceiving spirits and teachings of demons&rdquo;</strong> (1 Tim. 4:1).</p>
<p>Some will depart from the faith and listen to the heretical, evil teachings of demons. This will also be a sign of the Lord&rsquo;s second coming.</p>
<p><strong>7. &ldquo;They will not tolerate the healthy teaching; but according to their own lusts they will heap up to themselves teachers, having itching ears, and they will turn away their ear from the truth and will be turned aside to myths&rdquo;</strong> (2 Tim. 4:3-4).</p>
<p>Another sign of the Lord&rsquo;s coming is that people will not tolerate the healthy teaching but according to their own lusts will heap up to themselves teachers, have itching ears, and turn away their ears from the truth and be turned aside to myths. Believers today truly are in this condition. If we speak the healthy teaching to them, they feel it is dry and boring, and they become restless. They like to hear myths and teachings that are according to their own lusts. This is an abnormal condition and tells us that the day of the Lord&rsquo;s second coming is near.</p>
<p><strong>8. &ldquo;In the last of days mockers will come with mocking, going on according to their own lusts and saying, Where is the promise of His coming?&rdquo;</strong> (2 Pet. 3:3-4; see also 2:1-2).</p>
<p>In the last days some will deny and even mock the promise of the Lord&rsquo;s second coming. This will be a sign of the Lord&rsquo;s second coming.</p>
<p><strong>9. &ldquo;When the Son of Man comes, will He find faith on the earth?&rdquo;</strong> (Luke 18:8).</p>
<p>By the time of His second coming, many of the believers will have little faith. A lack of faith among believers is a sign of the Lord&rsquo;s second coming.</p>
<p><strong>10. &ldquo;This gospel of the kingdom will be preached in the whole inhabited earth for a testimony to all the nations, and then the end will come&rdquo;</strong> (Matt. 24:14).</p>
<p>According to this verse, the gospel of the kingdom will be preached in the whole inhabited earth for a testimony to all the nations, and then the end will come. The preaching of the gospel of the kingdom to the whole inhabited earth is a sign of the Lord&rsquo;s second coming.</p>
<p><strong>11. &ldquo;Learn the parable from the fig tree: As soon as its branch has become tender and puts forth its leaves, you know that the summer is near. So also you, when you see all these things, know that it is near&rdquo;</strong> (Matt. 24:32-33; see also Luke 21:29-31).</p>
<p>The fig tree represents the nation of Israel. In Matthew 21:18-20 the fig tree, the symbol of the nation of Israel, was cursed by the Lord and withered because it did not produce fruit for Him. The Jews lost their nation and were scattered. According to prophecies in the Bible, however, the Jews will recover their nation. The Lord&rsquo;s word concerning the fig tree branch becoming tender and putting forth its leaves refers to this matter. When Israel, like the fig tree, becomes tender and puts forth leaves, the Lord said that His coming would be near. The recovery of the nation of Israel is another sign of the Lord&rsquo;s second coming.</p>
<p>The Jews have recovered their nation and now are a member of the United Nations as the nation of Israel. Many of the Jews who were scattered around the world have returned to their own soil in Palestine. Despite the fact that the old part of the city of Jerusalem and the temple mount are still in Arab hands, they have made their capital in the new part of Jerusalem. [Editor&rsquo;s note: The content in this chapter was prepared in 1949, prior to the Six Days&rsquo; War in 1967, during which time all of Jerusalem and the temple mount were regained by the nation of Israel.] These are signs that the withered fig tree is growing tender in its branches and putting forth new leaves. When we see these things, we should know that the day of the Lord&rsquo;s second coming is near.</p>
<p><strong>12. &ldquo;When they say, Peace and security, then sudden destruction comes upon them&rdquo;</strong> (1 Thes. 5:3).</p>
<p>People in the world desire peace and security, but when they say, &ldquo;Peace and security,&rdquo; that is, when they feel safe and peaceful, sudden destruction will come upon them. Therefore, it is a sign of the Lord&rsquo;s second coming when worldly people speak of peace and security.</p>
<p><strong>13. &ldquo;It will not come unless the apostasy comes first and the man of lawlessness is revealed, the son of perdition&rdquo;; &ldquo;It is the mystery of lawlessness that is now operating&rdquo;</strong> (2 Thes. 2:3, 7).</p>
<p>Before the day of the Lord&rsquo;s second coming, the apostasy will come, and the man of lawlessness, Antichrist, will be revealed. These things are signs of the Lord&rsquo;s second coming. Although Antichrist has not yet been revealed, the mystery of lawlessness is already operating on the earth so the earth is filled with apostasy. This tells us that the day of the Lord&rsquo;s second coming is not far off.</p>
<p><strong>14. &ldquo;When you see the abomination of desolation, which was spoken of through Daniel the prophet, standing in the holy place (let him who reads understand)&rdquo;</strong> (Matt. 24:15).</p>
<p>The prophecy spoken of through Daniel indicates that the abomination of desolation will occur in the &ldquo;middle of the week&rdquo; (9:27), the last half of the final seven years of the church age. In the middle of this week, Antichrist will set up the abomination of desolation in the holy place. According to 2 Thessalonians 2:4, <em>holy place</em> refers to the temple of God. Antichrist will set up an abominable idol of desolation, an image of himself (Rev. 13:14; 14:9, 11), in the temple and make people worship it. This shows that the temple in Jerusalem will be restored. When the great tribulation, the last three and a half years, is about to begin, Antichrist will set up his image in the temple. When this happens, the day of the Lord&rsquo;s second coming will be very close. This is the reason that the Lord said, &ldquo;Let him who reads understand.&rdquo; The abomination of desolation in the temple is a certain sign of the Lord&rsquo;s second coming. We should have no desire to be on earth to see the fulfillment of this prophecy; instead, our hope should be focused on being raptured by the Lord from the earth to His presence before the three and a half years of the great tribulation.</p>
<p><strong>15. &ldquo;There will be signs in the sun and moon and stars, and upon the earth anguish of nations...for the powers of the heavens will be shaken&rdquo;</strong> (Luke 21:25-26).</p>
<p>When the Lord&rsquo;s coming is very near, there will be extraordinary changes to the situation in the heavens and on earth. There will be signs in the sun, moon, and stars, and there will be anguish among the nations on earth. The powers of the heavens will be shaken. These matters will be signs of the Lord&rsquo;s second coming, and they will be some of the last signs.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE BELIEVERS&rsquo; RESPONSE<br />
TO THE LORD&rsquo;S SECOND COMING</h2>
<p><strong>1. &ldquo;Watch therefore...Be ready&rdquo;; &ldquo;Let your loins be girded and your lamps burning...Be like men waiting for their own master&rdquo;</strong> (Matt. 24:42, 44; Luke 12:35-36; see also Matt. 25:10, 13).</p>
<p>We should respond to the Lord&rsquo;s second coming by being watchful and ready, waiting for Him. Our loins should be girded, and our lamps should be burning. We should not be loose but instead testify for the Lord. It is only right to be watchful and ready, waiting for the Lord.</p>
<p><strong>2. &ldquo;The heavens, from which also we eagerly await a Savior&rdquo;</strong> (Phil. 3:20; see also Heb. 9:28; 1 Thes. 1:10).</p>
<p>We should be those on the earth who are waiting for the Lord&rsquo;s coming. We should not be those who are merely saved, but even more, those who are waiting for the Lord to come. Our hope today should not be on any person, matter, or thing upon the earth. Our only hope should be on our coming Lord. If our hope is on something other than the Lord, we will have a problem with Him, and we will be a defeated believer. When our hope is placed on Him, we will be those who are waiting for the Lord&rsquo;s coming. That is how to be a proper, overcoming believer.</p>
<p><strong>3. &ldquo;Those who have loved His appearing&rdquo;</strong> (2 Tim. 4:8).</p>
<p>If we are waiting for the Lord, we must also be those who love His appearing. Our heart should desire the Lord&rsquo;s second coming. We should lovingly think of His appearing. Our heart should not be rooted to the earth; it should ascend above it to be with the Lord. This was the heart of the early apostles. Miss M. E. Barber also lived with such a love for the Lord&rsquo;s appearing. Their hearts were not tied to any person, matter, or thing on this earth. Those who wait for the Lord&rsquo;s coming and love the Lord&rsquo;s appearing will overcome.</p>
<p><strong>4. &ldquo;Everyone who has this hope set on Him purifies himself, even as He is pure&rdquo;</strong> (1 John 3:3; see also 2:28).</p>
<p>If we are waiting for the Lord&rsquo;s coming and love His appearing, we will purify ourselves, even as He is pure. In this way we will be bold when He comes, and we will not be put to shame before Him. No one waiting for the Lord can live a filthy life. No one who loves the Lord&rsquo;s appearing can allow himself to be stained with any impurity or mixture. We must forsake everything that is filthy and remove all mixture if we want to be worthy of waiting for the Lord&rsquo;s coming. We must purify ourselves, even as He is pure, to be worthy of the hope of His appearing, of seeing His holy face, and of being transfigured into His glorious image.</p>
<p><strong>5. &ldquo;Come, Lord Jesus!&rdquo;</strong> (Rev. 22:20).</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come, Lord Jesus!&rdquo; is the last prayer recorded in the Bible. It expresses a believer&rsquo;s ultimate desire before the Lord. This is the attitude that we should have toward Him. This should be the attitude, desire, and prayer of everyone who is waiting for the Lord and who loves His appearing. May our heart desire the Lord&rsquo;s coming, and may our attitude be positive toward His coming. May we pray with a desperately desiring heart and an absolute attitude, &ldquo;Come, Lord Jesus!&rdquo;</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_067.html">Prev</a> | Next </body></html>
