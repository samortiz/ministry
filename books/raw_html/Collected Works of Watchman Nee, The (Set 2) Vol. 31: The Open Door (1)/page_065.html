<h2 class="head2">Wu-Chow,<br />Kwangsi Province</h2><p>Dear Brother Lan in the Lord:</p><p>May grace and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ be to you. Since parting from you at the station, I arrived in Canton by the Lord's grace. Although I experienced many hardships and threats along the way, the grace of God was always sufficient. God protected, watched over, and upheld me more carefully and more completely than a loving mother protects her baby in love. I cannot deny the dangers of the Canton-Hankow Railway, neither can I refrain from praising our God, saying, "Jehovah will keep you from all evil; He will keep your soul. Jehovah will keep your going out and your coming in from now to eternity."</p><p>After the train passed through Ch'ang-sha, it would sometimes back up because there were too many trains on the tracks ahead. We would go forward for a day and backwards for a day. After four days and nights, we barely made it to Li-Dong in the middle of the night, because the #22 Canton-Wu-ch'ang Express traveling north had gone off the track at the entrance of the tunnel between the Ying-Teh and Li-Dong stations (about 64 miles from its point of origination); our train had to stop outside the tunnel. It could not go forward, and the passengers were free to get off the train. For awhile everything was in confusion. People were frightened, and we could not make out our way because it was night. There were no hotels and no place to stay the night. I had brought only two pieces of luggage with me, having shipped the rest of my things. Two people left their luggage with me and walked five miles to the southern end of the Li-Dong tunnel to take a train to Canton. Since I had been entrusted with their luggage, I had to be faithful. At dawn I hurriedly boarded a train back to Lien-Jiang and took the Jung-Yuan electric boat to Canton. I traveled for three days under the covering of His blood and did not meet up with any danger. I must honestly say that it was the Lord's covering. When I arrived in Canton, I had to wait for a few days at Brother Shuan's place because my luggage had not arrived. I also went to Hong Kong to visit the brothers in the Lord in Kowloon. The meeting in Kowloon experienced much blessing from the Lord. Because of this trip south, I was able to hear Brother Nee's message. He spoke on the topic of "The Question of Power and Wisdom" on the Lord's Day. The Scripture reference was 1 Corinthians 1:22-31. The main points of the message were: "The Bible manifests God's wisdom, while the Holy Spirit manifests His power. Many of God's children think that if they beg God to make them this and that way, they will become this and that way. They do not know that such prayer is like climbing a tree to get fish. The more they pray, the farther they will be from what they want. We are justified, not because we are worthy to be justified, but because the Lord Jesus, the righteous One who lives in us, makes us righteous. If someone asks who my righteousness is, I can immediately answer that the Lord Jesus is my righteousness. From this we see that we do not have to ask the Lord to make us righteous in this or that matter. We just need to allow the Lord to reign in us, for He is righteousness itself. The Holy Spirit has the power and can accomplish in us what we are unable to accomplish in ourselves. He can overcome what we are unable to overcome. Therefore, we do not need to beg the Lord to make us this or that. We just need to allow the Lord to do this or that in us." The Holy Spirit worked much on that day. The atmosphere in the meeting was attentive. The word was strong and piercing. Unfortunately, I did not write it all down, so I can only tell you the main points.</p><p>I arrived in Wu-Chow on the sixteenth, but the Salt Ministry was not set up yet. This was really unexpected. The only denominations here are the Christian and Missionary Alliance Church and the Baptist Church. This is only my second day here, but I have been invited to testify at the Christian and Missionary Alliance Church twice already. I spoke on the matter of life. They really desired it. What is the current situation in Hankow? Will you be going elsewhere? Has God given you some direction? Please write an answering note if it is convenient. May the Lord be with you! Greet all the brothers and sisters in the Lord.</p><p>Your little brother in the Lord,<br />Mu Hue-chen<br />January 21</p>
