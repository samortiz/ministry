   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>The Father and the Son</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Even earlier the Lord was talking with His disciples on one occasion and told them He would be going away.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>This news troubled them.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In answer to Thomas' question, Jesus said, "I am the way, and the reality, and the life; no one comes to the Father except through Me" see John 14:1-6 .</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>At this point Philip asked that they be shown the Father; the disciples would be satisfied if the Lord would do this for them.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The Lord replied, in effect, "What do you mean, Show us the Father'?</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>I've been with you for three years or so.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Why do you ask to see the Father?"</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Then He said, "Do you not believe that I am in the Father, and the Father is in Me?</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The words which I speak to you, I do not speak from Myself; but the Father Who abides in Me, He does His works" v. 10 .</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Notice, however, that the Lord does not say that He is the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>When I would read John 14, sometimes I would ask the Lord, "Lord, why didn't You just plainly say, I am the Father'?"</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>His reply to Philip seems so roundabout.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>If He had directly said He was the Father, it would have prevented much theological debating all these centuries!</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>But the Lord is not that simple!</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Nor is the Trinity that simple!</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Suppose some of you say, "Brother Lee, show us Witness Lee.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Then we'll be satisfied."</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>I would reply, "What!</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>I've been speaking to you all this time, and you still want me to show you Witness Lee!</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Don't you know that Brother Lee is in Witness Lee, and Witness Lee is in Brother Lee?</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>When you see the one, you see the other."</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Yet I will not come out and say that Brother Lee is Witness Lee.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>To do so would mean that I could be easily explained!</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The Spirit and the Son</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Later on in this same chapter, the Lord says, "I will ask the Father, and He will give you another Comforter the Spirit of reality" John 14:16-17 .</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Yet in the very next verse He says that He Himself is coming v. 18 . One verse indicates that it is the Spirit who is coming, and the next verse declares that the Lord is coming.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>This confusing way of talking continues with regard to who it is who will be in the disciples.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Verse 17 says that the Spirit of reality "shall be in you," whereas in verse 20 the Lord says, "In that day you shall know that I am in you."</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The Spirit's indwelling the disciples meant the Lord's indwelling of them.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Yet the Lord does not openly say that He is the Spirit or that the Spirit is simply Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>He chooses to talk in this mysterious way, making us wonder whether there are Two in us, the Spirit and Himself, or only One.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>PAUL'S REVELATION OF THE MYSTERY</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Paul, the great apostle who received the revelation concerning this mystery, refers to Christ in the flesh as the last Adam 1 Cor 15:45 .</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Our forefather Adam was the first Adam.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The last Adam, Paul says, became a life-giving Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>In the same book he says, "He that is joined unto the Lord is one spirit" 1 Cor 6:17 .</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>He further tells Timothy, "The Lord Jesus Christ be with thy spirit" 2 Tim 4:22 .</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>From these verses it is clear that the Lord must be the Spirit and also that we must have a spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Otherwise, how could we be one spirit with Him, and how could He be with our spirit?</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>"Christ in you" Col 1:27 is another word of Paul's. Is he speaking figuratively? How could we possibly contain Christ? However mysterious it sounds, it is a fact that Christ is in us; we can testify to this mysterious reality.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>He is like the electricity that makes the lamps give light; we cannot explain how it works, but we experience its benefits.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>In Galatians 2:20 Paul goes a step further.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>"I have been crucified with Christ, and it is no longer I who live, but Christ lives in me."</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Christ is not only within us; He is living in us.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Paul is describing his experience.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Can we also testify that Christ lives in us?</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Does having Christ live in us seem like a strange way of talking, or is this our reality?</S>
