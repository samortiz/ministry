   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Nourishing and Cherishing the Church</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Ephesians 5:29 says, No one ever hated his own flesh, but nourishes and cherishes it, even as Christ also the church.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>To nourish is to feed us with the living word of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>To cherish is to warm us up.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Just as a mother tenderly embraces her baby to warm him and feed him, Christ cherishes us by warming us and nourishes us by feeding us.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>1 Nourishing the Church</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>To be nourished by Christ is to be supplied with His riches.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>If we take Christ as our person, we will experience Christ nourishing us.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>We will continually have the sense of His inward nourishment.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>We need to experience the nourishment that comes from taking Christ as our person.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Nourishment brings about transformation.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>We become what we eat.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>This means that if we eat Christ, we will eventually be constituted with Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>We will be transformed by the element of Christ that has been dispensed into us.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The more we take Christ as our person, the more He nourishes us.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Through Christ s nourishment we are transformed.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>This means that we become a new person with a new element and substance.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>We should praise the Lord that He nourishes us with Himself, with the riches of all He is.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Today the need of the Lord s people is to take Christ as their person for nourishment.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>We need to come in touch with the living Christ, to open to Him, and to take Him as our life and person.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>We should pray, Lord, by Your mercy I want to learn to take You as my person and allow You to make Your home in my heart.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>When we are nourished, something enters into our being to meet our need.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Nourishment, therefore, must come from a supply.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Without a supply, it is impossible to have nourishment.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Christ nourishes the church with all the riches of the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Christ is the embodiment of the fullness of the Godhead.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Hence, all the riches of God are in Him, and He enjoys these riches.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Then He nourishes the church with the very riches of the Godhead that He Himself has enjoyed.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>This is proved by John 15, where the Lord Jesus says that He is the vine and that the Father is the husbandman.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The Father is the Cultivator, the Planter, the Farmer, of the vine.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>We, the believers in Christ, are the branches of the vine.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The vine nourishes the branches with what the vine absorbs from the soil.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>God the Father is the soil, the water, and everything to Christ as the vine.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The vine absorbs the riches from the soil and the water, digests them, and then transmits them to the branches.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>This is the nourishing.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Christ nourishes the church with the riches of the Father, which He has absorbed and assimilated.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>By nourishing the church, Christ meets the inward need of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>It is correct to say that Christ nourishes the church with His life and with His word.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>His life and His word are the substance of the nourishment, but neither His life nor His word is the source.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The source is the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>What Christ receives of the Father becomes the life and the life supply which are embodied in the Word.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>For this reason, the Word is the word of life, even the bread of life or the supply of life.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>If we would be nourished by Christ today, we need to abide in Him to absorb His content into our being as life and the life supply.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>In order to experience this in a practical way, we daily need to contact the living Word, for the Word is the embodiment of life and of the life supply.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The more we abide in the Lord and contact the Word, the more we experience His nourishing.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>This is the way Christ nourishes the church.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>All the members of the church need to practice abiding in the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>There should be no insulation, no separation, between us and the Lord and no detachment from Him.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>As soon as we are detached from Him, the supply of nourishment is cut off.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Along with abiding in the Lord constantly, we must daily come to the Word and take it in as our life and life supply.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Then we will receive nourishment.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Furthermore, all the meetings of the church should be meetings of nourishment.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Morning revival and our fellowship with the saints should also be times of nourishment.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>As we are nourished by the life and the life supply, we grow and we are purified.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>As we abide in the Lord to receive the riches of the Father and as we contact the Word to receive the life and the life supply, we are nourished by Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>In this way Christ nourishes the church He loves.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>2 Cherishing the Church</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Along with the nourishing we have the cherishing.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>To be cherished is to be softened by being warmed.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>When we are hard and cold, we need Christ to cherish us, that is, to warm our hearts.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>After some experiences of His warming, we are softened.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Just as a mother cherishes a child by holding the child to her breast, so the Lord cherishes us by holding us close to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>How tender, sweet, and warm the Lord Jesus is!</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>By resting on Him, we who once were hard and cold become soft and warm.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>The Lord warms us and softens us as we enjoy His tenderness, sweetness, and lovingness.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>When the Lord sanctifies, cleanses, and nourishes us, He cherishes us with His tender warmth.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>His cherishing comforts us, soothes us, and calms us.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>According to the New Testament, Christ s care of the church has two aspects.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>The inner aspect is the nourishing, and the outer aspect is the cherishing.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>To be nourished is to have something imparted into us inwardly, whereas to be cherished is to be warmed and comforted outwardly.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Cherishing is related to environment.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>In our environment or circumstances the Lord Jesus is often real to us as a warm, tender breeze blowing upon us.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>As this warm breeze comes upon us, we have the sense of being tenderly soothed.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>Although this takes place in the environment, it is something more than the environment itself.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>It is even something that surpasses the Lord s presence.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>When the Lord s presence becomes a gentle breeze, we experience His cherishing.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>This cherishing includes soothing, comfort, and rest.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>In the environment of the church life, we often experience the Lord s cherishing, although we may not even be conscious of it.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>However, if for any length of time we are in an environment where there is no church, we sense that the climate has changed and that the environment is different.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>Then we begin to sense that we have lost something, that the tender, warm breeze is no longer blowing upon us.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>We may have everything necessary for our material existence, but we know that something we formerly enjoyed is missing.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>When we return to the church life, we immediately and spontaneously enter into the environment and atmosphere of the Lord s cherishing.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>Once again we are warmed, soothed, and comforted.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>This is cherishing.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>Just as a child is cherished by the presence of his mother, so we are cherished by the Lord s presence, which produces an atmosphere of tenderness and warmth to cherish our being.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>We experience such an atmosphere in the church meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>How pleasant is the spiritual climate in the gathering of the saints!</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>As soon as we enter this atmosphere, we are cherished by the Lord s presence.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>It is by the atmosphere produced by the Lord s brooding presence that the Lord cherishes the church.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>To be in this climate, this atmosphere, this environment, gives us rest, comfort, healing, cleansing, and encouragement.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>No atmosphere can compare to the atmosphere of the church meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>Nourishing and cherishing go together.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>Through the nourishing we enjoy the supply of life inwardly, and through the cherishing we experience the soothing, comforting atmosphere outwardly.</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>Whenever we are in an atmosphere of cherishing, we can absorb the word of the ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>This indicates that under the cherishing we receive nourishing.</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>A church that is nourished and cherished in such a way will be strong and healthy.</S>
   <S PAR='98' RSNT='1' SNO='98'>The nourishing and the cherishing are the church s portion, and they should be found in every meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='99' RSNT='1' SNO='99'>If we are proper, normal, and healthy, we will enjoy the cherishing atmosphere of the Lord s presence in the church, and in this atmosphere receive the nourishing supply of life.</S>
   <S PAR='100' RSNT='1' SNO='100'>We should praise the Lord for the way He cares for the church.</S>
   <S PAR='101' RSNT='1' SNO='101'>In the proper church life we have the privilege of enjoying the Lord in such a fine, tender, intimate, and real way.</S>
