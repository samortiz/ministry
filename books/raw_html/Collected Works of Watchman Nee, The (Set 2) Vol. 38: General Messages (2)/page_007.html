<h2 class="head2">3. The Direction of the Work&mdash;<br />from the Center to the Circumference</h2><p>God's work always begins from the center and goes to the circumference. God reveals Himself within man's center, his spirit, then extends to his soul, enlightening his mind, and finally directs his body to execute His will. Take the matter of sanctification as an example. The God we know in our spirit is absolutely holy. This holy God is joined to our spirit through the Holy Spirit (we become one spirit with the Lord). From this spirit God enlightens our mind, so that our mind begins to understand. The power of holiness thus begins to operate in our mind. All unholy thoughts are rejected, and anything that is incompatible with God is immediately denied. In this way, the soul becomes sanctified. At the same time, the effect reaches the body, particularly the eyes. The inward sanctifying power will direct the eyes, so that they can no longer look at anything that is contrary to holiness. The eyes will shun everything unholy. When the Holy Spirit speaks through the ones who know holiness in such a genuine way, their words will convey the sanctification that they have seen and experienced, and they will produce an effect in others.</p><h2 class="head2">4. The Method of the Work&mdash;Revelation</h2><p>Revelation is the method by which God works. Revelation is something of the spirit. Hence, the spirit and not the mind comes first. The spirit and life take priority, while the mind and the intellect follow. Many people use their mind and intellect to seek after God's will. The result is confusion in the mind. They will never know God's will this way because the method is wrong. The first thing God wants us to do is to wait for His revelation in our spirit. After this, He will enlighten our mind. Only then will we know God's will. We must remember that the mind is secondary and not primary in spiritual matters. This does not mean that we should not use the mind, but we should use it as a secondary means.</p><p>We need to consider a few things that constitute a spiritual vision. God's Word shows us that at least three things are needed. The first is revelation. The meaning of revelation is an unveiling or a removing of the covering. Suppose that there is a book in a cabinet, yet it cannot be seen because the door of the cabinet is closed. The door must be opened before the book can be revealed. The second thing is light. If this room does not have any light, one cannot see anything even when something is placed before his eyes. The third is opened eyes. A thing may be uncovered and light may be present, but one cannot see anything if his eyes are closed. The Holy Spirit unveils the reality of Christ to man through revelation. At the same time, He enlightens the mind in man's soul. The mind is man's inner eyes. As long as a man does not have the eyes of the Laodiceans, he will see. The Laodiceans did not see because they felt that they had something; they thought that they had something. Once there is a thought of having something, that thought becomes a veil to the eyes, and a person becomes blind. Blessed are those who are poor in spirit.</p><h2 class="head2">5. The Lines of the Work</h2><p>There are two lines in God's work. On the negative line, God's work leads man to a knowledge of himself through revelation. Once man sees himself, he will apply the cross to deal with sin, the flesh, and the world by the power of the Spirit. On the positive line, the Holy Spirit reveals Christ to man's spirit and dispenses Christ to man. Man receives Christ by faith and abides in Him, allowing His life to be wrought into his being. The measure of revelation and knowledge of Christ determines the measure of the stature of one's spiritual life. The destination of these two lines of work is the purifying of the "self" to the point that nothing of the "self" remains and only Christ occupies the whole being.</p><h2 class="head2">6. The Pattern and Goal of the Work</h2><p>When Moses built the tabernacle, God showed him the pattern on the mount. He could not change anything; everything had to be built according to the pattern of God's instruction. Today the building work of the Holy Spirit in us is according to the pattern of Christ. Nothing apart from Christ can be brought in. The work of the Holy Spirit is absolutely pure, and His work is to make men as pure as the Lord (1 John 3:3).</p>
