   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>TO BECOME THE CONDENSED, CONSUMMATED,</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>LIFE-GIVING, ALL-INCLUSIVE SPIRIT</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Being a Christian is not a matter of adjusting ourselves or improving ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Such things are something of religion and have nothing to do with God's dynamic salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>God's dynamic salvation is just the Triune God Himself passing through the processes to become the condensed, consummated, life-giving, all-inclusive Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>As such a One He can be contacted through our prayer from our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>When we pray even a little from our spirit, we contact this all-inclusive Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>He is real, genuine, living, fresh, and moving.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>He is God the Father, God the Son, and God the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>He is the Redeemer and the Savior.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>He is life and everything to us.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>He is even us.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>He has become us in order to make us Him.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>This is God's dynamic salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>God's intention from eternity to eternity is to make Himself us, that we might become Him in life, in nature, and in constitution but not in the Godhead .</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>This is actually the prophecy in 2 Samuel 7 concerning the seed of David who is called the Son of God.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>He is divine as well as human; He is human as well as divine.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>He, the firstborn Son of God, is our elder Brother, and we, His many brothers, are the many sons of God.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>In God's dynamic salvation there is no need for us to adjust ourselves or improve ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>What we need is for this One to be wrought into us through the metabolic process of transformation.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Through this process He will move in us and gradually transform us into His image 2 Cor 3:18 until we are fully the same as He in life, in nature, and in constitution.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>This is God's salvation, and this is the revelation in the Bible.</S>
