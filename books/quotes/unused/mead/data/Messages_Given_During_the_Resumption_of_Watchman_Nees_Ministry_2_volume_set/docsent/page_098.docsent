   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Place:Hardoon Road, Shanghai</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Speaker:Watchman Nee</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>THE TYPES IN THE OLD TESTAMENT The Tabernacle and the Temple</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Typifying Two Aspects of the Church</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Concerning the question of the desolation of the church, we must first consider the way of the church on earth.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The way of the church on earth can be seen from the history of the tabernacle in the Old Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The tabernacle in the Old Testament was set up by God.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The purpose of the tabernacle was for God to dwell with His people Israel Exo 25:8 .</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>There are many basic differences between the temple and the tabernacle.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>At the beginning, God dwelt in the tabernacle.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>After the temple was finished, God began to dwell in the temple 1 Kings 9:3 .</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Both the tabernacle and the temple typify God's dwelling among men.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The two appear to be a repetition in type.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Actually, they are not repetitions.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>In the past, many people have written books concerning the tabernacle as a type.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>But few books have been written concerning the temple as a type.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Actually, both things are types of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Yet there are some basic differences between the two things.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The Tabernacle Being in the Wilderness,</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Being Temporary and Movable,</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Whereas the Temple Being in the Holy Land, Being Eternal and Stable</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The tabernacle was built in the wilderness under the direction of Moses and Aaron.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The temple was prepared by David and completed by Solomon in Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The tabernacle does not have a floor.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>It has a cover and curtains.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>When a person enters the tabernacle, what his feet touch is the sand on the ground.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>This reminds him that the tabernacle is something transitory and movable.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>This is why it is called the tabernacle, or "the tent of meeting."</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The temple has many similarities to the tabernacle.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>In the tabernacle, there are the gold, the silver, the brass, and the iron.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>In the temple, there are the wood and the stones.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The stones are a crucial material.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>In the New Testament, the Lord called Peter, Cephas John 1:42 .</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The word Cephas means a stone.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>In the tabernacle there was no stone.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Stones are immovable; they signify stability and solidarity.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The tabernacle was designed for the wilderness; it was transitory in nature.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The temple was designed for the kingdom; it was eternal in nature.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>David represents the Lord, and Solomon represents the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The meaning of Solomon is the One who brings in peace.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>God sent the Holy Spirit of peace to build up the temple.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>David is a type of the incarnated Christ, and Solomon is a type of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The Tabernacle Typifying God's Church on Earth,</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Whereas the Temple Typifying the Church</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>as Christ's Unique Body</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>In the Bible, there are always two aspects to God's habitation.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>On the one hand, it is transitory and wandering, and it is typified by the tabernacle.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>The tabernacle moved as the people traveled along.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Sometimes it was in Elim.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>At other times, it was in Kadesh-Barnea.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Sometimes it was in the land of supply.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>At other times, it was in the land of the bitter water.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>However, the tabernacle itself did not change with the change of location.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Wherever the Israelites pitched their tents, there was the tabernacle.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Hence, the tabernacle typifies God's church on earth, or His church in the localities.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>In Shanghai there is the church, because in Shanghai there are God's people.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Whenever God's people come together, there is the church.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>When they are separated, there is no church.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>This is the aspect of the church as typified by the tabernacle.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>The temple is different from the tabernacle.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>The temple was established on the threshing floor of Ornan 2 Chron 3:1 and was built with stones.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>It was built for the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>It was the center of the life of the people of Israel.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>The temple is unique, eternal, and solid, and it cannot be divided.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Even when the nation was divided politically, the temple could not be divided.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>There can be only one temple.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>From this, we see that, on the one hand, the church appears in different localities.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Yet the spiritual reality of the church is still one Body.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>It is unique and eternal.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>These are the two pictures of the church.</S>
