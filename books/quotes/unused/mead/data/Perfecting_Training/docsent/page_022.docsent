   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Second, you have to ask yourself who is there or what is there all the time that you don t live Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Since you cannot say to me to live is Christ, you must say to me to live is my peculiarity.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>If you are not living Christ, you must be living your peculiarity.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>This is the case unless you are living sin or worldliness or the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>These things are easy to denominate and to designate.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>But if you are living something that you cannot designate, that you cannot name, you have to realize that is peculiarity.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Peculiarity is always much better than sin or worldliness or the self or the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>All these things are easy to designate.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>But if you are living something that you cannot designate, no doubt that is peculiarity.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Peculiarity is neither sin nor worldliness nor flesh nor lust nor Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>You live something daily.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>To you to live is something daily.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>If it is not sin or worldliness or the flesh or Christ, surely it is peculiarity.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Because you have never seen it, you have never condemned it.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Yet what you are now proves there is such a thing.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Now you do live something not sin, not worldliness, not lust, not flesh, not disposition but not Christ either.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Because it is not apparently something bad you have never condemned it.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>This is your peculiarity.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>PECULIARITY VERSUS ONENESS</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Third, we need to see why we have opinions and why we are not absolutely one with others.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The opinion, the dissension, the lack of absolute oneness with others comes from peculiarity.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>If you have been enlightened, and if your peculiarity has really been dealt with, you will be a person with a sober mind, a strong will, a pure love, and a very rich spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>You would go along with anyone and have no opinion.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>You would realize what is real oneness and you would have no more dissension.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>You would go along with others in anything as long as it is not sinful.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Why do we have the opinions?</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Whenever a husband and wife sit down at the dining table, opinion comes.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>This is because you have your peculiarity, and your spouse has her peculiarity.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>From this peculiarity comes the opinion.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>We don t live Christ that much because we have this antichrist peculiarity.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Christian brothers cannot be one because there is some antichrist within.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Peculiarity is an enemy to Christ and also an enemy to the Body life.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>You cannot live Christ as long as you have your peculiarity, and you cannot have the proper Body life as long as you have your peculiarity.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Bring this matter to the Lord and spend some time to pray about it.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>If you will do this, I believe you will see more.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Many have been among us for at least ten years.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>But you have been stopped and stuck at this one point by the hidden antichrist of peculiarity within you.</S>
