<h1 class="title">DENYING THE SELF<br />
FOR THE BUILDING OF THE CHURCH</h1>
<p>In Matthew 16:18 the Lord Jesus speaks of the gates of Hades, which signify the power of darkness. In the Bible Hades is the place of death, where people are held in the power of death. Hence, it is a region where death prevails. After the Lord Jesus died, He took a tour of Hades. Acts 2:24 indicates that Hades tried its best to hold Him. However, because Christ is the resurrection, He could not be held by death. Death cannot overcome resurrection; on the contrary, resurrection always subdues death.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE GATES AND THE KEYS</h2>
<p>The gates are mentioned in verse 18 and the keys in verse 19. The enemy has the gates, but we have the keys. The gates do not overcome the keys, but the keys control the gates. The enemy&rsquo;s gates are much bigger than the keys, but the gates are nonetheless under the control of the keys, just as the doors of a building are controlled by the keys that open and close them. Hallelujah, we have the keys! Satan has many gates, but we have the keys.</p>
<p>Now we need to consider what the keys of the kingdom are. Shortly after I was saved, I was taught by a great Bible teacher that the keys of the kingdom given to Peter were two in number. Peter used the first key to open the gate for the Jewish believers to enter the kingdom of the heavens on the day of Pentecost (Acts 2:38-42); and he used the other to open the gate for the Gentile believers to enter the kingdom of the heavens in the house of Cornelius (Acts 10:34-48). I still believe that this teaching is correct. But, as we shall see, there is more to this matter of the keys than this.</p>
<p>In order to interpret the Bible, we must follow the basic principle of taking care of the context of every verse. In Matthew 16, Christ, the Son of the living God, the church, the kingdom, the gates of Hades, and the keys of the kingdom are all revealed. Verse 21 reveals what must take place for Peter to be transformed from a Simon to a Peter. For this, the Lord Jesus had to be crucified and resurrected. It was through the crucifixion and resurrection of Christ that Simon, the son of Jonah, became Peter, a son of God. Without this transaction, it would have been impossible for Simon Bar-jona to become Peter.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE LORD AS THE PATTERN AND THE PATHWAY</h2>
<p>Verse 22 says, &ldquo;And Peter, taking Him to him, began to rebuke Him, saying, God be merciful to You, Lord; this shall by no means happen to You!&rdquo; With a good heart, Peter was telling the Lord that God should be merciful to Him. This verse is difficult to translate. Some say it should be rendered, &ldquo;Lord, pity Yourself.&rdquo; According to this rendering, Peter was telling the Lord to be merciful to Himself. Another translation is, &ldquo;God be merciful to You, Lord.&rdquo; It is difficult to determine the subject, whether it is God or the Lord Jesus. At any rate, the emphasis is on the self. Whether the subject is God or the Lord Jesus, the self is emphasized.</p>
<p>Verse 23 says, &ldquo;But He turned and said to Peter, Get behind Me, Satan!&rdquo; Then in verses 24 and 25 the Lord said to His disciples, &ldquo;If anyone desires to come after Me, let him deny himself, and take up his cross, and follow Me. For whoever desires to save his soul-life shall lose it; but whoever loses his soul-life for My sake shall find it.&rdquo; According to these verses, the Lord is the pattern and the pathway. If anyone desires to come after Him, that is, take Him as the pattern and the pathway, he must deny himself, take up his cross, and follow Him.</p>
<h2 class="head1">SATAN COMING OUT THROUGH THE GATES</h2>
<p>Verses 21 through 26 are necessary for the interpretation of verses 16 through 19. As we have seen, verse 18 speaks of the gates and verse 19 of the keys. In order to know what the gates and the keys are, we need to consider verses 21 through 26. Satan comes out through the gates. The first gate is the self. This means that we ourselves are one of the gates of Hades through which Satan comes out. Satan may come out through the gate of self even when we have a good heart. Whether our heart is good or evil, self is the first gate through which Satan comes out. In addition to the self, verses 21 through 26 also speak of the mind and the soul, both of which are also gates through which Satan comes out. Thus, the self, the soul, and the mind are the main gates through which Satan comes forth. Many times Satan has come out through your mind because your mind has been an open gate for him.</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_006.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_008.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>The Exercise of the Kingdom for the Building of the Church &nbsp; pg 7</div><br></body></html>
