   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>The transforming Spirit makes us right-side up.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Before we were saved, we were in an upside-down situation.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>We were collapsed in death and darkness.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>But the Spirit in His seeking sanctification brought us back to God.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>We believed into Christ, and the Spirit continued to sanctify us by regenerating us.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Then this Spirit, who is Christ Himself, continues His sanctifying work to transform us every day, making us right-side up.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>A brother may talk to his wife apart from the Spirit in an upside-down way.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>But gradually the Lord transforms this brother to make him realize that his way is not the Lord's way.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The Lord's way is not in our flesh or in our American way of thinking.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>His way is in our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Eventually, the Lord will work in this brother again and again to turn him to his spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>There the Holy Spirit meets him to shine over him, enlighten him, and speak to him in a personal way.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The Spirit may say, "From now on don't talk to your wife without My speaking."</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>This will make this brother right-side up.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Bit by bit the transforming Spirit is making us upright.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>We are not merely corrected or adjusted outwardly but transformed inwardly.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The very Christ who is living in us, working in us, and making His home in us is transforming us day by day.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>When a person moves into a new house, he makes many adjustments.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Christ is making His home in us and making many adjustments within us.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>In our marriage life, we are upside down much of the time.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The wife's attitude toward her husband may not be proper.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>It is upside down.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>But every day the indwelling Christ is fixing His dwelling place.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>He is transforming us, making us right-side up.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>This transformation makes us a treasure.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>God is making us His treasure by transforming us.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>As we are being transformed, we are being made right-side up, that is, we are being headed up under Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>It is a beauty to see this.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>In the Lord's recovery, we should be Jesus lovers who have been headed up under Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>When we are headed up, there is no turmoil, no fighting, no debating, no confusion, and no collapse.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Instead, everything is in a good order.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>We Jesus lovers should take the lead to be headed up in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Then eventually Christ will have all things in heaven and on earth headed up under Him.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>God has given Him to be the Head over all things, but all things today would not be headed up.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>But we, His lovers, should take the lead to be headed up in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Today's whole universe is in an upside-down situation.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The whole universe needs to be made right-side up, to be headed up.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>We are the Jesus lovers, who are willing in Christ's redemption to be transformed by the sanctifying Spirit to be made right-side up.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>This is why the Lord needs a recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Among us there should be no struggling, no fighting, and no debates.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>There should just be fellowship and submission.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>This is all due to the dispensing of the Son.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The Son's dispensing in His redemption and His transformation through the sanctifying Spirit issues in the heritage prepared as a treasure to God.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The Father's dispensing results in a group of sons.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The Son's dispensing results in all of us being made a treasure.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Now God not only has a group of sons, but also has all the sons becoming His treasure, His heritage.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Many of us came to this conference from a long distance because we want to be right-side up.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>What is the Lord doing today in His dispensing?</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>He is making us right-side up by transforming us in our soul.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>This transformation includes our being renewed and conformed to the image of Christ, resulting in a heritage produced for God.</S>
