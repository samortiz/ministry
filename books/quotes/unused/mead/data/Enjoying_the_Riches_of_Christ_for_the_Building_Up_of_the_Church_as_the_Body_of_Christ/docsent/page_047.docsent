   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE PROBLEM OF HUMAN-MANUFACTURED SPEAKING IN TONGUES</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>I wish to impress you that in the New Testament, teachings and gifts are childish.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>We cannot say that teachings and gifts are wrong if they are genuine, but some teachings and gifts are not genuine.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Tongues in the New Testament means a dialect.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>How can any strange sound made with the tongue be a dialect?</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Some may say that this strange speaking is the dialect of angels, but how can angels speak in such a way?</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Those who say this are deceiving themselves.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>These are not the genuine tongues; these are the human-manufactured tongues.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Some exhort others to turn their tongue, exercise their jaw, and utter anything but English.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>On the day of Pentecost, no one asked Peter to turn his tongue, exercise his jaw, and utter anything but his own language.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Tongues-speaking is something miraculous, something supernatural.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>As a supernatural thing, there is no need for anyone to teach others how to do it.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Many times I told those who practice this that the case of Balaam and his donkey in the Old Testament is a case of the genuine speaking in tongues Num 22:28-30 .</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>It was miraculous and supernatural.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>All of a sudden a donkey spoke a human language.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Balaam did not tell his donkey to turn his tongue and exercise his jaw.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>People in the tongues-speaking movement first give a lecture to people and some testimonies to inspire them.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Then they ask, "Are you interested in speaking in tongues?</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Come into this room with us."</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Five or ten people may come into the room with you, and one will exhort you to say, "Praise Jesus!</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Praise Jesus!", the faster the better.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>They may then lay hands on your head and tell you to turn your tongue, exercise your jaw, and speak anything but your mother tongue.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>In San Diego in 1963, I and a few others stayed in the same home as guests.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The host was clear that I was strongly against the false speaking in tongues.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>After one night's meeting when I had gone to bed, he and his wife tried to help one of the Chinese-speaking brothers to speak in tongues.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The host laid hands on him and told him to speak anything except Chinese and English.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Because this went on for a long time, a second brother, speaking in Chinese, told the first brother to speak anything, even nonsense.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Because the first brother's wife was a Chinese woman born in Indonesia, he had learned something of the Indonesian language, so he spoke some nonsense in that language.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The host and his wife were excited and began to applaud.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The next morning the brothers told me the whole story.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>I recounted it to the host and asked him, "Brother, is Christ not good enough for us to preach?</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Why did you have to do this?"</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>In the so-called Charismatic movement there are many stories like this.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>I was there and I saw this.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>This is why I am so strong in this matter.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>I am not against anything that is genuine.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>I believe that today the genuine tongues-speaking is still on the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>God is living, and He is still miraculous and supernatural.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>However, I cannot believe in the false, human-manufactured tongues.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>EVEN GENUINE GIFTS BEING CHILDISH</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Even the genuine tongues are still something childish.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>First Corinthians 13:8 and 11 say, "Love never falls away.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>But whether prophecies, they will be rendered useless; or tongues, they will cease; or knowledge, it will be rendered useless.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>When I was a child, I spoke as a child, I thought as a child, I reasoned as a child; since I have become a man, I have done away with childish things."</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>If we read the context of these verses, we must admit that the childish things are the gifts.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Even the genuine gifts, the real gifts, are childish things.</S>
