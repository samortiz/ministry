   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE OPENING WORDS BEING THE MOST CRUCIAL IN GOSPEL PREACHING</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>We all have to pick up an attitude, spirit, and atmosphere of learning.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Suppose you come to my home, and I welcome you and invite you to come in and be seated.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Now, how would you start the conversation?</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>To me, this is the most difficult point.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The first few sentences are the most crucial.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>To know how to begin, you have to pray, "Lord, what would I say?"</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>You cannot simply go to all the people that you visit and tell them that you would like to speak with them about the mystery of human life.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>This is too common.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Sometimes you have to begin in a very gentle, normal way.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Your speaking should give the impression that you are a normal person.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>This kind of impression will always be welcomed by people and will also invite people's openness to you.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>They will be happy to talk to you.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>You may speak in this way: "I am a Christian.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>May I ask you, sir, are you a Christian?"</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>This kind of opening is very broad and allows room to pursue almost any direction with him.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>When you open with, "Here is a book on the mystery of human life," you have really limited yourself.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>From that point forward you will have to talk about the mystery of human life.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>After speaking for just a short time, you may find out that this person is not suited to such a subject, but it will be hard for you to change directions at that point.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>You will be limited.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>You may open in a general way by saying, "I am a Christian.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Are you a Christian brother?"</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Then you can deal with the person in many directions.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>BUILDING UP A GOSPEL PREACHING CUSTOM</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>I have definitely found out that the most difficult thing for Christians to carry out is the gospel preaching.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>If you are going to be successful in this matter, you must realize that this is the most difficult point.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>It is not so easy to be successful in gospel preaching.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>I do not expect that you would be a big success.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>I only expect that you would go out regularly, preferably once a week.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Do not go too often.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Do it regularly, continually, and persistently.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>If you do this your whole life, once a week, I am fully confident that you will gain two remaining fruit yearly.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>To do this you have to be willing to learn.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Do not regard it lightly.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Do not hold to a kind of understanding that everyone can preach the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>None of us can preach the gospel in a prevailing way unless we are trained.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>We have to be discipled in order to preach the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>If we will be discipled, we will surely gain fruit.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>We should feel shameful that we have been barren for so many years.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>We have been barren because we have not had the spirit to learn to be trained, to be discipled.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>My burden is to stir up your heart and your spirit so that you can see that this is a big problem.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>After the Lord comes back, it will be hard for us to face Him if we have not borne any fruit.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>I hope you would be stirred up to pick up the burden for this in a normal way.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>When people reach their twenties, it is normal for them to get married.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Later, they will have children and rear them.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>This is the way ordained by God for man's multiplication.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>In this way of propagation, the whole earth is replenished by man.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The divine life is propagated in the same principle.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>We should not expect a big revival.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>History has already proven that such revivals do not work.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>What is needed is a practical preaching of the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>All of us who love the Lord's interest need to learn how to practice such preaching.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Then we can bear a year-round burden of preaching the gospel, going out once a week.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>If we will get ourselves prepared, we will be successful.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>But for us to go to do this, much learning is needed.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>I hope this learning can be established in the Lord's recovery and that such a gospel custom can gradually be built up.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>This is similar to the way a language is picked up by a race of people.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Eventually, a foundation with a certain custom becomes established.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Those who are born in an American family speak American English spontaneously because the speaking of American English has been laid as a foundation and as a custom in American society.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>When the immigrants first came to this country, it was very hard for them to learn English.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>But after two centuries of their living in America, American English has penetrated nearly every family.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>I expect that a foundation and a custom of preaching the gospel will be built up in the Lord's recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>When such a custom has been built up, it will be easy for all the brothers and sisters in the Lord's recovery to bear fruit.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>If we are to see a gospel-preaching custom built up among us, we must rise up and take this word and practice it week by week, trying our best to learn in every aspect.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>This will require our building up ourselves with the knowledge of the Bible and with the practical, proper speaking.</S>
