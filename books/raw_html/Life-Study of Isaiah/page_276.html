<H2 CLASS=HEAD2>F. Through His Life-releasing Death<br>and with His Life-imparting Resurrection<br>Producing a Corporate Seed as the Issue<br>of the Travail of His Soul, Whom He Saw<br>in His Resurrection and Was Satisfied</H2><P>Through His life-releasing death and with His life-imparting resurrection, Christ produced a corporate seed as the issue of the travail of His soul, whom He saw in His resurrection and was satisfied (Isa. 53:10c-11b). Isaiah 53:10b says, "When He makes Himself an offering for sin, He will see a seed." As we mentioned previously, Christ's making Himself an offering for sin is related to His crucifixion. It is the "cause," and the "effect" is His seeing a seed in His resurrection. Here seed is singular, indicating that the seed is a corporate seed. This corporate seed implies all the many grains, all the members of Christ's Body, all Christ's brothers, and all the sons of God. The great "delivery" of Christ's resurrection still has not ceased. This delivery is continuing; it has produced millions of saints, and it is still producing. We, the gospel preachers, are the midwives. When we go out to contact sinners, we help to speed up the delivery.</P><P>All those brought forth through the gospel are the components of this corporate seed. This was accomplished through Christ's life-increasing and life-releasing death with His life-imparting resurrection, which produced a corporate seed as the issue of the travail of His soul, whom He saw in His resurrection and was satisfied. I believe that, even today, when the Lord Jesus looks at us, He is satisfied. We are a part of the seed; we are a part of the issue, the outcome, of His travail.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>1. To Be His Continuation<br>for the Extension of His Days</H2><P>This seed is Christ's continuation for the extension of His days (Rev. 1:18a). Because Christ continues to live by living in us, we are the extension of His days.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>2. For the Pleasure of Jehovah,<br>Which Will Prosper in His Hand</H2><P>This is for the pleasure of Jehovah (Eph. 1:5, 9; Phil. 2:13), which will prosper in His hand. This is the fulfillment of God's economy. Ephesians 1:5 and 9 are two verses that mention God's good pleasure. God's economy comes out of God's good pleasure. God's dispensing is to fulfill God's good pleasure, which is to produce many sons to be the components of the Body of Christ, the church. This is God's good pleasure. In the whole universe nothing but the church could be God's good pleasure.</P><P>In our gospel preaching, merely to save souls is inadequate. We need to realize that our preaching of the gospel is to produce something to be God's pleasure, something to make God happy. When one soul is saved, thousands of angels in heaven rejoice (Luke 15:10). The angels are so happy because this is God's good pleasure.</P><P>Isaiah 53:10c says that the pleasure of Jehovah will prosper in the resurrected Christ's hand. Christ's hand today is still moving, working, and operating to produce more and more believers for God's good pleasure.</P>
