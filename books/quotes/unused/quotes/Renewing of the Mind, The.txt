The Bible shows us that man not only has a spirit, but a body also; he not only has a spirit and a body, but a soul as well
The body is given to us by God to communicate with the world; through the body we can feel everything in the world
What we usually call the heart, according to the Bible, is the conscience in man's spirit plus the mind in his soul
The spirit is the organ for communicating with God, for being intimate with God, for understanding the will of God, and for knowing God
The heart is the point of mutual interaction for the spirit and the soul, the contiguous place and the place of intersection
It is like the central exchange of the telephone company where all the lines intersect and all the calls pass through
The soul, including what it feels from the outside, reaches the heart, and from the heart passes through to the spirit
The good man, out of his good treasure, brings forth good things, and the evil man, out of his evil treasure, brings forth evil things'
The Lord Jesus said that out of the abundance of the heart the mouth speaks, because the heart is the man himself
Matthew 15:18-19 says, 'But the things which proceed out of the mouth come out of the heart, and those defile the man
For out of the heart come evil reasonings, murders, adulteries, fornications, thefts, false witnessings, blasphemies'
God gave us a new spirit, which enables us to communicate with Him and which causes our deadened spirit to recover its function
The Bible places this emphasis on the heart in order to cause us to see the important position that the heart occupies in the Bible
The function of his conscience is recovered to its original state, so that he now hates sins and dislikes sinning
At this time our soul, through the nous, translates the intuition so that we understand what is conveyed to us
We all know that when a brain is being surgically dissected, no more than some gray and white matter can be seen
And this is eternal life, that they may know You, the only true God, and Him whom You have sent, Jesus Christ'
We think it is sufficient if we have a new heart, but the Bible speaks not only of this; it also says that our nous needs to be renewed
Why did we allow our parents and others in the world to oppose us, and why were we willing to forsake the world?
It was the nous that enabled us to understand salvation, confess our sins, forsake the world, and allow our parents to persecute us
Other matters such as listening to a message or working for the Lord are likewise unprofitable if the nous does not cooperate
And this is eternal life, that they may know You, the only true God, and Him whom You have sent, Jesus Christ'
Whether or not our nous has been renewed can be determined by these three aspects: toward man, God, and ourselves
Only criticisms come out of him; his thoughts are engaged in 'splitting hairs' to find fault, and he always speaks poorly of others
The reason we have these kinds of thoughts is that our nous is not renewed and also Satan is working behind us
He should know God's will in the same way that he knew that Christ is the Son of God and that he was saved at the time of his conversion
We think that if we harbor hatred toward others in our heart, if we sin, if we commit fornication, we will offend God
It is very amazing that before a man is saved, his mind is very unorganized, and even after he is saved, his mind remains the same
If we cannot concentrate all day, why is it strange that we cannot do the same when we read the Bible or when we pray?
If we use a magnifying glass to collect the light from the sun, the heat can burn a finger underneath the glass
Self-criticism, self-analyzing, or any thought concerning the self, whether good or bad, causes one's mind to become restless
When you ask them to talk about spiritual things or about the truth, they cannot explain even one thing to others clearly
Even though this is necessary, if a person does not have a renewed nous, he cannot express what he has received within him
Suddenly, he went into the house of one of his neighbors and asked to be allowed to go upstairs to do something
If you daily have a renewed nous, you will see that you cannot bear what God shows you of yourself through your nous
If your regeneration has caused a change in your living, your nous should also be enlightened in a specific way and be renewed daily
If man's growth in the truth were governed by his natural intelligence, it would be entirely a matter of the flesh
The person beside you may be the most intelligent and wise person, but he cannot understand; only you can understand
If you are saved, you will surely see a change of heart and an improvement in the matters of loving, forbearing, and serving
Regardless of whether a believer is wise or foolish, he should know that his mind as well as his heart should be proper
As long as your nous is renewed, you can know God, understand His will, perceive, analyze, and synthesize what God has given you
Just as there is a great difference between death and life, there is a great difference between a renewed nous and an unrenewed nous
Just as there is a difference between heaven and earth, there is a difference between a renewed nous and an unrenewed nous
If we earnestly and single-mindedly deal with our nous in the way that we dealt with our salvation in the past, our sky will always be clear
We always need to keep an open and unveiled spirit in the presence of God so that we can have a living communication with Him
If the nous of a Christian is not proper, his spirit will also not be proper, for the problem in his head will directly affect his spirit
Verse 18 says, 'Alienated from the life of God because of the ignorance which is in them, because of the hardness of their heart'
Every doctor knows that the wound of a patient hurts but when the hurt goes beyond a certain stage the person does not feel the pain anymore
The meaning here is that since you have heard and have been taught in Him as the reality is in Jesus that your old man has been put off etc
According to the original text the meaning here is, 'The old man, which through the lusts of the deceit is heading towards corruption'
The meaning in the original text is to be continually renewed in the same way that the old man is continually being corrupted
Verse 24 reads, 'And put on the new man, which was created according to God in righteousness and holiness of the reality'
Verse 17 speaks of the nous; verse 18 speaks of dianoia, which is the function of the nous, something concerning the nous
He will not believe because he has said in his heart that there is no God, not because he is incapable of believing
Suppose a believer hears that baptism is according to the Bible and is something that God has clearly commanded
When someone preaches something that is different from our belief and practice, we should ask God if his speaking is really improper
Many Christians study the Bible like a lawyer studying a law book; their purpose is only to defend their own case
They first have a tendency to covet in their heart; then their mind and whole being are dragged into the peril of covetousness
Someone said that Eve did not fall because she ate the forbidden fruit, but because her motive was not proper in the beginning
The heart is improper; second, man is alienated from the life of God; and last, man's imagination and thoughts become totally evil
If you want to know whether or not a person's heart is proper and his mind is right, you need only talk to him
Some Christians' minds are like a wheel; they rotate all day long and cannot listen to what others say to them
Just as the wheel splashes dirt as it rotates, these Christians only raise questions and do not take in the truth
For people who do not understand English, words must first be translated into Chinese before they can be understood
Once a man cannot think for himself and can only act according to the thoughts given by others, he becomes a mentally passive person
Thinking constantly speaks of the mind's inability to stop, while failing to think speaks of the mind's inability to move
Because the light of God's life cannot shine into their nous, their nous is darkened, and the function of their nous is also darkened
If we do not put off the old man in our experience, we will not be able to experience the renewing of our mind
Putting off the old man is a specific matter; it is like a gate which we go through, rather than a road which extends continuously
Please notice another thing: the old man in Romans 6 is spoken of in a different way than it is spoken of here
We not only must believe that our old man is crucified, but we must also exercise the power of our will to cast away our old man
Although this correcting does not mean a so-called cultivation of the heart, that idea is, nevertheless, included in this correcting
Every believer who does not understand God's will is in this condition because his heart was improper in the first place
Verse 24 reads, 'And put on the new man, which was created according to God in righteousness and holiness of the reality'
If we want to renew our nous, or have our nous renewed frequently, we must put on the new man in our experience
While he was seating himself, he unintentionally stepped on and dirtied the raincoat of a lady sitting in front of him
We should put off uncleanness, improper motives, and unrighteousness on the negative side and put on the new man on the positive side
In the same way, if our nous is closed, our spirit will have nowhere to express itself and have no power to express itself
The amount of knowledge they have is another matter altogether; not everyone who is used by God has great knowledge
If our nous is renewed and our understanding is quick, we can understand God's will, God's desire, and the Bible
If you want to see how deep or how advanced a believer's spiritual life is, just find out what God is asking of him
God will grant you the understanding or the possession of His truth, though not necessarily at the moment you are reading
Sometimes your nous is opened, and you understand the truth while you are walking, working, going to bed, or getting up
At the beginning, when we read the Bible, we may only get pieces; but later on, we will understand the whole truth from God
The renewing may be resolved all at once; it may also not be resolved all at once, but rather grow like an infant
