   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>This is not all that resurrection accomplished.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>If we think that it is, we are wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>This is only the objective aspect of resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>There is still the subjective aspect.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Objectively speaking, the resurrection of the Lord becomes the proof of our salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>If anyone were to ask me how I know that I am saved, I would tell him that I have the proof.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>This proof proves that I am saved.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>You may tell me that you were saved on a certain date in a certain year because that was when you received the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>I would then ask how you could know that was sufficient.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>You may say that you confessed your sins that day, but how do you know that confession is sufficient?</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>You may say that you cried for your sins that day, but how do you know that your tears will wash your sins away?</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>You may say that you have repented, confessed your sins, and accepted the Lord Jesus, but how do you know that this repentance, confession, and receiving of the Lord is sufficient?</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>If you asked me, I would answer that I am actually saved because of the Lord's death, but I know that I am saved because of the Lord's resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>My friends, you have to differentiate between the two.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>I am saved because of the Lord's death, but I have the assurance and clear knowledge that I am saved because of the Lord's resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>When I pay the money, I settle my debt.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>I know that I have settled the debt because I have a receipt.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Thank God that He has given us a proof and a receipt.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>His Son has paid the debt for all our sins on the cross, and through the resurrection of His Son, He has informed us that the matter is fully settled.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Hence, all of the Lord's work is now finished.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>If there is anyone here tonight who still doubts that he is saved, I only need to ask him what he has believed in and what he has received.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>It is not sufficient for a person just to believe in the cross and to receive the redemption of the Lord on the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>One must also believe in His resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The resurrection of the Lord Jesus is God's message to us.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>It shows us that God has accepted the Lord's work.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Thank God that the cross has satisfied God's heart.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>That is why there is the resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Thus, the foundation of our faith is the death of Christ, but our faith is also based on the proof of resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Death is His work of redeeming us.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Resurrection is the proof of His having redeemed us.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Notice that here I have said "having redeemed."</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Death is His work of redeeming us, and resurrection is the proof of His having redeemed us.</S>
