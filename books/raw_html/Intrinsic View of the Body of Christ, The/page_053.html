<H2 CLASS=HEAD2>Always Remember:<br>There is No Way for the Members<br>of the Body of Christ to be Legitimately Divided<br>in the Body of Christ</H2><P>We must always remember that there is no way for the members of the Body of Christ to be legitimately divided in the Body of Christ. In other words, no division is legitimate, and no division is justified, regardless of how strong our reason is.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>All Problems Can and Should Be Solved<br>through Proper and Adequate Fellowship<br>by Praying Together Sincerely and Thoroughly</H2><P>All problems can and should be solved through proper and adequate fellowship by praying together sincerely and thoroughly. Any question and any problem can be solved by fellowship. Acts 15 speaks of how the trouble concerning circumcision came from Jerusalem to Antioch. That stirred up a big turmoil in the church at Antioch. Paul and Barnabas, however, did not say, "This is something from Jerusalem. Let Jerusalem take care of this. We will tell these people to go back to Jerusalem. Antioch is our territory. It is in our jurisdiction." That is not the right way. Instead, Paul and Barnabas went from Antioch to Jerusalem to fellowship with the apostles and elders there (vv. 1-2). They all came together to have a thorough fellowship. By this kind of adequate and thorough fellowship, they arrived at a conclusion by the leading and guidance of the Spirit. Thus, they solved the problem.</P><P>Today we should be the same, but those who have been dissenting among us did not take this way. In recent years there have been some turmoils among us. When the dissenting ones came to me, a proposal was made to invite all the leading co-workers and the leading elders throughout the globe to come together. We would all come together to pray thoroughly, and then we would open up the holy Word to study and fellowship about all the concerns. They told me that they would agree on a date which would be acceptable for everyone to come together, and then they would let me know. Eventually, however, this never took place. That means they rejected the proper way to have fellowship. Thus far, none of the dissenting ones have come to me with a spirit of fellowship to fellowship about their problems. We all have to learn that if we see something that we cannot tolerate, the best way is to have fellowship with the concerned ones and with some experienced ones. By praying together to search the Word, we can solve every problem.</P><P>If we all hold to the unique faith, there should be no problem among us that cannot be solved. We all believe that God is triune and that the Bible is God's Word. We also believe that Christ is God becoming a man to be our Savior. He died on the cross for our sins and He resurrected physically, psychologically, and spiritually. Today He is our Savior and our life, and we are the children of the Triune God. As long as we believe in the contents of the faith, we should not contend for anything else. We do not need to argue with one another. Instead, we need to fellowship by praying together.</P>
