Are four Marys: the Mary in Romans 16, the mother of Jesus, Mary the Magdalene, and the mother of John Mark in Acts 12
We need to consider Romans 16 as important as Romans 6, even as important as Romans 8, and as important as Romans 12
Without adequate experience, it is very hard to get into Romans 16 to see what is covered there, what it reveals to us
It is somewhat easy to understand that Romans 6 and Romans 8 reveal the Christian life, and that Romans 12 reveals the church life
The main point in chapter fifteen is the communication between the churches, the fellowship in the Body between the churches
We may expect such a recommendation to come at the end, but Paul made this recommendation of a sister the number one item
After this recommendation, the first ones that Paul greeted were a couple, but he mentioned the wife's name first
If you read carefully, you could see that all the things related to these four sisters include all the aspects of the practical church life
The holy Word is economical, but Paul uses two long verses to recommend this dear sister, to indicate in what way she serves
Perhaps the best nurse in an American hospital could give you a part of the picture of the service of a Roman patroness
A Roman patron takes care of your cases, your legal cases, legal causes, and also takes care of your business need
In every local church there is the need of a group of serving sisters like this sister, a group of serving sisters taking care of the saints
Most of the brothers had to work six or seven days a week, so nearly all of the cleaning work was under the hand of the sisters
Wherever they went, she and her husband took care of the church in the way of having the church meeting in their home
In a family, if the wife does not take the lead to have the practical church life, the husband would always be frustrated
In every family, if the wife takes the lead to have the church life, it could be so easy to bring the whole family into the church life
The frustrations would always come from the source of the wife who would not take the lead for the church life
In every local church there is the need of a group of sisters to be so bold to take the lead for the practical church life
Among thousands of things, in this one unique matter, the sisters may take the lead for the practical church life
If the sisters would not do this, they could not be up to the standard, they are not qualified before the Lord
In verses 6 and 12 Paul says that Mary has been laboring for the apostles, and that Persis has labored very much
If these matters are put into practice among us, right away we could see that our situation does not match the revelation in Romans 16
If you sisters mean business to be serving ones in the church, first of all you have to learn not to talk, not to talk at all
Many of the sisters would consider gossip just as idle words, but would not include the vain talking of doctrine
The Bible calls this kind of word an idle word because you are idle, you have nothing to do, you have no serving to occupy you
Those serving sisters also realized that a number of the younger ones needed to be served by their prayers for their marriages
All the vain talk about so many points, all the vain talk about others, is just gossip in the eyes of God, and it wastes your time
When you see that a brother becomes a problem to the church, or that a sister has some problem in her life, don't talk
We all have to learn to serve the church and serve the saints like the sister Phoebe that Paul recommended in Romans 16
What the sisters can do if they pick up this burden and are faithful to the Lord in it is something that the brothers cannot do
