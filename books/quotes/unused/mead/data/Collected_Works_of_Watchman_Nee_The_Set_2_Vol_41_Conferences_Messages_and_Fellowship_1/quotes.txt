[5]  The real issue is not what the environment says or what other men say, but what God says.
[6]  God's thought concerning man is that man cannot please Him by doing anything himself.
[7]  In himself, man is full of sin and totally incapable of pleasing God.
[8]  CHAPTER TWO LIFE AND LIGHT Date: August 20, 1934, morning
[9]  It is absurd for a child of God to have life but be without light.
[10]  A student once said to Mr. Bengal, a famous Bible expositor, "I have recently discovered the doctrine of sin from the book of Romans." Mr. Bengal looked at him and said, "Do you mean to tell me that today is the first time that you have known about the doctrine of sin? By now you should have realized that your whole person is sin from your daily experience!"
[11]  CHAPTER THREE PRIVATE TALKS 1 GENERAL SPIRITUAL TOPICS The Universe Revealing God's Glory,
[12]  Nature reveals only God's glory, but Christ reveals God Himself.
[13]  At the most the universe can reveal God's glory Psa 19:1; Rom 1:20 ; only Christ can reveal God Himself, because God is in Christ.
[14]  The student argued that there is no God, and I said to him, "Then you must be God.
[15]  There was a opera star in England named Miss Christiana Fry.
[16]  She was born of a rich family and endowed with beauty and wealth.
[17]  The preacher told her that she was going down the wrong path and that she should believe in the Lord.
[18]  The Place of the Male and the Female July 28
[19]  In the Bible the male represents truth and stands for objective things, whereas the female represents experience and stands for subjective things.
[20]  In a family the male must assume the responsibility of authority and supply.
[21]  Place: Foochow ON BIBLICAL EXPOSITION Biblical Manuscripts and the Apocrypha July 31
[22]  Although there were Old Testament apocryphal writings, the Lord did not acknowledge them.
[23]  Chapters one through eight of Romans are doctrinal, nine through eleven are illustrative, and twelve through sixteen are experiential.
[24]  Chapter seven describes the condition of a person before he is saved.
[25]  Verse 6 says that we the saved ones have died to the law in which we were held and are therefore discharged or freed from the law.
[26]  Place: Foochow ON THE PRACTICE OF THE CHURCH LIFE The Ground of Locality of a Church
[27]  There are many advantages in having the city as the unit of the church.
[28]  Although not all the cities in the Bible have walls, cities historically experience the least amount of changes.
[29]  The principle in ascertaining a sect: 1 It has its own distinctive name, 2 it has its own distinctive organization, and 3 it has its own distinctive fellowship.
[30]  When Dr. Stearns discussed the matter of leaving the denominations with Mr. Sparks, he was asked, "If you are truly under the headship of Christ, would you come under the Presbyterians?" This made Dr. Stearns clear about the matter of leaving the denominations.
[31]  We should let them know that we fellowship with all the saints and that we take care of the Body life.
[32]  Place: Foochow ON THE ASSEMBLY IN FOOCHOW AND ON DIVISION
[33]  Editor's Note: In 1934 there was a meeting in She-Er-Jen-Pai, a district in the city of Foochow.
[34]  The meeting was not a part of any denomination, and it had knowledge of the church in Shanghai.
[35]  the Way of Watchman Nee and John Wang Brother Weigh's Abbreviated Record
[36]  I felt that your attitude and motive were very questionable referring to what John Wang did when he was in Shanghai .
[37]  IN VARIOUS PLACES IN 1934 CHAPTER SEVEN KEYS TO STUDYING THE BIBLE
[38]  In studying the Bible we have to pay attention to the following points:
[39]  There is no need to adhere to any form when reading the Bible.
[40]  I answered that I live in a very nonrigid fashion.
[41]  It is a serious thing for a sinner saved by grace to excommunicate another sinner saved by grace.
[42]  We are not sitting on a throne of judgment; we are not the judge.
[43]  CHAPTER NINE THE WAY TO WORK THE NEED OF A VISION IN GOD'S WORK
[44]  The Israelites first received the pattern on the mount from God before they built the tabernacle.
[45]  We must first have a vision before we can obey it.
[46]  In Genesis 32 in the Old Testament, we have a record of Jacob wrestling with an angel.
[47]  Although the hollow of his thigh was touched, he spoke to the angel, saying, "I will not let thee go, except thou bless me" v. 26 . Although Jacob was ruthless, his disposition met the condition for God's blessing; he was desperately seeking.
[48]  If your thoughts are unclean, if you cannot overcome your disposition, if you do not have an uninterrupted fellowship with the Lord, if you are afraid to pray, or if you see no result to your work, now is the time for you to ask the Lord to give you the abundant life and fill you up with the Spirit.
[49]  Scripture Reading: Phil 1:21; Col 3:4; 1 Cor 1:30 GOD'S ETERNAL PURPOSE
[50]  This is why God is not satisfied with man simply living by his human life.
[51]  Asking God to Grant Us the Power to Overcome
[52]  Another group of people know that they have received a new life, new standards, and new demands and aspirations.
[53]  They know that they are weak and prone to defeat and failure.
[54]  They think that they should ask God to grant them strength and help them to overcome sin.
[55]  The new life and new power that God has given to us is simply Christ Himself.
[56]  He is within us as our life, and He is within us to be with us all the time.
[57]  He gives us the overcoming life by giving us His Son, who becomes our victory.
[58]  Paul did not say that we should live by Christ, that we should live by His strength, or that we should live by His life.
[59]  Our greatest misconception is to think that God gives us Christ to help us to overcome our sins.
[60]  Last year in Chefoo, a Christian said to me, "I need a great change.
[61]  This afternoon we will consider how we can experience Christ as our life.
[62]  I am not saying that we do not have this life.
[63]  I am saying that in addition to having this life we can experience Christ as our life.
[64]  If we have Christ living within us, we will have the same holy life as Christ.
[65]  If we still do not realize that we cannot make it or if we only have an overcoming doctrine without an overcoming life, we have to ask God to give us the light and show us that we cannot make it at all.
[66]  After we realize that we cannot make it, what should we do?
[67]  I know many brothers and sisters who have come to me and wept before me and before the Lord about their inability to overcome their sins.
[68]  What should we do when we realize that we cannot overcome our sin and are completely powerless?
[69]  She said, "I pray to resist this temptation, I pray for God to deliver me from it, or I pray for God to grant me the strength so that the sin will not prevail over me."
[70]  Many people are familiar with the first part of 2 Corinthians 12:9, but they forget about the second part of this verse.
[71]  Today we will pay special attention to the second part of this verse.
[72]  Paul said that he most gladly boasted in his weaknesses so that the power of Christ might tabernacle over him.
[73]  In order to receive and experience the overcoming life, there are four steps we have to take.
[74]  First, we have to see that we cannot do anything.
[75]  Second, we have to give up trying to do anything.
[76]  Fourth, we have to believe that God is able, that is, we have to believe that God can make it for us.
[77]  CHAPTER THIRTEEN A BELIEVER'S RELATIONSHIP WITH CHRIST Date: November 15, 1935, evening
[78]  In the Old Testament, Adam was commanded by God to obey His word after he was created.
[79]  In the Old Testament, "it was said to the ancients, You shall not murder, and whoever murders shall be liable to the judgment'" v. 21 , but in the New Testament, the Lord said, "Every one who is angry with his brother shall be liable to the judgment" v. 22 . The Old Testament says, "You shall not commit adultery" v. 27 , but in the New Testament, the Lord said, "Every one who looks at a woman in order to lust after her has already committed adultery with her in his heart" v. 28 . This means that even a thought in the heart is not allowed.
[80]  Our second relationship with the Lord is one which is between the Head and the body.
[81]  Christ is the Head, and we are the members of His Body.
[82]  The fingers are organically joined to the body and do not need to bear any responsibility of their own.
[83]  In John 6 the Lord said, "I am the bread of life; he who comes to Me shall by no means hunger, and he who believes into Me shall by no means ever thirst....Unless you eat the flesh of the Son of Man and drink His blood, you do not have life within yourselves....He who eats My flesh and drinks My blood abides in Me and I in him" vv.
[84]  We believe in God's Word, which says that we are the branches of the vine, that we are the members in the Body of Christ, that the Lord is our bread of life, that we have been married to Christ, and that Christ is the Father to us the orphans.
[85]  Romans 1:17 says, "For the righteousness of God is revealed in it out of faith to faith."
[86]  CHAPTER FOURTEEN WHAT IS FAITH Date: November 16, 1935, morning
[87]  Every person has a different capacity of faith before God, in the same way that cups, bowls, and tumblers all have different capacities.
[88]  Mr. George M ller had a great faith; his capacity was great, and God did much through him.
[89]  For Jesus Christ to become our life, God has to show this to us as a revelation on the one hand, and we have to believe it on the other hand.
[90]  How do we know if this or that verse is the Lord's word to us?
[91]  Every saved person has the Holy Spirit residing within him, and everyone can know God's leading.
[92]  According to the promise of the New Testament, "I will impart My laws into their mind, and on their hearts I will inscribe them; and I will be God to them, and they will be a people to Me. And they shall by no means each teach his fellow citizen and each his brother, saying, Know the Lord; for all will know Me from the little one to the great one among them" Heb 8:10-11 . There was a man who once wrote a book to oppose the trichotomy of the spirit, soul, and body.
[93]  I said, "Even if the Bible did not say that man was of three parts, the Holy Spirit, who is in us, would tell us there is the distinction between the spirit, soul, and body."
[94]  If the Spirit within has not ordered us to do something, and we do it, we are wrong in the eyes of God no matter how well we have done the work.
[95]  CHAPTER FIFTEEN THE WAY OF A CHRISTIAN Date: November 16, 1935, afternoon
[96]  Every Christian has a work that is divinely assigned by the Lord, and every Christian should live according to such an assignment.
[97]  Ephesians 2:10 says, "We are His masterpiece, created in Christ Jesus for good works, which God prepared beforehand in order that we would walk in them."
[98]  Scripture Reading: Rom 12:1; 6:13; 2 Cor 5:14-15 INTRODUCTION
[99]  God saves us for the purpose of living for the Lord.
[100]  God has not saved us merely for the purpose of separating us from the world.
[101]  The first thing to do after overcoming is to consecrate.
[102]  It is putting yourself and all that you have on the altar.
[103]  Specifically, we should consecrate four things to the Lord.
[104]  If you have consecrated yourself to the Lord, no one in this world will occupy your heart any longer, and no person can seize your heart away from Him.
[105]  Not only should we consecrate people, careers, and things, but we also have to consecrate ourselves.
[106]  Some think that after one has overcome he does not need to practice obedience anymore.
[107]  Actually, our overcoming only makes us more able to obey the Lord.
[108]  Formerly we did not have the strength to obey the Lord.
[109]  Now that the Lord has accomplished everything for us, we can spontaneously hand over our will and everything to the Lord and allow the Lord to strengthen us with the overcoming life for obedience.
[110]  CHAPTER SEVENTEEN THE GUARDING OF THE OVERCOMING LIFE Date: November 17, 1935, evening
[111]  Scripture Reading: 2 Tim 1:12; Phil 1:6; 1 Pet 1:5; Psa 17:8; Jude 24-25 THE LORD HAVING BEGUN
[112]  In fact, both the initiation, continuation, and consummation of the overcoming life are from the Lord Himself; we have nothing to do with them.
[113]  IN THE OVERCOMING LIFE Date: November 18, 1935, 9 a.m.
[114]  Every day we have to tell the Lord that there is no goodness in ourselves, that we are still as evil as we were before, and that we are full of sin.
[115]  There is no time to prepare for sudden and instantaneous temptations.
[116]  Therefore, we cannot deal with them on the spur of the moment.
[117]  Long before this kind of temptation comes, we have to set up our defense.
[118]  Every morning, we have to pray to the Lord and ask Him to deliver us from sudden temptations.
[119]  The section above covers the steps one should take to live a life beyond the gate of victory.
[120]  Now we have to know the attitude one should take toward maintaining an overcoming life.
[121]  Many people have done the things we mentioned above, but they are constantly afraid that the Lord will not come to them, and they worry that they will fail if He does not come.
[122]  In order to live an overcoming life, we have to pay attention to our attitude.
[123]  The more we read the Bible, the more the Bible will increase our measure, and the more we will know ourselves.
[124]  When we listen to a message, pray, or fellowship with God, we receive grace directly from Him through His enlightening.
[125]  It is not too easy to speak about the outpouring of the Holy Spirit here.
[126]  This does not mean that the Bible only speaks this much about this matter, but I can only make a few miscellaneous remarks here and there.
[127]  We can also tell the difference between the outpouring of the Holy Spirit and that of evil spirits from the principle by which the two spirits work.
[128]  The way we cooperate with the Holy Spirit is as follows: When the Holy Spirit comes, He will ask, perhaps with a small voice, how much we are willing to allow Him to occupy us.
[129]  AND THINGS TO WATCH OUT FOR Date: November 18, 1935, evening
[130]  In order to receive the outpouring of the Holy Spirit, we have to fulfill certain conditions.
[131]  Taking Control of the Spirit That Is upon Us
[132]  The Spirit that is poured out upon us is not personified.
[133]  For example, 1 Corinthians 12:13 mentions being baptized into one Spirit.
[134]  This Spirit is compared to water and therefore is not personified.
[135]  This Spirit is subject to us 1 Cor 14:32 .
[136]  However, the Spirit that dwells within us is personified, and we have to come under His subjection.
[137]  The Spirit that is upon us submits to us, and we can direct Him to stay or go away.
[138]  We have to obey the Spirit who is within us, but we have to take control of the Spirit that is upon us.
[139]  The experience at Pentecost recorded in Acts was not a literal fulfillment of the prophecy in the book of Joel; it was only an event that was similar to Joel's prophecy.
[140]  Both the Old Testament and the New Testament show us that there are only three works of the Holy Spirit: 1 imparting life to man, 2 becoming life within man, and 3 becoming power upon man.
[141]  The Holy Spirit dwells within man to be his life, and He rests upon man to be his power.
[142]  If we are not clear about the difference between these two aspects of His work, we do not know the difference between the work of the Holy Spirit in the Old Testament and that in the New Testament.
[143]  The indwelling of the Holy Spirit was promised by Christ in the New Testament before His death.
[144]  If we do not understand the difference between the indwelling and the outpouring of the Spirit, we will find it hard to explain the fact that the Samaritans had believed and were baptized, but had not yet received the Holy Spirit.
[145]  The outpouring of the Spirit is much inferior to the indwelling of the Spirit and the overcoming life.
[146]  God has been gracious to make me a minister of the overcoming life and not a minister of the outpouring of the Spirit.
[147]  But it is terrible if we have the outpouring of the Spirit, but are lacking in the experience of the indwelling Spirit.
[148]  If we have the inward aspect, we can pursue the outward work of the Spirit, but if we do not have the inward aspect, it is all right if we temporarily put aside the pursuit of the outward manifestation of the Spirit.
[149]  If the inward aspect of the Spirit is more important than the outward aspect of the Spirit, why do we need the outpouring of the Spirit?
[150]  Those who live a life of holiness and who know the Spirit as a person will have the strength to share this holiness with others once they receive the outpouring of the Spirit.
[151]  A man who is filled with the Holy Spirit can change the atmosphere.
[152]  When some people enter a room, they can turn a quiet room into a noisy one, a noisy room into a quiet one, or speechless ones into talkative ones.
[153]  Our failure lies in the fact that we cannot bring a spiritual atmosphere with us wherever we go.
[154]  CHAPTER TWENTY-THREE THE TONE OF AN OVERCOMING LIVING Date: November 19, 1935, evening
[155]  Before we come to this matter, we have to review what we have seen.
[156]  A few passages in the Bible speak of rejoicing.
[157]  Matthew 5:11-12 says, "Blessed are you when they reproach and persecute you, and while speaking lies, say every evil thing against you because of Me. Rejoice and exult, for your reward is great in the heavens; for so they persecuted the prophets who were before you." "Rejoice and exult" means "to greatly and jubilantly rejoice." James 1:2 says, "Count it all joy, my brothers, whenever you fall into various trials." What is our tone in the midst of trials? James said that we have to count them all joy.
[158]  CHAPTER TWENTY-FOUR THE HOLY SPIRIT AND THE LAW Date: November 20, 1935, morning
[159]  As believers, we live by the Holy Spirit, not by the law.
[160]  Many people do not know what the law is.
[161]  They do not know what it means to live by the law and what it means to live by the Spirit.
[162]  The failure in our work is due to the fact that we work by the law and not by the Spirit.
[163]  If we trust in the law, we will not have the power or the fruit because the law is something that the Lord has judged.
[164]  A living that is according to the Spirit does not follow any fixed rule.
[165]  All dead rules are set aside, and one seeks after God's will directly.
[166]  After my servant finished cleaning the floor, he did not know what to do next.
[167]  CHAPTER TWENTY-FIVE TALKS 1 Date: November 20, 1935, 3 p.m.
[168]  After you have received the outpouring of the Spirit, you must take control of your spirit every day.
[169]  We should only receive the outpouring of the Spirit when we need it and should not consider it an entertainment or a spiritual enjoyment when we do not need it.
[170]  Let us consider again the difference between the outpouring and the infilling of the Holy Spirit.
[171]  The outpouring of the Spirit is for every believer, whereas the infilling of the Spirit is for a special group of people those who are emptied.
[172]  In studying the Bible we have to realize that every term can be paired with a corresponding term.
[173]  If we have not passed through the cross and are not filled by the Holy Spirit, and if we can only show men such things as head covering and baptism by immersion, I will be the first to declare that I have nothing to do with such a sect.
[174]  CHAPTER TWENTY-SIX BEING BESIDE OURSELVES TO GOD Date: November 20, 1935, evening
[175]  Both our Lord and Paul were accused of being insane when they were on earth Mark 3:21; Acts 26:24 .
[176]  Let me ask one question: Even though you are sober-minded before men, are you beside yourself to God?
[177]  The Bible also tells us about many people who were beside themselves in offering up their possessions and houses.
[178]  Acts 4 mentions the disciples selling their all and laying the money they received at the apostles' feet v. 34 . Many people agree that we should be zealous, but they say that we should be careful, balanced, and not go to extremes.
[179]  Yet throughout the past two thousand years, all those who have truly consecrated themselves to the Lord were men who risked everything to offer up themselves.
[180]  One brother asked me, "How can you love the Lord so much, and why can't I love Him as much?"
[181]  I said, "If you give your money to the Lord, you will love Him.
[182]  Not only do we have to be beside ourselves in preaching the gospel and in offering our all, we must also be beside ourselves in suffering.
[183]  CHAPTER TWENTY-SEVEN A REPORT ON THE VARIOUS REGIONS
[184]  OF WORK IN CHINA Date: November 21, 1935, morning
[185]  Since we are co-workers together in our work in China, we should be concerned for the work of the whole country.
[186]  Later, if we find others standing on similar ground in other countries, we can enlarge our hearts to the work of the whole world and be concerned for them as well.
[187]  CHAPTER TWENTY-EIGHT GIFTS, MINISTRIES, AND OPERATIONS Date: November 21, 1935, afternoon
[188]  Scripture Reading: Acts 6:2-4 GIFTS, MINISTRIES, AND OPERATIONS
[189]  First Corinthians 12:4-6 says, "But there are distinctions of gifts, but the same Spirit; and there are distinctions of ministries, yet the same Lord; and there are distinctions of operations, but the same God, who operates all things in all."
[190]  Gifts are of the Spirit, operations are of God, and ministries are of the Lord.
[191]  Based on these two categories, there are two kinds of ministries.
[192]  The first category includes gifts that enable one to work for the Lord, and the second category includes gifts that enable one to bear local responsibilities.
[193]  Place: Chuenchow GIFT AND MINISTRY The Ministries for the Ministries
[194]  First Corinthians 12:28-30 speaks of nine kinds of gifts.
[195]  Some have thought that being free from the denominations is the same as being free from authority.
[196]  Actually, freedom from the denominations only frees us from man's authority.
[197]  In our daily lives and work, God has appointed many representative authorities for us to learn submission.
[198]  Place: Chuenchow THE DEALINGS A WORKER HAS TO EXPERIENCE
[199]  The main thing that ordinary brothers have to deal with is sin.
[200]  First Thessalonians 5:14 mentions the consolation of those who are "weak," which in Greek literally means "little-souled."
[201]  Those who are little-souled are the ones who are psychologically weak.
[202]  Some people have a strong soul, while others have a weak soul.
