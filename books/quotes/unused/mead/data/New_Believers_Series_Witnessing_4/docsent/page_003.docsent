   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>B. Going Home to Tell Others</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In Mark 5:1-20 we see a person who was demon possessed.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>It is the most severe case of demon possession recorded in the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>A legion of demons was within this man.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>He dwelt among the tombs, and no one was able to bind him, not even with a chain.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Night and day, he would cry out among the tombs and in the mountains and gash himself with stones.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>When the Lord commanded the demons to come out from him, they did and entered into about two thousand hogs.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>They all rushed down the steep slope into the sea and drowned.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>After the demon possessed man was saved, the Lord said to him, "Go to your house, to your own people, and report to them what great things the Lord has done for you, and how He has had mercy on you" v. 19 .</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>After you are saved, the Lord wants you to tell your family, neighbors, relatives, friends, and colleagues that you are now a saved person.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>You should tell them not only that you have believed in Jesus but also what great things the Lord has done for you.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The Lord wants you to tell others what He has done for you.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>He wants you to confess and witness to others what has happened to you.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Others will be lit when you do this, and salvation will continue on; it will not stop with you.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>What a pity that many souls in Christian families are on the way to eternal perdition.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Some of our parents, children, relatives, and friends have not heard the gospel of Christ from our own mouths.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>They have only the blessing and happiness of the present age, without the hope of the coming age.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Why should we withhold from telling them what the Lord has done for us?</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>These are the ones who are right next to us.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>If they cannot hear the gospel from us, who else can?</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>In order to witness to our family, we must show them the great change in our conduct.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>We must show our family what a wonderful change has been wrought in our lives since we believed in the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Only then will they listen to us.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>They will not have confidence in anything less than this.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>We must be more righteous, more self-sacrificing, more loving, more diligent, and more joyful than before.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>They will not believe us if there is no change in our conduct.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>At the same time, we need to witness to them the reason for this change.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>C. Proclaiming in the Synagogue</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Acts 9:19-21 says, "He was with the disciples in Damascus for some days.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>And immediately he proclaimed Jesus in the synagogues, that this One is the Son of God.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>And all who heard him were amazed and said, Is this not the one who ravaged those who call upon this name in Jerusalem and came here for this, that he might bring them bound before the chief priests?"</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Saul was on his way to Damascus to bind the believers of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>But he met the Lord on the way and the Lord spoke to him.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The moment light came, he fell on his face and became blind.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The men who journeyed with him led him by the hand and brought him into Damascus.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>He was there three days without seeing, eating, or drinking.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The Lord sent Ananias to lay his hands upon him, and he received sight, rose up, and was baptized.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>After he had taken food, he was strengthened.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>After a few days he immediately went into the synagogues to proclaim that Jesus is the Son of God and to witness to others.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>It was obviously difficult for him to do this because he had been persecuting the Lord's disciples all along.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>He could have been a member of the Sanhedrin.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The Jewish Sanhedrin was comprised of seventy-one persons, and he could have been one among the seventy-one.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>He had secured a letter from the high priest and was on his way to bind the believers of the Lord and to bring them before the high priest.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>What should he do now that he had believed in the Lord?</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Originally, he was going to bind those who believed in the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Now he himself was in danger of being bound.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Humanly speaking, he should have escaped or hidden.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Instead, he went into the synagogues, not just one but many, to prove that Jesus is the Son of God.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>This shows us that the first thing a person should do upon receiving the Lord is testify for Him.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>After Paul received his sight, he went at the first opportunity to testify that Jesus of Nazareth is the Son of God.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Every believer of the Lord should do the same thing.</S>
