   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Job continued by speaking regarding God's dealing with those who rebel against the light, who are not acquainted with its ways nor abide in its paths v. 13 . Included among such ones are murderers and adulterers, who do not know the light vv.</S>

   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Job said that God preserves the mighty for awhile and then lets them be cut off like the ears of grain.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Job concluded by saying, "If it is not so, then who will prove me a liar/And bring my words to nought?" v. 25 . It seems that here, in spite of his pain, Job was showing off to his friends.</S>
