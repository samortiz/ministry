They were first used by the church in Peitou, which studied these lessons twice in their service meetings and witnessed rich results
They left a deep impression on the brothers and brought about very much progress in their service and coordination
The light concerning the elders' administration of the church has been received and practiced by us for many years
In the first message, we will begin by covering the matter of the knowledge of an elder what an elder has to know
In order for an elder to manage a church properly, obviously he must first of all know God's desire and plan for the church
If the elders lack knowledge in this matter, their administration of the church will surely be unsatisfactory both to others and to God
The more you read the Bible, the more you feel the fullness and the abundance of God Himself; they are truly unlimited
For this reason, God desires to have a Body for His full Christ, so that all the fullness can be manifested in the whole universe
Some Christians have further knowledge; they realize that a person has to be zealous, to love the Lord, and to learn to be spiritual
If we have the vision concerning God's plan for the church, we will see clearly that it is not enough to help others to be saved
For this matter, there is no distinction between something on earth today and something in heaven in the future
He never considers whether it is to be on earth or in heaven, or whether it is to be for today or for the future
If the Son of God is to be expressed in this Body in the future, so much more does He want to be expressed today
The church is the Body that God seeks after for His Son in His plan, for the purpose of expressing Him in the universe
We have to point out that the Brethren went too far in putting God's plan off until the future through the application of prophecies
According to his teaching, the visible church has some true elements and some false elements; only the invisible Church is all true
Some elements of the visible church are fleshly, while some are spiritual, but the invisible Church is all spiritual
Only by being under the control of such a vision can there be the service according to the standard of such a vision
In a practical way, God desires those who are part of this Body to become churches in the different localities
In other words, he must know the Church in its universal aspect, and he must know the church in its local aspect
Never consider the universal Church to be one kind of church, and the local church to be another kind of church
There is a great vision in the New Testament that tells how the Church as the Body of Christ is the expression of the Son of God
Every elder should realize in a sober and profound way that the eldership is a matter of government in the church
Although Peter's epistles are not as numerous as those of Paul or as the writings of John, he is nevertheless a great minister of the word
To them, as long as you understand that the church is the Body of Christ and the house of God, it is good enough
In the New Testament, every aspect of God's dealing with the church is under His government and administration
In order to manage a church properly, an elder has to know that God desires to execute His government in the universe through the church
There it says that if a brother sins and refuses to repent, in spite of repeated exhortation, the matter should be brought to the church
When he refuses to repent, and two or three would go to him to help him, it is partly a spiritual matter and partly a governmental matter
If he would not repent and the matter is told to the church, it becomes more a governmental matter than a spiritual one
They only consider that they are serving together with the brothers and sisters and are having spiritual fellowship one with another
Every elder has to see that God has His government in the universe, and He also has His government in the church
Every one who lacks a vision concerning God's government will be unable to serve satisfactorily as an elder before God
Whenever we mention the administration of a church by the elders, we should immediately have the concept of authority
Brothers and sisters, the Pope should be condemned, and autocracy should be condemned, but authority can never be annulled
No matter how much man talks about democracy in these days, everywhere in the universe you are met with authority
Sometimes, man has stretched the meaning of democracy to such an extent as to make it an excuse for lawlessness
If the elders only shepherd and teach without managing, or if they are incapable of managing, the church will be weak
In order for a local church to be strong, living, reliable, and stable, the elders must be able to govern and administer
In a locality where saints begin to meet, under normal circumstances, elders should be set up as soon as possible
The New Testament shows us clearly that the authority of the church is entrusted to the elders and is completely in the hands of the elders
Although the elders are appointed by the apostles, God has not entrusted the authority of the church to the hands of the apostles
In that particular instance in Jerusalem, the apostles did not make independent decisions apart from the elders
Unless you are an elder in a local church, you have no authority to directly touch the affairs of the local church
In the same principle, if there is no authority or government in the church, it will also be improper, in chaos, weak, and off the track
There is a very clear light in the New Testament, which is that in the church there are the elders as the authority
They may not be as spiritual as you are, and may not have received as much education as you have received, or be as capable as you are
It does not mean that you should boast that you are the authority of the church, or that you are a delegated authority!
It is for no other reason than that the church would be strong on earth and would be delivered from the element of confusion and corruption
Although human society is corrupt, nevertheless you cannot deny that a normal situation is established to a certain degree
If you were to overturn the police department, the whole city would immediately be thrown into turmoil, and much corruption would break out
In the same principle, we, the redeemed and regenerated ones, are children together in the house of God, serving the Lord in the church
If we were to remove from the church the delegated authority, the church would be thrown into a similar kind of confusion
An elder has to know God's plan for the church, and he also has to know God's government and administration in the universe
Not only does the Bible say this, but history also testifies to this, and our experience can also attest to it
Perhaps some brothers would ask, 'Does not the Bible say that the apostles are higher and more important than the elders'?
Please remember, however, that the key to the condition in the church does not hinge on the apostles; rather it hinges on the elders
The beginning of Revelation shows us that in the whole universe Gods testimony is the churches in the different localities as His lampstands
When the Lord came to speak, He did not speak directly to the churches; rather He spoke to the messengers of the churches
It is because all the accomplishment of God's plan in the universe and the attainment of His desire hinge upon the elders in the church
We say this not for the elders to be proud; rather it shows all of us the important position in which the grace of God has placed the elders
It will be not only a blessing to us as individuals, but a blessing to the church, and the elders themselves will be perfected
The authority of the church is not in the hands of the apostles; the authority of the church is in the hands of the elders
Concerning the administration of the church by the elders, our emphasis is also not the method of administration
They may think that now that Brother Lee is going to talk about the way for the elders to manage a church, everything will be wonderful
There is no need for a good method of administration; rather, there is the need of a good person for administration
Of course, there are many other aspects to an elder's heart, but the most indispensable thing is a broad heart
If you are a narrow-minded person, but you try to be an elder with broad ways, surely the result will be a failure
If you want to help others to read the Bible and pray, you yourself must first be a reading person and a praying person
If you read the Bible and pray only because you are an elder, such reading and praying is the method of being an elder
Although a Christian has to learn to be human, he should not learn to be human according to the way of worldly society
Sometimes the elder would even explain to me, saying, 'Oh, you do not realize how bad a temper this brother has
Unless you do nothing whatever you do no matter how much you keep it secret sooner or later others will know about it
You may tell a brother that he is quite good, and may turn around soon after he leaves and say that he is terrible
You may think you are saying it only behind his back and not to his face but you can be sure that in less than half a year he will find out
When it is difficult for us to say something, we can remain silent, but we must never say something that we do not mean
When he loses his job or is in sorrow, you do not have to express such a pretentious gesture if you are really not concerned about him
It may seem to be perfectly all right for you to be a false person if, after you act in pretense once, you move to the moon
Otherwise, others will eventually become tired of listening to your sympathetic 'Oh's,' and they will say that this elder is pretending
Brothers, since we have received the Lord's mercy to be appointed as elders among His people, we should be honest persons
In the world, there may be the need for polite pretense, but in the church, the elders should not have any polite pretense
Sometimes, after an elder complained this way at home, the troubled brother came right afterward to visit his home
The elder would then invite him politely into the living room and would give him a smiling face again, as if all his temper had disappeared
Many times, the humility of the elders is a performance before man; the elders are actually very proud before God
Some elders have one manner of living in private and another manner of living in the church before the brothers and sisters
During those forty years in the wilderness, Moses did not learn a set of methods concerning how to manage God's people
It does not mean that such a person cannot reason, but he has been broken and is no longer trusting in reasoning
It does not mean that such a person does not have ways to manage things, but he has been broken and is no longer using these methods
If we do not have the proper person, or if the person is not the right person, we cannot expect things to be done well
In addition to the problem of the person, there is also the problem of the heart, which also needs much dealing
For an elder, the problem of the heart is a very serious matter; it is an important factor in his function as an elder
All readers of the Bible admit that he is a standard and a typical character concerning administration in the Bible
We must remember, however, that King Solomon was competent at managing for two reasons: he had wisdom, and he had a large heart
Surprisingly, however, though he asked only for wisdom, God gave him, in addition to wisdom, also a large heart
Kings 429 says And God gave Solomon wisdom and understanding exceeding much and largeness of heart even as the sand that is on the seashore
A Chinese proverb speaks of the heart being as large as the capacity of the sea, but here the heart is as large as the sand on the seashore
A large person would not feel anything concerning a pair of shoes even if he is given two automobiles he will not feel anything
If your heart is large, even if you have preached very well a thousand times, let alone only once, you would not feel anything
Whenever we touch the affairs of the church and whenever we touch any spiritual matter, we have to learn to be large in our heart
The theme of the message that time touched on the point that a leading one must learn to choose and experience the cross
After the message was given, these few leading brothers all praised and thanked the Lord, and they thought their problem was solved
Your heart must be so large that whenever others offend you, you can forgive them as soon as they confess to you
If the heart is not large enough, you must prepare yourselves to make mistakes in the future; you will surely eat the fruit of regret
If you have an argument with a brother, eight or nine times out of ten it is because of the narrowness of your heart
Such a one should have a sober attitude before others; he should make the others realize that he is not pleased
Brothers, whenever you are not genuine, it means that you have a motive, and to have a motive means that you are being political
To refrain from being political yet at the same time not lose your discipline before God is not an easy thing to do
You have to admit that he had a great mind, and he was a man full of wisdom, insight, knowledge, and capability
We admit that this is true, but please remember this kind of foolishness is not bad foolishness, but good foolishness
For the elders to manage the affairs of the church, their heart must be upright, and their ways must also be upright
To ninety percent of the success of a work depends on the person, the remaining ten to twenty percent on the method and principle
From our experience, a strict analysis of character shows that it is developed from our hereditary nature plus our habits
There is one more point: no matter what kind of walk a person may have, he can never go beyond the boundary of his character
Not only does character control the whole person as the heart does, but it is a person's whole world; it is his realm, and even his sphere
Experience has shown us that in order for the elders to be a true profit to the church, their character must be carefully considered
If you are a man pulling a rickshaw or a man cleaning the street, the consideration of character is not so important
If you undertake to do something higher, such as being a physician or a professor, then the demand for character becomes higher
Today, those brothers who are elders in the church and who oversee God's house are engaged in the highest undertaking in the universe
Brothers and sisters, if you have ever tried to be thorough, you will discover how much man is not at all thorough
Sometimes the elders have caused much confusion in the church among the brothers and sisters because of a lack of thoroughness
You have not listened clearly and accurately enough to the words of the brothers; you have not understood the meaning of their words
By the time it reaches the eighth person, the words will then differ very much from the words spoken by the first one
If you bring together the brother who initiated the words with the one who relayed those words, the two will quarrel with one another
In managing things, negotiating matters, passing on words, or solving others' problems, our character needs to be thorough
When a brother or a sister speaks to you concerning the problems of others, he or she may be careless in speaking
After she is finished speaking, you may nail the matter down further: 'Did you say that he came home at 12 o'clock last night'?
It is best after you have heard a message to repeat it once to yourself, then compare it with a recording of that message
No wonder Solomon said that the sluggard buries his hand in the dish and will not so much as bring it to his mouth again
You may remember another way he described a slothful man, that he wallows on his bed like the door turns upon its hinges
From this, you can see that with the same question, diligent ones and lazy ones respond with different tones and different suggestions
If you put something into the hands of a lazy man, he will surely make an important matter look small, and a small matter to be nothing
Sometimes a brother or sister would come to advise me, 'Brother Lee, try to make the Scripture a little simpler'
Please remember that with anything in this entire world everything can be simplified to the degree that it can be finished in an hour
When a lazy man tries to solve the same problem, he does it in a lazy way; to him, everything is easy and can be done quickly
If you ask him why he writes so little, he would say that he does not have anything to say, and that what he has written is good enough
When meetings are being considered, these elders would wish that an hour-and-a-half meeting would be shortened to one hour
In the morning, before any of the employees arrive, they arrive early at the place of business and take the lead to work
If elders do not possess this kind of stable character, they will cause trouble to the church, and there will be no way to go on
After you have finished the first draft, it is best to lay it aside for a couple of days and then to read it again
At the same time when you repeatedly say that someone is not good remember that as a part of Gods creation he still has his good elements
When a problem arises in the church and it appears that you need to deal with it deal with it you must but you should not panic or be hasty
Although you may have one hundred percent trust in a brother, while you are trusting, you have to be considering at the same time
In some situations, you need to allow the other person to manifest himself a little, then put your trust in him slowly
The thing everyone fears the most in the church is fluctuation; it bothers people to see things changing back and forth
If you lay hold of this principle, you as an elder in the church will not be changing back and forth every time the wind blows
Either we do not coordinate, or if we do, we have to be like Caleb and Joshua, coordinating with each other until death
A stable person will never coordinate with anyone easily, but once he coordinates with someone, he will not change until death
Sometimes, when words of persecution, opposition, or other kinds of rumors come, you should not accept them too quickly
Things may not have been so serious at the beginning, but an unstable character makes things worse and rumors multiply
Do not tell others right away, saying, 'Brother So-and-so, who is responsible in a district, has gone to see a movie'
Not only on important issues such as marriage, schooling, and employment, but even on trivial matters, the brothers and sisters need help
The worldly people do not care much about fellowship, but we Christians are the people that care the most about fellowship
If you want to see a doctor and you can first have some fellowship with the elders, you will surely be blessed
If you want to rent a house and can first have some fellowship with the elders, you will also surely be blessed
Some brothers are really good elders; when others fellowship with them about renting a house, they can immediately ask a lot of questions
If the brother says that there is a dance hall next door, the elder would at once reply, 'How can you live next door to a dance hall?
If each local church can have more elders who are like this, it will truly be a blessing to all the brothers and sisters
Such ones are not inquisitive concerning others' affairs, but they do have a character of being concerned for others
If you are really spiritual, yet you lack these few character traits, your spirituality is still useless, and it still amounts to nothing
If your character is poor, even if you have spiritual experiences, there will be no way for them to be applied
Even if we pour out all the days of our life and our very life itself upon the church, it is worthwhile, and we are still willing to do it
Whether it is the administration of a group of people or the administration of a place, there is the need for authority
If you examine the affairs conducted among mankind, you will discover that there is hardly an issue which does not involve authority
On one hand, you give her the authority to manage the kitchen; on the other hand, you also become the authority over her
The responsible brothers have given them this authority; at the same time, they also have become their authority
There is no way to avoid this consideration of authority, whether in the school, in the office, in the factory, or in any organization
Perhaps you can do something haphazardly, but you can never administrate affairs and conduct them on the right track
How regrettable it is that Protestantism has been affected by the poison of Catholicism, which has an abnormal concept of authority
God's children are greatly affected because of the background of the abnormal concept of authority in both Catholicism and Protestantism
Unless we ignore the administration of the church altogether, it is impossible to neglect the question of authority or to despise it
We must admit that there are two sides to all truths in the Scriptures and that the two sides balance each other
Gradually due to our love for the Lord we realized more of the spiritual life and saw the light concerning the church and the Body of Christ
If only a dozen people in the meeting were to express their opinions, the discussion would go on until the end of the world
Among the people of the world, they can solve problems by councils, but in the church, we cannot do what they do
The more spiritual a person is and the more he knows the Lord, the more he is unwilling to win something for himself with his own hand
Praise the Lord, though such leading and teaching was not among us at the very beginning, yet in fact the matter of authority was there
In the end, a brother would finally stand up to speak, 'According to our present condition, we only need a pool at someone's home'
If a child of God truly wants to follow the Lord, sooner or later he will have to confront the matter of authority in his own experience
He will discover the fact that whenever he sins against authority or seeks to destroy it, it is much the same as if he had lost his own life
Not until the day when his smuggling was discovered and the government ordered his arrest was he confronted with such a thing as authority
Do not say that only ten-year-old children will find it difficult to go on when they are in trouble with their parents
That fugitive smuggler also ate, dressed, slept, and even took a bath, but only he knew how unbearable that kind of life was
If the reality of the church and the presence of the Lord are truly among us, authority will definitely be present
You can still pray, read the Word, and serve the Lord, but the taste within will not be the same; in no way will you have peace any longer
Strictly speaking, however, this is not true either, because officers can change, but the authority still remains
In such a case you will never touch authority, because there is no such thing and no such understanding in those places
Do not have the misconception that submission to authority means that you are obligated to do even things that are wrong; this is not true!
Even when you find the authority proposing something that is wrong, you can still submit, without doing the thing that is wrong
An unsubmissive person will only bring forth an unsubmissive church; he will never be able to bring forth a submissive church
Only then can we bring into the church an atmosphere and a spirit of submission, and only then will the church have a way to go on
Only those who are submissive can bring forth the spirit of submission, and only they can bring forth a submissive church
Once you try to annul it, there will be no administration of the church, and there will be no reality of the church
If you go to a group of Christians and you do not touch authority there, you have to put a big question mark on that place
Once you opposed it, you could not go on as a proper Christian any longer, nor could you go on in life, nor could you go on to serve
In some things the delegated authority may not perceive as clearly as you do, and his judgments and decisions may not be accurate
If what we are serving is merely a name or some doctrinal terms, there will not be the reality of authority among us
The Gentiles can advocate democracy or a congressional system, but in the church none of this kind of thing will work
In the church not only is there the question of submission to authority, but there is also the question of being the authority
Strictly speaking, this principle applies not only to the church, but to all representative authorities among human communities
On the one hand, there is the submission to authority, and on the other hand there is the exercise of authority
In order for a local church to be strong, there must be some submitting-to-authority brothers who act as the authority
The meaning of this, to put it in a blunt way, is simply: 'I don't mind other people's business, so don't mind my business
It was not a good sign to have no king in Israel and to have every man doing that which was right in his own eyes
If you are an elder in a local church, but you can never be an authority, you have to realize that you have utterly failed
You can find out from reading the Scriptures that Moses as a leader differs from all the other leaders of the world
He told them to take away the calf, and he ground it to powder and scattered it upon the water for the children of Israel to drink
It is a regrettable thing as well as a shameful one that in some local churches there are elders who are apparently not the authority
Once we touch authority, we will have to learn to submit to authority and to learn to represent Him as the authority
We know that the other side of submission is domination, yet God never charges the husbands to dominate over their wives
We can see that the husbands have to love their wives, and the fathers must not provoke their children to anger
We can see one thing clearly here: God appoints us to be the authority, yet He does not want us to take the way of discipline
In a family, if the parents lack love toward their children, but apply strict discipline only, surely the result will not be good
There was a brother who heard a message that wives should submit to the husband's authority and that husbands should be the head
If you genuinely love the brothers and sisters, the love itself will become the control, and it will become your authority over others
It is actually not your purpose to solve his problems, but to love him, to be concerned for him, and to bear his burden
You can understand what this means by watching a shepherd: while he rules over the sheep, he is loving his sheep with a fervent love
The food, the water to drink, the resting place, and the protection for the sheep are all prepared by the shepherd
The shepherd had a few special dogs that were small and short, with short legs, and he used them to protect his sheep
When the shepherd led the flock to the meadows, sometimes the sheep would move in a scattered way and would go astray
Although the sheep were large and the dogs were small, the dogs were very fierce, and the sheep had to turn back to the flock
The shepherd gave a command, and one of the dogs obediently ran in front of the sheep and barked fiercely at the sheep
In this way the sheep all turned back and within a short time the dogs had rounded up all the sheep that had strayed and brought them back
Sometimes a guest may say some pleasant and sweet words to a child, but the child knows that the words have nothing to do with him
In the same principle, those who are the authority should not cause others to feel that they are the authority
If the brothers and sisters cannot sense love in you, you have no position, no ground, and no standing to be an authority
Although you may be an elder, you cannot act unless there is the moving, the prompting, and the burden in your spirit
Should you leave the matter as it is, should you take up the case, or should you deal with it together with the other elders?
For this reason, in the handling of these matters, many times others do not sense the anointing and do not touch the supply of life
All the time we have to learn to live in the spirit, to touch the sense of the spirit, to act in the spirit, and to speak in the spirit
You have to put the matter through the death of the cross to test it; you have to allow the death of the cross to filter it
You may discover that your messages are something entirely of another realm; they are natural, fleshly, and even fleshy
For those things that we are not sure whether they have passed through the cross, it is better for us not to do them
No matter how much work you have invested in others, and no matter how terrible the result is, you still have hope in them
No matter how much you have worked, and despite a lack of results after repeated labor, you are still not disappointed
When he deals with the affairs of the church whatever he can accomplish he accomplishes and whatever he cannot accomplish he simply lets go
Please remember that in order to oversee the church there is the need to exercise authority, and there is the need to be the authority
Patience is to say that although someone may be incompetent in the way he cleans, still you ask him to come to clean
It is true that we are not satisfied with what you have done in the past two months, but we encourage you to come again'
After two months of observation you may judge him unqualified and may try to get rid of him through some political maneuvering
When others detect the political flavor in you, they will not be able to submit to you, and your authority is finished
It is right that elders in the church should not lightly choose brothers and sisters to take up responsibilities or to coordinate with them
Once you have invited someone to bear a responsibility or have invited someone to coordinate with you, you have to be patient
Every time that problems, difficulties, or business affairs arose, he had only one place to go, which was to bow before God
Either we do not mention church management at all, or if we do, we need to see a basic need, which is the ability of discernment
In discerning people and things, the first thing the elders have to determine is whether or not the person or the matter is spiritual
The goal of church administration is to nourish and supply every family member with life, so that each one will grow to maturity
Perhaps certain ones are still in the natural realm, because the things they say come from their natural and ethical concepts
Whenever you contact people, pick up a conversation, or encounter a certain matter, you must have this ability to discern
Gospel preaching is a good thing, but in this matter, you can touch that this man has never been crucified by the cross
Perhaps a brother has all the reasons on his side, but you can sense that his condition before God is quite improper
For him to be confronted with an unreasonable brother this time is a chastisement from God; it is a discipline of the Holy Spirit
On the other hand, you have put him in a situation where he will have to go through more severe dealings from God
You must be able to discern that such a brother may have all the reasons, but his very person is wrong before God
There is no need to speak too much; these few words will suffice; no doubt you will have given this brother some serious help
Many times when brothers and sisters come to speak to you, you cannot believe them according to their words only
It is true that they are not intentionally lying, but each of these is one person on the outside, and another inside
You can clearly discern the motive of this person and the spirit of this person, whether they are calm, tender, pure, and single
When elders encounter problems, they must also be able to discern whether the matter is according to the truth
In such cases, you have to discern whether there will be more gain or more loss, whether the gain can counterbalance the loss
We were talking about the pressing circumstances that we were under at that time; we could not stop, but there was no way to go on
If this is the way you work, you will have sold out the church of God and will have hurt the brothers and sisters
Those who are thirteen will become twenty-three in ten years, and those who are in junior high school will be Ph
At the same time, do not forget that those who are in their fifties and sixties will soon be in their sixties and seventies
Whenever you touch a person, you will immediately know if such a one has handed over his own rights before God
As soon as the question was raised, he immediately gave the answer and separated the two things clearly one from the other
If we do not have the discernment, we have no way to deal with them; the only thing we can do is let them go on
Please remember that this is the main reason the church becomes weaker and weaker, with sickness after sickness
In order for the church to be strong and have all things on the right track, the elders must have clear discernment
Of course, in such a thing as the management of the church, you can never make anything absolute; everything is relative
If there is no coordination among the elders in a local church regardless how strong an individual elder may be his strength is of no avail
If an individual handles everything, bears everything, and deals with everything, it is as if he is but singing solos
If a church does not have any elders, not only will there be no building, but it will be extremely difficult to have a church at all
The building and the coordination in the church are entirely in the hands of its elders, and they are dependent upon them
If there is no coordination and building with the elders, there will be no way to talk about the coordination and building up of the church
It is not enough for an elder to be capable on one point, in one area, or with one part only; elders have to be capable in everything
There are many things we should solve, take the lead in, or help with, but we do not have the way to do what we should do
For this reason, we have to see that the elders must be coordinated, because no one person is capable in everything
Any brother or sister can only have that little bit of gift that he or she has; he or she cannot be capable in everything
Although Paul was a multi-talented apostle, and although he was gifted in many ways, he was very weak in areas other than his specialties
When the elders in the church see the need to be capable in everything, immediately they will realize the need of coordination
If we see that members of the same body do not have the same function, we will realize that the gifts of the elders are also different
Many times, those who are fervent in heart are blind in their eyes, and those who are sharp in their eyes are cold in their hearts
Those with sharp eyes need others to be their heart, and those who are too fervent in heart need others to be their eyes
If you do, you will probably become a knife or a gun to others; you are too sharp, and therefore you must be coordinated with someone else
Perhaps a message needs to be given, but you cannot give the message because you do not have the gift of speaking
You can then present your feeling to the elders in fellowship and accept the coordination of those elders who are the speaking ones
When they speak, you will feel that it is not they alone who are speaking, but the speaking of the elders in coordination
Not only does it have to have those who are capable in everything; it must have those who are gifted in all areas
When the light goes out, or the fuse is burned out, and it is not convenient to find an electrician, they have to be electricians themselves
In a family, you cannot depend on craftsmen for everything; the parents have to learn to do everything on a daily basis
The elders cannot depend all the time on the so-called apostles and the specially gifted workers to do everything
They are having a little work, a little bit of ministry of the Word, and a little bit of usefulness under the framework of an administration
Of course, this contact is not a matter of fostering natural relationships, but a matter of spiritual fellowship
No matter what kind of problem there is, as soon as these brothers go and fellowship, the problem is swallowed up by life
We should feel it to be a very sweet thing that when our brother stands up to say a few words, everyone is enlightened
Under normal conditions, the gifts you can find in the brothers and sisters should also be found among the elders
Some represent service, some, administration, some, the ministry of the Word, some, the leading in life, and some, teaching
It means that your portion is here, my portion is here, and his portion is also here; everyone's portion is here
What the condition of some seems to say is that unless a certain one puts out all his portions, he will not put out anything
The real coordination means that your portion is here, my portion is here, and everyone else's portion is here
No one would say that if he does it, he does it all, and if he does not do it, he will not have anything to do with it
We cannot say that such-and-such a responsibility rests on one elder and that such-and-such a hall rests on another elder
When one elder makes some arrangements in one meeting hall, it should be the whole eldership making the arrangement there
Once we touch the matter of coordination, we will realize it is not something two-dimensional, but something three- dimensional
On the other hand, if there is autocracy within the eldership, and there is only one man giving commands, we also have a worldly situation
In order to have the coordination, all the elders have to accept authority and to accept the ordering in the authority
If they do this, the result will not be democracy or autocracy, but will be something that issues from the Holy Spirit
The situation in Acts 15 was neither democratic nor autocratic; it was a situation like the one we have just described
Everyone opened himself in the Holy Spirit and fellowshipped what he had encountered, what he felt, and what he had observed
In the end, James, who was the authority at that time, after hearing all the words, stood up and stated the way they should proceed
The elders should know the place the Lord has put them in, whether as the authority, or as those under authority
The chairman of the board is no higher than other directors; he merely possesses a little power in convening others and in representing them
The coordination of the elders not only requires some to submit to authority, but some to be the authority as well
In the end, when no conclusion can be reached, he will say, 'Since everybody feels this way, shall we decide the matter this way'?
Every time we discuss any matter, we should learn not to have any arguments, nor to ignore any inward feelings
Everyone knows in what order he is placed, and everyone accepts the authority without insisting on anything or resisting any responsibility
The coordination of the elders in the church requires that everyone be free from the self, fear God, and live in the Holy Spirit
All of the elders should fellowship together according to their inner sense and should arrive at an accurate feeling based on this
A person cannot assert himself, protect himself, and preserve himself, and at the same time coordinate with others properly
You may be the best one in preaching, in administration, or in visitation, but even in your specialty, you have to learn to be broken
Others may feel that without their preaching, there is no way for those who can only administrate and visit to go on
On the positive side, a person who is not open cannot supply others with grace and life, and cannot receive others' supply
It is not easy for those who are positive to be humble, and it is not easy for those who are humble to be positive
If you are one who cares for the spiritual direction among the brothers and sisters, you should be balanced a little by the gospel
Within you it is not a question of being too busy but a question of unwillingness to accept the suggestion you are merely taking an excuse
Resurrection life is derived from authority, and the authority of the elders comes from the harmony among them
If the elders are in harmony, and if they have the authority and the life, whatever they do will bear good results
May the Lord be merciful to us, and grant us to learn this serious lesson, so that the Lord's blessing can be poured out among us
Perhaps you have never realized that the knowledge of boundaries would have much to do with the administration of the elders
When we come to Leviticus and Deuteronomy, in God's commandments to His people there are many references to the question of boundaries
In the New Testament, and especially in the Epistles, you can also find many teachings related to the matter of boundaries
What we are doing here is only to bring out an issue, which is that in God's work He has set up all kinds of boundaries
If such were not the case, there would be no need for administration, and there would be no need for men to take up responsibility
All the services must be in proper order and according to the proper principles, and everything should have its definite boundary
In order for us to administrate the church, we must have a very clear knowledge concerning the matter of boundaries
Otherwise, sometimes the elders will be doing the work of the deacons, and the deacons will be doing the work of the elders
If the elders have to be involved directly with this kind of arranging work, the elders have done the work of the deacons
They must only do the things that are within their boundaries and must let the deacons do the things that should be done by the deacons
When they do this once, twice, three times, four times, on and on, it becomes impossible for the deacons to be perfected
Not only does this require the responsible ones in the districts to take up the leadership, but it requires the attention of the elders
The elders should always take care of the big, high, important, developing, advancing, promoting, and building works within the church
As to the other affairs, they should only lay down some general guidelines and should hand them over to the deacons
It is true that we all are God's children; the elders are God's children together with all the other brothers and sisters
From the standpoint of family responsibility, the oldest brother and sister share in the responsibility of the family
They can talk among themselves, but they should set up a boundary between them and their younger brothers and sisters
One day after coming home from an elders meeting upon entering his door his wife may ask him What was discussed at the elders meeting today
Before eight o'clock at night, when the son goes to the tutorial class, all the brothers in the son's class also know about it
Although they may all have good intentions in their hearts, they will stir up a storm and will make the situation a mess
Otherwise, within a year, many rumors will abound in the church, and these rumors will all come from the elders
You cannot say that because a matter is announced in the prayer meeting it can therefore be released in the preaching meeting as well
The elders must study whether the matter has become open yet, and whether they can visit the couple in a proper way
If an elder indeed has a heart to shepherd God's flock and to build up Christ's Body, he will see the importance of timing
Any elder who cannot draw a boundary in the matter of timing will most certainly be unable to manage the church
Other than this, all the elders have to consider all the boundaries and must draw a clear line across all the boundaries
Only in this way can the elders feel free to discuss the matters concerning the brothers and sisters in the elders' meeting
There are other matters which the elders must look into, because they are within the jurisdiction of the elders
If a person becomes an elder at the age of forty or fifty, he will at least be an elder for another ten to twenty years
Please remember that the clearer you draw the boundary line, the more solid the church's unity and coordination will be
Some other matters may come to the elders, and they can draw a clear line immediately, saying, 'This is the sisters' business
Only when you clearly draw the line in business affairs can you know what things are within the boundary of the elders
You will be able to tell whether a matter has contradicted the truth or whether it is within the boundary of the truth
True, all the local churches are in the Lord, and they should all fellowship with one another and do their best to help each other
On the one hand, the church encompasses everything; all the workers, including the apostle Paul, are in the church
All the work of outreach is absolutely and one hundred percent in the hand of the worker and not in the hand of any local church
Only then can we say such a matter belongs to the church and such a matter belongs to the workers and the work
Whether or not he has a gift to exercise here, and whether or not he has the burden or the leading to work here is a different issue
It is as if they are saying, 'You are older, and you know how to take the lead; please take up the responsibility of leadership'
He can never take over the responsibility of the church in the position of an apostle and in the qualification of a worker
The elders among us who bear responsibility in the various local churches must say that the difference is too great
We can only acknowledge that within those denominations there are our brothers and sisters, and people who are part of the church
Either we do not talk about the administration of the church, or we must have a very clear boundary in this matter
The ones responsible for administration in the church do not necessarily need to use all the truth, but they need to know all the truth
It is like the pursuit of knowledge: some knowledge is for application, whereas other is to be used at some later date
Man is of course not simple, for he is composed of skin and flesh on the outside, and muscle and bone on the inside
Although they will use only certain aspects of the truth, and will not use much of the other aspects, they should still keep them there
When you can really classify the truth, you will truly know whether or not a message is helpful to the brothers and sisters
If the elders cannot draw the line on the truth, the church will be put in jeopardy in receiving the supply of the ministry of the Word
If you can draw the boundary and classify this way, you will be able to tell right away if the message is dangerous or helpful
The reason is that the responsible ones do not know how to draw the boundary in the truth and do not classify the truth
Between the brothers and sisters, they meet in the meetings, in the service, in the gospel preaching, and in their witnessing work
For this reason, in their administration of the church, the elders must draw a boundary between the brothers and the sisters
In Christianity there are some zealous ones with little spiritual experience who suggest: 'We are all brothers and sisters in the Lord
In some places, it is the elders who are reaping and eating their own fruit because the elders themselves have led the church this way
In some places some teach that we are all spiritual and that to talk about the boundary between male and female is to have defiled thoughts
The elders in every locality must set up a firm boundary between the brothers and the sisters; they should never remove it
In 1 Corinthian 11 and 14, it says that in the church we must still distinguish the boundary between male and female
There is no distinction between male and female in Christ, but there is still the distinction between male and female in the church
Dear brothers and sisters, you cannot deny that David loved the Lord more than you do and was more spiritual than you are
If the elders know how to draw these boundaries, their administration of the church will be stable, clear, and proper
If we know the principle of God's work, we will see clearly that a basic principle for God to bestow grace is fellowship
Whether it is God's salvation of man, or His edification or raising up of a man, He does it in the principle of fellowship
If you read the history of the church or the autobiographies of spiritual men, you can find that the same is true in God's calling of men
On the one hand, you can say that God calls men directly, but within this calling there is always the element of fellowship
Even Gods edification His raising up and equipping of a person and His giving of gifts to us are bound up with the principle of fellowship
The apostle Paul told Timothy in his letter that the gift Timothy received came from the laying on of hands of Paul and the elders
If the elders want to bring the management of a church up to a strong shining fresh and rich condition they must be persons of fellowship
When there is no balance, you will be biased, and you will be stuck in minor matters, or will go to an extreme
If the elders will take every opportunity to fellowship, they will surely be nourishing, rich, shining, fresh, and balanced
In speaking about the elders' administration, we cannot talk about the coordination of the elders without talking about their fellowship
During these years, the brothers in all the places have realized the need of coordination for the management of the elders
Not only in spiritual matters, but in the worldly matters also, there is the need for fellowship with those outside your own sphere
If you try to close your door and be a reclusive person in the end you will have only a very narrow view you will know only a limited amount
Others may have advanced in many ways already, but you are still dragging the oxcart and are still quite contented
Today, in politics, military developments, finance, science, and many forms of literature, there is the need for exchanges
You do not necessarily only receive from others; in receiving something from others, you also supply others as well
They should bring all the responsibilities, all the matters, and all the problems before God and fellowship with God about them
When the elders serve together, they must fellowship to such an extent that not one brother is holding back anything from the other elders
Where the elders hold back a little, reserve a little, or close themselves up a little, there the wisdom and light are lacking a little
They must be mingled together in water until the five lumps become one lump, and they become indistinguishable one from another
In order for the elders to have the light, the guidance, the wisdom, and the dealings, they must be together daily
Surely the burden will come, and the guidance, the light, the wisdom, the power, and the authority will all come
If you have not fellowshipped this way, and you propose, 'Well, we have not preached the gospel for three years already
While you are making the proposal, you are pouring cold water on the others; there is no way for you to warm the others up
, for six or seven hours, over ten of the elders and leading brothers and sisters would always come together for fellowship
They might mention that a certain sister had much progress and much function, that she might even have some gifts
It was through that kind of fellowship that the church in that place became alive, and the responsible ones became transparent
Each one will see his unfaithfulness towards the church, and his shortage in learning the lessons before the Lord
From that day on, they become an opened person; they become wise, and everything presented to them is judged in a wise way
Never think that if the elders do not watch over the arrangement of chairs and the hall, they will have nothing more to do
If you do not give it fertilizer and do not water it, it can still barely survive, but the appearance will be different
The two of them should coordinate together to fellowship with the responsible ones of the thirty-five districts on administration alone
Not only should the elders fellowship with the serving ones; they have to find out what the result of this fellowship is
Look, those plants that should have grown up have not grown up, and those that should have blossomed have not blossomed
The elders can come once a week to discuss a little, make some decisions, and then make some announcements in the prayer meetings
If you want to be another kind of elder, you will see that every day there are burdens, and every day you can be so busy
In order to receive guidance the elders have to fellowship with God with each other with the serving ones and with all of the saints as well
Only after the fellowship in these few aspects becomes thorough should they come together to seek God's guidance
At such times, you can write to the brothers in other localities and tell them that there is such a problem and ask for their feeling
Sometimes you can fellowship a little in the matter of burden for prayer; you can tell the others the items that need prayer
Some have a wrong concept about The News of the Churches; they think that to write something there is to make a display of themselves
Whether or not you are making a display of yourself one thing is certain you need others fellowship and others need to fellowship with you
The church is the Body of Christ, and all of us have to learn not to lose any blessing from any part of the Body
It is an extremely valuable thing for you to try your best to fellowship with the churches in the other localities
Although the churches in the localities are independent before the Lord, they have to maintain continual fellowship with the workers
Those who have learned the lessons lead the church on in one way, and those who have not learned the lessons lead the church in another way
The administration of the elders is the overseeing, the management, the building, and the leadership of the elders
The elders' oversight, administration, building, leadership, and management of the church all refer to the same thing
Regardless where the church appears on this earth, it has only one goal: to be a testimony of Christ and to express Christ among humanity
The reason God establishes churches in all the localities is that Christ may be expressed by the saints in these localities
The elders must realize that our meeting here does not represent any particular truth or any Christianity movement
Among all the organizations in Christianity, some represent the truth of baptism; they label themselves the Baptist Church
If the testimony of the church is to be strengthened and built up, there must be the preaching of the gospel to bring in new souls
Through the building up of these three areas of service, God's glorious goal is achieved, and Christ is expressed
All the elders' administration and oversight of the church revolve around this one goal and three areas of service
The oversight and administration of the elders are nothing other than the gospel, the perfecting, and the service
We have to realize that if the Lord is to gain the goal in the church in this age, the saints must be built up together
The word 'organization' is not found in the Bible, but the word 'coordination' is found in the Chinese Version of the Bible
The elders have to consider seriously everyone who wants to come into the coordination to see if each one has life
It seems that salvation has come to mean only the forgiveness of sins, the deliverance from perdition, and a passage to heaven after you die
To have life is the same as what Christianity calls being saved, and to be living is equivalent to what Christianity calls being revived
The difficult part is to make the brothers and sisters who have life but who are not living to become quite living
In between are the half-dead ones, and the ones who have been dead for a long time and are about to come alive
Sometimes we could not even help them ourselves, and we would ask another brother who had learned the lesson to help them
Once you have enlivened the class-eleven father and the class-ten mother, the daughter will more or less come along
Most people will have become living, and the remaining few, even if they are not living, will be made alive together
The brothers and sisters became alive one after the other, and there was no way for the church to fail to be revived
Some who are sitting here can testify the kind of stirring, visitation, and fellowship there was in those days!
By the end of 1942, there were at least eighty or ninety brothers and sisters out of one hundred who were very living
You should find it unbearable to see so many brothers and sisters there not being living, yet you are still serving as an elder in peace
Not only do you have to call together the workers, but you must have the blueprints, the places to work, and the arrangements for the work
You have to consider the kind of people to send to a certain place and the kind of arrangements that need to be made
You have to consider what needs to be done first, what kind of arrangements you need to make, and what kind of people you should bring in
Please observe that although there are many brothers and sisters in all the local churches the manifestation of the gifts is very scarce!
At most, there is some arrangement as to the time of meeting and some announcement as to the nature of the meeting
You have to help them to go over the hurdle and to know the meaning of Christ as life, so that they can enjoy the riches of Christ
Acts portrays to us a resurrected and ascended Head, whereas Colossians shows us how rich the Head is and how He is everything
As far as their husbands' opposition is concerned, they can only stay at home and cannot come to the meeting or to the services
If you do not manage the home, but go to the movies and the games every day, and leave the children at home, you can do this
In order for the coordination of the church to be strong and powerful and to be advancing all the time, you cannot neglect these matters
Problems such as these that have to do with the church and with the family are many, and you will encounter them all
They have come into an argument with the elders, or they have come into an argument with another serving brother
If you cannot help the brothers and sisters, up to a certain time they will face problems, and all your previous efforts will be lost
They should not merely receive a general burden, but a burden to be a responsible one in a district, or to be an elder
Of course, this cannot be done in three or five words; there is the need for a long period of fellowshipping with the Lord
On the one hand, you need to contact them many times, fellowship with them much, touch their hearts, and know their feelings before the Lord
On the other hand, you have to pray for them always, to touch the Lord's feeling and the Lord's will regarding them
You still have to spend time with this one, to help him or her to have some dealings before the Lord, to grow, and to be perfected
When he first began to serve, he was unconcerned; he was saved, and he had a little love and was a little revived
When he was assigned to the ushering service, or the cleaning service, or the business-office service, he merely did the job
After an elder has helped a brother or sister to receive a burden, immediately he should take them along to learn to do the work
After he understands what you are doing, you have to ask him to do the same, while you are by his side to correct him
The seed needs to be improved, the method of planting needs to be improved, and the harvesting needs to be improved
It is all right if you have a humble heart, and you want to assume a learning position and to listen to an academic lecture
Even if you were to invite the apostle Paul, the apostle Peter, Apollos, and all the others to come to speak, you would still be you
If you do not do these things, even if you were to listen to a thousand messages or ten thousand messages, they would still do you no good
Gradually, you will see that the local church where you are, or the district where you are will have some improvement
Brothers, do not expect an angel to come to your place to have a week's conference, and the church where you are will be revived
As long as a brother has nothing to eat, and as long as you have a meal, you should take half of it, and share the other half with him
If you are willing to do this, you will see the blessing coming; it is useless for you to invite others to preach
Not only do the elders have to exercise patience to help the brothers and sisters learn, they have to help them to become proper vessels
How glorious a thing it would be if among those whom you lead, some would become a Peter, a Paul, or a greatly-used vessel
The Gospel Book Room, which has a history of over forty years among us, was the responsibility of Brother Nee alone during 1933 and 1934
We must clear the ground for them to have the opportunity to be perfected, so as to prepare them for future use
Up to this point, you have to help the brothers and sisters to practically, seriously, and deeply learn the lesson of the cross
The things to deal with are the carnality the flesh the ambition the haughty aspirations and the desire to accomplish something for oneself
The carnality, the flesh, the ambition, the aspirations, the self-interest, and the desire to be great must all be terminated on the cross
Consider this pride, this striving for self-interest, this desire to be great, to be superficial, and to be famous
As far as you are concerned, you may have the mercy to supply others the grace despite whether they are great or small
The problems before men are the carnality the flesh the ambition and aspiration the desire for achievement fame and greatness in the church
Even if you have solved these problems, you have to remember that the natural strength in serving the Lord must be broken by Him
To accept coordination is nothing other than to accept the restriction of those who are fellow members and who are serving together with you
Only when we reach this stage can our carnality, opinions, misunderstandings, and the works of the enemy lose their effectiveness
Towards all the things that are not of God, this is a body that is immune; no bacteria can have any effect on it
By this time they will come into a realm they will touch something and will realize the glorious fact that the church is the Body of Christ
They are like the kernel within an almond seed, where the life is contained and where the center of life exists
Where there is real management, there is real coordination, and where there is real coordination, there is real building
Strictly speaking, the one item of solving others' problems will alone require much practice for many sessions
If the elders cannot open a way for others in these matters, and cannot solve their problems, they are short in management
When a problem arises with the children, you have to open up a way for them, and you have to help them solve the problem
If you really know the way to manage a church and will really take up such a burden, the door to your house will be daily jammed with people
If you are not unfaithful to your ministry, you will find that every day there will be brothers and sisters coming to you
Gradually, we increased from fifty to one hundred, and one hundred to two hundred, and the number became larger and larger
At that time we could not find any reference book on the subject of church management, nor could we find a place to learn from
The sixteen points mentioned earlier discuss how we bring the brothers and sisters step by step into the coordination
They must help the saints to be active in the gospel, to strive in the gospel, and to bear fruit in the gospel
You can see that some are effective in preaching the gospel, whereas others are not effective in preaching the gospel
The elders have to gather the brothers and sisters together to have some prayers of the church, asking for the zeal of the gospel
It is not right to go to a local church and find the brothers and sisters interested in spiritual things, yet cold towards the gospel
No matter how big a church is and how mature and deep in experience it is, it must have the fire of the gospel
If a housewife neglects the house throughout the month, but eats, sleeps, and plays day after day, the house will still survive
If she wants to manage the house well, there will be no end to her work, from morning to evening, and from the first day until the last day
You have been meeting in that place for two or three years already, yet there are still only thirty or more brothers and sisters
You have to pray, to call on the Lord to give the church the zeal of the gospel, and to have every brother and sister burning within
The elders have to point out that with some, the target should be their family, while with others, the target should be their schools
If a local church is properly managed, built up, and coordinated, most of the brothers and sisters should be able to preach the gospel
They should know when to argue, when to advance, when to debate even if the others do not want to debate, and when not to argue
They should know when to use the words of the Bible, when to ask them to confess their sins, and when to ask them to pray
It is sad that, when some come to the church for a Bible, the responsible ones would say: 'Go to the Bible Society for your Bible'!
Other than Bibles, there are other tools, such as tracts, booklets, gospel stories, testimonies, and gospel posters
The gospel is not merely to bring forgiveness of sins to people, but to bring them the Lord's life and to enliven them within
After the elders have trained the brothers and sisters in all the points we have covered, they should begin some gospel activities
Other than the above the gospel message the gospel hymns the gospel counselling and the gospel visitation are four important items as well
If many brothers and sisters in your church have never consecrated themselves, this proves that your church has never been managed
Every church that has been helped and perfected will have most of its brothers and sisters consecrated before God
The consecration of the brothers and sisters must not only be genuine, but must be something living in the Holy Spirit
The elders should consider how much work there is to do in bringing the brothers and sisters genuinely through the gate of consecration!
Suppose you invite one person to come this week, another person to come next week, and a third person to come the third week
After consecration, we have to lead these ones to fellowship with the Lord, to learn to pray, and to study the Word
You can go to the nearby churches and ask one or two brothers who are especially good at helping others to study the Word to come and help
For the elders to manage the church, they have to know at what stage the brothers and sisters are and what kind of things they lack
If everyone is looking to the heavens for food, and no one tills, sows, or irrigates, there will surely be no harvest at all
Dear brothers and sisters, you should pray more, look to the Lord more, deal with Him more, and be more diligent
They need to help the brothers and sisters to see that their old man has already been crucified and terminated
Their carnality, their flesh, temper, disposition, ambition, and aspirations have been terminated on the cross
While you are helping one brother, you may feel that he is good in the gospel, and he is most suitable to take the platform
You have to help him in this area, developing him, encouraging him, perfecting him, and giving him the opportunity to practice
When we spoke about coordination, we emphasized the need for the brothers and sisters to be brought into the coordination
You, as one who manages the church, in bringing him into the coordination, should channel him into the direction of perfecting
At most they will need to make some announcements of the regular meetings and to make some decisions regarding the direction of the meetings
The apostle Peter also said: 'And when the Chief Shepherd is manifested, you will receive the unfading crown of glory'
On the side of perfecting, the fifth point on which the elders have to render help is the knowledge of resurrection
The reason man is brought into God, mingled with Him, takes Him as life, and lives in resurrection, is for the purpose of having the church
In eternity, God had a plan, and this plan is to produce in the universe the church, which comes out of the created beings, the human race
Just as the nature of a table is wood and the nature of a microphone is metal, so the nature of the church is Christ
If he brings you some clothes and asks you what is their nature, you would answer that they are made of cloth or of silk
In simple terms, it has two functions: on the one hand, it is the Body of Christ, for the expression of Christ
On the other hand, it is the habitation of God, for God to have a dwelling place in the universe, and particularly on earth
In the Bible, we can find the church in Jerusalem, the church in Antioch, the church in Ephesus, and the church in Corinth
If the brothers and sisters know this, wherever they go, they will be able to discern under what kind of condition a place is a church
We have to know a general sketch of what the church has passed through, and we have to know the present condition of the church
We have to let them know what the different denominations, sects, and groups are, and what the church is that God is after on earth
You yourselves have to know these things, and you have to help the brothers and sisters to know these things also
Knowing the church emphasizes the organizational aspect, whereas knowing the Body emphasizes the spiritual aspect
Suppose your eyes say that they do not like to be in the body, in the same way that children say that they do not like to stay at home
Not only do we work and serve with the brothers and sisters in coordination, but we live in coordination as well
Sometimes we spend a considerable amount of money to buy some flowers, only to arrange them in a disorderly way
Some time ago, some brothers in Southeast Asia heard that we baptized a few hundred people at a time in Taipei
They said that for them to baptize ten or twenty people alone would throw the meeting hall into disorder and their people into chaos
If a matter as small as a baptism is so disorganized in administration, how can the church be clear in the big matters?
Thank God that He has given you a portion of grace and a commission, but you should not be satisfied with what you have
We have previously spoken of three directions in the management of the church into which the elders are to lead the brothers and sisters
If the service is somewhat living, strong, regulated, and effective, you can be sure that the management in this church is quite strong
In helping the brothers and sisters, and in managing the church, we have to keep these three directions as our goal all the time
Of the three directions mentioned, the gospel is the easiest, the perfecting is deeper, and the service is the most troublesome
It means that it is not enough just to have the soul; we must have the body to match it before the person can be strong
The three books of 1 and 2 Timothy and Titus belong to another category; they specialize in the organization of the church
They tell us who are qualified to be elders and deacons, how to handle matters, and how to behave in the house of God
Unfortunately, when Bible readers talk about the church, they always refer to the spiritual aspect and neglect the management of the church
No matter how many spiritual messages there are, if the management is lacking, the church cannot help but be weak
Brothers, thirty years ago, we all had the inaccurate concept that once we become spiritual, all of our problems will be solved
From the book of Romans to 2 Thessalonians, it is a matter of life, and from 1 Timothy to Titus, it is a matter of management
No matter how intellectual you are or how much education you have, when the body is dead, everything is finished
In the same principle, the church has its need on the spiritual side, and it also has its needs on the management side
In the direction of service, the first thing we have to do is to teach the brothers and sisters the way the church is established
Some brothers and sisters have been saved for many years, yet they still do not know by what way the church is produced
The Bible shows us that when the apostles go out to preach the gospel and some are saved, the apostle will establish a church
As soon as a church is established, immediately it should have meetings, gospel activities, and visitation of the saints
If a church is raised up in a certain place and the situation there is normal, the Holy Spirit will certainly be there
If we recognize that the church is there, then we ought to also believe and to solemnly recognize that the Holy Spirit is among them
Ancient politics was a matter of autocratic, sovereign kingship, whereas contemporary politics tends toward democracy
The measure and intensity of the presence of the Holy Spirit, and whether it is manifested or not, altogether depend on the degree of life
Peter had the highest attainment in life among the brothers; however, in Galatians 2 we see Peter with some weakness
In Acts 15, the apostles and the elders in Jerusalem were discussing the problem of the Gentiles keeping the law
Barnabas and Paul stood up again to describe the miracles and wonders God had done through them among the Gentiles
He allowed Peter to speak, and he let Barnabas and Paul testify; in the end, he stood up and said, 'Men, brothers, listen to me'
Among them, James' condition before God was the most proper; hence, the leading authority and the final deciding authority fell on James
When a local church is raised up, naturally those who have a higher degree of life will become the leading ones there
In the Bible there is no autocracy; there is only the meeting together of the experienced, spiritual, and elderly ones
You as a leading one should listen, on the one hand, and look to the Holy Spirit, on the other hand, to give you the discernment
You need to cause the brothers and sisters to realize that here is the authority of the Holy Spirit, and that this is not a democracy
It is everyone expressing the feeling of the Holy Spirit before the Lord, and the authority of the Holy Spirit making the decision
If the brothers would hold fast this principle, under such circumstances you will see the evident presence of the Holy Spirit
