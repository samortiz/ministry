   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>FURTHER FELLOWSHIP REGARDING THE ELDERSHIP</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Question: Can an elder retire?</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Answer: The Bible does not say that an elder can retire.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Just as a husband and father cannot retire, neither can an elder retire, for these are all matters of life.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Furthermore, our real usefulness begins at eighty.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Moses began to be used by the Lord at eighty Exo 7:7 .</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>However, because there are always several elders in a church, the older ones do not need to overly exert themselves, for the younger elders can bear the practical burdens.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The older ones do not have much physical strength or energy, but their experiences are valuable and greatly needed.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Brother Watchman Nee once told me that it is a great loss when the old saints pass away.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>He said that the recovery needs many saints to live beyond eighty years of age, because we need their testimonies concerning their experiences in life.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>We need to take care of our physical health so that we can live longer for the sake of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>It is dangerous for an elder to leave the eldership.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>We should either enter the eldership for life or not enter at all.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>We must look to the Lord to make us willing to continue serving in this function at any cost.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The thought of retirement is somewhat natural.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The older we are, the more positive we should be about our service.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>This does not mean that we should do more, but it is a great help in any situation if we will speak of our experiences.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>There are several overseers in each church, and the older and younger ones have different portions.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Nothing can replace the lessons learned from experiences.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>These are the riches of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Question: What is the best way to carry out an apprenticeship for the eldership?</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Answer: We must be careful not to do this quickly.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>We need to do all such things in the church continually but gradually.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>When brothers are first brought into the meetings of the elders as apprentices, they should only observe to learn.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Occasionally, the elders may ask them to do something.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Learning in an apprenticeship does not come mainly from teaching and instruction but from observation.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Question: How do we cultivate the proper aspiration for the overseership?</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Answer: First Timothy 3:1 indicates that it is good to aspire to the overseership.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>This means that for the future of a local church several brothers in the church should have the aspiration that one day they could bear the responsibility of the eldership.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>This aspiration is different from ambition.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Although we need to cultivate the proper aspiration for the eldership, we must condemn ambition.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The older elders should bear the responsibility to pray, Lord, raise up more proper, useful brothers to bear the burden of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Some brothers may be promising and good for the eldership yet lack the aspiration.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Therefore, we need to pray for them.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The proper aspiration comes mainly from others prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Question: In considering a brother for the eldership, should we take into account his reputation before he was saved?</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Answer: Whether we did something wrong before we were saved or after, we should make a thorough restitution with all those involved in our life.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>If a man steals before he is saved, once he becomes a believer, he must make restitution to those from whom he stole.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>If he does not make restitution and eventually becomes a leading one in the church, others will reproach him.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>We need to distinguish slander from reproach.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Reproach means that we are criticized because of some sin, error, mistake, or wrongdoing.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Slander is when we are falsely accused or ill spoken of simply because we have become a believer or come into the church.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>If we are criticized for wrongdoings that we have not dealt with, this is reproach, but if we are slandered for following the Lord, this is a good testimony.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Those who slander us know deep in their conscience that we are taking the right way.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Even if others revile us when we make restitution to them for past offenses, their conscience will bear testimony to them that we are right.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Question: How can an elder who is a father care for his family and also be always available to help the saints?</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>To be an overseer is difficult.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The most helpful thing for children is for their parents to spend time with them.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>To sit with them, observe what they are doing, and instruct them is the best encouragement to them and prevents them from being idle.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Sometimes we need to have free talks with them about wide-ranging subjects.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>If we do, they will be happy.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>All children like to learn.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>The need with our children is endless.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>The more time we spend with them, the better.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>We should allow them to join in our daily activities, and we should join them in their activities.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>However, an elder also needs to be available to help the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>In order to care for both these needs, we must learn to fellowship with the Lord and follow His leading.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>What I have shared concerning the eldership are principles.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>We need the Lord s leading for specific situations.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>CONCLUDING WORD</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>We need to be impressed that the eldership is altogether a matter of life.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>It depends not on what we do but on what we are and how we live.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>We can retire from doing something, but we cannot retire from what we are.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>The care for the churches is not a matter of business but a matter of life.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Therefore, those who aspire to the eldership need to learn mainly not how to do things but the way to live a life of a high standard.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>The requirements in 1 Timothy 3:1-7 are altogether related to what we are and to the way we live.</S>
