   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER FOUR REVELATION, VISION, AND APPLICATION Scripture Reading: Matt 16:13-19, 17:1-9, 24-27</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>For a considerable number of years we have been abiding mostly in the Epistles in Ephesians, Romans, and all the other letters written mostly by the Apostle Paul.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Sometimes we have been in the Gospel of John.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>How we have loved all these books!</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>But this year the Lord has opened the book of Matthew to us and we have received something new.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>I myself love the book of Matthew and cannot keep away from it.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Oh, I do have a burden to recommend Matthew to you!</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>We all must love Matthew.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>We have seen how Matthew gives a record of Jesus as the Bridegroom with all the other items the new cloth, which was good for making the new garment, the new wine, and the new wineskin.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>We cannot find all these precious items in the other books of the New Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>I know you love the Gospel of John, but you cannot find the new garment, the new wine, or the new wineskin in John.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Formerly, I loved John very much, perhaps more than you, but today I find something more in Matthew.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>John is rich, but John is not all-inclusive.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>I tell you, Matthew is all-inclusive.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Matthew is so precious.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>THREE STEPS OF ONE EXPERIENCE</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Now we come to chapter 16 and 17 of Matthew, and from these two chapters we will gather three portions: chapter 16:13-19, chapter 17:1-9, and chapter 17:24-27.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>If you pray-read these three portions carefully, you will see that they give you three steps of one experience.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>With all spiritual things, if we would experience them, we need these three steps.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>What are they?</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>In the first portion, chapter 16:13-19, the Lord used the word "revealed."</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>"Flesh and blood hath not revealed it unto thee, but my Father who is in heaven" v. 17 . This means that the first step to experience anything of the Lord is revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Revelation is more than knowledge, more than understanding; it is the realization of something deeply within.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>In this first portion of these two chapters Peter and the other disciples obtained a revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Then, in the second portion, in chapter 17:1-9, the Lord Jesus mentioned the word "vision."</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>"Jesus commanded them, saying, tell the vision to no man, until the Son of man be risen from the dead" v. 9 . The second step, therefore, of experiencing something of Christ is further and deeper than revelation it is vision.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>What is the difference between revelation and vision?</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The word "revelation" in the Greek means an unveiling.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>When a veil is taken away from any object, you can see it this is revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Nevertheless, I may take away the veil, but there may be no light.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Furthermore, I may take away the veil, but you may be born blind.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>So we need the revelation, the unveiling, and we also need the light plus the sight.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Then we have the vision.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>We not only need a revelation, but also a vision.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>My job in all these messages is to take away the veils.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>One by one I am taking them away.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>In the last message I took away a veil; in this message I will take away another veil.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>I want you to see this wonderful Person; so I am taking away veil after veil.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>You may think that as long as the veils are removed, surely you will be able to see.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>But, I tell you, I can only take away the veils, I cannot shine upon you.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Light comes from the heavens; light comes from the very God who commands the light to shine in darkness.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>I cannot do that; I am not God.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Receive the mercy of God, however, and the light will immediately shine upon you.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Yet you still need something more you need sight.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>You need not only the light, but also the sight.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>These three added together give you the vision the unveiling, the light, and the sight.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The first step to experience Christ is to obtain revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Then following this, we need vision.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Yet, even after we have taken the second step, we do not have the real experience.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Therefore, we must look into the third portion of these two chapters, in chapter 17:24-27, where we see the application.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>The third step is the application.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>After the revelation, we need the vision, and following the vision, we need the application.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>We must realize something. and even more we must see that very thing, but how to apply it is yet another matter.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>I cannot help you with this.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>All I can do, I say again, is take away the veils; God, then, by His mercy can shine from the heavens and give you sight to receive the vision; then after the vision. you need to apply it.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>You need to know how to apply what you have seen.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Peter firstly obtained the revelation and secondly the vision, but thirdly he learned the application in such a hard way that it could never be forgotten.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>The harder it is to learn, you know, the harder it is to forget.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Peter could never forget this lesson.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Hallelujah, the Lord got through and Peter got through also!</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>I do not mean that Peter was able to get through, but that the Lord was able to bring him through.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>The Lord brought him through the revelation, through the vision, and through the application.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Let us look into all these three steps.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>What was the revelation?</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>What was the vision?</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>And what was the application Peter learned?</S>
