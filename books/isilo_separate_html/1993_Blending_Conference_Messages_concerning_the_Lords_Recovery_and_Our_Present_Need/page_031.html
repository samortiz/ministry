After Adam was created, God said that it was "not good" for Adam to be alone (Gen. 2:18). A bachelor needs a counterpart, a completing part, a complementing part. A young brother who has not yet been married needs to realize that he is not complete. He needs to have a sister to complete him, to be his counterpart. The church as the counterpart of Christ is revealed in Ephesians 5. This counterpart, this bride, becomes the warrior, the fighter, in Ephesians 6.</P><P>Revelation 19 fulfills these two points. The totality of the overcomers becomes the bride to be the counterpart of Christ (vv. 7-9), and this counterpart becomes Christ's army to defeat Antichrist at Armageddon (vv. 11-21). Ephesians 5 and 6 will be fulfilled in Revelation 19. This is the revelation of the Body of Christ in the book of Ephesians.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>SPEAKING BY VARIOUS BROTHERS<br>CONCERNING THE BODY OF CHRIST</H2><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>The Body of Christ Being an Organism<br>of the Processed and Consummated Triune God</H2><P>Some people think the church is an organization, but the church, the Body of Christ, is an organism of the processed and consummated Triune God. Our physical body is an organism, but a chair is a mere organization of materials because it has no life in it. The Body of Christ is an organism because it is full of life. The church is not an organization without life, but an organism with life.</P><P>Every aspect of the church must be organic because the church is the issue of the living Divine Trinity. The Bible tells us that the embodiment of God, Christ, is life (John 14:6). Christ is not something organizational. As the embodiment of the Triune God, He is the totality of the divine, eternal life. The totality of life, the living Triune God, issues in one thing&#151;the Body of Christ. Since the Triune God is the totality of life, the Body of Christ is altogether a matter of life. We should put anything that is not life under our feet.</P><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_030.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_032.html">Next</a> </body></html>
