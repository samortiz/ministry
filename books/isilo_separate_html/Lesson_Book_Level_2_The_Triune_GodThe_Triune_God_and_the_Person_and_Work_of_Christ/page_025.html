Although we cannot understand how our God can be three-one, we have seen that He is three-one in order to dispense Himself into us. In this last lesson on the Triune God we want to see the final result, the consummation, of His dispensing. Such a rich Triune God is doing so much for us. He is dispensing Himself into us as life and everything. But there must be an issue; something must be produced by His economy.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>I. SEVEN GOLDEN LAMPSTANDS</H2><P>In Lesson Seven we saw how the golden lampstand in Exodus 25 is a wonderful type of the Triune God. That lampstand also appears in 1 Kings 7, then in Zechariah 4. Each time it reveals more to us about the Triune God, and each time it is related to God's dwelling place. But the final appearance shows us the goal. In Revelation 1:12 John saw a vision of seven golden lampstands. This was a great mystery to him, so the Lord told him that "the seven lampstands are seven churches" (1:20). The lampstand that symbolized the Triune God has now become the seven lampstands which are the seven churches!</P><P>But the church is made up of people. How could the lampstand be a symbol of both the Triune God and the church? This is possible because the church is just the mingling of God and man. By working Himself into man, God has produced the churches as the golden lampstands. They are filled with the divine nature of God. Christ has made His home in the believers' hearts; the Spirit has saturated their whole being, so they have become the full expression of the Triune God. They are golden and they are shining. When people see the church they see the Triune God. </P><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_024.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_026.html">Next</a> </body></html>
