   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>III.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>LEARNING TO ACKNOWLEDGE GOD'S GOVERNMENT A. Adam Being Cast Out of the Garden of Eden</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Recall how Adam sinned.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>After God prepared the garden of Eden, He created Adam and Eve and charged them to guard the garden.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The garden of Eden was committed entirely to them.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Eden means happiness, and they lived in this happy garden.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>But both of them sinned.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>After they sinned, God gave them a promise that a Savior, the seed of the woman, would come.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Though there was the promise of redemption, Adam and Eve were cast out of the garden of Eden.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Here we see the grace of the Lord manifested through the promise of redemption.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Yet this does not annul God's governmental action of casting them out.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>God not only cast them out of the garden of Eden; He also guarded the garden with cherubim so that Adam and Eve could not go back.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>This was God's government.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>God's government and grace are two different things.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Grace gave man the promise of a Savior, whereas government drove man out of the garden of Eden.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>From that day forward, man could no longer return to the garden of Eden.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>This is quite clear.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>B. The Israelites Being Barred</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>from Entering Canaan</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>When the Israelites reached Kadesh-barnea, they refused to enter Canaan.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>As a result, God barred them from entering the good land.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The Israelites regretted this and wanted to go in by themselves.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Many of them were killed by the Canaanites in one day.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>They wept and cried, but God would not let them enter the land Num 13 14 .</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Once they refused to enter, they could no longer enter in. God's government would not allow them to do as they pleased.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>God has His government.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>C. Moses Not Being Allowed to Enter Canaan</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Moses struck the rock with his rod two times and did not sanctify Jehovah.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>As a result, he could not enter into Canaan Num 20:7-12 .</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Although God was merciful to him and brought him to the mount of Pisgah, he could not join the people of God in entering Canaan.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Although he could see the land of Canaan with God on the mount of Pisgah, he could not enter it Deut 34 .</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>God's grace allowed him to see the boundary of the land, but God's government forbade him from entering the land.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>D. The Sword Not Departing</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>from the Household of David</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>When David sinned, God was gracious and merciful to him and forgave him of his sins.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>God was so gracious that He even granted David a special fellowship after that incident.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>But the sword never departed from his household 2 Sam 12:7-14 .</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>This was God's government.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>E. Paul's Separation from Barnabas</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Barnabas separated from Paul because of Mark Acts 15:37-39 .</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Mark was a relative of Barnabas Col 4:10 .</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>He disagreed and disobeyed along the way, but Barnabas still wanted to bring him along.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Obviously, this decision was motivated by his kinship relationship.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Barnabas then departed from Paul and took Mark to Cyprus Cyprus being their home .</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Here we see the influence of a fleshly relationship at work.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>I admit that Barnabas still might have been used by God in some way after this; he still might have done a good job later.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>But from that point forward, the Holy Spirit erased his name from the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>His name was still in the book of life, but it was no longer in the book of Acts.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>This is God's government.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>God's government does not allow anyone to take his own way!</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>The system of grace is one thing.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>The system of government is another.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>The more humble a person is, the more experienced he will be in the system of God's government.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Never think that you can annul God's system of government just because you are under the system of His grace.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Grace never annuls government.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>In fact, grace makes a person yield to government.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>I say this solemnly: Grace gives us the ability to subject ourselves to government.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Grace does not make us rebels; it does not help us overturn government.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>These two systems of God mutually perfect one another.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Grace cannot annul government.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Only foolish ones will say, "Since I have received grace, I can behave loosely and do things carelessly."</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>This is the work of a foolish man!</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>The more a person's eyes are opened to grace, the more he will behave as a proper servant if he is a servant or a proper master if he is a master .</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Similarly, the more a person's eyes are opened to grace, the more he will know how to be a husband, a parent, a son, and a citizen, and the more he will find himself in subjection to authority.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>The more a person receives grace from God, the more he will know how to maintain God's government.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>I have never seen a person who truly knows the grace of God destroy His government.</S>
