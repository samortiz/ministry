What Paul Preached</H2><P>Acts 14:22 says, "Establishing the souls of the disciples, exhorting them to continue in the faith and saying that through many tribulations we must enter into the kingdom of God." This is what Paul and Barnabas encouraged the disciples with. Does it say here that the gospel of the kingdom is not the gospel of grace?</P><P>Acts 19:8 says, "And he entered into the synagogue and spoke boldly for three months, reasoning and persuading them in the things concerning the kingdom of God." Here it says that Paul, for the space of three months, reasoned and persuaded them in the things concerning the kingdom of God. If this is not about grace, what is it about?</P><P>Acts 20:24-25 says, "But I consider my life of no account as if precious to myself, in order that I may finish my course and the ministry which I have received from the Lord Jesus to solemnly testify of the gospel of the grace of God. And now, behold, I know that you all, among whom I have gone about proclaiming the kingdom, will see my face no more." What kind of gospel did Paul say he preached? The first part says, "Testify of the gospel of the grace of God," and the second part says, "Proclaiming the kingdom." From this we can see that the proclaiming of the kingdom of God is equal to the gospel of the grace of God. On the one hand, it says the gospel of the grace of God; on the other hand, it says the gospel of the grace of God is the proclaiming of the kingdom of God. Who can say that the gospel of grace is different from the gospel of the kingdom? Paul said that the gospel of the kingdom is equal to the gospel of grace.</P><P>Acts 20:31 says, "Therefore watch, remembering that for three years, night and day, I did not cease admonishing each one with tears." This is the end of the apostle's work. The apostle never ceased preaching about the kingdom of God.</P><P>Where in the Bible does it say that the gospel of the kingdom has nothing to do with us Christians? The Bible does not say this. On the contrary, the Bible says that the proclaiming of the kingdom of God is the gospel of grace. We can see that this kind of presumption is not reliable. This shows us that the teachings concerning watching and preparing in the Gospels are spoken to us Christians.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>7. The Seventh Presumption</H2><P>Our brothers say that the work that the Lord did on the earth was basically for the Jews. The Lord's ministry was to the circumcision; therefore, we can see that the Lord specially served the Jews. In other words, the age of the gospel began after the Lord died.</P><P>Is what they say reliable? It is not reliable. I am not saying that when the Lord was living on the earth there was not the Jewish background. The Jews had the law, the covenant, and the promise from the past. The law also ended at the Lord's death. But according to the Bible, the age of the gospel did not begin at the Lord's death, but even while the Lord was working on the earth. There is much evidence for this. These ones insist on putting the Lord's work under the law. They say that the church is under grace and not under the law; therefore, all the commandments and warnings of the Lord in the Gospels do not have anything to do with the church. But the Bible does not permit them to presume this way. Let us see what the Bible says concerning the time the law ended and the gospel began.</P><P>(1) Matthew 11:13 says, "For all the prophets and the law prophesied until John." Luke 16:16 says, "The law and the prophets were until John; from that time the kingdom of God is proclaimed as the gospel, and everyone forces his way into it." The Bible tells us that the law ended when John came out to preach. Since that time, that is, since John began to preach, the gospel of the kingdom was preached. The Bible does not say that the law ended at the cross. The Bible does not say that the law ended at Pentecost. The Bible does not say that the law ended with Stephen. The Bible does not say that the law ended at Paul's preaching. The Bible does not say that the law ended at Acts 28. The Bible does say that the law ended at John. Although at that time the two sides were still not clear, and although it was not until the cross that everything was settled, the age of the gospel had, nevertheless, begun.</P><P>(2) Acts 10:36-37 says, "The word which He sent to the sons of Israel in announcing the gospel of peace through Jesus Christ...the word which has been spoken throughout the whole of Judea, beginning from Galilee after the baptism which John proclaimed." As soon as John the Baptist began preaching on baptism, the age of the gospel began.</P><P>(3) Acts 13:23-26 says, "From this man's seed, God, according to promise, brought to Israel a Savior, Jesus, after John had proclaimed, prior to His public entrance, a baptism of repentance to all the people of Israel. Now as John was completing his course, he said, What do you suppose that I am? I am not the Christ. But behold, One is coming after me, the sandals of whose feet I am not worthy to untie. Men, brothers, sons of the race of Abraham, and those among you who fear God, to us the word of this salvation has been sent forth." We need to take note that the time "the word of this salvation" began was the time the age of the gospel began. When did the word of this salvation begin? It began with John the Baptist. Therefore, the age of the gospel also began at this time.</P><P>(4) Mark 1:1 says, "The beginning of the gospel of Jesus Christ, the Son of God." If we read from verse 1 through verse 15, we will realize that the beginning of the gospel of Jesus Christ, the Son of God, began when John the Baptist preached the baptism of repentance. This is most clear. The Bible does not say that the gospel began at Christ's death.</P><P>(5) Luke 4:17-19 says, "And the scroll of the prophet Isaiah was handed to Him. And He unrolled the scroll and found the place where it was written, `The Spirit of the Lord is upon Me, because He has anointed Me to announce the gospel to the poor; He has sent Me to proclaim release to the captives, and recovery of sight to the blind, to send away in release those who are oppressed, to proclaim the acceptable year of the Lord.'" We say that the things recorded here belong to the gospel of grace. When did the Lord say they began? Verse 21 says, "And He began to say to them, Today this Scripture has been fulfilled in your hearing." The Lord said, "Today"; that is, it was fulfilled in that day. The age of the gospel began in that day and not at His death.</P><P>(6) John 4:23 says, "But an hour is coming, and it is now, when the true worshippers will worship the Father in spirit and truthfulness, for the Father also seeks such to worship Him." How did the people in the age of the law worship God? It was according to the flesh and according to rituals. The cleansing was according to the flesh; the defilement was also according to the flesh. But the Lord said, "But an hour is coming, and it is now, when the true worshippers will worship the Father in spirit and truthfulness, for the Father also seeks such to worship Him." When do we worship Him in spirit and in truth? It is in the time of grace. The Lord said, "It is now." We see that day was the time of grace. The Lord said, "It is now."</P><P>(7) John 5:25 says, "Truly, truly, I say to you, An hour is coming, and it is now, when the dead will hear the voice of the Son of God, and those who hear will live." Is this the law or the gospel? We all know that this is the gospel. The Lord said, "It is now." Does this not mean that the age of the gospel began then? It did not have to wait for a later day, but "It is now."</P><P>According to the verses we have quoted, we can conclude that when Christ was living on the earth, the age of the gospel had begun. It did not begin in Matthew 28, nor in Acts 2, nor in Acts 28. The age of the gospel began when the Lord Jesus came out to work. This being the case, all of the words in the four Gospels are for the Christians. In this way, the words that indicate that the rapture is only for those who are watching, praying, and preparing, as spoken of in the four Gospels, are for all the Christians. If this is the case, not all Christians will be raptured before the tribulation. Therefore, the condition for the rapture is not regeneration, but being watchful. Since this is the case, how can we say that the whole church will be raptured before the tribulation?</P><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_034.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_036.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Collected Works of Watchman Nee, The (Set 1) Vol. 19: Notes on Scriptural Messages (3) &nbsp; pg 35</div><br></body></html>
