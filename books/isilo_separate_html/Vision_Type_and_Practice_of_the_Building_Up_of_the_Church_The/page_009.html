<p>Most Christians have the mistaken concept that the church will be built after the Lord comes again, not in this age. In their consideration the present time is merely for the Lord to prepare materials. They say that according to Old Testament typology, David, who typifies Christ as the Warrior-King, merely prepared materials for the temple but did not build the temple (1 Chron. 29:3). Instead, David&rsquo;s son Solomon, who typifies Christ in His second coming, was the one who built the temple (2 Chron. 3:1; 6:2). Hence, they conclude that the building of the church will be carried out at the Lord&rsquo;s second coming. We will look at this matter in order to see that this concept is not accurate.</p>
<p>It is correct to say that David typifies the crucified Christ and that Solomon typifies Christ in resurrection. However, it is too arbitrary to say that David typifies Christ in His first coming and that Solomon typifies Christ in His second coming. While He was on the earth, the Lord Jesus said, &ldquo;Behold, something more than Solomon is here&rdquo; (Matt. 12:42). This means that even while He was on the earth, He was the real Solomon. Hence, David and Solomon do not typify the Lord in two stages; rather, they typify two aspects of the Lord: His suffering and crucifixion and His resurrection and glorification.</p>
<p>To say that the building materials were prepared by David means that all the materials for the building of the church are prepared through Christ&rsquo;s sufferings and crucifixion. However, the spiritual house will be built up by the Lord in resurrection. The building up of the church will not be carried out after the Lord&rsquo;s second coming; it is to be carried out in His resurrection. The Lord Jesus said, &ldquo;Destroy this temple, and in three days I will raise it up&rdquo; (John 2:19). <em>Three days</em> signifies resurrection. Therefore, the building is accomplished in resurrection. In typology this refers to Solomon building the temple. David typifies the Christ who suffered in battle and won the victory and thus obtained the materials and the ground for the building up of the church. Solomon typifies the Christ who resurrected from among the dead and is building up His Body with the materials, the saved persons, obtained through His death. This means that the building is the issue of the life that has passed through death and resurrection and that the building is carried out on the ground that He obtained. Hence, the church will not be built after the Lord comes again. The building of the church began after the Lord resurrected.</p>
<p>The New Testament says that the building of the church is in this age. The Lord Jesus said, &ldquo;I will build My church&rdquo; (Matt. 16:18), and the apostle Paul says, &ldquo;We are God&rsquo;s fellow workers; you are...God&rsquo;s building&rdquo; (1 Cor. 3:9). In other words, Paul and his fellow workers were building the church as God&rsquo;s dwelling place. Paul, a wise master builder, laid the foundation of the building (v. 10). This foundation is Jesus Christ, and no one can lay another foundation (v. 11). We are now building upon this foundation, but each of us should be careful with our work. Some of us are building with gold, silver, and precious stones, and others are building with wood, grass, and stubble (v. 12). When the Lord comes, He will judge our building work (v. 13). These words indicate that the building is taking place today; it will not wait until the Lord returns. When the Lord returns, He will judge the work that we are doing today for the building.</p>
<p>Ephesians 4:11-12 says that the Lord &ldquo;Himself gave some as apostles and some as prophets and some as evangelists and some as shepherds and teachers...unto the building up of the Body of Christ,&rdquo; which is the church. First Peter 2:5 says that we, &ldquo;as living stones, are being built up as a spiritual house.&rdquo; These matters will not take place in the future; rather, they are happening today. In Ephesians 2:22 the apostle Paul says that we &ldquo;are being built together into a dwelling place of God in spirit.&rdquo; Hence, to say that the church will be built only after the Lord returns in the future is not according to the Bible.</p>
<p>On the one hand, God has overcome the enemy and thus obtained the ground for His building in this age through the death of His Son, and He has also rescued men through the death of His Son. On the other hand, through the divine life and the Spirit, God is building all His redeemed ones together in resurrection. In typology, as David, Christ obtained the materials, and as Solomon, Christ is building these materials into the temple. These two matters are being carried out in this age by the crucified and resurrected Christ through the Holy Spirit.</p>
<p>We are fellowshipping concerning these points because some among us are still spreading inaccurate teachings. I am concerned that there is still an uncertain sounding of the trumpet among us, which says, &ldquo;We do not need to care for the building up of the church. It is good enough to zealously preach the gospel and earnestly love the Lord. We should wait until the Lord comes back and then speak about the building up of the church.&rdquo; The saints who hear such a speaking do not need to debate, nor should they be troubled. As God&rsquo;s army, we have one sounding of the trumpet, and we are marching together in the same steps; hence, we should not be distracted. We have seen that God is building His house in this universe. The age of the church is the age of God&rsquo;s building. We should ignore other trumpet sounds and receive only this call of the Holy Spirit from the Bible. We desire to learn to be built by God and to do the work of the building by His grace.</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_008.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_010.html">Next</a> </body></html>
