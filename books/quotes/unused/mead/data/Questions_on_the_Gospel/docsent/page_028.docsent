   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>QUESTION NINETEEN CONCERNING ROMANS 2:12</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Does Romans 2:12 say that a man will not perish if he does not have the law which means God has not given him the law and commits sin?</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Will a sinner still end up in perdition if he has never heard the gospel?</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>ANSWER</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Perdition and sin are closely related.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Whether or not one perishes does not depend on the existence of the law.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Romans 2:12 says, "For as many as have sinned without the law shall also perish without the law."</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>If a person does not have the law or has not heard the gospel, God has a way to deal with him.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>1 The righteous God does not do anything unrighteous.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>2 God is not obligated to save man.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Man has committed sin and deserves to perish.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Therefore, God would not be unrighteous if He did not save man.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>We are saved not because God is obligated to save us, but because God extends special grace to us.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>When we consider this question, we must pay special attention to God's grace and God's righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>God's grace caused a Savior to die and resurrect for us.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>We were saved by the righteousness of God because the Lord Jesus died, and God must save us if we have believed.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>However, if the Lord Jesus had not died for us, God would not have been unrighteous if He did not save us.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Grace comes first and then righteousness follows.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Grace is the means of salvation, but salvation itself is accomplished by righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>By His grace God sent the Lord Jesus to become the Savior of sinners.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>This is how God saves a sinner.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>In the future there will only be voices of pain in hell but no voices of complaint, because hell is God's most righteous punishment.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The judgment in Revelation 20 shows us that nobody will rise up and say that God is unrighteous at that time.</S>
