In this message we will open up the 'gold mine' of the Bible and excavate the gold that is buried deep inside it
Regardless of how many times we have heard it, we still may not understand it because this matter does not exist in our natural concept
Each stone has the name of a person written on it, one stone bearing the name of Peter, another stone bearing the name of John, and so on
The fact that the wall of the city shines brightly like a jasper stone signifies that the city is the expression of God
The end of the Bible says that God's redeemed, regenerated, and transformed people have corporately become like Him
The old man was created according to the image of God, so the new man was also created according to the image of God
The Scriptures consistently show us that God desires to be expressed and that He does not want to be expressed merely through Himself
Genesis 5:2 says, 'Male and female He created them, and called their name Adam, on the day when they were created'
There in Jerusalem, many of them received grace and the divine life and therefore were built together to become one new man
Perhaps you may say that the Bible shows us that God wants us to worship Him, to serve Him, and to work for Him
He certainly did, but we must realize that the worshipping, serving, and working for God spoken of by Paul are for the expression of Christ
His only intention is that this picture would manifest Him in a clear and definite way so that when people see the church they would see Him
If the device were removed, there would be no way for the radio to receive the radio waves that are in the air
Zechariah 12:1 says that Jehovah stretched forth the heavens, laid the foundations of the earth, and also formed a spirit within man
If we have children, we need to live in the spirit, and if we do not have children, we also need to live in the spirit
If our children are obedient, we need to live in the spirit, and if they are disobedient, we still need to live in the spirit
To live in the spirit is to let Christ fill and saturate us until He permeates our whole being and is thereby expressed through us
Most people pay attention to their minds and their feelings, but very few people pay attention to being in the spirit
We may not know what it means to pray and to fast, or we may not know what it means to be humble and to be patient
May the Lord open our eyes that we may see the consistent truth in the Bible and that the way to live in this truth is to live in the spirit
Today, however, you have been saved and have become children of God, and now you need to behave yourself in a proper way
Everything has two sides-a surface and an inside-and what is on the surface is often different from what is on the inside
The concepts described in the previous paragraph can be said to be on the surface of what is revealed in the Bible
God's being the Father, the Son, and the Spirit is not merely so that we can have the doctrine of the Trinity but is for God's economy
Traditional Christianity teaches the doctrine concerning the Trinity, saying that God is one, yet has three Persons
In degraded Christianity many people who teach this doctrine have the hidden concept that the Father the Son and the Spirit are three Gods
If we were to ask them how many Gods they believed in, they would eventually have to confess that they believe in three Gods
We must realize that God in His trinity-the Father, the Son, and the Spirit-is not for doctrinal study but for the dispensing of God into us
Fundamental Christians today all believe that the child who was born in the manger in Bethlehem was the mighty God
A child was born to us, and His name was called Mighty God, and a son was given to us, and His name was called Eternal Father
If we were to ask them whether the child born in the manger was the mighty God, they would strongly answer that He was
Even many pastors would not dare to answer because many of them are under the influence of traditional teachings
If anyone condemns us of being heretical because we say that the Son is the Father, we should show them Isaiah 9:6 and read it to them
We should not argue with such people, because the more we argue, the more they will become confused, and the more they will argue with us
We should not try to explain, because eventually we will become confused and will be unable to fight the battle
In one of his hymns, Brother Nee said, 'Thou, Lord, the Father once wast called, / But now the Holy Spirit art'
We all need to see that our God is one and that this one God, as the mysterious One, is the Father, the Son, and the Spirit
We must look to the Lord that He would enable us to see clearly that today our God, our Redeemer, is the Spirit
In His essence He is Spirit, in His economy He is ultimately the Spirit, and in His resurrection He actually became the Spirit
Not only did He become flesh to accomplish redemption for us, He also became the Spirit to come into us to be our life
The Lord who became flesh, who died and shed His blood for the forgiveness of sins, and who was resurrected is now the Spirit
The message was about pressing on, the saints sang hymns about pressing on, and many of the saints were shouting, 'Press on'!
We need to forget about our service as a responsible one in a small group, in a home meeting, or in a meeting hall
We may speak about prayer-how to pray and what to pray-but unless we have seen this vision, our prayers will be nonsensical prayers
If we do not enter into the mingled spirit and love others out of the mingled spirit, our love will be worthless
Can we say that our zeal, our having morning watch, and our endeavoring in doing many things are not under Satan's authority?
If we walk by the Spirit, we will be crucified without trying to be crucified, and we will be holy without trying to be holy
If we see this, we will no longer care about being holy, being victorious, bearing the cross, and various other matters
Neither should we be concerned with knowing what patience is, what submission is, what zeal is, what worship is, or what prayer is
If the Lord is merciful to open your eyes and show you this matter, your entire Christian life will have a great turn
The church itself is in the spirit, the building of the church is in the spirit, and the eternal testimony of the church is in the spirit
It also mentions our regenerated spirit, and even more, it speaks of the spirit that is the mingling of the Spirit with our spirit
The more we speak about other things, the more deadened and empty we will be, and the more others will not want to listen
Only in the spirit can we enter into the riches of the Lord, and only in the spirit can we be delivered from everything outside of the Lord
Still others have seen even more, realizing that the Lord is the vine, that we are the branches, and that we abide in Him and He in us
Its purpose in speaking about God is to show us that God has a heart's desire, which is to work Himself into man
Because He desires to enter into us and to put us into Himself, we should abide in Him, and then He will also abide in us
The highest gospel is not merely concerning the forgiveness of sins and deliverance from hell that we may receive eternal blessing
We may have read the Bible every day and read the Gospel of John several times, yet we may have never had this concept
If there was light here and you also had sight, then upon removing the veil, you would immediately see my face
Initially there was no way for us to eat God, because as the Creator, God is mysterious, incomprehensible, great, and glorious
After His burial He resurrected, and in His resurrection He still had a human body, but He also became the Spirit
Not only so, this book tells us that this God as the mysterious One is not only our life but also our bread of life
It shows us that after going through the process of incarnation, death, and resurrection, God became the all-inclusive life-giving Spirit
In the Old Testament air and spirit are denoted by the same Hebrew word, and in the New Testament, they are denoted by the same Greek word
We would see that after doing so many things, God became a wonderful Spirit, and that He has breathed Himself into us
Regrettably, however, when it comes to our practical living, most of the time we do not consider the Gospel of John
If we had the light from the Gospel of John we would see things from another angle and realize that it is not a matter of learning lessons
We would see that all the things that happen to us test us as to whether we are living in the spirit or in our self
When you are truly living in the spirit, there is no need to bear the cross, to be broken, or to be disciplined by the Holy Spirit
When we resist losing our temper, the devil will bother us again and again until we cannot help losing our temper
It should not be that when our wife kisses us, we live by Him, but when she scolds us, we endure and bear the cross
It should not be that when we go into a department store we quickly pray and become watchful in order that we would not fall into temptation
Rather, we should live by Him when we enter the meeting hall, and we should also live by Him when we enter the department store
Whether we have John chapter three in front of us or a variety of things in front of us, we should live by Him
Pursuing holiness, pursuing victory, bearing the cross, and receiving the discipline of the Holy Spirit are all matters in the Scriptures
When we endeavor to be dealt with by the cross apart from the spirit, we are merely changing our understanding of a situation
We may endeavor to bear the cross three times in a day, but we still do not live in the spirit for even five minutes
God needs people who will day and night, twenty-four hours a day, live in the spirit, live by Him, and live with Him as life
The Gospel of John does not teach us to be humble, to be patient, to bear the cross, or to learn this lesson or that lesson
To abide in the Lord is to abide in the spirit, to set our mind on the spirit, and to walk closely according to the spirit
When we walk closely according to the spirit by setting our mind on the spirit, we abide in the spirit and also let the Lord abide in us
If we were to live in the spirit, it would not matter whether we were experiencing trials, temptations, favor, pity, or anything else
No matter what kind of wind would blow on us-whether our wife would lose her temper or a brother would argue with us-we would not be shaken
Tomorrow morning when a situation arises, we may forget this message and try again to endure, to love our wife, or to submit to our husband
Today everything hinges on the fact that the Triune God as the all-inclusive Spirit is in our spirit to be our life and our all
Some want to preach the gospel extensively, others desire to have more time to pray, and still others want to speak in tongues
Some of the saints have said to me Brother Lee over twenty years ago when you were training us here in Taipei you spoke something different
Today, however, the jet planes can fly more than five hundred miles per hour, and it takes only around ten hours to fly from America to here
If we have seen the vision, we will see that the Lord's way today is to work Himself into us that we may live by Him
Today, however, both Taiwan and the United States have well-built highways and excellent transportation systems
There is a great difference between the life that has passed through death and the life that has not passed through death
The unsearchable riches of Christ are contained in His eternal life, a life that has passed through death and resurrection
We need someone to unveil the contents of this life and to show us the vision of the riches of Christ, scene after scene
Within us there is something living, vital, and organic that continuously stirs us within, not in our mind but in our regenerated new man
The Chinese Confucianists say that the principle of the highest level of learning is to develop the bright virtue
If you truly see this vision, you will be beside yourself for at least three days because this is a tremendously great matter!
We will not be filled with only a little love or with a little humility; we will be filled unto all the fullness of God
We are too accustomed to being in religion, not realizing that a set pattern is like a rope with which we hang ourselves
We often condemn the denominations, but today our practice has become the same as the practice in the denominations
We all need to receive mercy that God may remove the veils from our face layer by layer so that we may have an unveiled face
Our whole being, from our spirit to our outward being, needs to be unveiled to be like an open mirror, beholding and reflecting our Lord
If we remain in our oldness, there will be no difference between the practices among us and the rituals in the denominations
What we need is to look to the Lord that He may continue to grant us mercy and grace so that we would live according to what we have seen
Since we have heard this eternal mystery, from now on we should simply abide in the Lord, living and walking in Him
There are millions of people throughout the world today who have believed in Jesus yet none of them have seen the Lord Jesus with their eyes
Even if we were to fall and become degraded to the extent that we appeared improper to others, this mysterious Person would still be in us
It is very possible to be outside the spirit and apart from the Lord while praying, reading the Word, or meeting and worshipping
Before the Lord Jesus came to the earth, there was already a temple in the city of Jerusalem, built according to God's ordination
They also went into the Holy Place to burn the incense, light the lamps, and arrange the showbread table for the worship of God
On the surface the worshipping in the temple was true worship, but intrinsically people could not touch God because God was not there
People would have said that they were too loose that they did not put on priestly garments or offer sacrifices or that they were too casual
They base this teaching on 1 John 3:9, which says, 'Everyone who has been begotten of God does not practice sin, and he cannot sin'
He also told people that once they were regenerated, sin was eradicated from them, and they could no longer sin
When he saw this situation, he was perplexed, wondering how it could be right to buy only two tickets and bring five people into the park
Even 1 John says that to this day we still have the lust of the flesh, the lust of the eyes, and the vainglory of life
In God's eyes the whole world, that is, all human beings, all human societies, and all things, are under the hand of Satan
Only one thing in the whole universe and on the whole earth does not have Satan's footprints on it-our regenerated spirit
The high priest's service, the burning of the incense, and the worship in the temple were under the hand of the evil one
We must ask ourselves whether the Lord is in our prayer, our reading of the Bible, and our bread-breaking meeting
The three parts of our being-our spirit, our soul, and our body-correspond exactly to the three parts of the tabernacle
If God's Holy of Holies were only in the heavens and not in our spirit, we would have no way to behold the Lord every day
The church is God's Holy of Holies because the church is the aggregate of the regenerated spirits of all the saints
When we pray read the Word worship and serve we must be in our spirit and in the church because the church is the aggregate of our spirits
Everyone who is begotten of God refers not to the entire being of a regenerated believer but to his regenerated spirit
If we would carefully read the New Testament and also check with our experience, we would see that God has indeed drawn a boundary
John states very clearly that 'he who has been begotten of God keeps himself, and the evil one does not touch him'
Besides this, everything else, including our flesh, our mind, our emotion, and our will, are all under Satan's hand
Verse 20 says, 'And we know that the Son of God has come and has given us an understanding that we might know Him who is true'
Although the professors and the people with doctorate degrees have the knowledge in the world, many will not come to receive the Lord Jesus
The word this refers to this particular matter, circumstance, or situation, which is the true God and eternal life
They have the teachings, the knowledge, and the rituals of worship, but they are not in the spirit, and the Lord is not in them
You may not realize that your idol is your insistence on teaching others the spiritual experience you had three years ago
The Lord Jesus is one, and He is also one in our spirit, so there cannot be any opinion if we are in our spirit
We are fleeing from our idols, our flesh, our ideas, our views, our dissenting thoughts, and our old experiences
It is used once in Acts 14:6, where the apostle Paul fled from Iconium to Lystra and Derbe, and it is also used in Hebrews 6:18
The Greek word translated fled implies 'to flee intensively, seriously, and speedily,' just as Lot and his wife fled from Sodom
We must flee until we have nothing else to flee from, until we are directly touching God and are face to face with God
We need to cross the river of the flesh, the river of knowledge, the river of old religion, and the river of the old ways
