[1]  He desires to know God, but he realizes that his sinful acts and sinful nature isolate him from God.
[2]  No one can be as holy as God is; no one can be as righteous as God is; and no one can love God in the way that He demands.
[3]  The best picture of this work of redemption is seen in Christ's becoming the Passover Lamb of God.
[4]  When He was crucified on the cross, He was rejected by God.
[5]  He was the sinless Son of God, yet He was forsaken by God.
[6]  In explaining Christ's death on the cross, Isaiah, the Old Testament prophet, said, "Jehovah has caused the iniquity of us all to fall on Him" Isa 53:6 and "Jehovah was pleased to crush Him, to afflict Him with grief" v. 10 . It was Jehovah God who executed judgment on Christ.
[7]  We need to be clear that redemption is something that God has done in Jesus Christ to satisfy His own righteous requirement on mankind; it has nothing to do with what we are or what good works we have done.
[8]  If you see how the redemption of Christ has fully satisfied God, you will be at peace with God.
[9]  Many people have asked, "I know that it is a great thing for Christ to die for me, and I know that by accepting His death I receive forgiveness of my past sins; but what shall I do with the power of sin that still entangles me and that is driving me to sin continually?"
[10]  Today, all you need to do to receive Christ's redemption and salvation is to pray and call on His name.
