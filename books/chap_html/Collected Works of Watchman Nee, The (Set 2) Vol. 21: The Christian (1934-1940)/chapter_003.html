<H1 CLASS=TITLE>MAN'S ONLY SIN</H1><H2 CLASS=HEAD4>Issue Nos. 2 and 3</H2><H1 CLASS=SCRIPTURE>Scripture Reading: Gen. 2:17; 3:12; 4:3; 25:30; Luke 15:18; John 3:18; 16:9; Acts 2:36-38; Rom. 1:21, 24, 26, 28; 3:10, 23</H1><P>This morning, by the grace of God, I would like to deliver a gospel message to you. My focus today is on the one unique sin in the Bible. It is very strange that man's view concerning sin is completely different from God's view. It is unfortunate that in preaching the gospel, some have presented the principle of sin in a wrong way. They say that man needs a Savior because he has sinned, and if man had not sinned, he would not have needed a Savior. But what kind of sin has man committed? Sin is a general term. You have your sin, and I have my sin. If we have not committed the same sin, why do we need the same Savior?</P><P>The Bible focuses on only one sin from the first to the last page. Whether or not man receives eternal life depends on how he deals with this one sin. Whether or not a man will perish depends on how he deals with this one sin. Man's position before God depends on the way he deals with this one sin. The biblical emphasis is not on thousands of sins. Even if thousands of sins are dealt with, if this one sin is not dealt with, a person is still a sinner. What is this one sin? This sin is the failure of man to have a proper relationship with God. Something has gone wrong between God and man, and there is a kind of disruption. Sin is not just lying, pride, or jealousy. Although lying is a sin, and being proud or jealous is also a sin, these can only be considered as miscellaneous sins. There is only one sin that the Bible cares for; this is the sin that leads to perdition. You may not have committed many sins, but as long as you have committed this one sin, you are qualified to go to hell.</P><P>We may not have committed fornication, and we may not have gambled. But we all have committed the sin of failing to have a proper relationship with God. Something has gone wrong between us and God. Suppose that there is a man or woman who is very clean, but who has committed the sin of being wrong in his or her relationship with God. If there is anyone here who has not believed in the Lord, you may not have committed any other sin, but you are a sinner already. We have all committed the common sin of being wrong with God. As long as we have this sin, we are a sinner.</P><P>There are many names to sin. Enumerating all these names would take more than three days and three nights. You may not have committed any of these sins which would be enumerated during the three days and three nights. But you cannot deny one sin, the sin of having a breakdown in your relationship with God. If you do not have Christ today, you are a sinner. What is sin? It is being in a position of having no fellowship with God. What is sin? It is being in a position that is in opposition to God. Sin is not murder, arson, pride, or jealousy. Sin is to be wrong with God.</P><P>Let me give you an illustration to show you the critical nature of this sin. Suppose a man has brothers, sisters, and parents at home and also has colleagues at work. In addition, he has many relatives and friends. Perhaps he is married and has children. He may be a very good brother at home. He may be a very good husband and father. He may be blameless in the way he handles business and very faithful to his friends. He may be an excellent person among his relatives. He may be good at everything. He does not smoke, drink, lie, and is not jealous of others. He abides by all the moral laws; indeed, he is a gentleman and a good person. However, he has one shortcoming: he hates his parents. He can get along with everyone but his parents. He is civil to everyone but his parents. He is polite to everyone but his parents. He can forgive anyone, but he is mad at his parents whenever he sees them. By himself, he is morally good in every aspect; he is good to his brothers, friends, and relatives. He has not committed any of the sins that men ordinarily commit. But he has committed one great sin, which is being wrong in his relationship with his parents. He has not committed sins which are commonly committed, but the one unique sin he has committed is being wrong with his parents.</P><P>This is where the whole world stands today. If you ask many people whether or not they are a sinner, they will say that they have not sinned very much. In man's eyes they are gentlemen, and they are moral and courteous people. Their conscience seems to testify that they are good people. But I have to ask one thing: is there any problem between you and God? It may be true that you have no problem with men and no problem with your relatives. You may be moral and courteous. But I have to ask: is there something wrong between you and God? There is not only a relationship between you and your wife, children, friends, and relatives; there is also a relationship between you and God!</P><P>Man is a sinner for no other reason than not having a proper relationship with God. A man is a sinner not because he has murdered, committed arson, or been darkened in his conscience. He is a sinner because he is not right with God; he is standing in a position that opposes God. He is a sinner because there is no communication between him and God. You can excuse yourself by saying that you have not committed this and that sin, but there is one sin which you surely have committed. You can say that you have not committed a hundred and one sins, but you cannot excuse yourself from this one sin. This one sin makes us all sinners.</P>
