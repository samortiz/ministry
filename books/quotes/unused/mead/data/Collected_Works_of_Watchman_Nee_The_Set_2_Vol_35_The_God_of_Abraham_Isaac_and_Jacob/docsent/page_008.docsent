   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>GOD'S PURPOSE IN CALLING ABRAHAM</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>God's purpose in calling Abraham was to recover man from the sinful situation.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>We should not consider the choosing of Abraham to be a personal matter.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Abraham's being chosen by God was for the purpose of recovering man from his sinful situation.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>We should carefully consider the items included in the calling of Abraham and the kind of things brought about through such a calling.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In Abraham's calling we see God's purpose, plan, and predestination.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>We also see the solution to the problems of sin and the devil.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>May the Lord open our eyes to see these things.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Genesis 12:1 says, "Now the Lord had said unto Abram, Get thee out of thy country, and from thy kindred, and from thy father's house, unto a land that I will show thee."</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>God called Abraham with the purpose that he would get out of his country, and from his kindred, and from his father's house.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>This is a matter of inheritance.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Verse 2 says, "And I will make of thee a great nation, and I will bless thee, and make thy name great; and thou shalt be a blessing."</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>"A great nation" speaks of a people.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Verse 3 says, "And I will bless them that bless thee, and curse him that curseth thee: and in thee shall all families of the earth be blessed."</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>"In thee shall all families of the earth be blessed" this is the ultimate goal of God's selection of Abraham.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>In God's selection of Abraham, three things were included: 1 bringing him into the land which God would show him, 2 making him a great nation that would become God's people, and 3 blessing all the families of the earth through him.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>"Unto a Land That I Will Show Thee"</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>God called Abraham to leave his country, his kindred, and his father's house and go to a land that He would show him.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Abraham came from Ur of Chaldea, a land which served idols.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>His father Terah dwelt there and served the idols Josh 24:2 .</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>God called Abraham out of this land.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>On the negative side, it was for the purpose of taking him out of his country, his kindred, and his father's house and forsaking the service of the idols.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>On the positive side, it was for the purpose of bringing him into the land that God would show him, the land of Canaan, and serving the most high God, possessor of heaven and earth.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>God called Abraham so that he would go into Canaan, live there, express God, and carry out the authority of the heavens.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>God intended to give the land to his descendants.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Through him and his descendants, God intended to claim the land for Himself and to carry out His authority and express His glory in the land.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>This was God's first reason for calling Abraham.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>In Matthew 6 the Lord Jesus taught the disciples to pray, saying, "Our Father who is in the heavens, Your name be sanctified; Your kingdom come; Your will be done, as in heaven, so also on earth" vv.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>9-10 .</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>God's intention is for His people to bring His authority and His will to earth.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Today the church should be the place where God's glory is expressed and the place where His authority and will are carried out.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Wherever God's people obey His will and allow His authority to spread among them, that is the place where God's authority and God's will are executed.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>God wants to gain a group of men on earth to be His people.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>This means that God wants to gain a way among men so that His authority and His will can be done on earth as they are done in heaven.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>This was God's goal in calling Abraham.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>It is also His goal in calling us to be His people.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>"I Will Make of Thee a Great Nation"</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>God called Abraham not only for the purpose of bringing him to the land that He would show him but also for the purpose of making a great nation out of him.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>God's goal is to gain a group of men to be His people.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>God called Abraham with the purpose of making him and his descendants His people.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>In other words, God's choosing of His people began with Abraham.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>He called one man out from among so many men.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Thereafter, God revealed Himself to this man, and His salvation was to be accomplished through this man.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Salvation would come out of this one man.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>God would reach His goal through the man He chose and called.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Abraham was selected.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>This means that God called out for Himself one man from among many men.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>God wants to gain a group of people for Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>In the Old Testament there was a nation, Israel, because God wanted a people on this earth, that is, He wanted a group of people who were separated unto God, who were for His glory, and who belonged to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Although God let the Israelites go in regard to many of the sins that they committed, He would not let them go when they committed the sin of idolatry.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>For God's people to worship idols is a very serious sin.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>God's place can never be usurped by idols.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>God's purpose in choosing a people is for them to become His testimony on the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>What should they testify?</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>They should testify God.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>God has placed Himself in the midst of His people.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>In other words God's people are the vessel which contains God.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Wherever there are God's people, there is God's testimony.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Rabshakeh, a general of the king of Assyria, the enemy of the children of Israel, said, "Where are the gods of Hamath, and of Arpad? where are the gods of Sepharvaim, Hena, and Ivah?...Who are they among all the gods of the countries, that have delivered their country out of mine hand, that the Lord should deliver Jerusalem out of mine hand?"</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>2 Kings 18:34-35 .</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>This shows us that before the enemies of the Israelites could deal with the Israelites, they had to first deal with Jehovah because the Israelites were one with Jehovah.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>God has placed Himself in the midst of His people.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>He has placed Himself, His glory, His authority, and His power in the midst of His people.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Acts 15:14 says, "God...visited the Gentiles to take out from them a people for His name."</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>This is a picture of the New Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>In the New Testament the church constitutes God's people.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>All of God's testimony, work, and will are found in the church today.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>God's goal is to gain a group of people unto Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>His goal is to gain a group of people who will declare, "I belong to Jehovah.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>I am the Lord's."</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>This is why the Bible pays so much attention to a person's confession of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>The Lord said, "Everyone who confesses in Me before men, the Son of Man will also confess in him before the angels of God; but he who denies Me before men will be denied before the angels of God" Luke 12:8-9 .</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>The Lord wants to gain men who will confess His name.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>Many times, confessing Christ is not just preaching the gospel, but declaring, "I belong to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>I belong to God!"</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>This is God's testimony.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>In this way God will gain something.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>God wants to gain a group of people, who will confess, "I belong to God, and I am for Him."</S>
