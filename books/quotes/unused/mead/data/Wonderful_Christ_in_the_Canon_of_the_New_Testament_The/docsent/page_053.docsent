   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>A PREPARED BRIDE</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>This is the Lord s indwelling between His baptism and His coming back.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>By His baptism He puts us all into Him.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>By His coming He will take us as His Bride.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>This is why we need His indwelling, transforming work.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The Bride needs to be prepared.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>We are still so ugly and unsuitable.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>A man would never marry such a woman.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>This is exactly today s situation.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>How could the Lord Jesus come today?</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Hence, we need a long period for His indwelling work.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>This is the finest work He is doing.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>It was easy for Him to accomplish incarnation once and for all.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>His crucifixion only took six hours.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The resurrection and ascension did not take long.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Even the baptism was accomplished on both parts of the Body in a short time.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>His coming back will also not take long.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>But to prepare us takes a lot of time.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>If we did not have the indwelling Christ, I am afraid that we all would give up.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Praise the Lord that it is not a hopeless case!</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Christ is in us, the hope of glory.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Eventually we all will be in the New Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>All the time He is working within.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>We may say that we do not like the church life, but still He is working.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The Lord has a way to work in us, and to work us into His glory.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The way is by His indwelling.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>We all have the same life indwelling us.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>He is so rich, so present, so available, so ready, so constant, so instant, and so continually working in us.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>TWO WONDERFUL STEPS</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The indwelling of Christ is really hidden and mysterious; yet it is so real, strengthening, empowering, satisfying, enlightening, comforting, refreshing, and watering.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>This is why we have such a wonderful church life.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>If we only had the baptism accomplished once and for all, and were waiting for Him to come back, we would be miserable.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>But today we do have His indwelling.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>This is because He has become the life-giving Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The last Adam was Jesus in the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Then this last Adam has become the life-giving Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>We should never forget that Jesus took two wonderful steps in order to become something.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The first step was the Word becoming flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>He was God, yet He became flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>That was Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>He was no longer merely God, but God plus humanity.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>He was God becoming flesh so He could be our Redeemer as the Lamb of God.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Then in resurrection, the Lord Jesus as the last Adam became something else.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Here He took another step.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>This time He became the life-giving Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>His first step was for Him to become our Redeemer.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>His second step was for Him to be our life-giver.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>To be the Redeemer He needed to become flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>To be the life-giver He needed to become the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>The flesh is for redemption, and the Spirit is for life-giving.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>It is indeed sad that most Christians have never heard that Christ became the life-giving Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Rather, some Christians even condemn this as heresy.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>But what can they do with 1 Corinthians 15:45b?</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>It tells us clearly that the last Adam became the life-giving Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Now we are clear that the Lord has taken two steps.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>He was God, yet He took the step to become flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Then He became Jesus, the last Adam.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>After He finished His redemptive work, He took another step as the last Adam to become the life-giving Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>First of all He was for redeeming; now in the second step He is for life-giving.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>After we are redeemed, we need the life supply, the life-giving, and Christ as the life-giving Spirit is the indweller to supply the life to us.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>In the past, we never heard that Christ today is the life-giving Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>If we need to have a Bible study, we should study the verses concerning Christ as the life-giving Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Christ as the life-giving Spirit is indwelling us, imparting life to us all the time.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Following 1 Corinthians 15:45b, we have 2 Corinthians 3:17.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Now the Lord is that Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>John the Baptist declared, Behold the Lamb of God!</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Now the Apostle Paul declares, Now the Lord is that Spirit!</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>The Lord is no more just the Lamb of God for redemption.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Now He is the Spirit for life-giving.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Darby s New Translation puts brackets around verses six through seventeen of 2 Corinthians 3.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>This indicates that verse seventeen continues verse six.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Verse six says that the letter kills, but the Spirit gives life.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Then verse seventeen continues to say that now the Lord is that Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>It is the Spirit that gives life, and now the Lord is that Spirit that gives life.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>This is marvelous!</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>Today the Lord Jesus is the Spirit that gives life.</S>
