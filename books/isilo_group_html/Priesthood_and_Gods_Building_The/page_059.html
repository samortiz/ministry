SEEKING THE LORD&rsquo;S LEADING</h2>
<p>This kind of practice cannot be done properly within a short period of time. The way that we have received from the Lord is a new way, a way that we have never taken previously. We are learning one step at a time and making improvements as we go. We do not even know the extent of what we should learn because we do not know how the Lord will lead us. We have to set our heart on praying faithfully for these matters every day and every week, seeking to become clear concerning the Lord&rsquo;s leading.</p>
<p>We are not taking this way simply to be different. Instead, we are dropping the ways of Christianity because religious rituals put believers into bondage and hinder the Lord&rsquo;s grace from being released. Many brothers and sisters have been enlivened in their spirits, even though we have been practicing this way for only a short time. We will continue to seek the Lord&rsquo;s leading as we go forward.</p>
<h2 class="head1">BEING FLEXIBLE AND BEING AWARE<br />
OF INDIVIDUAL DIFFERENCES</h2>
<p>In our &ldquo;classes,&rdquo; we should be flexible and avoid rigidity. We do not have to do things the same way every time; rather, we should consider what to do based on who is present. During the message time, we should consider who is present, especially those who do not come regularly. In our time of fellowship, we can set aside some time to care for them, but we do not have to spend all our time with one person because this may cause him to feel as if he is being pressured.</p>
<p>If a crucial point is mentioned, everyone can pray together. Those who are more exercised should pray first, because their prayer can open up others&rsquo; spirits and bring in an atmosphere of prayer. When we fellowship with a saint who does not meet regularly, we may be able to lead him to pray, but we should not force him. If he does not know how to pray, we can lead him to pray sentence by sentence. We can say, &ldquo;Brother, what if I pray a sentence, and you repeat after me?&rdquo; Perhaps, in this way he will be enlivened. This is the same as leading a person to pray after preaching the gospel to him. Anyone who prays is likely to be enlivened. Initially, a saint who feels that he does not know how to pray or that his prayer is inadequate will hesitate to open his mouth. But if we can help him open his mouth to pray, he will become bolder. Gradually, he will be able to pray by himself and will be blessed a great deal.</p>
<p>After helping him in a wise and gentle manner, we should introduce him to the other saints, telling them, for example, the year that he was baptized. This can be compared to blood circulating in our body. If our blood is blocked in a certain place, various diseases will develop. With this kind of fellowship, there will be a flow among the saints, and many diseases will be eliminated spontaneously. This practice, though seemingly trivial, will have a great impact. If we help a brother just a little, he will come back, and when he comes back, he will bring others with him. This shows that he was helped and that he wants to help others.</p>
<p>We must also pay attention to individual differences. We cannot have a rigid plan to do something for the first five minutes and then something else for the next five minutes. We must be flexible and make adjustments according to the actual situation. If the saints are more advanced, our fellowship should be more advanced. If the saints are new believers, we should adjust our fellowship to their level but still be a little more advanced in our speaking. This can be compared to teaching. When a teacher speaks to his students, his lessons should be according to their level of comprehension, but they should also be slightly more advanced so that the students will be interested in advancing further.</p>
<p>We should not have a fixed way to practice in the small &ldquo;classes,&rdquo; thinking that someone should first give a message and that we should then pray. Once we have such a concept, we will have no way to progress. We should regard our meeting in the small &ldquo;classes&rdquo; as an experiment. We should also be watchful because none of us fully knows what to do. We are learning while doing.</p>
<p>I am concerned that this fellowship will become mere talk; that is, we may be idealistic yet impractical. Therefore, we should practice with the brothers and sisters in a blended way and fellowship together after our &ldquo;class&rdquo; times. Such fellowship will bring out many things that will improve our times together. The saints should have a learning spirit and an opportunity to learn. If they receive any benefit in the fellowship and sharing, we should encourage them to practice it. In this way they will receive much more than they would from merely listening to a message. If we have this attitude and spirit, I believe that we will learn a great deal.</p>
<p>We should also improve the way that we give messages. The main points of a message must be clear, and the messages must be educational. Every time we speak, there should be several clear and understandable points. Whenever we speak, the saints should be touched and educated in spiritual matters. A spiritual sense and some spiritual knowledge should be imparted into the saints. It is not difficult for brothers to speak for a long time, especially those who have been giving messages, but now that we are meeting in smaller groups, the messages need to be shortened. The brothers need more training so that they can cover the main points in a shorter time but still impart something spiritual into the saints.</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_058.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_060.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>The Priesthood and God's Building &nbsp; pg 59</div><br></body></html>
