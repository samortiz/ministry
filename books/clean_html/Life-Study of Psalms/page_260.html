Psalm 89 Unveiling Christ<br>as God's Anointed to Possess the Entire Earth</H2><P>Psalm 89 unveils Christ as God's Anointed to possess the entire earth, with His territory extending from the sea to all the rivers.</P><P>Of the seventeen psalms in Psalms Book 3, these five are outstanding, showing us that God is our unique portion and then showing us Christ, the saints, the house and the city, the local and universal church full of gates, full of fellowship, for God to move on to accomplish His eternal economy. This is the intrinsic significance of Book 3.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>F. Indicating the Processed and Consummated<br>Triune God to Be the All-inclusive Enjoyment<br>of His Chosen People in the Incarnated,<br>Crucified, Resurrected, and Exalted Christ</H2><P>Finally, these five outstanding psalms in Book 3 indicate the processed and consummated Triune God to be the all- inclusive enjoyment of His chosen people in the incarnated, crucified, resurrected, and exalted Christ. The processed and consummated Triune God is revealed in the Psalms, and the enjoyment of God's chosen people is also revealed here. Their enjoyment is in the incarnated, crucified, resurrected, and exalted Christ. These four matters concerning Christ&#151;His incarnation, His crucifixion, His resurrection, and His exaltation&#151;are repeatedly unveiled in the Psalms. This Christ is for the accomplishment of God's economy that we may enjoy in full the Triune God as the processed and consummated One.</P>
