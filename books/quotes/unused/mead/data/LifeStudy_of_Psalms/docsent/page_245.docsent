   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Through These Two Altars God's Redeemed</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Finding Their Home with God in Rest</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Through these two altars God's redeemed can find their home with God in rest.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Psalm 84:3 speaks both of a home and of a nest.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>What is the difference between a home and a nest?</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Whereas a home is a place of rest, a nest is a place of refuge.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>For us today, the brass altar is a refuge.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>We hide ourselves under the cross, escaping our troubles, and thus we are covered and have refuge.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Then at the golden altar we contact our Christ in the heavens.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>This contact is not for refuge it is for rest.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>A swallow is small and weak and is troubled by storms and by many other things.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>But a swallow has a nest, a refuge.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Like a swallow coming to the nest where she may lay her young, we may come to the cross of Christ as our refuge.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Here we may bring our "young," those whom we contact in our preaching of the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Spiritually speaking, at the "nest" of the cross we should "lay" our young, our spiritual children.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>To lay the young is to produce them through the preaching of the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>To do this we need to bring sinners to the cross of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>It is here, at the cross, that we have our nest, our refuge, and it is here that we "lay our young," that is, produce our spiritual children.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Before contacting the cross they were sinners, but by contacting the cross they become believers, young children in the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>As we teach our young to call on the Lord, they will learn to offer prayer to God at the altar of incense.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Then in their experience these two altars will be closely related.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>We have pointed out that this psalm on the psalmist's love for the house of God with Christ speaks of God's tabernacles and God's house.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>In type, the tabernacles, the habitations, are the local churches, and the house is the church as a totality.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>When we come to the church, the house of God, we are attracted by the two altars, both of which are very striking.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>At the first altar, the brass altar, we confess our sins, failures, and defects.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Here at the cross our problems are solved, and we are qualified to enter into God.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Then we may come to the golden altar to contact God.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>At the brass altar we meet the crucified Christ, but at the golden altar the crucified Christ becomes the ascended Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>In His ascension Christ becomes our acceptance.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>No matter how good or pure we may seem to be in ourselves, we cannot be acceptable to God apart from Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>We can be acceptable to God only in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>This is what it means for Christ to become our incense.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Revelation 8:3 indicates that in order for our prayer to be accepted by God, it must have Christ as the incense added to it.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>This is why we need to pray in the Lord's name.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Sometimes we may conclude our prayer with the words "in the name of the Lord Jesus."</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>If we pray in our own name, we will not be acceptable to God.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Only when we are in the Lord's name will we be acceptable to God, for then Christ as the incense, as a pleasant fragrance, will be our acceptance.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>In Him we will be not only acceptable to God but also fragrant and pleasant to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>In the church we first find a refuge, and then we find a home.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Before we were saved and came into the church, we not only were wandering and homeless, but we were also without any safeguard, protection, or hiding place.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>When we came to the church, we came immediately to the brass altar, the cross of Christ, and there, having the solution to our problems, we found a hiding place, a refuge.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>We hid ourselves in the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Then as we went on to contact God, praying at the incense altar, we had the sense that we were resting at home.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Many of us can testify that this was our feeling when we came to the church.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>As we experience these two altars in the church, we can say with Paul, "I did not determine to know anything among you except Jesus Christ, and this One crucified" 1 Cor 2:2 .</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>We know only Christ and His cross.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The cross is our refuge, our hiding place, and Christ Himself is our acceptance.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Day by day we come to these two altars.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Day by day we are hiding and resting.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>We come to the cross, where we have refuge, and we come to Christ, where we rest and are at home.</S>
