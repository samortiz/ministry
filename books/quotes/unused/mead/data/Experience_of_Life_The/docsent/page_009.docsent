   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE SECOND STAGE ABIDING IN CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>What we have seen in the preceding chapters is the first state of spiritual life, that is, the experience "in Christ."</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Now we will continue by looking at the second stage of the spiritual life, the experience of "abiding in Christ."</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>"Abiding in Christ" and "in Christ" are different.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Although both speak of our relationship with Christ's life, yet the matters referred to are different.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>"In Christ" refers to the fact of our sharing what Christ is and our oneness with Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>"Abiding in Christ" refers to the experience of our fellowship with Christ and of enjoying Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Originally we were in Adam and shared what was of Adam.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>When we received the Lord as our Savior, however, God translated us from Adam into Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>This is the first stage of our experience of life, so we call this stage "in Christ."</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>After we are saved and have been attracted by the love of the Lord, we pursue the Lord more, consecrate ourselves, and have various kinds of dealings.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Thus, we enter into the second stage of the experience of life.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>We begin to abide in Christ in a practical way, fellowship with Christ, enjoy Christ, and experience Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>We call this second stage, therefore, the stage of "abiding in Christ."</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Someone has designated the first stage as "the salvation stage," and the second as "the revival stage."</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The implication is that in the first stage man has only the Lord's salvation, being regenerated of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>As to the other experiences of life, they are still very weak and vague to him; so this stage can only be called "the salvation stage."</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>At the second stage, he is constrained by the love of the Lord and is revived.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>He then loves the Lord, pursues the Lord, and gradually obtains the various experiences of life which come after regeneration.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>This stage is therefore called "the revival stage."</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>We cannot avoid dividing a Christian's early life experiences into these two stages.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Yet, according to the truth, these two stages should not and cannot be divided.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Let us first consider the division, "in Christ" and "abiding in Christ."</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>When a man is saved, he is translated into Christ and should then be abiding in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Once we share what Christ is, unite with Christ, and possess the fact of being in Christ, we should have fellowship with Christ, enjoy Christ, and have the experience of abiding in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>No one ever moves into a house without living in that house and enjoying it.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Likewise, once a man is in Christ, he should abide in Christ these two events are closely connected and take place almost simultaneously.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Because of this, "in Christ" and "abiding in Christ" can only be regarded as one stage.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>"Abiding in Christ" should be the first stage, with "in Christ" being simply the beginning of this first stage.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>As to the division of the "salvation stage" and the "revival stage," the situation is also the same.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Regeneration in the salvation stage is actually "revival."</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Originally man lived in the presence of God, but because of his transgression, he became dead and fell into sins.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Now because of the Lord's deliverance, he is quickened together with the Lord and raised up together with the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>This is regeneration, and this is revival.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Therefore, a regenerated and saved man should also be a revived man.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>It is abnormal for a man to be saved but not revived, since the central point of salvation is regeneration, that is, revival.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Only in the salvation which does not reach the mark is there no condition of revival; salvation which reaches the mark is not only regeneration, but also revival.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>For this reason the salvation stage is the revival stage, and the two should not be divided.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Strictly speaking, therefore, the four stages of the spiritual life are in reality only three stages, with the first two stages regarded only as one.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>There are many, however, who though they are saved, do not appear to have the condition of revival; although they are actually in Christ, yet they do not have the practical experience of abiding in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>They still need the mercy of the Lord to be attracted by Him, to love Him, to pursue Him, and to follow Him, so that they will manifest the condition of revival and begin to enjoy Christ and experience Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>For this reason then, we divide the Christian's early experience of life into two stages.</S>
