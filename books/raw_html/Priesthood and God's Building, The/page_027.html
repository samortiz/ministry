        <h1 class="msg">CHAPTER NINE</h1>
<h1 class="title">GOD&rsquo;S CALLING AND THE PRIESTHOOD</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Exo. 28:2-25; Lev. 6:16, 18; 7:31-36</h1>
<p>The Bible reveals that God needs to gain a group of people in this age who will be priests according to His intention. We need to consider this matter in the Word so that we can be clear concerning the place of the priesthood in God&rsquo;s heart.</p>
<h2 class="head1">GOD&rsquo;S DESIRE CONCERNING MAN</h2>
<p>God&rsquo;s desire in the universe is to work Himself into man, to mingle with man as one, and to express Himself through man. Hence, whether in creation or in redemption, God&rsquo;s desire is that man would have His life and nature inwardly and express His image and likeness outwardly. Consequently, God, who is Spirit, created man with a spirit so that He could enter into man&rsquo;s spirit to be mingled with man as one and be man&rsquo;s life.</p>
<p>As the divine life in the believers, God is constantly moving and flowing. After He is mingled with us in our human spirit, God continues to mingle Himself with us so that the element of His life can spread into our mind, emotion, and will to the extent that we live out and express the glorious image of God. In the New Testament Paul speaks of Christ being our life (Col. 3:4), of Christ being formed in us (Gal. 4:19), and of Christ being magnified in us (Phil. 1:20). Thus, for us to live is Christ (v. 21), and this living is an expression of God&rsquo;s glorious image, because Christ is the image of God (2 Cor. 4:4).</p>
<p>When the Bible first speaks of man, it speaks of the matter of image and dominion (Gen. 1:26). God created man in His own image, and He gave man dominion over all the creatures. God&rsquo;s fundamental desire is to gain a group of people who will bear His image and exercise His authority. As long as we allow God to saturate us and be our life and let Him live out of us as the expression of His glorious image, we will receive a measure of God&rsquo;s authority. As long as we contact God, are mingled with God, and express God, we will have the authority of God.</p>
<p>However, God has no desire that we would have His image and exercise His authority as individual persons. Instead, He wants those who have His image and authority to be blended together in the divine life as one Body in one Spirit (Eph. 4:4). The believers, though many in number, are one Body, one corporate entity (1 Cor. 12:12). We are one dwelling place, one Body, one new man, and one counterpart (Eph. 2:22, 15-16; 5:23-32). All of these terms imply a corporate entity, not many scattered, independent individuals.</p>
<p>God&rsquo;s intention is to work Himself into a corporate man so that this man would bear His image and exercise His authority; consequently, He wants those who have received Him as life to be blended into one corporate entity to be His dwelling place, His Body, the one new man that He created on the cross, and His beloved counterpart. At the end of the Bible the holy city, the New Jerusalem, manifests these characteristics. This city is full of God&rsquo;s life, God&rsquo;s nature, and God&rsquo;s element. The outward expression of the city is God&rsquo;s glory and God&rsquo;s image. God&rsquo;s authority also is fully expressed through this city. The holy city, New Jerusalem, is a corporate man, bearing God&rsquo;s image and exercising God&rsquo;s authority, expressing God and representing God in the universe. This is the plan that God is carrying out in the universe.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE FUNCTION OF PRIESTS<br />
FULFILLING GOD&rsquo;S DESIRE</h2>
<p>We need to be saturated with God&rsquo;s life to the extent that He is our inward element and outward expression and so that we receive God&rsquo;s authority to reign for God. In order for us to attain to this goal, we must contact God, fellowship with God, come forward to God, absorb God, and allow God to fill us. We must allow God to operate in us and flow through us so that our nature of clay will be changed by the flowing of life that produces gold, pearls, and precious stones. When our inner element is just God Himself with His life and His nature, our outward expression will be according to God&rsquo;s glory and image. At such a point, we will receive God&rsquo;s authority and reign for God. The royal priesthood is a group of people who are not independent, scattered individuals but rather a corporate entity blended into one in God&rsquo;s life. In this priesthood, the priests come forward to God, contact God, fellowship with God, and allow God to pass through, operate, saturate, and shine out from them to express His image and receive His authority. The highest grace that we can receive is to be priests. As priests, we can draw near to God, fellowship with God, live before God, and allow God to saturate us and flow out of us. Furthermore, we can receive the authority of God.</p>

 	<h2>Noise Words</h2>
 	<p>Common words, such as "and", "is", "but", and "the", also known as noise words, are bypassed in a search. The search string, the Spirit &amp; who, would result in an error since who, which stands by itself, is a noise word. The following is a list of noise words:</p>
	<p>$, a, also, an, and, another, any, are, as, at, be, because, been, being, both, but, by, came, can, did, do, each, for, has, had, he, have, her, here, him, himself, his, how, if, in, into, is, it, like, make, me, might, much, my, of, on, or, our, out, over, said, should, since, some, still, such, take, than, that, the, their, them, then, there, these, they, this, those, to, too, very, was, way, we, well, were, what, where, which, while, who, with, would, you, your</p>

<div id="myModalRanking" class="reveal-modal">
  	<h2>Ranking</h2>
  	<p>Rank is a value from <strong>0</strong> to <strong>1000</strong> indicating how closely a match scored or ranked against the original search string. Rank values are affected by the following factors:</p>
		<ol>
            <li><span>The total number of occurrences of the original search words/phrases in a portion of a book.</span></li>
            <li><span>Content that includes the search words in close proximity to each other are ranked above those that do not. Therefore, a portion of a book that has the search words in close proximity may have a higher ranking than another portion of a book that has a higher hit count but the words are not in close proximity to one another. Therefore, we also include a search word hit count for reference.</span></li>
            <li><span>The rank values are relative to each other. Therefore, it is not possible to interpret the RANK value as a percentage or group the rank values into high/medium/low ranges. Think of rank as a method to order the results for a specific search.</span></li>

 	<h2>Search Scope</h2>
 	<h3>Include All Word Forms</h3>
	<p>This option breaks out the search string into its individual words and generates all conjugations and declensions for each word in the search phrase. A search on the word, dwell, would search for dwell, dwelling, dwelling's, dwells, dwelt, and dwelled.</p>
	<p>There is no need to use ^ (inflectional search) or * (prefix search) when using the Include all word forms search scope.</p> 
	<h3>Specified Word Forms</h3>
	<p>This option searches for exact matches of the specified words or phrases used in the search string. Use of ^ (inflectional search) with a particular word in the search string will broaden the search for that given word in that all conjugations and declensions for that word will be searched. Similarly, use of * (prefix search) with a particular word in the search string will broaden the search for that given word in that all words with that prefix will be searched as well.</p> 
	<h3>Note</h3>
	<p>Common words, such as "and", "is", "but", and "the", also known as noise words, are bypassed in a search. A list of all noise words is as follows:</p>
	<p>$, about, after, all, also, an,and, another, any, are, as, at, be, because, been, before, being, between, both, but, by, came, can, come, could, did, do, each, for, from, get, got, has, had, he, have, her, here, him, himself, his, how, if, in, into, is, it, like, make, many, me, might, more, most, much, must, my, never, now, of, on, only, or, other, our, out, over, said, same, see, should, since, some, still, such, take, than, that, the, their, them, then, there, these, they, this, those, through, to, too, under, up, very, was, way, we, well, were, what, where, which, while, who, with, would, you, your</p>
