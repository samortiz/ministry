<P>There is a hymn which well describes the joy of this salvation:</P><P CLASS=HBODY>Why should I worry, doubt and fear?<br>Has God not caused His Son to bear<br>My sins upon the tree?<br>The debt that Christ for me has paid,<br>Would God another mind have made<br>To claim again from me?</P><P CLASS=HBODY>Redemption full the Lord has made,<br>And all my debts has fully paid,<br>From law to set me free.<br>I fear not for the wrath of God,<br>For I've been sprinkled with His blood,<br>It wholly covers me.</P><P CLASS=HBODY>For me forgiveness He has gained,<br>And full acquittal was obtained,<br>All debts of sin are paid;<br>God would not have His claim on two,<br>First on His Son, my Surety true,<br>And then upon me laid.</P><P CLASS=HBODY>So now I have full peace and rest,<br>My Savior Christ hath done the best<br>And set me wholly free;<br>By His all-efficacious blood<br>I ne'er could be condemned by God,<br>For He has died for me!</P><P>Hymns, #1003</P>
