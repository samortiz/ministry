   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>God's dispensing is to dispense the Divine Trinity the Father, the Son, and the Spirit into us.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>He is not dispensing to us blessings such as a good house, a good car, or a good daughter-in-law.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Paul considered all such things as refuse Phil 3:8 .</S>

   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The divine building is just the church of God as the Body of Christ.</S>

   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>For any building, there is the need of material.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>In the divine building, we are the material.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>In order for us to be the proper material for God's building, we must be processed; we must pass through a number of steps.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>God the Father So Loving</S>

   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>When the Father gave His Son to us, He gave Himself to us in the Son.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>If I give you a purse that contains twelve checks, it seems that you receive only a purse.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Actually, you receive the twelve checks with the purse.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Jesus Christ is the "purse."</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>He is the embodiment of the riches of God.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>By Himself, Jesus seems to be merely a small purse.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>But in this "purse" there are many "checks."</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>This is the Father's giving, and this giving is His dispensing.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>God the Son Redeeming Fallen Men That Everyone Who Believes in Him</S>
