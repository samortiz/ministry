   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Prayer Bringing In Watchfulness</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Another thing that needs our attention related to prayer is the matter of being watchful.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Prayer brings in watchfulness.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The Lord Jesus often put being watchful together with prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>He said, Watch and pray that you may not enter into temptation Matt 26:41 .</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>It is difficult for a person who does not pray to be watchful.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>I can testify concerning this.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The insight I receive concerning the work, including my thorough understanding and my long-term view, comes from prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Before I pray, I might have a vague feeling concerning many things, but while I am praying, a sense of alertness comes.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>This sense is watchfulness.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The word watch has the meaning of observing.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>To watch is to open your eyes.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Instead of having our eyes closed in confusion, we observe things thoroughly.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>To watch does not merely mean to look but also to observe.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The most effective observation is done in prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>When we pray, we should learn not to speak so many of our own words, because this interrupts the watchfulness and the observing in the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>However, if we do not open our mouth to utter anything, our mind will wander.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>We may be distracted if we pray with our eyes opened, and our mind may wander if we pray with our eyes closed.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>It is not easy to stop our mind when we pray.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>We need to learn to be a person of prayer, to have a spirit of prayer, and to give every person we contact and every thing we do to the Lord in prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>LEARNING TO REJECT AND DENY THE SELF</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>One who serves the Lord should also learn to reject and deny the self.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The Chinese Union Version translates the phrase deny himself in Matthew 16:24 as sacrifice the self.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>To sacrifice the self means to get rid of the self.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>This translation does not convey the correct meaning, because no matter how hard we try to get rid of the self, the self does not leave us; it is with us all the time.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The self is corrupted.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The content of the self is the flesh, the old creation, with its passions, lusts, sins, jealousy, strife, and ambition.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>All of these things are in the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>However, the Lord Jesus said, If anyone wants to come after Me, let him deny himself and take up his cross and follow Me v. 24 . To take up the cross means to remain in the Lord s death, to not depart from His death, and to allow the Lord s death to operate in us and kill the self.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The more we cooperate with the Lord, the easier it is for us to deny the self.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>We need to learn to deny the self when we fellowship with the brothers and sisters.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>We can never fully learn the lesson of denying the self.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>We need to continue learning this lesson until we are transfigured.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>As long as we are living, our self and the old creation continue to exist.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The longer we live on the earth, the more experienced we may become concerning spiritual things, but our self may also become more experienced.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Hence, for the rest of our lives, there is no end to learning the lesson of denying the self.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Denying the self is not something that we can learn after hearing a message.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>We must learn to reject the self and to deny the self all the time.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>AVOIDING BEING INDIVIDUALISTIC</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>In serving the Lord we also need to avoid being individualistic.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>We are members of Christ s Body, and no member can exist alone.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Any member that is separated will die, because a member that is detached from the Body is isolated, and this results in death.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>This lesson is particularly for the young serving ones.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>As we learn to serve the Lord, we need to exercise to live in the principle of the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>We should never do anything alone.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Instead, two or three saints should coordinate together and learn to fellowship together, checking with one another s feelings.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>This is not the same as a subordinate requesting permission from his boss.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>It is the fellowship among members of the Body related to their feelings concerning specific matters.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>This is a great protection.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>We can compare this to a military troop that is fighting on the front line.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Any soldier who leaves the group is likely to be killed.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>This is an example of how we need to be careful and realize that whenever we are alone and isolated, Satan will take the opportunity to attack us.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>NOT HAVING OPINIONS</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>In serving the Lord we should not have any opinions.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Serving the Lord is a corporate matter that requires the serving ones to come together to fellowship without any opinions.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>May we all learn to be persons without opinions.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>You may say that if you are to have no opinion, it is better not to pray or fellowship.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>This is not a proper attitude.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Everyone should speak, but our speaking should be in wisdom, without opinions.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>We can give an example to show the difference between wisdom and opinion.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>A person with an ulcer should not eat anything sour, sweet, or fried.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>This is not an opinion.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>However, suppose this same person suggests that everyone follow his way of eating.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>That is an opinion.</S>
