   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>SIN AND SINS</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>We must realize that not only have we committed sins, but we are also sin.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>We may have never committed anything evil, but inwardly we are sin.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>It does not matter whether an apple tree brings forth apples or not; it is still an apple tree.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Praise the Lord!</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>On the one hand He was made sin for us, and on the other hand He bears all of our sins.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>He is the sin offering, and He is also the trespass offering.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Eventually the trespass offering is also a sin offering.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>In all of your experiences as a Christian, how many times have you realized that the Lord Jesus was your sin offering?</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>He is not only our trespass offering, but also our sin offering.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>I am afraid that many of us have never had any realization of our sin.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>We have only realized our sins.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>We have never enjoyed Christ as the offering for sin, although many times we have enjoyed Him as our offering for sins: "O Lord, I am so sinful, but You died for my sins on the cross."</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>This is the enjoyment of the Lord as the trespass offering.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>But we are not only sinful; we are also sin.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>A good person may have done little wrong, but he still must confess to God and apply the blood of Christ to himself.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>This is not for the outward trespass, but for the inward sin.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>It is not for what he did, but for what he is.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>What he is, is sin, and what he does, is sins.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Jesus was made sin for us, and He also bore our sins.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>SIN OFFERING MORE SERIOUS</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>As we go deeper with the Lord in the inner life, we will understand why the sin offering is mentioned before the trespass offering in Leviticus.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>This is because sin is more serious than trespasses.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Sin is the seed, the root, the source.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The trespasses are merely the outward fruits, and they are not as serious.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The most serious thing in the eyes of God is the sin in our nature.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>What we are is much more serious than what we do.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Hence, we need the sin offering first; then we need the trespass offering.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>For the sin offering, a vigorous, young bullock was needed.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>But there is no bullock mentioned for the trespass offering.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The strongest animal used for the trespass offering is a female sheep.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>This shows that there is not the need of a strong offering to deal with our trespasses.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>But we need a strong, vigorous bullock to deal with our sin.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>A weak turtledove or young pigeon is sufficient for a trespass offering, but the weakest animal mentioned for the sin offering in chapter four is a lamb.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>There is something even weaker used for the trespass offering: one tenth of an ephah of fine flour.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>It is not even a whole ephah, but one tenth of an ephah of flour.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>This proves that the trespass offering is not as serious as the sin offering.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>At the time I was saved, I did not hear a message on sin, but on the world.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>I heard how Pharaoh is the king of this world, and all the people are under his dominion.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Therefore, I repented of being occupied by the world.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>I did not at that time have much consciousness concerning my sins.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>I was caught by the Lord, and I told the Lord that I would give up the world for Him, but I did not repent so much for my sins.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>I would say that in typology I enjoyed Christ as my trespass offering as one tenth of an ephah of fine flour.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Still I was saved.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Perhaps when you were saved, you realized Jesus as your trespass offering as a ram.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>In later years, I began to enjoy the Lord Jesus as my sin offering as a young bullock.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Sometimes as a priest I have made some mistakes.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>By these experiences I realized that there was something wrong in my nature that was more serious.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>I needed a strong Jesus, a young bullock, not just one tenth of an ephah of fine flour.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>This means that I learned to appreciate and enjoy the Lord as my sin and trespass offering much more than I did fifty years ago.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>When we put all the items of Leviticus 4 and 6 together, we have the young bullock, the sheep, the goat, the lamb, the turtledove, the young pigeons, and the tenth of an ephah of fine flour.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>By all of these items we can see that the sin offering has the strongest items, and the trespass offering has the weakest.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>But regardless of how weak it is, as long as you touch it, you are saved.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>We must realize that what we do is not so serious as what we are.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Our outward actions are not as serious as our inward being.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Our outward actions are just trespasses and iniquities, but our inward being is sin.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Therefore, on the one hand the Bible tells us how Jesus was made sin for us, as in 2 Corinthians 5:21, and on the other hand several verses, such as 1 Peter 2:24, show us how Jesus bore our sins.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Isaiah 53 also tells how Jesus was made a trespass offering on the cross by God to bear our iniquities, transgressions, and sins.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>In verse 10 of this chapter, "an offering for sin" should be "a trespass offering."</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Therefore, we should read this verse in this way: "Yet it pleased the Lord to bruise him; he hath put him to grief: when thou shalt make his soul a trespass offering.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>" This shows us that in Isaiah 53, Jesus is the trespass offering.</S>
