   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>PROPAGATING THE TRUTH IN THE LORD S RECOVERY</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>THROUGH THE DEVELOPMENT</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>OF THE ORGANIC FUNCTION</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Hence, we see in perspective that the Lord has given the entire Philippines to His recovery because the Lord s pure gospel and His complete truth are in His recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The Spaniards brought Catholicism to the Philippines, and later the missionaries from the United States came to work here.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Consequently, the Philippines is overall a Christian country.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Nevertheless, most Filipinos know only a little about God and have heard only a fraction of the gospel, which in most cases was not the pure gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>This is beside the fact that most know little concerning the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The people here know about the existence of God and also fear God, but there is not much preaching of the pure gospel and even less speaking of the complete truth.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Thank the Lord that He gave us a period of eleven years to open up the entire New Testament, chapter by chapter and verse by verse.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>During those eleven years we studied exhaustively, and what the Lord unveiled to us has now been put into print for you to have in your hands.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>There are many rich truths within that need to be revealed to God s children.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The New Testament was completed during the apostolic age.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>However, for two thousand years man s understanding of the New Testament has been incomplete.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The Bible that is now in the hands of Christians has not been that open.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Today there are many expositions of the Bible in Christianity.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Among these expositions there are also many interpretations of the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Most of the interpretations, however, stop with the light and revelation of one hundred and fifty years ago, whereas the light and revelation in the life-studies are up-to-date and also complete and rich.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>For example, the Triune God s dispensing of life and God s New Testament economy are altogether new revelations.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>This kind of terminology and speaking cannot be found in any publications in Christianity.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>However, in the Lord s recovery there are many messages of this kind.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>All these are the latest revelations gradually shown to us by God during the last ten to twenty years.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Take the New Jerusalem for example.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>You cannot find one book in Christianity explaining and developing all the items of life related to the New Jerusalem in such a thorough way as you may read in the publications in the Lord s recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The gospel that we preach in the Lord s recovery is the purest, highest, and most complete gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>For example, concerning the Lord s death on the cross, where in any other book can you find that the Lord had seven statuses when He suffered death on the cross?</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>This proves that the light which the Lord has given us is clear and complete.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Christianity in the Philippines has a history of at least three hundred years.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>There may be almost fifty million Christians in the Philippines, but they are all in an unclear state they are in a cloud.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>People know there is a God and have heard a bit of the gospel, but the sky over them is not clear but cloudy.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>They seem to know God, but in reality they do not know God.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>They are altogether ignorant of what God is all about, what He is doing, and what He wants to gain today.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Therefore, we must receive the burden to preach to them the divine truths in the Lord s recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>No one is able to destroy or overthrow the Lord s recovery on this earth because it has a very solid foundation.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The Lord s recovery, as God s garden flourishing abundantly, is firmly rooted.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Recently several hundred young people have come into the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>We know this is just the beginning; thousands more will come into the Lord s recovery to enter into the divine truths.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Furthermore, one day they will all be able to stand up before millions to preach the pure gospel and to speak the divine truths.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>I have the boldness to make such a prediction and also the faith that this word will soon come true.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Hence, we must pay attention to equipping ourselves so that we may be suitable for the Lord s use.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>In this way, through us the Lord will be able to gain our locality, as well as the whole earth, with the pure gospel, the complete truth, and the normal and proper church life.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>First we must be clear that the Lord s move is definitely not organizational but organic.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>We have seen through history that from 1950, when the Lord began His work in Manila, to the present, we have not been doing an organizational work but one of sowing, planting, and watering so that the church of the living God can develop her organic function.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Today in the Philippines, all of the fruit has come not through organization but through the organic growth of the church producing that which is living and of life to become an organic Body.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>In the Lord s recovery we do not emphasize organization, nor do we pay attention to position and reputation.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The grace that we have received is the grace of life; this life is Christ Himself, who today is the all-inclusive Spirit, the Triune God experienced by us.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>He is growing in us and in the church.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The more He grows, the more He multiplies, and the more He flourishes.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Through the church as the organic Body and God s garden, the Lord will be able to fulfill His purpose and accomplish His economy.</S>
