   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>7 THE VICTORY OF THE CALLED And Melchizedek king of Salem brought forth bread and wine: and he was the priest of the most high God.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>And he blessed him, and said, Blessed be Abram of the most high God, possessor of heaven and earth: and blessed be the most high God, which hath delivered thine enemies into thy hand.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>And he gave him tithes of all.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Genesis 14:18-20 So also Christ did not glorify Himself in becoming a High Priest, but it was He who said to Him, "You are My Son; this day have I begotten You"; even as also in another place He says, "You are a Priest forever according to the order of Melchisedec."</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Hebrews 5:5-6 For this Melchisedec, king of Salem, priest of the Most High God, who met Abraham returning from the slaughter of the kings and blessed him, to whom also Abraham apportioned a tenth part of all; first being interpreted king of righteousness, and then also king of Salem, which is king of peace; being without father, without mother, without genealogy; having neither beginning of days nor end of life, but likened to the Son of God, abides a priest perpetually.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Hebrews 7:1-3</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>In this message we come to the victory in Abraham's experience 14:11-24 .</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>If we read the book of Genesis carefully, we shall see that apart from chapter fourteen it does not relate much concerning the international affairs among the Gentiles.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>But chapter fourteen gives us a record concerning the international fighting among the Gentiles.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Why is there such a record?</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The wording in the Bible is very economical.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Not one word is wasted.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Nevertheless, chapter fourteen is almost entirely concerned with the international fighting among the Gentile kingdoms.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The events in chapter fourteen, however, are not just related to international affairs but are sovereignly related to God's people.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Why does this chapter dedicate such a lengthy word to the international fighting among the Gentiles?</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Although this fighting apparently was international, actually it was sovereignly arranged by the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>God is sovereign over the environment and over all the events concerning His people.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>In the land of Canaan at that time, there were only two families of the Hebrew race the family of Abraham and the family of Lot.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>All of the rest were Gentiles.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>In this chapter we see that God was sovereign, causing something to happen for the good of His people.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Chapter fourteen of Genesis relates the fighting between a group of four kings and a group of five kings.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Eventually, the five kings were defeated by the four kings.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>If you read carefully, you will see this fighting was absolutely for Lot and for Abraham.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>In other words, both Lot and Abraham, the two Hebrews, were put to the test under God's sovereignty.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Was this fighting good or not?</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Humanly speaking, no fighting is good.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>However, in this chapter the fighting was good for Lot and especially for Abraham.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>In this message we need to see the profitable aspects related to God's people in this fighting.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>THE CAPTIVITY OF THE BROTHER</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The fighting occurred mainly at Sodom.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>It mainly happened at Sodom because one of God's people, Lot, was living there.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Before the time of that fighting, Lot had separated himself from Abraham 13:11 .</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Do you think that it was good for Lot to have separated himself from Abraham?</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>No, it was not good.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>All of the young people today like to be separated from the older generation.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>In God's economy, however, it is not good for the young ones to be separated from the older generation.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>If you do this, you will miss the mark and the protection.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>At the time of Genesis 13, God's goal and eternal mark were with Abraham.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>If you had been there and had separated yourself from him, it would have been equal to separating yourself from God's mark.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>God's goal is with the called ones.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>If you separate yourself from the called ones, you separate yourself from God's goal.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Lot should never have separated himself from Abraham, because God's goal was with Abraham.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>To leave Abraham was to leave God's mark.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Moreover, to leave Abraham was to leave the protection.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Lot was not firstly defeated by the four kings.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>That defeat was the issue of at least two foregoing defeats.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Before Lot was captured by Chedorlaomer, he already had had two defeats.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The first defeat occurred when Lot's herdmen were striving against Abraham's herdmen and Abraham offered Lot the choice of the land 13:7-11 .</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>When Abraham offered the choice to Lot, Lot should have said, "Uncle, my choice is you.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>My choice is your choice.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>I don't like to make any choice of my own.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>If my herdmen will not listen to me, I will fire them, but I will never go away from you.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>I have no choice but you and your choice."</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>But, on the contrary, when Abraham gave him his choice, immediately, without much consideration, Lot made his choice and went his way.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>That was his first defeat.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>After separating from Abraham, "Lot dwelled in the cities of the plain, and pitched his tent toward Sodom" 13:12 .</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Lot was going downhill.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>After taking the first step downward, it was easy for him to take the second and the third.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>The first step was leaving Abraham, who stood afar off from Sodom.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Lot took the way that was toward Sodom.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>He walked in the direction of Sodom.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>In the eyes of God, Sodom was a wicked and sinful city 13:13 .</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Lot, as one of the people of God, surely knew this.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>He should have stayed away from Sodom and not have walked towards it.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Nevertheless, because the land around Sodom was rich, Lot journeyed toward Sodom.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Eventually, he moved into the city, lived there, and settled there.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>That was his second defeat.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Do you think that God will allow His people to dwell in such a wicked city?</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Certainly not.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Thus, under God's sovereignty, Chedorlaomer led the attack against Sodom.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>God allowed that war to take place.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Four kings fought against five kings.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Humanly speaking, the five kings should have been victorious since their number was greater.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>But the four kings defeated the five kings, and the city of Sodom was taken.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>The Bible stresses the taking of Sodom because Lot dwelt there.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>This fighting was not merely a matter of four kings against five kings; it was a fighting for one of God's people.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>Lot might have been peaceful as he dwelt in Sodom, but God was not peaceful.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>God would never allow Lot to stay there in peace.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>God might have said, "Lot, you may have peace within, but I will stir up some disturbance from without.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>I will send the four kings to defeat the five kings and capture your city.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>They will capture you, your family, and all that you have."</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>This is in fact what happened to Lot.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>Lot suffered defeat after defeat.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>Eventually, as the last step of his defeat, he fell into the hands of the enemy.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>He was captured, and the king of Sodom could not help him.</S>
