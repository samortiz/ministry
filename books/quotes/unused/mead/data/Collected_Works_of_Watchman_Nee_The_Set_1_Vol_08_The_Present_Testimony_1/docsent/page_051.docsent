   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>The Second Thing to Do Is Believe</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>After we have surrendered ourselves, we must believe that God can deliver us from our love, our reluctance, and our inabilities.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Psalm 37:5 says, "Commit thy way unto the Lord; trust also in him; and he shall bring it to pass."</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>To commit is to surrender.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>To trust is to believe, and the result is that He will bring it to pass.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>We can do nothing in ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>When we commit our ways to God, we believe that the Lord living within us will bring them to pass.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Can we say that we have overcome?</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Hallelujah!</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>I can say that I have overcome, because the Bible tells me so.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>How pitiful that our faith is not as great as a grain of mustard seed.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>It is not even as great as a speck of dust!</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>If we had faith, God would have worked already.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>God exercised only His mouth when He created the heavens and the earth; when He said let there be light, there was light.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>When we have faith, God will work, for He is willing to accomplish His own work.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>A few weeks ago, a brother came to talk with me.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>He told me that he had three to four kinds of sins that he could not overcome.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>At times he even wanted to kill himself.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>I asked him, "Do you believe that Christ can save you from your sins?"</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>He answered, "Yes, I believe."</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>But immediately after saying this, he said, "Yet I have committed these sins again and again.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>I have overcome all other sins, but these few sins still remain."</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>I read Romans 8:1 with him, which says, "There is now then no condemnation to those who are in Christ Jesus."</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>I then said to him, "The Bible gives one condition for being saved to be in Christ Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Are you in Christ Jesus?"</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>He replied, "Yes, I am."</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Then I said, "All right, then see what the Bible says: For the law of the Spirit of life has freed me in Christ Jesus from the law of sin and of death'" v. 2 . He said, "The Bible says that I have been freed from the law of sin and of death." I then asked, "Are you free?" He replied, "I dare not say." I said, "Where is your faith?"</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>I am not afraid of men's weakness, corruption, or sin.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>But I am afraid of one type of person: one who does not believe in God's Word.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>How precious are the words "has freed me!"</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>God's Word says that we have been freed.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>It does not say that we shall be free.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Do we believe it?</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Christ has died for you.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>When you believe in Him, you have eternal life.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>What evidence do you have for this?</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Is it not merely because the Bible has said it?</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>In the same way, today the Bible says, "The law of the Spirit of life has freed me in Christ Jesus from the law of sin and of death."</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Therefore, I am already freed, and I am already delivered from the law of sin and death.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Even if there are a hundred, a thousand, or ten thousand sins, I am free from them all.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>I am free even from the spiritual death which I have inherited from Adam.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Brothers and sisters, do you believe in this word?</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Do you believe that you are free from the law of sin and death?</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The Bible says that you are free.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>If you believe it, you will say, "Hallelujah!</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Praise the Lord!</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>God's Word says that I am free from the law of sin and of death!"</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Do you have some sin or unclean thoughts that you cannot overcome?</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>If you do, you should know that there is a gospel for you today.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>The law of the Spirit of life has freed you in Christ Jesus from such sin.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Brothers and sisters, we must see that to surrender and to believe are two interrelated matters.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>When we put the two together, we will have the victory.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Otherwise, we will have failure.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>It is impossible to overcome merely by believing without committing one's life to God in exchange for Christ's life.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Although we obtained everything at the time of regeneration, unless we exercise our will to commit ourselves to God and allow Christ to live, God will never force us.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>However, if we merely surrender without believing, such surrendering is but a kind of dead work, because we have merely provided God the chance to work, without providing Him the chance to come in.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>We have to first lift up our heads to tell God that we are committing everything into His hand, and, second, we have to believe that God has accomplished everything according to His Word.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Christ has borne all the conflict for us.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>The government is now upon His shoulder.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>We should believe in Him this way, day after day.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Faith is continual, while surrender is instant; it is a once-and-for-all act.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Although some may surrender gradually and slowly, it is unnecessary to do this.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>We can commit everything to God in an instant and stop all our work from that point on.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>If we have committed, we should then believe that God will cause Christ to live out His holiness and victory from within us.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Our former salvation saved us from the punishment of hell.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Our present salvation saves us from the power of sin.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>There is no need to do anything else.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>All we have to do is commit and believe.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>I hope that every one of us can testify that we are victorious.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Brothers and sisters, there is only the need to believe.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>If we do not believe, nothing will work.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>If we believe, we will see changes.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>God has spoken, and we only need to praise and thank Him!</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>We only need to believe in a "cold-blooded" way and ignore our feelings.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>God has said it, and it is so.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>We have never seen heaven and hell, but we believe there is heaven and hell because God's Word says so.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>If we can believe, that is good enough; there is no need for further evidence.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>There is only one evidence the Word of God.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>We need no other evidence.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>I do not have to see if there is any change in me; I only need to believe that whatever God has spoken will count.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>If we believe, we will see change.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>If we do not believe, we will not see change.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>Once I spoke to a brother about Romans 8:2.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>I asked if he believed in it.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>He said he believed.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>I asked him further, "What will you do if you wake up tomorrow and sin again?</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>If you still sin, what are you going to do?"</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>He did not know what to say.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>Brothers and sisters, the greatest danger lies in the first temptation.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>Satan will say that to surrender and believe are vain, that we have sinned again, that we have not changed at all, and that we are the same as we were!</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>But brothers and sisters, we have to repeat again and again, faith is long-lived.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>If it is short-lived, it is not faith.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>Of all the lives in the world, faith is the most long-lived.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>Temptations may come.</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>But if God says that we will overcome, we will surely overcome, and the temptations will fail.</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>The way we deal with the first temptation proves if we have the faith or not.</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>The Lord Jesus told the disciples, "Let us go over to the other side" Mark 4:35 .</S>
   <S PAR='98' RSNT='1' SNO='98'>Later, a windstorm arose, and the waves beat into the boat, so that the boat was beginning to fill up.</S>
   <S PAR='99' RSNT='1' SNO='99'>The disciples woke Jesus and said, "Teacher, does it not matter to You that we are perishing?" v. 38 . The Lord woke up, rebuked the wind and the waves, and the wind ceased, and there was a great calm.</S>
   <S PAR='100' RSNT='1' SNO='100'>Then the Lord rebuked the disciples: "How is it that you do not have faith?" v. 40 . Since the Lord commanded them to go over to the other side, they were surely able to go over to the other side.</S>
   <S PAR='101' RSNT='1' SNO='101'>Even if the windstorm had become fiercer, it would not have stopped them from going over to the other side.</S>
   <S PAR='102' RSNT='1' SNO='102'>Brothers and sisters, the most important thing is to believe in God's Word.</S>
   <S PAR='103' RSNT='1' SNO='103'>If God has said it, that is enough.</S>
   <S PAR='104' RSNT='1' SNO='104'>We do not have to worry about anything else.</S>
