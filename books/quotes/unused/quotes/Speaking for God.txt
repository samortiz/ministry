In the spring of 1949, the Lord's recovery took a step forward when some saints moved from mainland China to Taiwan
In 1949 there were approximately eighty to ninety churches outside of mainland China, most of them being in Southeast Asia
At that time there were no churches in either Japan or Korea, and in Taiwan there were only five or six very small churches
In Southeast Asia the churches were concentrated mostly in four countries: Indonesia, Thailand, Malaysia, and the Philippines
Further south toward Burma and India, there was some contact with a small number of people but no formal meetings anywhere
After we were sent to start the work in Taiwan, the Lord was able to gain scores of churches on the island of Taiwan
Before the Lord's recovery spread to the Western world, there were already two hundred fifty churches in the Far East
A total of twenty-three years has passed since the inception of the work of the Lord's recovery in America in 1962 to today
Adding these to the ones in the Far East, we have a total of about six hundred twenty to six hundred fifty local churches
The internal problems were due to the fact that some of those who had been brought into the Lord's recovery had ulterior motives
When the Lord's recovery came to America, its most pronounced and striking characteristic was its richness in the truth
As a result, the American brothers and sisters among us, especially the young people, were the first ones to suffer much persecution
When the second book, The God-Men, arrived in England, the 'poison' in that book damaged many localities there
Once affected by the poison, the parents would spend a great deal of money to hire certain persons to 'counsel' their children
They used every means, at times even exhausting their financial reserves, in the belief that they were rescuing their children
In 1 Corinthians 6 Paul said that it is wrong for brother to go to court with brother, especially before unbelievers
The commander was a chiliarch in the Roman military who was in command of a thousand troops for the purpose of maintaining peace
We saw the advertisements of the books before they were published and made telephone calls to the publishers, but they ignored us
We pleaded with them to leave us, yet they would not; thus, we were forced to ask the police to come and handle the situation
The number attending the training was always between three to four thousand; and the duration of the training was ten days
Under my leadership, several brothers who were capable in English and quite good in Greek re-translated the New Testament text
My burden in fellowshipping these few matters is so that you all may know what we went through in the past years
The Lord's recovery among us began in the Far East, with mainland China as the first cradle and Taiwan as the second
Rather, it has been the outside Christian organizations that have been using our publications to a great degree
Their favorite purchases are publications that expound the Bible, such as the life-studies and the Recovery Version of the New Testament
Unfortunately, even though he clearly presented these points to us early on, we have never seriously practiced them
During the next five years the number of saints grew to such an extent that there was the need for more and more meeting halls
In the first five years, these groups were a great help to the increase of the church, resulting in the addition of a good number of people
In the past ten or so years, these small groups gradually disappeared although we still had the bigger home meetings
In 1975 and 1976 Taipei had almost one hundred such meetings, of which at least seventy or eighty participated in the breaking of bread
In other words, we have been gradually slipping away from the light and practice that the Lord had given us in the recovery
Since the degree of decline was very small, not precipitous, we did not even notice that we were going downhill
In short, the regular large meetings were no different from the so-called worship services in degraded Christianity
Among us, at least seventy percent of the saints, if not one hundred percent, have just been 'going to church'
If the church life is focused on the large meetings for so-called worship services, it will be difficult to continue expanding
If these matters are difficult, then bringing others in as the increase, retaining them, and holding them will be even more difficult
Also, on the six continents on the earth, there are over six hundred churches in the Lord's recovery as our fields of labor
Already there are twenty-one meeting halls, and the number attending the meetings is about three to four thousand
Everything was rearranged to open up a new atmosphere so that every place could become a workplace and a place of blessing
Thirty years have since passed, and even their children have grown and now have a college education; some are even married
After another year of listening, he may feel about the same; after ten or fifteen years, he will still feel almost the same
It seems that he understands addition, he has heard about subtraction, and he has also heard about algebra, geometry, and calculus
When the time comes to apply what he has heard, he cannot add, subtract, multiply, or divide correctly, much less do calculus
Since they have believed into the Lord Jesus, they want to know what He is all about and what the Bible teaches
Perhaps ten people would come on the first night, the next night twenty would come, and after one week perhaps two hundred would come
As a result, the people in Central and South America are hungry inwardly, longing for someone who can preach the truth to come to them
Because the truths in the entire New Testament have been completely released and put into print, we surely have the truths among us
Once in Taipei, after two days of meeting, Hall One alone had about one hundred fifty people baptized with the majority being young people
Whether it is in Germany, Japan, or America, everywhere there are young people; what they seek after the most is the truth
Our publications are even in the Russian-speaking world; there are over ten books already translated into Russian
Today the reason we are here is because we all have been kept by the truth and have been inwardly enriched with life
Rather on the one hand we may have the large meetings but on the other hand we have to pay attention to the release and spread of the truth
It seems that we voluntarily come together because we hear about a meeting and take the initiative to attend it
These examples show us that even the meeting together of only two or three persons is initiated not by us but by the Lord
The Lord Jesus who is in him may stir in him continually so that finally he comes to the meeting instead of remaining in his store
The reason that we can come together is altogether because the Lord gathers us together; furthermore, He gathers us into His name
God's speaking, the way God speaks, God's desire that we speak, and our speaking in the meetings are four crucial matters to us
According to the Chinese language, the word religion means having a certain belief and teaching according to that belief
Regardless of race or nationality, everyone who is human has a stomach, an organ specifically for containing food
Zechariah 12:1 says, 'Jehovah, who stretches forth the heavens and lays the foundations of the earth and forms the spirit of man within him'
It is amazing that a chief secret agent who killed thousands of people would request to have the Bible before his execution
There is an ancient Chinese book called The Great Learning which says that the principle of great learning is to develop the bright virtue
Paul said in the New Testament that he exercised himself to always have a conscience without offense toward God and men
Concerning this matter, the unbelievers, and even the Christians-the believers in the Lord, do not understand how they can eat God as food
In 1 Peter 5:8 Peter says, 'Your adversary, the devil, as a roaring lion, walks about, seeking someone to devour'
More than forty years ago during World War II, Germany had a very strong military and began frequent attacks on the Soviet Union
They may have believed that even if the doors of the churches were re-opened, there probably would not be many who would go to church
It is amazing that the more you persecute people and prohibit them from seeking after God, the more they will seek after God
In the same way, the more you suppress people, restraining them from believing in God, the stronger will be their inner longing for God
We may say that the history of the human race is a history of building up religions; human beings are continually researching religions
In the Confucian mentality there is only the concept of heaven as reflected in the saying He who offends heaven has none to whom he can pray
Confucianism does not teach people to worship God; rather, it teaches people to be ethical and to have a purpose in life
If, however, in this life he does not do good deeds, then in the next life he will become something worse than a man
Buddhism is a way of thinking that teaches people to refrain from doing evil, because if a person does evil things, he will be punished
Taoism speaks about the wind, saying that the wind is like a breath and comparing human life to the wind or a breath
Judaism only acknowledges the Old Testament, whereas Catholicism and Protestantism acknowledge both the Old Testament and the New Testament
A person who is quickminded is described as linghuo spiritliving a medicine that is very effective is called wanlingtan an allspiritpill
According to some studies, the best languages are Chinese, English, Greek, and Hebrew; the latter two were used by God in revealing His word
We were born into a realm of speaking, we live in a realm of speaking, and we are accustomed to being in a realm of speaking
The Bible says that God created man in His image, and the most important aspect of God's image is that God speaks; thus, man also speaks
The husband usually sits and observes, but the wife unceasingly takes care of various matters and gives orders, so naturally she speaks more
If the wife does not say a word the whole day, then it will be hard for the husband and the wife to live together
Although there are billions of people on the earth, there are not any two people who have exactly the same voice
In speaking, everyone has his own particular voice, tone, manner, and wording; even more, each is distinctly different in expression
After a person has given a message, no one else can duplicate it because the words of a person are just the person himself
In the Bible there is such a verse which says, 'In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God'
The book of Hebrews tells us that our God is a speaking God; He not only spoke in old times, but He is still speaking today
When the people of the world do business, their success or failure depends on whether or not they know how to speak
Those who know how to talk will get the business, and those who talk improperly or inadequately will not get the business
In the Old Testament the psalmist praised the Lord for His word, saying, 'Your word is a lamp to my feet / And a light to my path'
In Matthew 4:4 the Lord Jesus said, 'Man shall not live on bread alone, but on every word that proceeds out through the mouth of God'
Peter 1:23 says, 'Having been regenerated not of corruptible seed but of incorruptible, through the living and abiding word of God'
God's word is like the rainwater; for the seed to grow, it still needs to be watered with God's word as the rain
It is exceedingly marvelous that the word of God is life and also the seed of life; moreover, it is the rain that waters this seed
We see that the word of God is life the seed of life and the rain which waters the seed even more it is the dew which moistens the plants
The sword is used for dealing with our self to discern the thoughts and intentions of our heart, that is, to divide our soul and our spirit
The unsaved people, and even the saved ones who do not have the word of God, may confuse the soul and the spirit
When we quietly read the Word of God, regardless of which chapter or verse, we will be able to clearly discern our spirit from our soul
It was just Psalm 19, which says, 'The heavens declare the glory of God, / And the firmament proclaims the work of His hands'
If he had not had this kind of reading and praying in the morning, the soul and the spirit within him could not have been divided
He learned a secret so that the next time he encountered a cause for reasoning, he would quickly return to his spirit to pray
On the other hand, for the church to be strong and normal, built up, spiritual, and mature in life, we must speak the word of God
Sometimes because we are confused, we mix up the spirit and the soul and are unable to discern one from the other
God's word is also a sharp sword which defeats Satan for us, divides our spirit from our soul, and deals with our flesh
The law first talks about the holiness of God, then the righteousness of God, then the love of God, and finally the light of God
The first four commandments speak of God's holiness; they were written according to God's attribute of holiness
If we analyze the Ten Commandments, we will see that their basic points are God's holiness, God's righteousness, God's love, and God's light
As human beings, we are deeply fallen and improper, yet from the time we are young, none of us wants to be a failure, despised by others
We all want to be honorable, outstanding, respected, and distinguished; this is according to the holy nature of God
Because when God created man, He created him according to the image of what He is-love, light, holiness, and righteousness
Because God is a God of love, light, holiness, and righteousness, He created man with love, light, holiness and righteousness
Aside from the Bible, there is no other book that has been spread universally in so many different kinds of dialects
The Bible is among nearly every race, people, and tongue, and there are Christians among nearly every human race, people, and tongue
The New Testament says that Christians are people who have been called 'out of every tribe and tongue and people and nation'
Not only do we have His image in love light holiness and righteousness but we also represent Him and have His image in our ability to speak
According to Genesis 1:26, God created us not only that we might have His image but even more that we might rule for Him
It was an angel who spoke first, and it was an angel who announced the good news first; thereafter, we must preach the gospel
The Chinese character for soul is formed by two radicals: one radical denotes demon while the other denotes say or speak
Since we all have been begotten of God, within us we ought to have the 'God' tone; whatever we speak, we speak about God
Although we became fallen once we are regenerated and our spirit is made alive we are doubly able to speak for God even more able than Adam
Today whether in our daily walk or in our various activities in the church, Christ is our wisdom and our power
When God's word came upon someone and when this one opened his mouth to speak God's word, this one was then a prophet
If a person did not have God coming upon him, and if he did not speak God or speak for God, he was merely an ordinary person
He would become a prophet, however, immediately after he opened his mouth to speak God, to speak God's words, and to speak for God
We have to know that in the Old Testament there were no self-appointed prophets, nor were there prophets designated by men
God then told him to gather from among the elders of the Israelites seventy persons and to bring them to the tent of meeting
The two who did not come to the tent of meeting but remained in their own tents also began to prophesy in the camp
We know that when Paul wrote the Epistles in the New Testament, many of his words were derived from the Old Testament
We see that this concept is consistent in both the Old and New Testaments- God wants His people to speak for Him
The pope gave an order saying that the Bible was too sacred and beyond the understanding of the ordinary people
They could not read it nor interpret it; only the pope and the few archbishops under him had the ability to understand it
We have to see that where the work of the Lord is, there must also be the literature work for the spread and release of the Lord's word
Although Martin Luther took the lead to unlock the Bible five hundred years ago, the Bible had not been fully interpreted by then
They saw the meaning of the great human image in Daniel chapter two, the four beasts in chapter seven, and the seventy weeks in chapter nine
Through their understanding and knowledge of these three matters, they were able to open up the book of Revelation
Ever since the Lord's recovery started in China, we have paid much attention to studying the truth and the Bible
We have read deeply into church history and thoroughly researched the various important schools of interpretation of the Bible
We may say that the Lord's recovery today has passed through Luther, Zinzendorf, the Brethren, and now it has reached us
Although we have not seen as many things as they first saw, the things we have seen are high and were seen from a high position
The reason the Bible has been opened to us today is that God wants us to speak, and He wants us to speak His word
In the history of the propagation of the Bible, the Bible was locked up at first by the Catholic Church for about one thousand years, from A
During the Reformation the Bible was released, and one hundred and fifty years ago it was interpreted through the Brethren
Today the so-called proper and orthodox teachings of Protestant Christianity are all influenced by the teachings of the Brethren
When the other Christians saw our brothers and sisters praying so confidently, they were astonished and asked, 'Are all of you pastors'?
We did this week after week and year after year; apart from the pastor, we did not hear anyone else who could preach or pray
In Christianity the pastors are those who specialize in prayer and Bible reading while all the other people do not have the ability to speak
The Bible has been released from the chains of Catholicism through Luther and interpreted through the Brethren
In our meetings we should not have one person speaking and the rest just listening; rather, everyone should speak
There are some Christians today who believe that we can express God by our behavior alone and without speaking
Regardless of whether we are in the office, in school, or in the midst of our relatives and friends, we need to speak
In this way, perhaps after half a month, your colleagues may come and invite you to a Saturday or Sunday dancing party
After two weeks when they are planning to have a dancing party, they will not come to you, so you are naturally separated from among them
If you do not declare and if you do not speak, you leave a back door for Satan to come in and for you to slip out
Once you have declared and spoken, not only is the back door closed, but every other door is also closed; then you have protected yourself
We all need to be experienced in the deeper word of God so that when needed we may have the words with which to speak for God
What we should emphasize after the changing of the system is teaching the saints the truth according to a certain line of lessons
The twenty-seven books of the New Testament in particular have all been interpreted for us, and the truths are quite clear
It is best to announce at the Lord's table what will be read the next Lord's Day and to ask the saints to bring the Life-studies
Almost everywhere in the world there is the custom of resting from work on the Lord's Day; everyone has a day of vacation and rest
We have to utilize the Lord's Day morning to diligently work on the truth, speak the truth, and teach the truth
In this way, after three to five years the saints among us will have made great progress in knowing, speaking, and explaining the truth
If we depend only on the preachers to speak and minister the word, the word will be very limited and very restricted
We have to see that the Christian meeting is not a so-called worship service but a gathering for all to prophesy, to speak Christ
We thank the Lord that in the church there are many older saints, because without them the church would not have any descendants
Christianity has fallen into such a pitiful condition that the Lord has no position and no freedom to speak there
All the chapels and cathedrals, whether big or small, have been constructed in a way that causes people to remain silent
Consequently, the believers not only do not know how to preach the word, they do not even know how to pray and do not dare to pray
When Paul wrote 1 Corinthians chapters twelve through fourteen, he inserted chapter thirteen to speak about love
Rather, the Christian meeting is for speaking, for everyone to speak the word of God, for everyone to 'play ball'
In chapter twelve Paul mentioned a total of nine items concerning the manifestation of the Spirit in the believers
Some of the believers may say the reason they do not speak is not that they do not want to speak but that they do not know what to speak
Maybe they would introduce you to only one item or perhaps five or ten items, but they would not bring out all the items
The Life-study of the New Testament alone contains more than 1,200 topics, and if we count the pages, there are more than ten thousand pages
Today the problem is not that there are no balls rather the problem is that we do not know how to select a ball nor do we know how to use it
The way of everyone speaking is too hard; let us go back to the way of one person speaking and the rest listening'
How we hope that every one of us would have a ball in our hands and know how to use it, and that we all would play using the same ball
In 1 Corinthians 12 Paul said that we are not worshipping dumb idols, but we are speaking in the Spirit of God
When we come to the meeting, we must be in the Spirit of God, because when we are in the Spirit of God we cannot and will not be dumb
They feel that they are the younger generation, so they are nervous and scared and wait for the older ones to open their mouths first
When the young people come to a meeting, they have to take the initiative to exercise their spirit and say, 'Hallelujah!
Even if you held him by his throat to force him to say it, he might not be able to say it because Satan is there
When we talk to people about Chinese philosophers such as Confucius and Wang Yang-ming, they feel glorious and honored
Paul told the Corinthians that whenever they meet, instead of worshipping the dumb idols, they should speak in the Holy Spirit
It would be good if we changed exhibiting Christ to speaking Christ, because in speaking Christ we surely cannot be dumb
The two most important items of the manifestation of the Spirit in the believers are the word of wisdom and the word of knowledge
They have not seen however that although 1 Corinthians talks about the spiritual gifts it actually depreciates their value to almost nothing
Those in the Pentecostal movement absolutely do not have these; they have neither the word of wisdom nor the word or knowledge
Today those who are engaged in the Pentecostal movement are unceasingly speaking in tongues and interpreting the tongues
Although different languages are used, such as Chinese and English, their intonations are the same, and the phrases are almost identical
A later research found out that in America there is a school for prophesying which specializes in teaching people these techniques
Corinthians 128 says For to one through the Spirit a word of wisdom is given and to another a word of knowledge according to the same Spirit
The word of wisdom is mainly out of our spirit through revelation; the word of knowledge is mainly out of our understanding through teaching
The word of wisdom concerns the deep things of Christ, and the word of knowledge concerns the general knowledge of God and of Christ
The coming together mentioned in verse 26 should refer to the big meetings of the whole church gathered together
Paul tells us that in the meeting each one has a psalm, has a teaching, has a revelation, has a tongue, or has an interpretation
The first three items are a psalm, a teaching, and a revelation; among these three, a teaching and a revelation are matters of speaking
Of course, psalms are for singing; however, according to the New Testament, psalms are even more for speaking to one another
If a language has not reached a stage of maturity, it cannot produce poems and songs, which are very powerful for the expression of feelings
Let us exhibit Christ, / Let us exhibit Christ; / We'll bring His surplus to the church / And thus exhibit Christ'
We can practice different ways until we become skillful, just as basketball players can pass the ball on the court in various ways
In the New Testament when Christians meet together, they should bring the riches of Christ to exhibit them together
The tongue-speaking here is not the so-called sound of the tongue and prophesying as practiced by the Pentecostal people
What Paul speaks about here, whether a teaching, a revelation, a tongue, or an interpretation, all ought to be the speaking of Christ
We must labor on Christ, our good land, that we may reap some produce of His riches to bring to the church meeting and offer
The Lord not only gives us the permission and the position; He also gives us the ability so that we 'can all prophesy one by one'
Every one of the saints should speak for the Lord by prophesying, but the elders need to take the lead in speaking
When the ball comes to your hands, you have to pass it on quickly so that ultimately the ball can go into the basket
When you speak in the meeting, do not speak too long nor speak too many times; after speaking once, you should wait and let others speak
We should always remember that each of us is just a member of the Body and that there are still many other saints in the meeting
There is a meaningful cartoon which is an appropriate picture of laboring, depicting how hard the children in Taiwan study
Many of us know that the education in Taiwan is widespread, yet its standard is higher than most other countries
The elders should not be at ease; they must take great pains to study the Bible, and their families must wait on them and support them
The elders' family members must give them a great deal of help so that they may wholeheartedly enter into the Lord's word
The elders still have to spend their effort and take the lead in this matter so that the younger generation can follow and also enter in
To say that the purpose of the Christian meeting is for speaking is altogether against traditional Christianity
According to traditional Christianity, the Christian meeting is called tso-li-pai in Chinese, which literally means 'doing a worship'
The Chinese have expressions such as tso-fan , tso-i-fu , tso-chia-shih , tso-kung-k'e , tso-hsueh-wen , tso-cho-tzu , and tso-i-tzu
It indicates that the early believers met together not only in the temple but also in their homes, from house to house
We believe that what they taught was surely based on the truths they heard from Peter and John, and they taught from house to house
On the one hand they taught the truths and on the other hand they announced the gospel furthermore they did these things from house to house
The actions of the believers on the day of Pentecost were altogether the actions of the Holy Spirit who was poured out upon them
Peter answered, 'Repent and each one of you be baptized upon the name of Jesus Christ for the forgiveness of your sins'
After they were baptized, they began to have big meetings in the temple and also small meetings from house to house
On the one hand, there were the big meetings in the temple, and on the other hand, there were the small meetings from house to house
In these small meetings held from house to house the newly saved ones can function comfortably be preserved and learn to take care of others
In Acts 2 Peter spoke about Christ's death and resurrection based on the prophecies in the Old Testament concerning Christ
If these three thousand people had been divided into groups of six, they would have formed five hundred groups
In the big meeting every Lord's Day, only one person speaks and the rest just listen; everyone merely attends a worship service
We are very clear that man can never create or originate anything; man can only produce something by first studying and learning about it
No one can improve God's creation, whether it is the heavens and the earth created by God or the features of man
If the nose of a man were moved and placed on top of his eyes or the lips were placed upon the eyebrows, would that be functional?
They had hoped to be the leading sisters of some home meetings, ones who were called 'home responsible ones' at that time
Some among them were very spiritual, but due to certain improper family situations, they were not assigned to be responsible ones
Greatly disappointed, these sisters were not able to eat well and sleep well for a few weeks, and their meeting life became abnormal
Ever since the meetings in Taiwan went through the change in the system last year, the emphasis has no longer been on the big meetings
Everybody was surprised upon hearing this, wondering how they could have a meeting without someone taking the lead
We saw that firstly when the Lord Jesus was on the earth He Himself appointed twelve apostles but He did not establish a leader among them
Brothers, look for seven well-attested men from among you, full of the Spirit and of wisdom, whom we will appoint over this need'
From this portion of the Bible we do not see the apostles selecting one out of the seven to be the 'head deacon'
According to the human concept, there ought to be a leader, but there is no record in the Bible of such a thing
Going further, we saw that in 1 Timothy Paul charged the elders concerning many things, saying that the elders should be this and that
From these three portions we clearly see and can boldly say that in the Bible there is neither a head apostle a head elder nor a head deacon
According to Acts chapters two and five, the way to meet as Christians developed from the way the Jews met in the Old Testament
Later, the people of Israel in their degradation were taken captive and carried away to foreign lands, far from the holy temple
After the birth of the Lord Jesus and while John the Baptist was going forth to preach the word, these synagogues still existed
If out of ten thousand who came, five hundred were saved and baptized, these five hundred then would be given to the church
Among the saints at that time, about one hundred and twenty, such as Peter and Mary, were somewhat experienced
We need to do this at the very beginning of the church life; otherwise, once a habit is formed, it will be hard to change in the future
We absolutely believe that if the churches would divide into small groups in a good way, we could bring in thousands of saved ones
Some Christian meetings seem to be church meetings, but they do not possess the definite nature of the church meetings
We should use this day to release the truth, just like the Lord Jesus did in preaching on the Sabbath in the synagogues
We should use the Lord's Day to have big meetings for the release of the truth or for gospel preaching to gain people
Releasing the truth includes preaching the gospel, leading people to salvation, edifying the saints, and helping them to grow in life
We cannot condemn people who have this habit, because the Lord Himself went to preach in the synagogues on the Sabbath
He went not to keep the Sabbath, nor to read the Scriptures; He went into the synagogues to take the opportunity to release the truth
Regardless of what we do, on the Lord's Day we should have a meeting in the meeting hall for people to worship God and listen to a sermon
More than thirty years ago in Taiwan we brought in many young people within one or two years, and almost all of them were college graduates
We not only know spiritual addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division, we have even learned algebra and calculus
We have to go one step further and ask ourselves if we could teach others the truth, such as the meaning of justification by faith
When you go home, no matter how much they oppose, they cannot completely refuse to listen since you are their granddaughter
After a period of time, when you go home and see your grandparents again, you can speak to them about the God of glory, the unique God
Your grandmother, who previously opposed you, may 'run out of steam' and may not oppose you that much any more
The problem is that we, the saved ones, only go to church every week and listen to 'famous preachers' but do not properly attend classes
We can imagine that the students who graduated from this school would have surely heard a lot but probably they would have no real abilities
We have to change our system; instead of listening to 'famous speakers,' we must properly attend classes and seriously learn the truth
To help us learn the truth, we have specifically assigned three co-workers to form an editorial group to compile a book called Truth Lessons
Four lessons will be covered every month, and the lessons for every three months will be combined into one volume
We should teach the brothers and sisters one lesson after another, and there should be different levels of classes
The first level should be one class, the second level, another class, the third level, another class, and the fourth level, another class
We should prepare different classrooms so that all the saints can receive the education of the truth according to their own need
The problem, however, is that some of the saints have reacted, saying that they do not know how to speak and to teach
Concerning this matter, we have considered holding a training and a presentation of teaching methods for the teachers of the truth lessons
If the church has one thousand saints and all of them learn the truth and preach the truth, then the truth will surely prevail
Besides this, after every baptism we should immediately arrange a new believers' edification meeting for the newly baptized ones
In this way every week we would have three meetings: the Lord's table, the prayer meeting, and the small group meeting
We do not need to spend too much time to read; the best way is to read one message thoroughly in twenty or thirty minutes
We could let everybody know a week ahead so that they could prepare the pertinent books to be read together in the meeting
In this way, for fifty-two weeks a year, on fifty-two Lord's Days, we could have fifty-two life-supplying messages
In this way every week the saints will gain one life-supplying message and also learn some spiritual principles for service
Although we may use materials published by the Taiwan Gospel Book Room, this does not mean that we should let go of the Bible
That book can surely supply a great deal of gospel material, and it can also provide us with many points and lines on the gospel
We all must enter into the depths of the truth; otherwise, we will not be able to minister to the saints in the meeting
When a teacher is teaching, he cannot just talk as he does ordinarily, speaking words 'off the top of his head'
In his preparation, he must prepare according to the textbook; he cannot just gather any material he likes outside of the textbook
You have to enter into the depths; then eventually the content of your speaking will be the riches of the truth
Regardless of what we speak about, we need to utter and express it with words; therefore, we need to have the knowledge of the truth
If there were no truth, how could our understanding be opened, therefore making it possible for us to experience Christ?
We all know that we are very rich in truth; however, the degree or level of our knowledge of the truth is not very high
The church in Taipei has about 5,000 saints who meet regularly, which is about one half of the number for all of the churches in Taiwan
Among nearly one hundred churches in Taiwan the number of those who regularly meet and those who alternately meet with us is less than 15000
After less than one year since we changed the system, we already have more than 3,000 newly baptized ones in Taipei alone
There are over 2,000 who are still outside of the church life; thus, there is the need for us to go and speak to them
Even the people on the street could become your friends; after you talk to them for three or five minutes, they become your friends
When we say that they are those who belong to the denominations, it sounds like they are of one sect and we are of another
We need to pursue the truth seriously and be constituted with the words of the truth so that we may all go out and speak for God
Every small home should have eight to ten people, so one thousand homes will have eight to ten thousand people
Suppose the parents keep all the children at home with them, so that the sons never marry and the daughters are never given in marriage
When three get married, there will be three units for reproduction; when seven get married, there will be seven units for reproduction
In the Lord's Day morning meetings there will be no fear of having no one to give a message for the ministry of the word
The disciples were scattered among various towns and villages, and they all announced the word of God as the gospel
After the disciples were dispersed, not only did they quickly spread throughout all of Judea, but they also reached Samaria
If the local churches today would all practice this way, then the gospel would be preached rapidly throughout the entire earth
What we have fellowshipped should not be made into rules and regulations to be observed accordingly one by one
Not only so, we also need to help the saints so that they all could go forth and be prophets speaking for the Lord
He must protect against insects, that is, he must prevent the insects from eating up the tender sprouts in the field
While some of the insects are easy to deal with, others are very hard to deal with and cannot be killed regardless of how hard you try
In Song of Songs the Lord says, 'Catch the foxes for us, / The little foxes, / That ruin the vineyards / While our vineyards are in blossom'
They particularly eat the flower buds; they do not eat the leaves or the stem, but they specifically eat the best and most tender parts
The little foxes do not come when the vine is not in blossom; it is when the vine is in blossom that they come
An error which we who work for the Lord most easily make is that we like to give messages according to our preference
On the one hand, we prefer to give messages which fit our taste; on the other hand, we prefer not to speak others' messages
In Paul's time, the 'different things' referred first to the law, which was of and according to the Old Testament
All these are according to the Old Testament, but they are things which are different from the New Testament economy
From the fourteen Epistles written by Paul we can see that the focus of the messages he preached was Christ and the church
That year there was a great deal of fellowship; letters from different localities were continually flooding in
All these letters however repeatedly referred to things such as leaving the denominations baptism head covering and the breaking of bread
He said, 'Christ is the head of every man, and the man is the head of the woman, and God is the head of Christ'
Some pastors even say that the scriptural way is to go and be baptized in the river of Jordan as the Lord Jesus was
Even more absurd is that some in the United States are discussing how many times a person should be immersed-once or three times?
By the Lord's mercy, we have not preached anything other than Christ and the church in our speaking and in our publications
In other words, we only preach that Christ as the mystery of God expresses God and that the church as the mystery of Christ expresses Christ
At the time of Paul there were some who did not preach this economy; therefore, Paul charged Timothy to pay attention to this matter
In the same way, some of our so-called co-workers also do not like to speak about God's economy; they like to speak only their own messages
Although we do not harbor any evil intentions against each other, everyone is speaking according to his own preference
There is a very good Greek dictionary-Theological Dictionary of the New Testament-which explains every word in the New Testament
He also gives clear explanations of how the words were used when the Greek language pervaded the Mediterranean region
The first period, from 1922 to 1952, covers the first thirty years, which was the period of Brother Nee's ministry
In 1922 Brother Nee started the first meeting of the Lord's recovery in Foochow, and in 1952 he was put into prison
The thousands of messages we have spoken, regardless of how they were presented, were all concerning the economy of God
We need to see what marvelous riches the Lord has given us and that what He wants us to preach is His economy only
Anything we speak apart from this economy is a different teaching and will result in much damage to the Lord's recovery
The common illness of the elders is that they love to be the head; they often feel that they are the owner and boss of their local church
The Lord Jesus called these disciples together and said to them, 'You know that the rulers of the Gentiles lord it over them
You must realize that from that day onward, you have not become the first lady; rather, you have become the servant-lady
Brothers, you also have to be clear that even though you may have been used by the Lord to raise up a church, you cannot be the king there
The brothers not only should not be the head in the church, but even at home they should not assume the headship all the time
The elders not only must not be the head and must not assume a position; furthermore, they must not monopolize and must not control
The best way is for the elders to assign tasks to the saints and then to be responsible only to oversee them from the side
The hidden meaning in his answer is that he is the only one who can clean the restrooms well, and therefore he has to do it himself
The mother may be assured that even if their cooking is so poor that they turn the rice into paste, it is still all right
If there had been such an arrangement, there would have been no confusion, and it also would have been very convenient
There is not just one person serving in the meeting hall; rather, there may be over a hundred serving ones there
When the Corinthians were saying there that they were of Paul, of Apollos, of Cephas, or of Christ, Paul condemned them in his Epistle
Some may speak just once in the meeting, yet their speaking lasts thirty-five minutes; this is also not proper
He told the congregation, 'While our brother keeps on praying without end, do not stop him, but let us just be dismissed'
Each team has five players, so there are ten people playing in the game, but they have only one ball and can use only that ball
If while we are speaking in the meeting, we become aware that no one is saying amen, then we must stop our speaking as soon as possible
We have to care for the atmosphere of the meeting, and we also must care for others' feelings and not waste others' time
For this we must be familiar with the hymns and study the Bible well so that we can meet the need of the meeting
In addition, we should avoid doing and speaking anything habitually without caring about whether or not others are edified
In these years, although the churches have been increasing and spreading, the increase and the spread have been too slow
Businessmen know that if they cannot make a profit of $1,000 with $10,000 in a year, then they should close their business
The establishment of a business's operational direction must be decided according to accounting and statistics
If this situation persists, then even after two hundred years, the Lord's recovery still will not have a way to progress and spread
There is no problem on the Lord's side for the churches in the recovery to increase and spread; the problem is on our side
May we all bow our heads and pray, 'O Lord, forgive us; we have limited You too much, and we have failed You in too many matters
If one of the contestants runs very fast and the other runs very slow, then they will easily fall and be unable to rise up again
How our future will be and how the church will advance both depend on how we cooperate and coordinate with the Lord
If we have much prayer, much pursuing of the truth, and much entering into the truth, we will have more knowledge and experience of the Lord
We will have more supply, the number of saved ones will naturally increase, and the power to retain them will be strong
According to our past experience in Taiwan, only about five out of one hundred people who were baptized remained
In other words, out of one hundred children who were born, ninety-five died prematurely and only five remained
We therefore picked up the burden to study how to nourish and bring to maturity the newly saved ones after they are baptized
The urgent need at present is to find a way to retain and feed the newly baptized ones so that they may be perfected and may grow in life
For each new one there should be at least one brother or sister who regularly meets and takes care of that one new one
Of course, it would be best if the newly saved ones voluntarily and regularly came to the meetings after their baptism
According to our observation, however, most of the newly saved ones are not enthusiastic about attending the meetings
They may come this week and not come the next two weeks, or they may come for two weeks and then stop coming for the next three months
In the past we would go to see the new believers in person or call them on the phone and repeatedly ask them to come to the meetings
As a result, they would get disgusted and refuse to take our calls because they felt that we were trying to force them to do something
Caring for the new believers requires us to continue steadfastly, not forcing people, pushing people, or compelling people
Every time we go to see them, we should give them a small amount of truth, a small amount of food, and we should pray together with them
We should not go to people to drag them to the meetings; rather, we have to go to be with them, meeting with them in their homes
And we remain silent, without a word and unable to answer, then he will not get any help and may even be stumbled
Man has an inner desire to seek for knowledge, so we must try our best to satisfy the needs of the saints regarding the truth
When we speak the truth and minister life to people, this brings out the desire and longing within them for the truth
Although we cannot say that we will be able to retain one hundred percent, at least we will retain seventy percent
It is impossible to depend only upon the elders to do this; every one of us must rise up and enter into the depths of the truth
In the past we had a co-worker who was a Manchurian and a member of the Kuomintang, the Chinese Nationalist Party
He thought that Christianity was a completely Western religion and that it was a tool used by imperialism to invade China
No one preached the gospel to him, but he was remorseful to such a great extent that he rolled on the ground, weeping and crying
In this way, little by little over an extended period of time, your parents will be impressed and eventually will be saved
My brother, who was four years younger than I, saw this and was very much moved, so he also started to read the Bible and was clearly saved
If the person hearing these words is your father, he might think, 'It does not seem too bad that my child believes in such a religion
It's incredible that he can actually speak such words as 'the law of the Spirit of life,' 'the law of sin and of death,' and 'eternal life'
If we only speak such things, then people will be disgusted and will have a negative reaction; besides, these things are too low and shallow
The more burden we have, the more results we will have, and the more results we have, the more we will be encouraged
We should not simply say that the Lord Jesus is wonderful, and that believing in the Lord Jesus will give people peace
At that time he had not yet believed in the Lord but there was a believer a brother who loved the Lord very much who was working under him
After the manager threw away one tract, the brother would place another one; every day the brother would place a new tract
We have to find opportunities to preach the truth to our relatives, including our uncles, aunts, grandparents, and cousins
The problem today is that our knowledge of the truth is not sufficient and that we do not know how to introduce the truth to people
We Christians often are very foolish because we do not know how to bring out the treasures in the Bible to show to people
Today although the number of Christians is not so great, neither is it that small, so we will always be able to meet some
When we are speaking with others, we should not give them the sense that we are teachers or that we are speaking with a teaching attitude
At the same time we will also surely have the burden to preach the gospel to our relatives, friends, and neighbors
Of course, we will also care for the Christians we meet, releasing the truth to them and supplying them with life
