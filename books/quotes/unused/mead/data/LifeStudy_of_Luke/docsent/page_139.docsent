   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>TERMINATION AND GERMINATION</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>We have seen that the Lord Jesus unveiled His death and resurrection to His disciples three times 9:22; 9:44-45; 18:31-34 .</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Why did the Savior reveal His death and resurrection to His disciples?</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The full answer to this question requires the fourteen Epistles of Paul.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The Lord s death involves the termination of His followers.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The followers of the Man-Savior were all in the old creation, and it was necessary for this old creation to be brought to the cross and terminated.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>After the termination of the cross, there is germination.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>For germination there is the need of resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Therefore, it was necessary for the Lord to die and then to be resurrected.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>He died to bring His followers into termination, and He resurrected to bring them into a new life.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>When the Lord unveiled His death and resurrection to His disciples, He seemed to be telling them, If you remain in the old creation, you cannot enjoy the jubilee.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>In order to enjoy the jubilee you must be a new creation.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>You need to be re-created.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>For this, you first need to be terminated, and then you need to be germinated.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>In this way you will become a new creation.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The jubilee is not for the old creation; it is for the new creation.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>If you would participate in the jubilee, you need to go with Me to the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>In Mark we have the thought of universal replacement.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>But in Luke we have the thought of termination and germination.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>When we have the termination of the old creation and the germination of the redeemed ones to be a new creation, we shall be in the jubilee.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>RENOUNCING EARTHLY POSSESSIONS BY RECEIVING</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>THE MAN-SAVIOR AS OUR DYNAMIC SALVATION</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>In the Gospel of Luke the Man-Savior emphasizes the dealing with riches and material possessions.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>We see this emphasis in the case of Zaccheus, who said to the Lord, Behold, the half of my possessions, Lord, I give to the poor; and if I have taken anything from anyone by false accusations, I restore four times as much 19:8 .</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Zaccheus could renounce riches and material things because he received the living Savior as his dynamic salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>This indicates that it is not by our old creation that we can renounce material things.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Even if we could do this by the old creation, this would not mean anything.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The way to renounce earthly possessions is to receive the living Savior to be our dynamic salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Zaccheus did not hear the Lord s messages concerning money and material possessions.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>He was not present when the Lord spoke about this in chapters twelve, fourteen, sixteen, seventeen, and eighteen.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>However, Zaccheus received the Man-Savior as his dynamic salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Therefore, automatically and spontaneously he could give half of his possessions to the poor.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Today sinners also need the Man-Savior to be infused into them as the all-inclusive Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>When the Lord is infused into people in this way, He becomes their dynamic salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The case of Zaccheus is an illustration of the richness and all-inclusiveness of the Gospel of Luke.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>In these messages I can do little more than give you some hints how to study this book.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>I encourage you to spend more time to delve into the riches of this Gospel.</S>
