   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>LESSON FOUR CONSECRATION</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>This lesson is concerning consecration.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Every person should enter through the gate of consecration as soon as he is saved in order to walk the way of consecration.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>We will consider seven aspects of consecration.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>THE CONTINUATION OF SALVATION</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Salvation is the beginning of a person s spiritual life, not the conclusion.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>When a person is saved, he is saved once and for all; his salvation is eternal.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>However, being saved is merely a spiritual birth, a person s spiritual beginning.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>In the Old Testament, when the Israelites held the passover in Egypt, God told them to count that month as the first month, the beginning of the year.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Even though it was not the first month of the year, they changed their calendar because God wanted them to consider the passover month as the beginning of the year.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Once a person is saved, he has a new beginning before God.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>This is a new day in life.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>A person s physical birth is the day on which he was begotten by his parents.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>His spiritual birth is the day he was saved and regenerated.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Therefore, salvation is a beginning, not a conclusion.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>After a beginning, there should be a continuation.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>This continuation is to present oneself to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Consecrating oneself to the Lord is the continuation of salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>There is a clear type of this step in the Old Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Exodus 12 is a record of the Israelites keeping the passover.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>In chapter 13 God required the children of Israel to sanctify their firstborn unto Him because they were saved through the passover.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Whoever is saved by God should belong to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>In other words, a person should offer himself to God as soon as he is saved.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>We should never think that our initial salvation is a conclusion.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>We should be clear that it is only a beginning.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>After being saved, we need to go on step by step.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The first step is offering oneself to God.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>THE NEED FOR GROWTH</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>A believer who wants to walk the way of the Lord, grow in life, and allow God to work thoroughly in him needs to offer himself to God.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>He needs to offer himself to God in order to enjoy all the riches in God s salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Walking the Way of the Lord</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Needing Consecration</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>As soon as we are saved, God places us on His way so that we can follow Him.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>In order to follow Him we need to give ourselves entirely to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>We should say, From now on I want to be led by You.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>I will no longer walk my own way; instead, I want to walk Your way.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>I will no longer decide for myself in any matter; I want You to lead me in everything.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>I put myself completely in Your hands to let You plan and determine every step of my way.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>I do not want to choose my own way.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>I put myself in Your hands; take me and lead me on.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>In order to receive God s leading, we need to have a definite consecration.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The Lord cannot guide us if we do not entrust ourselves into His hands.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Growth in Life Needing Consecration</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Once we are saved, there is another life in us that needs to grow.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>We need to give this life the opportunity to develop so that it can grow daily.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Therefore, our emotion must be handed over to the Lord, our mind must be touched by the Lord, and our will must surrender to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Then the life in us will have an opportunity to develop.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Every living organism needs a good environment in order to grow properly.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Suppose we place one baby chicken in a good environment and another in a poor environment.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>The one in the good environment will grow to be big and strong, and the other will be small and weak.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>This also applies to plant life.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>If two trees are planted at the same time in different environments, the one in the good environment will grow tall, and the one in the poor environment will be stunted.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>The difference in their growth is mainly due to the environment.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>All believers receive the same life of God.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>However, some experience much growth in life even though they have only been saved for one or two years.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>There are also those who have been saved for many years but who have little growth in life; rather, they seem to be withered and old.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>This is because some people consecrated themselves to the Lord immediately after they were saved.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Thus, the life within them had an opportunity to develop.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>The others kept themselves in their own hands instead of offering themselves to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>They did not give the Lord s life an opportunity to develop in them.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>A thorough consecration to the Lord activates the function of the life within us, making it lively and strong and causing the sense of life to become sensitive.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Before consecrating ourselves, we did not feel it was wrong to do certain things.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>After consecrating ourselves, however, the sense of life causes us to feel that these same things are wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Before our consecration we were confused, unable to discern what was of God.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>But after a thorough consecration, the function of the inner law of life is immediately manifested.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Whenever we touch anything that is not of God, the law of life within us operates to give us the feeling that this is not of God; it is apart from God.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Similarly, when we touch something of God, this law of life manifests its function, giving us the deep feeling that we have touched something that is pleasing to God.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Therefore, the manifestation of the law of life and the growth of the sense of life enable the life in us to grow gradually.</S>
