   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>A PREFIGURE OF CHURCH HISTORY</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The history of the tabernacle with the ark is a prefigure of church history, giving us a full portrait of the course and situation of the church from the very beginning to the present time.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>There are five main aspects: 1 The Church with Christ in It</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In the beginning the tabernacle contained the ark.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>As God's dwelling-place, the two were one.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>That was normal.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The tabernacle was the very expression, and the ark was the content.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>This prefigures the first stage of the church: Christ was contained in the church; the church was the expression of Christ, and Christ was the very content of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>On the day of Pentecost Christ was in the church.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>At that day Christ was the ark and the church was the tabernacle.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>That was the absolutely normal condition.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>2 The Church without Christ in It</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>History reveals that this wonderful situation, this pleasant prospect of the ark contained in the tabernacle, did not last long.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The ark was captured because of the failure of the people of God.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The ark was separated from the tabernacle, and the tabernacle became empty.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>This portrays the failures of the Christians causing the church to lose the reality and presence of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>This is the second aspect, the second situation.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Christ as the very content was separated from the church, and the church became an empty vessel, just an outward expression with no inward reality.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>In principle, this sort of abnormal situation has been existing for many centuries.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Even today, many so-called Christian churches are empty tabernacles without Christ in them as the reality.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The biggest problem today is the so-called church without Christ's presence within it.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>How much of Christ do you sense when you attend some "church" services?</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>When I was young, I attended two different kinds of so-called churches, and I must confess that not once did I have the sense of meeting Christ in their services.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Because of the sins of Christians and the failures of churches, Christ has departed from many so-called churches.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>All that remains is an empty tabernacle.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>3 Christ without the Church</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The third situation prefigured in the Old Testament is that of the ark without the tabernacle.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Firstly in the house of Abinadab at Kirjath-jearim for twenty years 1 Sam 7:1-2 and then in the house of Obed-edom the Gittite for three months 2 Sam 6:10-12 the ark was apart from the tabernacle.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The blessing of God came upon Obed-edom's house because of the ark's presence, yet the tabernacle was still in Shiloh, separated from the ark.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>This third condition when compared with the second is much better.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>However, it is still not normal.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Church history reveals that from the second century to the present time there have been many Obed-edoms.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>There have been many persons with the reality and presence of Christ in their personal lives.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The ark was with them, but this was not the normal state.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Throughout church history there have consistently been these two conditions.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>There has always been the situation of Shiloh, that of the tabernacle without the ark.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>That is the condition of the so-called formal churches they are the tabernacle without the reality, without Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>And there have also been so many dear Obed-edoms, people with Christ in their lives and Christ in their homes.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>If you were confronted with these two conditions, which would you choose?</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Would you go to Shiloh, to the empty tabernacle?</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Or would you take the ark?</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>When Solomon was a young king, he thought that if he would worship by offering his offerings to the Lord he must do it at the tabernacle.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>So he went to Gibeon which possibly was another name for Shiloh with his people to offer sacrifices to God.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>He was using his natural understanding apart from revelation or vision.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>At Gibeon Shiloh the Lord appeared to Solomon in the night and asked him what he desired.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Solomon requested wisdom from the Lord, and the Lord truly answered him.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The next morning when Solomon awakened, he had the wisdom: he became clear that he was not in the right place.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>He had to return to the ark.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>He had received wisdom in a vision 2 Chron 1:3-13; 1 Kings 3:15 .</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Both conditions, the tabernacle without the ark and the ark apart from the tabernacle are abnormal.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>But comparatively speaking, the first is worse than the second.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>When you are confronted by these two conditions, you must go to the ark rather than to the empty tabernacle.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>However, the ark alone will not give full satisfaction, for it is only one-half of the total picture.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>The best, normal, and satisfying situation is that of the ark within the tabernacle.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Many Christians readily agree to go to Obed-edom's house, to the place where Christ is.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>They think that as long as they have Christ, everything is all right.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>But this is not completely right.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>You have the content, but you do not have the vessel; you have the reality without the expression.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>You still need a proper church, a proper tabernacle.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>The ark is important, but you still need a tabernacle.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Christ is the reality, but you still need the church as the expression of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>If Christ is separated from the church, it is better to choose Christ; but this is still an abnormal situation.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>We must have the church with Christ within it.</S>
