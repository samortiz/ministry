   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Your Name Be Sanctified</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Following this there are three things that we have to ask for: Your name be sanctified, Your kingdom come, Your will be done, as in heaven, so also on earth.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>First we ask, Your name be sanctified.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In the Bible, the words sanctification, holiness, and separation are the same word in Greek.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>It means to set apart a person or a thing unto God.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Whether we set ourselves apart or are set apart by someone, being set apart means to be sanctified.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>There are two aspects to our sanctification.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The first is positional and objective.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>For example, men can be sanctified:</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>1 Aaron and his sons.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Exodus 28:41 says, And shalt anoint them, and consecrate them, and sanctify them, that they may minister unto me in the priest s office.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Here we have the sanctification of Aaron and his sons.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>2 The firstborn.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Exodus 13:2 says, Sanctify unto me all the firstborn, whatsoever openeth the womb among the children of Israel, both of man and of beast: it is mine.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Here we have the sanctification of the firstborn of Israel.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>3 The saints.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Acts 9:13 says, Lord, I have heard from many concerning this man, how many evil things he has done to Your saints in Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The term saints shows that the disciples are sanctified.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>4 The wife, the husband, and the children.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>First Corinthians 7:14 says, For the unbelieving husband is sanctified by the wife, and the unbelieving wife is sanctified by the brother; otherwise your children are unclean, but now they are holy.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Here the husband and the wife are sanctified.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The Bible also mentions things being sanctified.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>1 Food.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Leviticus 21:8 says, You shall sanctify him, for he offers the food of your God.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>2 Every creature of God.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>First Timothy 4:5 says, For it every creature of God is sanctified through the word of God and intercession.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The above verses show us that both food and every creature of God can be sanctified.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Furthermore, the Bible also mentions places being sanctified.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>1 Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Matthew 4:5 uses the phrase holy city, showing that Jerusalem is sanctified.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>2 The temple.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Matthew 23:17 refers to the temple being sanctified.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>3 The altar.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Matthew 23:17 and 19 say, The temple which sanctifies the gold...the altar which sanctifies the gift.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>This speaks first of the temple and altar being sanctified, and then of the gold and gift being sanctified through the sanctification of the temple and the altar.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The second aspect of sanctification is experiential and subjective.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>It is sanctifying God s name through one s life.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>1 The Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Matthew 4:10 says, Then Jesus said to him, Go away, Satan!</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>For it is written, You shall worship the Lord your God, and Him only shall you serve.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>God s name is sanctified before Satan through the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>2 Enosh.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Genesis 4:26 says, And to Seth, to him also there was born a son; and he called his name Enosh: then began men to call upon the name of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>God s name was sanctified before men through Enosh.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>3 Abraham.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Genesis 14:22 says, And Abram said to the king of Sodom, I have lifted up mine hand unto the Lord, the most high God, the possessor of heaven and earth.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>God s name was sanctified before the king of Sodom through Abraham.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>He called God the most high God.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Genesis 21:32-33, Thus they made a covenant at Beersheba: then Abimelech rose up, and Phichol the chief captain of his host, and they returned into the land of the Philistines.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>And Abraham planted a grove in Beer-sheba, and called there on the name of the Lord, the everlasting God.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>In verse 33 God s name was again sanctified through Abraham.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>He called God the everlasting God.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>4 Isaac.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Genesis 26:28 says, And they Abimelech, his friend Ahuzzath, and Phichol the chief captain of his army said, We saw certainly that the Lord was with thee: and we said, Let there be now an oath betwixt us, even betwixt us and thee, and let us make a covenant with thee.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>God s name was sanctified before Abimelech through Isaac.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>5 Jacob.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Genesis 30:27 says, And Laban said unto him, I pray thee, if I have found favor in thine eyes, tarry: for I have learned by experience that the Lord hath blessed me for thy sake.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>God s name was sanctified before Laban through Jacob.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>6 Joseph.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Genesis 39:9 says, There is none greater in this house than I; neither hath he Potiphar kept back any thing from me but thee, because thou art his wife: how then can I do this great wickedness, and sin against God?</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>God s name was sanctified before Potiphar through Joseph.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>7 David.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>First Samuel 17:46 says, This day will the Lord deliver thee into mine hand; and I will smite thee, and take thine head from thee; and I will give the carcasses of the host of the Philistines this day unto the fowls of the air, and to the wild beasts of the earth; that all the earth may know that there is a God in Israel.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>God s name was sanctified before Goliath through David.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>8 Samson.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Judges 16:28 says, And Samson called on Jehovah and said, O Lord Jehovah, remember me, I pray; and strengthen me, I pray, this one time only, O God, that I may be avenged of the Philistines at once for my two eyes.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>God s name was sanctified before the Philistines through Samson.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>9 Elijah.</S>

   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>The Lord s name was sanctified before Paul s companions through Paul.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>Hence, sanctifying God s name is making God s name distinct in the ear of the hearer from all other names who are not God, such as the devil John 8:44 , the stomach Phil 3:19 , and idols Isa 36:19 .</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>Sanctifying God s name is to make His name distinct whenever it is mentioned.</S>
