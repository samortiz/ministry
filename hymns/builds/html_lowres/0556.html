Rightly do they love you.<br><b>fn 1 </b>In her pursuing of Christ for satisfaction, the lover of Christ asks Him to draw her that she and her companions (we) may run after Him. For the accomplishing of His eternal economy, God created man in His own image so that man may express Him (Gen. 1:26). He also created man with a spirit so that man may receive Him and contain Him (Gen. 2:7; Zech. 12:1), and with a heart that seeks God Himself so that God can be man's satisfaction (Eccl. 3:11). Although man fell away from God, and sin through Satan came in to frustrate man from receiving God for his satisfaction, the desire for God, the seeking for God, still remains in man's heart. This book tells us the unique way to be properly satisfied with God-to pursue and gain Christ (Phil. 3:7-14), who as the very embodiment and reality of God (Col. 2:9; John 1:18) came to earth that man might receive Him for satisfaction. Cf. Eccl. 1:2 and note 2.<br><div style='height:5px'></div>

For your love is better than wine.<br><b>fn 1 par 1 </b>The kisses of the mouth are the most intimate kisses. This yearning to be kissed by Christ is a response to Christ's cheering love, which is better than wine (v. 2b), and to His charming name (equivalent to His person), which is like ointment (the all-inclusive, compound, life-giving Spirit as the realization of Christ's person-1 Cor. 15:45; Exo. 30:23-25 and note 251) poured forth with the pleasant fragrance of the anointing oils (v. 3a). No one can resist Christ's cheering love and His charming person (cf. Matt. 4:18-20).<br><div style='height:5px'></div>

At this point the lover and Christ are not one but are separated. There is a controversy between her and Christ. The lover cares only for her satisfaction, not for His will, intention, or goal.<br><div style='height:5px'></div>

The death of Christ, the resurrection of Christ, and the Spirit of Christ always go together (John 19:34; 1 Cor. 15:45; Rom. 8:9, 11, 13). His death goes along with His resurrection, and His Spirit is the realization of His resurrection. The way to gain Christ and enjoy Him is to experience Him in His death and in His resurrection and to remain in His Spirit, who is in our spirit (Rom. 8:16).<br>The lover gains Christ (Phil. 3:8) and enjoys Him privately (at night) in His death (a bundle of myrrh) in her embracing Him with love and faith (breasts-1 Tim. 1:14; 1 Thes. 5:8). She also gains and enjoys Him publicly in His resurrection (a cluster of henna flowers-v. 14) in the churches of Christ (vineyards) built on the fountain of His redemption (En-gedi-see note 141), which fountain is the Spirit.<br><div style='height:5px'></div>
