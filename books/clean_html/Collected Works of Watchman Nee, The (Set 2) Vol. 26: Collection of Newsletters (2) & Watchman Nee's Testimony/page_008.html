<h2 class="head1">THE EXPERIENCE OF THE MEETING<br />IN CHEN HSIA KUAN IN P'ING YANG, CHEKIANG PROVINCE</h2><p>(1) Before there was a meeting here, we listened to the Word and worshipped in the meeting in the Ao Nei denomination. At that time I listened to the Word, but I did not know that Jesus was crucified for me or that He died and lives for me. All we wanted was to change our behavior a little. Thank God, in 1928 Brothers Wang, Ts'ai, and a few other good servants of the Lord came from Wu Tai and Tai Sun to meet with us in Ts'uo Tze. At that time I heard that Jesus died on the cross for us to bear our all and shed His blood to cleanse away our sins. I immediately received, believed, and was saved. I was not only saved but also revived. I was not the only one who was revived. There were several other brothers who were revived at the same time. Every Wednesday and Friday evening at 5:30 we went to Ao Nei for a two-hour prayer meeting and walked back home. It was a trip of more than ten miles over narrow paths and mountain roads. We returned home at 11:30. One brother told us that before he believed in the Lord, he could not walk five miles in half a day. After he believed in the Lord and was saved and revived, he could walk more than twenty miles with us on foot every Wednesday and Friday to the meetings. It was more than six hours round trip. This was truly the power of God overshadowing him. There are some other brothers who have been attending the prayer meeting for more than a year now. Thank God!</p><p>(2) In 1929 a few of us discussed the possibility of having a prayer meeting in our own locality. At that time the brothers were all in one accord and went immediately to rent a place for the prayer meeting. On Wednesday and Friday more than ten people, including old ones, young ones, men and women, met to pray. After discussing the situation, everyone prayed and waited before the Lord. Thank God for His marvelousness. At that time there was a five-room tiled house in which a demon had appeared. Nobody lived in it, and it was for sale for a very good price. They wanted one hundred twenty dollars. We had very few people and most were poor. We could not borrow money from other churches. We prayed before God; each person did his best. We wrote down our own offering and placed it in the offering box. Some for one, two, three, ten, twenty, thirty, fifty, or one hundred dollars. After adding them all up, it totaled two hundred dollars. The brothers then purchased this house. The house is about ten miles from Chen Hsia Kuan. Later, we set a time to tear down the old house. All the work was done by the brothers in the Lord. God gave us another miracle. The five-room house of wood and tile was torn down in one day. We carried the building materials, totaling more than two hundred baskets, to the river by hand and transported them by boat to Chen Hsia Kuan.</p><p>(3) In 1930 a four-room tiled house was temporarily completed. The entire cost came to four hundred fifty dollars. Thank God. We do not know where the money came from. We never expected God's grace to be so great. In our human mentality, we wanted a two-room straw thatched house. Who could have guessed that God would prepare a four-room tiled house for us to meet in? God really does everything beyond what we ask or think.</p><p>(4) We began meeting in September of 1930. There were six brothers in the table meeting. There were more than twenty people who came to the gospel meetings. Now there are sixteen in the table meeting and more than sixty in the gospel meeting. God has cast out demons and healed sicknesses in many places. Now many people want to come hear the gospel. I ask the brothers and sisters in every place to pray for us. Peace in the Lord!</p><p>From,<br />Wu Tze Chien<br />June 18, 1934</p>
