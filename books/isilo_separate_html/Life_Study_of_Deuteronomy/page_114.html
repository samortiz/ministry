His anger would burn against them, and He would hide His face from them (v. 17a). They would be devoured, and many evils and troubles would befall them because of all the evil they had done, for they turned to other gods (vv. 17b-18).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>C.

Jehovah would bring them into the land flowing with milk and honey, and they would eat and become satisfied and grow fat, and they would turn to other gods and serve them and despise Jehovah and break His covenant (v. 20). When many evils and troubles befell them, this song would respond as a witness before them because it would not be forgotten in the mouth of their seed; for He knew their intention before He brought them into the land (v. 21). So Moses wrote this song and taught it to the children of Israel (v. 22).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>D.
