   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE TESTIMONY TO BE MAINTAINED</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>At the beginning of 1935 a few co-workers felt that the trend of leaving the denominations was not correct, because it involved many complicated issues.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Therefore, Brother Nee spoke to the co-workers to clarify the matter of our testimony.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>He said that leaving the denominations is not our testimony; rather, our testimony is Christ: Christ as the Savior, Christ as life, Christ as the conquering King, Christ as the Lord of all things, Christ as God s centrality, and Christ as God s universality.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>He also pointed out that the testimony of Christ is absolutely in the church and that the church is one and the ground of the church is local.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>All these matters were made very clear.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>In 1937 Brother Nee spoke further on how to maintain the Lord s testimony by establishing churches locality by locality.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>These messages were collected and published in Rethinking the Work, now published with the title The Normal Christian Church Life.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The Lord raised us up in the East to maintain the testimony of Christ being expressed in the church.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Such a testimony includes saving people and making them spiritual.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>It also includes the building up of the saints, locality by locality, to be a corporate dwelling place of God and the Body of Christ so that Christ can be expressed through this corporate vessel.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Although the church is expressed in different localities, all the local churches should be one in testimony and have fellowship with one another.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>This is what the Lord showed us, and this is the testimony He wants us to maintain.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>THE LORD S SPECIAL COMMISSION TO US</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>We acknowledge that God has used different ways and many workers to save thousands of people.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Not so much with us as with others, God has done much related to salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>In fact, we need to learn from others concerning the many ways to lead people to salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>God has also done much related to life through others, and their work was quite good.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>This is true in the Western world and also in China.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The Lord has done much in the East and in the West related to helping people to be spiritual, to consecrate themselves, to love Him, to live before Him, to fear Him, and to walk with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>However, the Lord has given us a special commission related to one church in one locality, the building, and the expression of the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Besides us, no one else has paid attention to these matters.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>We are the only ones who have paid attention to these matters, and we are even opposed because of this.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>We have been attacked by many outsiders mainly because of these points.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>They say that it is sufficient to save others and help them to be spiritual but that there is no need to be concerned about meeting and being built up in every locality to be the expression of Christ s Body.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>They argue that if we would simply be concerned about salvation and spirituality, there would be no problems concerning denominations, the church, and the ground of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>They argue that people could be saved in the Catholic Church and in the Presbyterian Church and that they could also be spiritual in the Catholic Church and in the Presbyterian Church.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Some believers feel that they could be spiritual on their own; they also feel that since they were spiritual, they could be united to be one in the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Some of those who have felt this way have included Mr. Chia, the top pastor in the Presbyterian Church, Mr. Kao, the top pastor in the Quaker Church, and Mr. Cheng, a spiritual Christian worker.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>They were all very spiritual.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>They thought that since they were in Christ and in the Holy Spirit, they could be united to form a spiritual group that would take care of the work together.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>So they published a magazine called The Spiritual Light and invited Sister Ruth Lee to be the editor.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>In 1925, after seeing the oneness of the church and the sin of denominationalism, Sister Ruth Lee was no longer willing to serve as the editor and decided to resign.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The pastors, however, did not agree.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Later when the Chinese Nationalist government was engaged in a fight against the warlords, some Communist soldiers in the Nationalist army burned the church buildings in Nanking and arrested the preachers.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The office of The Spiritual Light was not spared.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>I respected these spiritual people.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>I can still testify with a pure conscience that they were devout Christians who lived in the Lord s presence.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>However, the ground of locality and the building up of the Body of Christ are not simply matters that we minister; they are related to our testimony.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>I have spoken with both Pastor Chia and Pastor Cheng.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>I could only humbly receive their spiritual instruction, confessing that they were God-fearing, spiritual, senior brothers who lived in the presence of God.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>However, they neither knew nor understood that God has commissioned us with the testimony of the local expression of the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>They even exhorted me not to insist on this point.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Once in 1937 I happened to be on the same train with Pastor Cheng.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Though I cannot remember the details of our conversation, I do remember that he exhorted me not to be so insistent.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>He said that it is good enough for us to preach the gospel diligently to save souls and to speak the truth of God for others to be nurtured and perfected.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>He said that this is the highest point of a Christian.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>His attitude was sincere, and he truly treasured and admired us.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>From our manner of speaking and our attitude, he knew that we were clear concerning the truth and had a firm foundation.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Therefore, Pastor Cheng and even Pastor Chia treasured us.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>We also respected them greatly before the Lord as we would respect our seniors.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>We also had fellowship with a Pastor Ting, and we respected him.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Pastor Ting was in his seventies when I was in my thirties.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>He was an elderly person living in the Lord s presence.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>We respected him and loved him, and he also loved and treasured us.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>These elderly brothers felt that it was precious that young people like us were willing to forsake our future and live for the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>They highly regarded us.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>However, they always felt that we were too much.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>They once indicated that we were the top group among the Chinese Christians and that if we would change and take the middle road, we would become the center of the churches in China, and the future of the churches in China would depend on us.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>According to their view, we were extreme in our attitude.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>However, we saw that the Lord s testimony is dispensational.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>These elderly believers saw something in their generation, but it was not the Lord s intention for us to keep the testimony of their generation.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>The Lord is moving, and He desires to advance.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>For this reason, although we respected their portion, we knew that God desired to take another step in China.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>The Lord desires more than personal salvation and spirituality; He desires to work out the testimony of His Body, the testimony of the church, in locality after locality so that He can gain a corporate vessel for His expression.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>This is what the Lord showed us more than twenty years ago.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Over the past twenty years, we have had many experiences and have suffered many blows.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Even though we were somewhat affected by them, we have not given up the testimony entrusted to us.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>There have been spiritual persons and evangelical giants who have influenced us.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>We were inferior to them in the power of the gospel and also concerning certain spiritual matters.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Nevertheless, we felt that we had a testimony to maintain.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Sometimes we wondered whether we were extreme.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>We wondered why those who had power in the gospel and those who were spiritual would not pay attention to the testimony of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>We were often tested in this matter.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>However, we can testify that we became clearer every time we were tested.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>Today the Lord s intention on earth is not merely to gain souls or spiritual persons; rather, His desire is to build up His corporate testimony in every locality.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>We are very clear concerning this.</S>
