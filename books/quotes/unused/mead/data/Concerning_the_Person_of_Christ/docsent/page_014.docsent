   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Finally, in Matthew 26:63-64 before His crucifixion the high priest who was judging Him asked Him if He was the Son of God.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>On one hand, the Lord answered, You said it!</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Yet, on the other hand, He still called Himself the Son of Man, holding firmly to His human status.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Besides this, His birth, His living and actions on earth all prove that He is a man: Philip saw Him as the son of Joseph, from Nazareth, a real man John 1:45 .</S>

   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>These facts strongly prove that He is absolutely a man, not a bit different from an ordinary man.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>He reclined at the table and ate with men just like an ordinary man Matt 9:10-11; Luke 7:36; John 12:2 .</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>When He was crucified, the soldiers divided His garments John 19:23-24 , thus proving that He put on clothing just like a normal human being.</S>

   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>He wept as did those who were present at that time John 11:33, 35 .</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>He laid aside His garments; and taking a towel, He girded Himself poured water into the basin and began to wash the disciples' feet and to wipe them with the towel with which He was girded John 13:4-5 .</S>

   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The Lord was a man, not only while He was on earth before His death, but even after His resurrection, His ascension to heaven, and His coming again in the future, He still is and forever will be a man in eternity.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>After His resurrection He appeared to His disciples and said to them, Behold my hands and my feet.</S>

   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>And when he had thus spoken, he showed them his hands and his feet.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>And they gave him a piece of a broiled fish, and of a honeycomb.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>And he took it, and did eat before them Luke 24:39-43 .</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>This proves that after His resurrection He is still a man, has flesh and bones, and eats like a man.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>He told the high priest, Henceforth you shall see the Son of Man sitting at the right hand of power Matt 26:64 .</S>

   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Again, in Matthew 26:64 He says, You shall see the Son of Man coming on the clouds of heaven.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>This means when He comes again in the future He is still a man.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>He said to Nathanael, You shall see heaven opened and the angels of God ascending and descending on the Son of Man John 1:51 .</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>This describes His condition in the future, in eternity.</S>
