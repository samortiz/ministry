   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>D. Not through the Short Way,</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>but through the Roundabout Way</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>As the Lord guided the children of Israel, He did not lead them to take the short way.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Instead, He led them to take a roundabout way, a way that may have seemed like a detour.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>We would expect the children of Israel to go straight through the land of the Philistines to the good land.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>However, 13:17 says, God led them not through the way of the land of the Philistines, although that was near; for God said, Lest peradventure the people repent when they see war, and they return to Egypt.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Because of the possibility of war with the Philistines, God did not lead the children of Israel along that way.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>As 13:20 indicates, they took their journey from Succoth, and encamped in Etham, in the edge of the wilderness.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>According to the human mentality, the Lord s leading of His people was strange and even foolish.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>If we had been God, we certainly would have led the people by another way, in order to avoid the possibility of pursuit by Pharaoh.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>God, however, led His people by the long way.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>As we shall see in a forthcoming message, this tempted Pharaoh to pursue them.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>God seemed to be mistaken in the way He led His people.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Actually, the Lord s leading is never mistaken.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Whatever way God leads is right.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>He is never wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Exodus 13:18 says, But God led the people about, through the way of the wilderness of the Red Sea.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The Hebrew language here indicates that God turned the people around.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>By the pillar of fire and the pillar of cloud He led them in a roundabout way.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>A number of times in my Christian life, God has led me in ways that I thought were mistaken.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>But I have come to worship the Lord for His leading.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>His leading is always right.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>From our human point of view, we may think that He should lead us a certain way.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>But if He had taken us that way, there would have been no lessons for us to learn.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>On the contrary, we may be in danger of returning to Egypt.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Therefore, God leads us to take an indirect way, even a long detour.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Because the children of Israel were led this way, eventually they had to wander in the wilderness for thirty-eight years.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Much of this time they went around and around in circles.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>This is also the experience of many Christians today.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>They go around in circles, with no apparent progress.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>However, through this kind of traveling we learn important lessons, as the books of Numbers and Deuteronomy make clear.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>We may expect to be led in a straight way, but God instead leads us to take a roundabout way, a detour.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>He even causes us to cross the Red Sea and then to travel through a great and terrible wilderness.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>In the past I read a book entitled Straight Paths for the Children of God.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>However, often there are no straight paths for God s people.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>When we most expect God to take a straight way, He causes us to take a detour.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Within the course of several years we may have a number of detours.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>However, by these detours we are helped, equipped, educated, trained, and disciplined.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>This is the reason God does not lead us along straight paths.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>When I was young, I appreciated that book on straight paths for the children of God.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>But I no longer value it because, in my Christian experience, I have learned that the Lord often leads us through detours.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Consider the journeying of the children of Israel in the wilderness.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Did they take a straight path?</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>No, their way was full of detours.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>However, they themselves did not choose to make these detours.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>They were led by the Lord s presence in the cloud and in the fire.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>E. By Himself in the Pillar of Cloud by Day</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>and in the Pillar of Fire by Night</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Exodus 13:21 and 22 say, And Jehovah went before them by day in a pillar of a cloud, to lead them the way; and by night in a pillar of fire, to give them light; to go by day and night: He took not away the pillar of the cloud by day, nor the pillar of fire by night, from before the people Heb .</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>The two pillars actually are one.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>When night comes, the cloud becomes the fire.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>But when day dawns, the fire becomes the cloud.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Nevertheless, the fire and the cloud are one.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>In typology, the cloud signifies the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>As He reaches us, the Spirit of God is like a cloud.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>The fire here signifies the Word of God, which is a light to us.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Hence, the instant, living guidance that God gives us comes either through the Spirit or the Word.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>When the sky is clear, He is the cloud.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>But when the sky is dark, He is the fire.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>When the Lord leads as a pillar of fire by night, the light from this pillar causes the night to become day.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>In this way the children of Israel could journey day and night.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>In the Christian life there should be no difference between day and night.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Actually, we Christians should not have any night in our life with the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Instead, our night should turn into day.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>If we have a night that does not turn into day, we are defeated.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Whenever we are in darkness and are sleeping, we experience a night in our life as Christians.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>But when we call on the name of the Lord, we are enlightened, and our night becomes day.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Both the cloud and the fire are symbols of God, for He is both the Spirit and the Word.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Furthermore, the Word is also the Spirit John 6:63; Eph 6:17 .</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>The Lord, the Spirit, and the Word are one to lead us and guide us continually.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>When we are clear, God guides us through the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>But when we are not clear, He guides us through the Word.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>As the Word is made clear to us, it becomes the Spirit in our experience.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>Whether as the cloud or the fire, God s guidance is always a pillar.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>In the Bible a pillar denotes strength.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>Hence, God s guidance is strong; it stands upright and supports weight.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>By means of such definite guidance God led the children of Israel.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>We need to thank the Lord for all the details presented in Exodus 13.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>Here we see substitution for sanctification, the day of memorial, and the beginning of a new life without sin.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>Here we also see the resurrection life in which we enjoy the Lord s presence for guidance as the pillar of cloud and as the pillar of fire.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>Let us worship the Lord for His leading, even when He leads us, not in a straight way, but in a roundabout way.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>Praise Him for all the detours!</S>
