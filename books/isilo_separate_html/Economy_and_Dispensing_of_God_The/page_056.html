This threefold dispensing is like a three-way lamp, which has a threefold intensification.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>1.

The Father Being in All the Believers<br>to Indwell Them as the Spirit,<br>the Reaching of the Divine Dispensing</H2><P>With the Father also we have a threefold dispensing (Eph. 4:6). First, He is over all the believers to overshadow them; then, He is through all of them to take care of them; and last, He is in all of them to indwell them. As the One who is over all the believers, He is the Father as the source of the divine dispensing; as the One who is through all the believers, He is the Son as the course of the divine dispensing; and as the One who is in all the believers, He is the Spirit as the reaching of the divine dispensing.</P><P>Every day this threefold dispensing is going on within us. The dispensing Triune God will never leave us or allow us to take a leave from Him. We may leave Him, but He will never leave us. Our God is a God full of patience. To Him a thousand years is like one day. Even if we forget about Him for a time, eventually He will still cause us to turn back to Him. It is impossible for a real Christian to give the Lord up, because he has the threefold dispensing of the Triune God, with the Father overshadowing him, the Son taking care of him, and the Spirit indwelling him all the time.</P><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_055.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_057.html">Next</a> </body></html>
