   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>FURTHER DETAILS</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Verse 13 says, Suffering unrighteousness as the wages of unrighteousness, counting luxury in the day to be pleasure; spots and blemishes, reveling in their deceits, feasting together with you.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In verse 13 some manuscripts read receiving the wages of unrighteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Here unrighteousness refers to unrighteous doings.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Peter uses the word unrighteousness in this verse in a governmental way.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>According to verse 13, the false teachers are spots and blemishes.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>This means that the lust-indulging heretics are to genuine believers, who are God s treasure, like spots and blemishes to precious gems.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Furthermore, these false teachers revel in their deceits.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>They are happy, beside themselves with pleasure, whenever they deceive others.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>They revel in the fact that they cause others to be deceived.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Verse 14 continues, Having eyes full of adultery and not ceasing from sin, enticing unstable souls, having a heart practiced in covetousness, children of curse.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>These details also describe the false teachers.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>FORSAKING THE STRAIGHT WAY</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Verse 15 says, Forsaking the straight way, they have gone astray, following the way of Balaam, the son of Beor, who loved the wages of unrighteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The straight way here, as the way of the truth v. 2 and the way of righteousness v. 21 , is to live an upright life without crookedness or bias, without unrighteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Having gone astray, the false teachers followed the way of Balaam.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Balaam was not a false prophet of the Gentiles, but a real prophet.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>However, Balaam was one who loved the wages of unrighteousness Num 22:5, 7; Deut 23:4; Neh 13:2; Rev 2:14 .</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Verse 16 says, But had reproof of his own transgression a dumb beast of burden, speaking with a man s voice, restrained the madness of the prophet.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>This refers to Balaam, who was restrained by a donkey, a beast of burden, speaking with a human voice.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>This verse says that this miraculous speaking restrained the madness of the prophet.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>This indicates that the prophet Balaam was mad in his pursuit of money, in his pursuit of the wages of unrighteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Therefore, God used the miraculous speaking of a beast of burden to restrain him.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>SPRINGS WITHOUT WATER</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>AND MISTS DRIVEN BY A STORM</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Verse 17 continues, These are springs without water and mists driven by a storm, for whom the gloom of darkness has been kept.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Here we see that the heretical teachers are dried up.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>They are springs without water and mists driven by a storm.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>They are waterless clouds carried along by winds Jude 12 , having nothing of life to meet the need of the thirsty ones.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Peter says that the gloom of darkness has been kept for these false teachers.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>This also refers to God s governmental dealing and indicates that a particular place has been prepared for them.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>In verse 18 Peter says, For uttering great swelling words of vanity, they entice by fleshly lusts, in sensuality, those who are barely escaping from them who live in error.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The Greek word rendered sensuality also means licentiousness, as in verse 2.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The word live also means to behave, to conduct themselves.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>SLAVES OF CORRUPTION</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Verse 19 says, Promising freedom to them, while they themselves are slaves of corruption; for by whom anyone has been overcome, by this one he has been enslaved.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>In this verse the Greek word rendered corruption is phthora and denotes corruption unto destruction, destruction that comes with corruption, destroying by means of corrupting.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The false teachers promised freedom, but they themselves are slaves of corruption.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>They have been overcome by Satan, and now they are enslaved by the one who has overcome them.</S>
