   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>In like manner, we have to be conformed to the death of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>By the fellowship of His sufferings, we will be conformed to His death and by this conformity we will be transformed into the same image as Christ; we will be made thoroughly one with Christ.</S>
