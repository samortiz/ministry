Our conscience is the organ for distinguishing good and evil. To distinguish means to have the knowledge. The knowledge to differentiate between good and evil is not the same among many Christians. Some have more knowledge and some have less knowledge, because individual circumstances are not the same and, perhaps, the lessons learned are also not similar. Therefore, we cannot act according to someone else's standard, nor can we expect others to live according to the light we have. In the fellowship between the believer and God, an unknown sin will not hinder the fellowship. If the believer walks according to the standard which he already knows: keeping (obeying) everything which he knows to be according to God's will and rejecting everything which he knows to be condemned by God, he is able to have a complete fellowship with God. A young believer always thinks that his knowledge is insufficient and, therefore, that he cannot please God. On one hand, spiritual knowledge is very high in value, but on the other hand, the lack of knowledge is not an obstruction in the fellowship with God. In God's fellowship with man, He cares about our attitude toward His will, not how much we know concerning His will. If our attitude is to seek after His will sincerely and truly, even desiring to keep it wholeheartedly, the presence of many unknown sins will not cause us to lose our fellowship or even have a limited fellowship with God. If fellowship is determined according to God's holiness, none of the most holy saints from the past until the present time would be qualified to have a complete fellowship with God even for a moment. Furthermore, they would all be driven away from the face of the Lord and from the glory of His might. The sins that we are not aware of have been covered under the precious blood.</P><P>On the other hand, if we are aware of and tolerate a little sin that the conscience has condemned, spontaneously we will not have a full fellowship with God. Just as a very tiny speck in the eye can impede our eyesight and give us pain, a sin that we are aware of, no matter how small, can prevent us from seeing the smiling face of God. Once the conscience has an offense, fellowship will also suffer. A particular sin may remain in the believer for many years, but as long as he does not know about it, it will not hinder his fellowship with God. However, the moment light (knowledge) comes, the conscience condemns. Then if it remains for another day, the fellowship of that day will be lost. God fellowships with us according to the level of our conscience. If we think that a particular sin, which has remained for many years without causing any hindrance, can continue to remain and cause no harm, we are the most foolish persons.</P><P>The reason for this is that the conscience can only condemn according to the most recent light it receives. It cannot condemn any sin that it does not know to be sin. Since there is advancement in the believer's knowledge, his conscience also advances; the more knowledge the believer has, the more sins the conscience will condemn. The believer does not have to grieve for anything that he does not know, nor does he need to strive to do anything. As long as he absolutely submits to what he knows, it is sufficient. "But if we walk in the light," that is, if we walk in the light which we have already, "as He is in the light, we have fellowship with one another, and the blood of Jesus His Son cleanses us from every sin" (even though many are still unknown) (1 John 1:7). God has limitless light, yet God also walks according to His limitless light. The light which we have is very limited, yet we must walk according to this light. Only then can we have fellowship with God, and only then will the blood of His Son cleanse us from all our sins. We still have sins which have not been removed, but if we do not know about them and the light has not yet shone, we are still able to have full fellowship with God. We must remember that even though the conscience is very crucial, the conscience is not the measurement of our holiness because of knowledge. Christ is the unique standard of our holiness. But in our fellowship with God, God uses the matter of having a conscience void of offense as the condition of His fellowship with us. Therefore, after we completely submit to the guidance of the conscience, we should never think, even for a moment, that we are already "perfect." A good conscience only tells us that according to what we know, we have achieved what we should achieve at the present.</P><P>Thus, as our biblical knowledge increases and our spiritual experiences grow, the standard of our conduct will also rise accordingly. In the gradual increase of light, our conduct must become gradually more holy for our conscience to be preserved without offense. Once we have another year of knowledge and experience, our conscience will accuse us if our conduct is the same as the previous year's. In the previous year God did not cut off His fellowship with us, because we were ignorant of our transgressions. But once we have knowledge of the same transgressions, the fellowship with God will be lost if we do not renounce them. The conscience is given by God to the believers to be the present standard of their holiness. If a believer violates the standard, they will be considered as having sinned.</P><P>The Lord still has many things to speak to us, but because of the immaturity of our spiritual understanding, He still has to wait. God deals with His children according to their individual condition. Some matters are considered to be extremely evil and sinful by some believers, yet others may not feel the same way. This is due to differences in the knowledge of their conscience. Therefore, let us not criticize one another. Only the Father God knows how to deal with His children. He certainly does not expect to see His "little children" have the strength of the "young men," or His "young men" to have the experiences of the "fathers." However, He expects all of His children to submit to Him according to what they already know. If we know with certainty --this is not easy --that God has already spoken to our brother's conscience concerning a certain matter, and he does not obey, then we can urge him. But we must never force our brother to follow the feeling of our conscience. If the absolutely holy God did not reject us because of past wrongdoings which we were ignorant about, then how can we, according to our present level, judge our brother who only possesses the knowledge which we had last year?</P><P>In fact, if we are helping others, we do not have to compel them again and again to obey every minor point. We only have to beseech them to walk fully according to the guidance of their conscience. If they have surrendered to God, then whenever the Holy Spirit enlightens them on any of the things clearly recorded in the Bible, they will obey. If the will has been surrendered, then any time the conscience receives light, a believer will walk according to the will of God. This is the same for us. We do not have to extend ourselves to use the strength of the soul to understand many truths for which the right time has not come. As long as we are willing to hear the present speaking of God, this is good enough. If the Holy Spirit wishes to lead us in our intuition to examine some truths, we should not hesitate to comply; otherwise, we would lower our own standard of holiness and become complacent. In short, if we are willing to move according to our spirit, there will be no problem at all.</P><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_037.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_039.html">Next</a> </body></html>
