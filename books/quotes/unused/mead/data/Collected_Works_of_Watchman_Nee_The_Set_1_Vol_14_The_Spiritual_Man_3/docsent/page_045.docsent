   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Therefore, if a believer wants freedom, he must eliminate his foolishness.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In other words, he must know the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Knowing the truth simply means knowing the real condition concerning a matter.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The lies of Satan bind the believer, and the truth of God sets the believer free.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>But there is a problem: in order to know the truth, one needs to pay the price, because this truth will shatter the vainglory which the believer gained from his past experiences.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>He may think that he is making twice as much progress as others, that he is already spiritual, and that he will not make mistakes.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>It is very difficult to make him admit that he may be possessed by the demons or prove to him that he is in fact possessed by the demons!</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>If a believer is not willing to be faithful to all the truth of God, it will be very hard for him to accept the truth that will cause him to suffer and be humbled.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Accepting what one likes is not hard; but accepting the truth that takes away one's vainglory is not so easy.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>However, whoever vehemently resists this truth should be careful lest he be possessed by demons.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>It is easier for him to realize that he can be deceived.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>It is much more difficult for him to realize that he is already possessed and admit that he is possessed!</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>God must grant us the grace.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Otherwise, even if we know the truth, we will still resist it.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>To accept the truth is the first step to salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>We have to be willing to know all the truth concerning ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Nevertheless, it takes humility and honesty to be willing to know the truth concerning our own spiritual and supernatural experiences.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>There are different ways for possessed believers to obtain the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Some have been bound so tightly that they have lost their freedom in everything.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>As a result, this causes them to wake up and realize the truth about themselves.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Some believers obtain the truth because they realize that even though ninety-nine percent of their experience seems to come from God, there is still a tiny portion of wrong elements mixed in. This raises their suspicion and causes them to doubt if their experience is really from God.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Through this they understand the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Some obtain the truth when other believers preach the truth to them and enlighten them concerning the real fact.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>In whatever way a believer obtains the truth, he should never refuse the first ray of light.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Doubting is the first step to acquiring the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>This is not to doubt the Holy Spirit or to doubt God and His word.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>This is to doubt our own past experiences.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>This doubt is necessary and even scriptural because God wants us to prove the spirits 1 John 4:1 .</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>If we believe in something, there is no need to test it; if we have to test it, this means that we cannot decide for certain where it comes from.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>We often have the wrong idea that this kind of testing may offend the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>We do not realize that the Holy Spirit wants us to make such tests.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>If something is of the Holy Spirit, it will still be of the Holy Spirit even though it is tested.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>If it is of evil spirits, it will be exposed as a counterfeit.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Has God caused you to fall into your present position?</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Can there be contradictions in the work of the Holy Spirit?</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Is it possible that you never make any mistakes in all that you do?</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>When a believer receives a little light from the truth, he will admit that it is very possible that he can be deceived.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>This gives the truth a chance to work.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The biggest mistake that a believer can make is to think that he can never be wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Someone else can be wrong, but he can never be wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>This will cause him to be deceived to the end. But after he humbles himself, he will see that he has been deceived.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>If he compares the principle of God's work with the condition of the evil spirits' work, he will see that his past experiences were all received in passivity.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>He fulfilled the condition of the work of evil spirits, and the result was many strange experiences; in the beginning they made him happy, but later they brought him sufferings.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>When he makes a comparison between his past attitude, the principle of God's work, and the condition of the evil spirits' work, he will find that he was not actively co-working with God.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Rather, he was just trying to passively follow God's will.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Therefore, all of his wonderful or frustrating experiences must have come from evil spirits.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Then he will admit that he was deceived.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>A believer must not only receive the truth, he must also acknowledge it.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Only by acknowledging the truth are Satan's lies eliminated.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>A believer's experience should be according to the following steps: 1 he should believe that it is possible for a believer to be deceived; 2 he should particularly believe that it is possible for him to be deceived; 3 he should acknowledge that he is indeed deceived; and 4 then he should go on to ask why he is deceived.</S>
