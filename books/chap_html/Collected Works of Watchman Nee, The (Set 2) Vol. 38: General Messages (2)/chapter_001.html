<h1 class="msg">CHAPTER THIRTY-EIGHT</h1><h1 class="title">THE MAN OF GOD AND THE OLD PROPHET</h1><h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: 1 Kings 13:1-32</h1><p>The story recorded in 1 Kings 13 is a sobering story; it is also a tragic story. In it we see two persons&mdash;a man of God and an old prophet. Both men were used by God, but both had a tragic ending. The lesson we draw from these two men is a very grave one.</p><h2 class="head1">ONE</h2><p>The old prophet was a prophet who was once used by God; however, God could not use him any longer. Jeroboam sinned in Bethel, and God intended to warn him. But He did not ask the old prophet in Bethel to speak for Him; instead, He sent the man of God from Judah to speak for Him. This means that the old prophet could no longer be used by God. The "oldness" of the old prophet does not imply spiritual maturity or the abundance of spiritual experience but staleness. He was no longer useful in the hand of God. When God wanted to speak with Jeroboam, He could only go to the man of God; He could no longer use the old prophet. Man of God implies a person in fellowship with God. Fellowship is the basis of light. Whenever fellowship ceases, light stops. The old prophet had a spiritual history; he was once a prophet. But he lost his fellowship with God and became an old prophet. God could no longer use him. What a sobering thing this is!</p><p>The spiritual condition of many brothers and sisters today is the same as their condition eight or ten years ago. They have not made any spiritual progress before the Lord. Some have a good mind and appear to have made some progress. Actually the progress is not spiritual progress at all. They speak what they do not understand. Even as they are speaking, they do not understand what they are saying. They only have mental knowledge but not genuine light. They have picked up many spiritual terms, but in God's eyes they have not made any genuine spiritual progress at all. Some people received some light ten years ago, and their condition was quite proper before the Lord at that time. But when you meet them ten years later, they do not have any fresh light, and there is no spiritual growth at all. They are prophets, but old prophets through whom God can no longer speak. God is a God who is always working. The Lord said, "My Father is working until now, and I also am working" (John 5:17). The light we received twenty years ago, ten years ago, or even five years ago is not sufficient to be our guide today. If we remain in our past experiences, we will have no way to go on.</p><p>We must pay attention to this one question: How can we not be put aside by the Lord? How can we preserve ourselves from being rejected by the Lord? The question of freshness is a big one before the Lord. The question of spiritual riches is also a big one before the Lord. Many times we are too old and too poor spiritually!</p><h2 class="head1">TWO</h2><p>The old prophet lived in Bethel. What was the condition of Bethel at that time? In Bethel Jeroboam sacrificed to the calves he made, appointed priests of the lowest people, who were not of the sons of Levi, made offerings upon the altar, and burned incense on the days and months that he had devised of his own heart (1 Kings 12:28-33). All these things offended the Lord. Jeroboam was afraid that the people would offer sacrifices in Jerusalem. Therefore, he set up another place of worship outside Jerusalem. He was not worshipping other gods; he was still worshipping the God who led the Israelites out of Egypt. But he worshipped according to his own way outside Jerusalem, and for that the Lord condemned him. He did not sin alone but led many kings into the same sin (see 1 Kings 16:19, 31; 22:52; 2 Kings 13:2, etc.). The sin that Jeroboam committed in Bethel was a very serious sin. The old prophet was living in Bethel, and the acts of Jeroboam were committed before his very eyes, yet he did not consider them as sins. This is too serious! A prophet speaks for God because he understands God's heart's desire. But here was an old prophet who did not understand God's heart's desire. Those who do not know God's heart's desire can never speak for God. God cannot commission anyone to speak for Him who does not know His heart. Therefore, He had to send the man of God.</p><p>The old prophet did not see any sin in the worship at Bethel. This proves that something was wrong with him. Brothers and sisters, do not think that practicing love is being a nice person. There is no such thing. If you think that this and that are good, that it is good to worship God in Jerusalem and equally good to worship in Bethel, you have not seen anything and you are sick. Many people are like the old prophet; their eyes are blinded, and they are sick. They do not see the things that offend God, and they think that it is good to worship God any way they like. They do not understand why it is wrong to worship in Bethel. Brothers and sisters, can you say that this is love? A doctor can care for his patient and love his patient, but he cannot cheat his patient and tell him that he is not sick. If a doctor says that a sick man is not sick, it proves that there is something wrong with the doctor himself; his eyes are blind. The old prophet lived in Bethel, yet he did not see the sin of Bethel. Sin was before him, yet he did not have any feeling for it. What a tragedy this is! How terrible this is!</p>
