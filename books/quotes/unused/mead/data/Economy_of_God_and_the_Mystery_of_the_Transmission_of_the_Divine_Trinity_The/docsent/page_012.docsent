   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>The Coming of the New Jerusalem in Two Stages</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The New Jerusalem is a particular, organic constitution.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Its scale is still quite small in the millennial kingdom because it will be constituted only with the overcomers.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The saints, including those in the Old Testament, who died without being matured are typified by the five foolish virgins.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>That they all died is signified by the virgins becoming drowsy and falling asleep Matt 25:5 .</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In the millennial kingdom God will cast them out into the outer darkness to be dealt with and disciplined 8:12; 22:13; 25:30 .</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Therefore, in the present age, the age of grace, God supplies man with grace.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>However, in the age of the millennial kingdom God will deal with man according to righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>At that time there will be no more grace but only righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>God will deal with His people righteously.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>This dealing is to compel us to receive grace and be matured in this age.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>All God's immature people, whether in the Old Testament or the New Testament, will be cast out into the outer darkness during the millennial kingdom so that they may be dealt with and become matured.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>After they have become matured, the new heaven and new earth will come, and they will be incorporated with the New Jerusalem of the millennial kingdom to be constituted into a great New Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Thus, the coming of the New Jerusalem has two stages: the initial stage as a miniature and the completing stage as the consummation.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The initial coming is in the millennial kingdom, and the complete and full coming is in the new heaven and new earth.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>This is the main content of God's economy.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>THE WAY GOD CARRIES OUT HIS ECONOMY</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>What is the purpose of God in accomplishing His economy?</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>What does He intend to do?</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>In His economy God intends, arranges, and plans to dispense Himself into His chosen, created, called, redeemed, and regenerated people.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Therefore, God firstly chose us before the foundation of the world and then created us in time.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Afterward, He called us and then redeemed us.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>After He redeemed us, He dispensed Himself into us and regenerated us.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Thus, we became those who were not only created by God but also born of Him.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Once we have God in us, we become those who are born of Him.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>We have His life and nature and have become His children John 1:12-13 .</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Hence, God's economy is God's intention, plan, and arrangement, which is also His purpose and His heart's pleasure and delight.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>God's heart's desire and purpose is nothing other than to dispense Himself into His chosen, created, called, redeemed, and regenerated people.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Moreover, He will also sanctify, renew, transform, and conform them.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Eventually, He will glorify His people, bringing them into His glory.</S>
