[1]  It contains ten messages, covering the way for a saved person to progress in life: to be pure in heart, to remove all that covers God s light within him, to confess his sins, to ask for God s enlightenment, to consecrate himself to God, to deal with his conscience, to live before God, and to have a proper service in Christ.
[2]  Second Corinthians 3:16 says, But whenever their heart turns to the Lord, the veil is taken away.
[3]  One who pursues the Lord and wants to participate in His service must bring his heart with him.
[4]  We must see that God only wants our heart; all the other things have to be removed and broken by Him.
[5]  Only when God s life in us spreads from our spirit to every part of our mind, emotion, will, and even to our body, causing our entire being to be filled with God s life completely and making our body a glorious body, will we be entirely spiritual.
[6]  First Corinthians 15 says that this corruptible must put on incorruption v. 53 . Not only will we have God in our spirit and our soul, but we will also have God in our body.
[7]  God wants to work His life into every part of our soul, that is, into our mind, will, and emotion.
[8]  The basic requirement of the work of God is that man must cooperate with God; man must let God work.
[9]  After the couple heard this, they knelt down before God and confessed their sins, saying, O God, forgive us, for we heard the gospel in the past, but we were not willing to receive You.
[10]  Matthew 5:8 says, Blessed are the pure in heart, for they shall see God.
[11]  These two verses reveal that in order for someone to see God and receive His shining, the most important thing is that he must either be one who is already not covered in any way, or he must have his coverings removed.
[12]  The pure in heart shall see God because they are not covered by anything.
[13]  Therefore, the reason man does not receive God s shining is not because God does not shine, but because there is a veil and a covering within man.
[14]  Second Corinthians 3:12-18 is a wonderful portion of the New Testament.
[15]  The removal of the veil does not depend on anything other than turning our heart to the Lord.
[16]  Once a person is saved and becomes a Christian, he should know what steps he needs to take to progress in the Christian life.
[17]  The Bible tells us that after a Christian is saved, he has Christ s life in him.
[18]  Receiving the Lord s life, however, is only the beginning, not the end. To be saved and baptized and to possess Christ s life is the first step of salvation.
[19]  Although a newly saved believer has the Lord s life in him, this life in him is very shallow; he does not yet have much progress in the Lord s life.
[20]  We who are saved should all be serious about taking this way.
[21]  Before the young people are saved, they love to read romance novels, but after they are saved, all these things should either be thrown away or burned.
[22]  This means that he must deal with every situation that is improper in the eyes of the Lord and every matter that is condemned by the Lord.
[23]  Originally, Peter did not realize that he was sinful, but when the Lord shined on him, he immediately said, Depart from me, for I am a sinful man, Lord v. 8 . In the Old Testament Job was one who also did not realize his sins until God shined on him.
[24]  People may be in a variety of conditions when they are enlightened by God.
[25]  Some people do not have a heart for the Lord after they are saved.
[26]  Often, however, when these kind of people are walking on the street or studying, they suddenly have a feeling within them that they should go to God to pray.
[27]  In the beginning they did not have a heart for God, but they were chosen and enlightened by God.
[28]  CHAPTER FIVE CONSECRATING OURSELVES TO THE LORD CONFESSING SINS, DEALING WITH SINS,
[29]  If a Christian wants to grow in life, two things are essential: He must confess his sins thoroughly to the Lord and deal with his sins.
[30]  However, after a person is saved, if he merely confesses his sins before God and deals with his sins before men but does not consecrate himself to God, he has not yet started to walk on the path of life.
[31]  The more we believe, the more we are joined to God; the more we believe, the more we are united with God and the stronger our contact with God is.
[32]  Although some saved ones may not feel very strongly that the Lord is lovely or that they want to love God, within them they still have a little love for the Lord.
[33]  After we are saved, the Lord draws our heart to Himself over and over again in many ways and through different kinds of environments and methods, so that we would tell Him, O Lord, not only do You love me but You are truly lovely.
[34]  Whenever our heart is facing the Lord within, immediately our inner being will be enlightened, and we will know what is the will of God and what is not the will of God.
[35]  If we are willing to give ourselves to God like this, when we pray, our prayer will become very special; when we read the Bible, the Bible will become full of light to us; when we preach the gospel, our gospel preaching will become very powerful.
[36]  Acts 24:16 says, Because of this I also exercise myself to always have a conscience without offense toward God and men.
[37]  Second Timothy 1:3a also mentions, I thank God, whom I serve from my forefathers in a pure conscience.
[38]  The experience of these three matters confessing our sins to God, confessing our mistakes to man, and consecrating ourselves absolutely to God may vary in sequence.
[39]  When man was living before God and had the light of God, the conscience was not used and the function of the conscience was not expressed because man had no need of it before God.
[40]  Man s fall was not a partial fall but a complete fall, and a continual fall.
[41]  Man did not stay under the ruling of the conscience but he continued to fall.
[42]  The lowest point of the fall is that man has to be ruled by other people.
[43]  If a wife has to be ruled by her husband, a husband has to be ruled by his wife, and the children have to be ruled by their parents, then this proves that they are fallen to the uttermost.
[44]  If there are some among us who do such a thing, this does not mean that they are not saved, but at least we can say that they do not live before their conscience.
[45]  Every saved one has to deal with his conscience.
[46]  If he does not deal with his conscience, he will not have peace within.
[47]  If he does not deal with his conscience, he will not be able to pray properly.
[48]  When we were first saved, we may have thought that we had committed only a few small mistakes before God, but after we began to confess these mistakes, we immediately saw many greater sins.
[49]  AND LIVING BEFORE GOD FALLEN MAN NOT BEING GOVERNED
[50]  They may think that these four matters a thorough confession of sins before God, a careful dealing with sins before men, a complete dealing with the conscience, and an absolute consecration to God are too difficult and seem to contradict the word of grace.
[51]  On the one hand, we are told that everything depends on the grace of God and the acts of God, and that we are not required to do anything; on the other hand, we are told that we must thoroughly confess, deal with our sins, and consecrate ourselves to God.
[52]  This experience testifies how great the grace of God is, because it was the grace of God from within which supported my entire being.
[53]  Only when I dealt with my sins did I see how immense the grace of God really is.
[54]  Those who live under man s ruling are in the lowest category of people they do not obey their conscience and do not live before God, but dare to do anything.
[55]  Those who live before God are ruled by God, those who live according to their conscience are ruled by their conscience, and those who live before men are ruled by man.
[56]  These three ways of living living before God, living according to one s conscience, and living before man are called God s rule, self-rule, and man s rule, respectively.
[57]  But if I am one who is learning to live before God and learning to know and deal with my conscience, I will go deeper than the feeling of my conscience and judge according to my spirit, living absolutely before God.
[58]  In the dispensation of law God dealt with man according to the law, demanding man to do everything, but in the dispensation of grace God deals with man by means of grace, desiring man to enjoy everything He has done.
[59]  Another example is that the Old Testament requires man to honor his father and mother Exo 20:12 , and the New Testament also requires man to honor his father and mother Eph 6:2-3 .
[60]  Hence, whenever we read a commandment or a law, we should prostrate ourselves before God and say, O God, I cannot do it.
[61]  THE COMMANDMENTS OF THE NEW TESTAMENT OPENING THE WAY TO THE GRACE OF GOD
[62]  Whenever man realizes that he is poor, he will be open to receive the supply of God s abundant grace.
[63]  In short, every commandment and demand of God is to prove man s inability and incapability.
[64]  Whenever we bring all these commandments and demands to God, He immediately opens the way to transmit His supply to us continually.
[65]  Whenever we receive a command from God, we should bring it back to Him and tell Him, O God, I cannot do it; I give You this command just as the disciples gave You the five loaves and two fish.
[66]  CHAPTER NINE BEING ABLE TO DO ALL THINGS IN CHRIST
[67]  John 15:5 says, I am the vine; you are the branches.
[68]  He who abides in Me and I in him, he bears much fruit; for apart from Me you can do nothing.
[69]  Nevertheless, whether this heart is strong or weak, all the saved ones do have such a heart, unless one never thinks about God or seeks God.
[70]  This does not mean that God wants to gain something good from man, but rather that God has many good things for man, much grace to grant man, and much work to do in man.
[71]  If man does not love God or draw near to Him, God will have no way to do what He desires, so God always desires that man love Him and draw near to Him.
[72]  Every time we feel the love of God and the sweetness of God s love within us, our love toward God spontaneously wells up, and we pray, O God, I love You; my heart is here for You.
[73]  He said that although he was saved when he was young, he did not know the Lord adequately.
[74]  At a time like this, many people may wonder why it is that before they loved God, they did not have any problems; however, now that they love God, their environment has become more difficult.
[75]  In response, she had a heart to respect her husband and be subject to him, so she made a resolution before God, saying, O God, from now on give me the strength that I may respect my husband and submit myself to him.
[76]  If we are not broken, even if we are good, whatever we do will be nothing but our own doing, rather than God s doing it in us and through us, or our doing it through God.
[77]  At this moment, we will live before God, and at this time, God will show us the glorious fact that apart from the Lord we can do nothing.
[78]  Apart from the Lord whatever we do cannot please God.
[79]  Only when the Lord becomes our strength are we able to please God.
[80]  On the one hand, the Bible shows us that we are able to do all things in Him who empowers us Phil 4:13 , and on the other hand, it says that apart from Christ we can do nothing.
[81]  In other words, God is breaking us so that we would not rely on ourselves and would be delivered from the self; He is also showing us that Christ is both our strength and our power.
[82]  It is through this kind of process that our strength goes bankrupt, and it is also through such an experience that God shows us that Christ is our strength and that He is living and powerful within us.
[83]  Then at this very moment God shows us that it is not our own strength but Christ s; it is not we but Christ; it is not our way but Christ s; it is not our wisdom but Christ s. God shows us that we have to put our own effort and methods aside.
[84]  One who serves God must learn to discern three things: desire, intention, and ability.
[85]  This example shows us that once a person loves God, his opinions and proposals will follow and that once his opinions and proposals come, God will suffer.
[86]  For example, if someone loves you according to his own opinion and never pays attention to your feeling, you will only suffer from this kind of love.
[87]  God wants man s heart but not man s opinion.
[88]  In Matthew 16 Peter did have a good intention, yet the Lord said, Get behind Me, Satan! v. 23 . Today many people love the Lord and are zealous for the Lord, but their good intentions have never been broken by the Lord.
[89]  Many times when we do not love the Lord very much, we do not have that many problems, but the more we love the Lord, the more sufferings we have.
[90]  However, when Peter saw the disciple whom the Lord loved, reclining on Jesus breast, his opinion came out again, and he asked, Lord, and what about this man? v. 21 . In response, the Lord dealt with him again, saying, If I want him to remain until I come, what is that to you? You follow Me v. 22 . Before saying this, the Lord also had said to Peter, When you were younger, you girded yourself and walked where you wished; but when you grow old, you will stretch out your hands, and another will gird you and carry you where you do not wish to go v. 18 . The Lord wanted Peter not to pay attention to how other people would be, but to just follow Him.
