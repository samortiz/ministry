<h2 class=head2>A. Explaining God Himself</h2><p>The Bible is God’s words. First, these words explain God Himself. All words are for explanation and expression. The words of the Bible are for the expression and explanation of God Himself. If one does not read or understand the Bible, he will not understand or know God. For example, today, if you do not understand Chinese, you will not know me as a person. You may hear my voice, but you will not know what I am expressing. The Bible as God’s word firstly explains and expresses God Himself.<h2 class=head2>B. Explaining God’s Desire</h2><p>The Bible also explains God’s desire. It explains what is in God’s heart, what He desires, what He longs for, and what He loves and hates. All the interests and desires of God are explained in the Bible. Thank God that we have such a Bible. If we read it from cover to cover, we would know God’s desire. This book not only expresses God Himself but also expresses His desire.<h2 class=head2>C. Explaining God’s Plan</h2><p>The Bible also explains God’s plan. God is not only a God with desire and emotion; He is also a God of plan and accomplishment. If we read through the Bible carefully, we will understand what God plans to do in the universe. Through the Bible, we can understand God’s plan.<h2 class=head2>D. Explaining the Origin of the Universe and of All Things</h2><p>The Bible also explains the origin of the universe and of all things. How was the universe with all the things in it created? How did they come about, and what is the end for them in the future? All this has been clearly explained in the Bible. The mystery of the universe is solved in the Bible. Without the Bible, no one can understand the universe. The universe is indeed a mystery and is incomprehensible to man. Although many astronomers, geologists, and other kinds of scientists have done much research, they do not know what the universe is about. We need the Bible to explain the mystery of the universe.<p>What the Bible explains are these four main things. Of course, if we want to say more, we can say that it also explains the condition of man and points out the way to man’s salvation. But these can be included in the preceding four main things. It explains God Himself. It explains God’s desire. It explains God’s plan. (God’s desire and God’s plan include God’s redemption.) It also explains the universe.<h2 class=head1>II. THE BIBLE BEING GOD’S REVELATION</h2><p>Since the Bible is God’s word, it is God’s revelation. As we mentioned before, the word is the expression and the explanation. As it is the expression and the explanation, it is a revelation. First Peter 1:10-12 says that the prophets who wrote the Bible had received revelation from God. Revelation in the original text means the removing of a veil and the unveiling of the mystery inside.<p>The Bible is the revelation of God. It reveals God Himself, His desire, His plan, and the origin of the universe. Through the Bible, we are shown God Himself, His desire, His plan, and the origin of the universe. If we understand the Bible, we will see God Himself, His desire, His plan, and the origin, the history, and the end of the universe, that is, the complete story of the universe. The whole Bible is the revelation of God. When God removes all the veil and unveils to us what is inside, we have the Bible.
