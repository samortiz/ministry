   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER FOUR PERFECTING THE MEMBERS</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>FOR THEIR FUNCTION Scripture Reading: Eph 4:13-16</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In order to perfect others, the first thing we must do is minister life to them to help them to grow.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Then we must give them the opportunity to serve, that is, to function.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>It is very easy for the bigger members to take all the opportunities.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>It is rather hard, on the other hand, for the younger ones, the smaller ones, to get the opportunity.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Whether or not they get the opportunity to function depends on the attitude and way of the bigger members.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>In addition, we need to teach the members some techniques for functioning.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>NOT REPLACING BUT PERFECTING</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>THE SMALLER MEMBERS</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Humanly speaking it is too easy for a bigger member to replace others.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Whenever a bigger member functions, there is the danger of replacing others, especially the smaller ones.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>This is because the bigger ones think that they can do something that the smaller ones cannot do.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>It is also easy for a member to do something by himself and more difficult to do something with others.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Many times in my Christian life of service, some, especially the sisters, have told me, If I do this, I will do it myself.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Do not let anyone come to bother me.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>When some sisters cook, they say Get out of the kitchen.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Let me do the cooking.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>If you do it, do it yourself, but if I do it, I will do it by myself.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>It is truly hard to bring someone in to help us and learn with us.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>To have an apprentice becomes a problem.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>However, consider the apostle Paul.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>He always had a younger, smaller one such as Timothy or Titus to help him and learn from him.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>We have to keep this principle.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>If we are a member that is bigger than others, we should never replace them.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Rather, we must give others the opportunity to practice and to learn.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Even in the matter of attending the meeting, we need to help the younger ones.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>We may notice that a younger brother has not prayed in the meeting for more than two months.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Perhaps by the Lord s sovereign arrangement he may live close by in the same neighborhood.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>In this case, we need to do something to help this younger brother by having some fellowship about the meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>We may say, Brother, don t you feel that we should pray in the meeting?</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>He may say that he does not know how to pray.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>We may answer, Simply open to the Lord to express something from your spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Brother, may we pray together now?</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>If you do not know how to pray, simply exercise your spirit to touch the Lord and utter something from within.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>When you contact the Lord, you must have the cleansing of the blood of Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>If you feel that you are wrong, then tell that to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>If you feel that you have some failures, confess them to Him and apply His cleansing blood.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Before the Lord s table meeting on the next Lord s Day, we can invite the brother to dinner.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Then we can take the opportunity to help him further.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>We can ask, Brother, are you ready to offer a prayer in the Lord s table meeting?</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>If he says he does not know what to pray, we can explain how the church is are about to come together to remember the Lord, enjoy Him, and partake of Him.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Then we may have a time to pray with him: Lord, help us tonight that we may have something with which to express You.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>In this way we can minister something to the younger brother.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>How much we can teach and minister to such a one depends on how much we learn and experience.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>We all have to learn how to raise up the younger ones.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Before we come to the meeting, we can talk with the young brother and help him to know how to choose a hymn and do various things.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>After this, we come to the meeting and sit with him.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>At a certain point in the meeting, it may be time to announce a particular hymn.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>We can then ask the brother to announce it.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>This may be the first time that he calls a hymn.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>We should open the way for him.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>We can start something, but he should carry it out.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>After another half hour, we may feel that the brother should pray or praise in the meeting, and we can help him to do it.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>After the meeting we can have a little fellowship with him.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>We can read that hymn again with him and explain why it needed to be called at that certain time, and we can explain why he needed to pray at a certain time.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>He will realize something and learn from this.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Then he may ask, Do you think I have prayed in the right way?</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>In doing this, he will open the way for us to give him some correction, instructions, or ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Within a short time of doing this, we will have a graduate.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Then this brother will know how to help others.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>If we know this principle, we can apply it to all the services, even in the small matters.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>This requires that we have a real love for the Lord and a real love and concern for the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>The way to bring all the members into function is not merely by teaching.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Mothers do not mostly teach their children.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Mainly they simply help them.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Then the children learn.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>We have to give the young ones the opportunity to do something.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>The principle is that in whatever we do, we must never replace others.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>All year round we may always pray three or four times in every meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>However, we need to learn how to bring others into this function, not to replace them but to perfect them.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>When we perfect others, we have to minister life to them.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>As I illustrated above, we may share with a brother that he should open himself to the Lord, confess his failures, and contact the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>This is not merely a way but a ministry of life.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>Then to explain why a particular hymn should be announced or why someone should offer a prayer about the Lord s glory at a certain time may be considered a teaching of ways, or techniques.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>With everything and in whatever we do, we have to do it with someone to help us so that they may learn from us.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>In this way we will continually produce and reproduce.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>Then one brother produces many brothers, and those many brothers reproduce another number of brothers and sisters.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>We all need to learn this.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>Spontaneously, there will be a certain kind of realization among us.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>The younger ones will submit to the older ones to be perfected, and the smaller ones will submit to the bigger ones.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>Merely to say that the younger and smaller ones have to submit does not work.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>We cannot make this claim.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>Rather, we must have the proper practice.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>Then spontaneously the younger ones and smaller ones will submit to others to be perfected.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>This depends not as much on the smaller ones as on the bigger ones.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>In everything, in every aspect of the service, we must apply the same principle.</S>
