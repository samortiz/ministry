   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>OBTAINING THAT FOR WHICH WE HAVE BEEN OBTAINED</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The Apostle Paul said, "I pursue, if also I may obtain that for which I have been obtained by Christ Jesus" v. 12, Gk.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>. Christ has obtained us that we may obtain Him.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>One day we repented and believed in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>According to our feeling, we were saved, but according to Christ's realization, we were captured by Him.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Christ has taken possession of us, not that we may go to heaven or be good Christians, but that we may obtain Him.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>We need to pursue Him so that we may lay hold of that for which we have been laid hold of by Him.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Therefore, we should say, "Lord, I thank You for obtaining me.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>You have obtained me so that I may obtain You.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>This was Your purpose in taking possession of me."</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>As we have pointed out, the best way to obtain Christ is to eat Him.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>He desires that we eat more and more of Him.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>In order to eat Christ, we must deny whatever we are, whatever we have, and whatever we are able to do.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>This is the way to obtain that for which we have been obtained by Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>It is not simply a matter of learning Christ, but of taking possession of Him.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>By denying all that we are naturally, we take possession of Him.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>We must deny not only our hatred, but also our love; not only our pride, but also our humility; not only our dullness, but also our intelligence.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The way to enjoy Christ is to deny everything that we are by nature.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>COUNTING ALL THINGS LOSS</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>According to Philippians 3, to deny everything is to count everything loss because of Christ, because of the excellency of the knowledge of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>How excellent Christ is!</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>This excellent knowledge will motivate us to count all things loss.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>We must even deny our knowledge of the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>I have been studying the Bible for more than fifty years, and I have acquired a good deal of Bible knowledge.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>However, if I trust in my knowledge while I am giving a message, that message will amount to nothing.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Every time I speak I have learned to say to the Lord, "Lord, I have nothing.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Even if I have something, it does not count.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Lord, You must come in to be everything.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Lord, You be the speaking, the outline, the points, the instant utterance, and the whole message."</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>When I speak like this, something new is released time after time, and I am the first one to be fed.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>However, if I trust in my knowledge, even the knowledge I received yesterday, I shall not have any nourishment.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>In such a case, I would be trusting in something good that is not Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Again I say, the way for us to enjoy Christ is to deny everything we have and are.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>We must even deny the best spiritual experiences we have had.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The way to eat Christ is to deny everything and to come to Him empty-handed.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>If you empty out your whole being, He will be something new to you.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Paul not only counted all things loss for the sake of Christ, but counted all things as dung.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>According to his accounting, everything meant nothing.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Because he always counted everything loss for the sake of Christ, he constantly enjoyed Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The more things you deny, the more Christ will replace you and the more He becomes your experience and enjoyment.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Our slogan should be this: "Oh, that I may gain Christ!"</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Oh, that we may also obtain that for which we have been obtained by Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The way to obtain Him, gain Him, experience Him, and enjoy Him is to deny whatever we are, whatever we have, and whatever we can do.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Do not bring anything to Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>He does not need what you are or have, but you need Him.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>In every way Christ wants to replace you with Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Christ has already obtained us that we may obtain Him.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Now He is waiting for us to experience Him and enjoy Him by denying all things and by counting all things loss for His sake.</S>
