<p>The key to turning the church life from the old way of meeting to the new way is to go door-knocking and have home meetings. We should immediately make an appointment to meet with those whom we baptize. We have heard many messages in the past, but we are still unable to speak. We must now learn to speak in the home meetings. As a result we will gain more than we did by simply listening to messages. People learn more when they teach a subject than they do when they study it. Similarly, a sister spontaneously learns to be a mother after she is married and has children. Whether or not we can speak, we should all speak in the home meetings.</p>
<p>Hence, our only fear is that we would not take this way. This is a glorious way with a bright future. This is the reason that we are changing the system. Before we changed the system, we saw that the old way of Christianity with hired preachers is not a living way. On the one hand, the congregation does not know if they hired a good preacher, and on the other hand, one good preacher cannot do the work of one thousand or ten thousand people. For the increase and spread of the church, we must beget new ones, nourish them, and teach them.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE HOME BEING THE BASIC UNIT</h2>
<p>A society grows through establishing homes. When homes are established, the society has a foundation. When the homes are proper and strong, the society, and even the entire country, is strong. The home is the basic unit of society, and it is the foundation of a country. The reason for Taiwan&rsquo;s strength today is that it has good homes. The parents give their children a good education. In addition, Taiwan is stable, strong, and prosperous because everyone receives a high level of education. Regretfully, we have not paid attention to the homes in the church life. We need to begin with the homes. We need to beget, nourish, and teach new ones in our homes.</p>
<p>We must give the Lord a way to lead people to salvation through door-knocking. This will cause the number of people in the church to increase. The number of people in the church in Taipei has increased by twenty thousand people from this practice. Of these twenty thousand people, six thousand are in meetings. We must be clear that this is the only way. The road is before us; we must simply follow the proper instructions, or there will be problems. We should not remain in the old way; rather, we must take the way of door-knocking and having home meetings.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE ESSENTIAL FACTORS OF THE HOME MEETINGS&mdash;<br />
THE SPIRIT AND THE WORD</h2>
<p>The first essential factor of the home meetings is the Spirit. We must be filled with the Spirit. Hence, we must pray and confess our sins every day, not once every three to five days. Especially when we are preparing to knock on doors or preparing for a home meeting, we must pray and thoroughly confess our sins so that the Lord can cause us to be inwardly filled with the Spirit. We must do this, because the first factor of the meetings is the Spirit.</p>
<p>The second essential factor of our meetings is the Word. Some people may not know how to select a topic from the sixty-six books of the Bible. We have published <em>Life Lessons,</em> in which the important points in the Bible have been compiled by topic into lessons with verses and explanations. When we meet with people, we can read the lessons with them. Instead of speaking too much, we should lead them to read by repeating, to read with emphasis, to read livingly, and to pray-read the contents of the lessons. In this way the verses, explanations, and main points of each lesson will enter into them. We simply need to visit people every week and read a lesson with them to inject God&rsquo;s Word and the light of His truth into them. In less than six months we will see the results. God&rsquo;s Word is full of life, light, and truth. When the Word enters into the new ones, it will release them and sanctify them.</p>
<p>God&rsquo;s Word supplies man with light and life. The four volumes of <em>Life Lessons</em> with a total of forty-eight lessons are in our hands. If we are familiar with the contents of each lesson, when we visit the new ones, we will know from speaking with them which lesson they need. We do not need to read through the lessons in sequence; instead, based on the need of the new ones, we can decide which lesson to read, just as a doctor gives medication according to the symptoms of his patient. The young people should thoroughly study each of the forty-eight lessons. We should understand and memorize the lessons so that we are constituted with the lessons. Then when we have a home meeting with people, we will spontaneously speak God&rsquo;s word. When we visit a new one, it will be easy for light, life, and truth to enter into the new ones because the Lord is within us, and we have His Word, light, and life.</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_027.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_029.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Three Crucial Matters for the Increase and Building Up of the Church &nbsp; pg 28</div><br></body></html>
