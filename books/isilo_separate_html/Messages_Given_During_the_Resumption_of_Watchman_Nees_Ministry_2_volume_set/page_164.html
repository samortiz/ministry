In the same way, when Satan takes hold of money, he has everything. Money is omnipotent; everything can be bought with money. To buy wood, stones, or any other things that we like, we need mammon. In this way, mammon becomes the power, the center of man's worship. Is man going to worship God or mammon? This becomes the controversy of the universe. The worship of God lies on one side of all things, and the worship of mammon lies on the other side of all things. Mammon is diametrically opposed to God. Why can mammon withstand God? It is because it is the only thing that can unify all things. Covetousness is not only a root of all evils (1 Tim. 6:10); it is even the same as idolatry. Riches are an idol. The Bible says that covetousness and idolatry are the same kind of sins (Eph. 5:5). After a man is saved, if he has not dealt with his money in a clear way, he is not yet fully saved. If a person still keeps wooden or stone idols in his house, will we accept such a one for baptism? Yet, many people have never dealt with the matter of money after they are saved. Today, we say that India is a nation of idols and that there are more idols than people in that land. Yet, there are countless more people today who worship mammon than people who worship idols. From the people in Asia to those in Africa, from the scientists to the most superstitious people, everyone worships mammon. Mammon is the most common object of worship.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>Being Delivered from Mammon to Serve God</H2><P>God wants to gain us, and mammon also wants to gain us. Unless God's people are delivered from the power of mammon, they will not have a proper testimony and cannot be proper Christians. If a man tries to hold on to both sides, he will not be able to serve the Lord well. Why did the Lord put such a harsh requirement upon the young ruler and ask him to sell all he had? That young man was quite good and had kept all the laws. But the Lord said that he lacked one thing, the most important thing, which had to do with mammon (Luke 18:18-23). The same principle applies when Zaccheus, at his repentance, gave half of his possessions to the poor (Luke 19:8). The same principle can also be seen in Acts 4 where the disciples sold their land and possessions, and no one said that any of his possessions was his own (v. 32). By the time we come to the Epistles, we see Paul saying, "He who gathered much had no excess, and he who gathered little had no lack" (2 Cor. 8:15).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>Overcoming Mammon to Have Spiritual Power</H2><P>In church history, the Moravian church was the group that had the strongest mission. Its founder, Count Zinzendorf, gave up all his possessions for the Lord. Sister Eva also gave up all that she had. A few decades ago, seven Englishmen came to China to preach the gospel. They were known as the Cambridge Seven. Among them was C. T. Studd, who was a cricket champion. He had received an inheritance of two hundred fifty thousand pounds, which equals 1.2 million U.S. dollars, and he gave it all away. When he told the British Consulate that he was going to China, the Consulate General was shocked by his consecration and dared not accept his application. After a week, Mr. Studd was still firm concerning his decision. God could use Mr. Studd in a great way because he had overcome mammon. Mammon stands in opposition to God. For this reason, every child of God has to overcome the power of mammon. If anyone does not overcome its power, he will have no spiritual power. The power of mammon does not lie in how much mammon a person possesses. Its power on the poor may be stronger than its power on the rich.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>Working Only to Sustain Our Living,<br>and Not for Making Money</H2><P>For this reason, no Christian should try to make money. Men think that it is wrong to make money by unrighteous means and that it is right to make money by righteous means. But mammon itself is unrighteous. Just as God Himself is righteous, in the same way mammon itself is unrighteous. Luke 16 mentions making friends with the "mammon of unrighteousness" (v. 9). Money is intrinsically unrighteous. Its nature is contrary to God. We have to be clear about the position money occupies. If we are not clear, it will be difficult for us to go on as a Christian. Christians cannot try to make money from the worldly people. If we do, we will lose our Christian standing. We say that our Father is over and above everything, and that we are His sons. Yet if such a person as we are would try to make money from the rickshaw coolies, whether it is ten thousand or twenty thousand dollars, it would be a shame to us. There are only two kinds of people on this earth, the unbelievers and the brothers. We cannot make money from the unbelievers. What then about making money from the brothers? Would we not feel ashamed to make money from our brothers? Hence, no one can neglect dealing with money properly. A Christian cannot make money; he can only work to sustain his living.</P><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_163.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_165.html">Next</a> </body></html>
