        <h1 class="msg">CHAPTER SEVEN</h1>
<h1 class="title">THE LIVING OUT OF THE ONE NEW MAN</h1>
<p>In this chapter we will consider how the Lord created the one new man on the cross and how we should live out this one new man.</p>
<h2 class="head1">ON THE CROSS THE LORD SLAYING THE ENMITY<br />
AND ABOLISHING THE ORDINANCES</h2>
<p>Ephesians 2:14-16 says that the Lord Jesus &ldquo;has made both one and has broken down the middle wall of partition, the enmity, abolishing in His flesh the law of the commandments in ordinances, that He might create the two in Himself into one new man, so making peace, and might reconcile both in one Body to God through the cross, having slain the enmity by it.&rdquo; The Lord created the one new man in Himself and slew the enmity on the cross. According to the context of these verses, the enmity is the law of the commandments in ordinances. The enmity is related to ordinances, which are the different ways of living among people.</p>
<p>For example, according to the Jewish ordinance, every male must be circumcised eight days after birth (Gen. 17:12). This occurs once in a person&rsquo;s life. The Jews also have to keep the Sabbath every seven days (Exo. 20:8-11). This is observed every week of a person&rsquo;s life. Furthermore, daily what they can and cannot eat must comply with the ordinances of the law. For example, they cannot eat fish that are without fins and scales (Lev. 11:9-12). They can eat birds that feed on seeds, that is, on life, but not birds that feed on carcasses, death (vv. 13-19; cf. Gen. 8:7 and footnote, Recovery Version). Cattle and animals that chew the cud and have a divided hoof are clean and may be eaten (Lev. 11:3). Consequently, camels, which chew the cud but do not have a divided hoof, and pigs, which have a divided hoof but do not chew the cud, are both unclean and may not be eaten (vv. 4, 7). Oxen and sheep chew the cud and have a divided hoof; hence, they are clean and may be eaten. Because of ordinances concerning circumcision, the Sabbath, and dietary regulations, the Jews do not mix with other people. However, according to Ephesians 2:15-16, the Jewish way of living according to the law of the commandments in ordinances was abolished by the Lord Jesus on the cross.</p>
<p>Most Christians know that the Lord Jesus took away the sin of the world on the cross, because John 1:29 says, &ldquo;Behold, the Lamb of God, who takes away the sin of the world!&rdquo; However, concerning the Lord&rsquo;s accomplishments on the cross, the Bible speaks of five things. First, the Lord Jesus took away the sin of the world. Second, He destroyed the devil, who has the might of death (Heb. 2:14). Third, our old man and the flesh were crucified (Rom. 6:6). Fourth, the world has been crucified (Gal. 6:14). Fifth, the Lord Jesus abolished the ordinances (Eph. 2:15). Because we have seen the Lord&rsquo;s accomplishments on the cross, we are being led to advance step by step in our knowledge and experience of the Lord.</p>
<p>When I was saved, I knew only that the Lord took away my sin. One day I read that the Lord Jesus destroyed the devil on the cross. This was the gospel to me, and I received it. Thus, I advanced one step in my knowledge of the Lord. Then I read in another book that my old man was put to death on the cross. I was exceedingly joyful to learn this. I read yet another book that quoted Paul&rsquo;s word in Galatians 6:14: &ldquo;Far be it from me to boast except in the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ, through whom the world has been crucified to me and I to the world.&rdquo; We do not have to make up our mind to not love the world; the world has been crucified. Why would anyone love the world that was hung on the cross and put to death? I saw a vision that day: the world has been nailed on the cross and can no longer attract me. This is the way that my knowledge and experience of the Lord advanced to another level.</p>
<p>I did not see these facts from reading the Bible myself. When new believers read the Bible, they usually ignore the deeper things, because they cannot understand the deeper things. The fallen human mind is not like fine Chinese paper that absorbs ink as soon as it is applied. The fallen human mind is like glass and marble, which cannot absorb ink. Therefore, regardless of how much we read the Bible, we cannot comprehend it fully. For this reason we need to receive help from the light that others have seen. I hope that this chapter will bring all of us to the fifth level so that we would have the further knowledge of the Lord&rsquo;s abolishing of the ordinances on the cross.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Ordinances and Barriers<br />
Brought In by Our Ways of Living</h2>
<p>Our different ways of living bring in different ordinances that result in barriers between people. Because of their way of living, the Jews cannot associate with Gentiles. Because of differences in their way of living, even people in one county cannot associate with those in another county. In Shantung Province there are three counties: Teng County, Lai County, and Ching County. The people of Teng County will not marry someone from Ching County, and they refuse to eat pancakes because the people of Ching County eat pancakes. The people of Teng County eat large steamed bread but refuse to touch a small pancake. People refuse to associate with one another even concerning something as insignificant as eating.</p>
<p>It is also very difficult for people from northern China to marry those from southern China. The men from northern China consider the southerners as barbaric and will not take them as wives; the women from southern China consider the northerners to be boastful and will not marry them. The northerners despise the southerners for being uncivilized. The northerners always wear socks when they wear shoes, but the southerners wear shoes without socks and are therefore considered uncivilized by the northerners. If a young man from the north marries a young lady from the south, his parents will rebuke him for being rebellious and not following filial piety. Therefore, not only is it difficult for Chinese to marry foreigners, but even marriage between northerners and southerners is extremely difficult. From this we can see the barriers that have been created in human communities due to different ways of living.</p>

 	<p>Common words, such as "and", "is", "but", and "the", also known as noise words, are bypassed in a search. The search string, the Spirit &amp; who, would result in an error since who, which stands by itself, is a noise word. The following is a list of noise words:</p>
	<p>$, a, also, an, and, another, any, are, as, at, be, because, been, being, both, but, by, came, can, did, do, each, for, has, had, he, have, her, here, him, himself, his, how, if, in, into, is, it, like, make, me, might, much, my, of, on, or, our, out, over, said, should, since, some, still, such, take, than, that, the, their, them, then, there, these, they, this, those, to, too, very, was, way, we, well, were, what, where, which, while, who, with, would, you, your</p>

  	<h2>Ranking</h2>
  	<p>Rank is a value from <strong>0</strong> to <strong>1000</strong> indicating how closely a match scored or ranked against the original search string. Rank values are affected by the following factors:</p>
		<ol>
            <li><span>The total number of occurrences of the original search words/phrases in a portion of a book.</span></li>
            <li><span>Content that includes the search words in close proximity to each other are ranked above those that do not. Therefore, a portion of a book that has the search words in close proximity may have a higher ranking than another portion of a book that has a higher hit count but the words are not in close proximity to one another. Therefore, we also include a search word hit count for reference.</span></li>
            <li><span>The rank values are relative to each other. Therefore, it is not possible to interpret the RANK value as a percentage or group the rank values into high/medium/low ranges. Think of rank as a method to order the results for a specific search.</span></li>

 	<h2>Search Scope</h2>
 	<h3>Include All Word Forms</h3>
	<p>This option breaks out the search string into its individual words and generates all conjugations and declensions for each word in the search phrase. A search on the word, dwell, would search for dwell, dwelling, dwelling's, dwells, dwelt, and dwelled.</p>
	<p>There is no need to use ^ (inflectional search) or * (prefix search) when using the Include all word forms search scope.</p> 
	<h3>Specified Word Forms</h3>
	<p>This option searches for exact matches of the specified words or phrases used in the search string. Use of ^ (inflectional search) with a particular word in the search string will broaden the search for that given word in that all conjugations and declensions for that word will be searched. Similarly, use of * (prefix search) with a particular word in the search string will broaden the search for that given word in that all words with that prefix will be searched as well.</p> 
	<h3>Note</h3>
	<p>Common words, such as "and", "is", "but", and "the", also known as noise words, are bypassed in a search. A list of all noise words is as follows:</p>
