   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE QUALIFICATIONS OF A WORKER</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>There are some minimum qualifications of a worker: 1 He must be a person living in the New Testament, and 2 he must be able to know God's will directly.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Without these two qualifications, a man is not qualified to work for God.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>If you find yourself unable to give guidance to the brothers without the help of a prophet, and if you find yourself unable to know God's will or render help to the churches without the help of a prophet, you are not living in the New Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>If something happens and you have to write letters, send cables, or make long distance calls to consult others, then in reality, you are consulting the prophets and damaging the New Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Many people do not understand the meaning of Acts 21.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>I did not understand it before either.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>However, during the past two or three months, it suddenly became clear to me.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Paul did not go along with the pleading of the saints from Tyre.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Was he following the leading of the Spirit or not?</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>He wanted to go up to Jerusalem, but the disciples were moved by the Spirit to advise him not to go.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Why would Paul not take their advice?</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Were the saints in Tyre wrong in speaking?</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The issue is not whether they were wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The issue is that they wanted to be New Testament prophets to Paul; they wanted to show Paul his personal path.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>This breaks the principle of the New Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Paul would rather take the wrong way and fail to know God's will than to allow a New Testament believer become his personal prophet.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>He would not allow a "fellow citizen" to become his prophet, because he knew that he was in the New Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Brothers, we are doing the same thing here.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>We can only speak about the general principles of the things of God.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>We cannot determine the personal path of others.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>We can exhort the brothers to be obedient, to not love the world, and to consecrate themselves.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>These are principles.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>But if I tell a brother to do a specific thing at six o'clock the next morning, I am doing something that is not found in the New Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>In the New Testament, we can receive exhortations from men, but we cannot receive specific instructions from men.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>We can accept principles from men, but we cannot accept detailed injunctions from men.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Today we have the right to enjoy the New Testament blessing of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>In everything that we do, we have to ask whether the Holy Spirit has first done an inward work within us, and whether we are doing this work as a result of the constraining of the Lord's love.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>If a worker is unable to know God's will directly, I would advise him not to be a worker.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>He is not qualified to be a co-worker because he is not even a Christian in a proper sense.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>A New Testament Christian must be able to know God's will directly.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>NOT BEING PERSONAL PROPHETS</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>There are two very precious things in the New Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>First, we can all be priests serving God in His presence.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Second, the Holy Spirit is within us and we can know God's will.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>If we do not have the second thing, we are only Jews and outdated believers.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The most important matter in the New Testament is that the Holy Spirit lives within the believers.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>When some among us receive the outpouring of the Spirit, they speak in tongues, prophesy, receive revelations, or experience many similar things.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>If a sister claimed that she had received a prophecy or a revelation, what would you do?</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Suppose something happened in your home.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Would you go to this sister and inquire of her?</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Would you charge her to inform you of any revelation that she has received?</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>If you did this, you would not only be relinquishing your New Testament right, but you would be opening the door to the deception of evil spirits.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>In the Old Testament there were the sorcerers, whose work was the same in principle as the work of the prophets.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The prophets conveyed to men the will of God, whereas the sorcerers conveyed to men the will of evil spirits.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Both were intermediaries.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>In the Old Testament, if a man claimed that he did not need a sorceress, he must have been an expert himself.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>However, in the New Testament, no prophet should occupy an intermediary position.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Every believer can communicate with God directly.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>In the New Testament, as long as some "sorcerers" remain, the Holy Spirit will not convey God's word to man.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>If some brothers have some gifts of the Holy Spirit as a result of the outpouring, and if they tell you to do this and that, they are acting as Old Testament prophets and being an intermediary for you.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>You should not accept their words.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>The outpouring of the Spirit cannot replace the inner leading of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Otherwise, an intermediary class of people will be produced and there will be "sorcerers."</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>THE NEW TESTAMENT WAY</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Paul refused to take the word of the believers in Tyre in order to maintain the absolute authority of the New Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>His going to Jerusalem was not a question of right or wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>He had to go no matter what would happen to him.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>It mattered little to him whether the believers of Tyre were speaking from the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>The important thing was that Paul had to learn to know God's will within.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>This does not mean that others cannot know our pathway in the New Testament age.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Others can know our path, but they cannot give us the direction.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>We can compare what we know with what others have said, but in the eyes of the Lord, we must know God by ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>We must understand His will by ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>We must be our own prophets, because the Holy Spirit is the Prophet.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>At the same time, we have to refuse to be prophets to others.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>We cannot tell others what they should do with their family affairs, what path they should follow, what things they should do, or how they should deal with the myriads of things in their daily life.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>We can only teach them the general principles of the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>If anyone comes and asks what they should do, we can answer, "This is the biblical teaching to me, but you have the Holy Spirit within, and you must seek for God's guidance."</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>We have to commit every brother and sister to the hands of God; we have to commit them to the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>If a person is not clear about God's will, it is better that he not do anything.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>It pleases God the most when we act according to His will.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>As workers we are not here to act as prophets for others, telling them what they should do.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>We should not be teachers to many.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>Our work should be for the building up, consolation, and encouragement of others.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>We should give others the biblical principles, but they have the Holy Spirit within them, and they can seek after God by themselves.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>This is the main work of the New Testament prophets.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>May the Lord be merciful to us and direct us to walk in the New Testament path.</S>
