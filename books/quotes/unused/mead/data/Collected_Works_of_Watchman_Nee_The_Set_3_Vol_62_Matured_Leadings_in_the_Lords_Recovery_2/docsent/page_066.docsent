   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>INCITING A LOVE FOR SERVING THE LORD</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>A meeting hall that is properly decorated will incite the brothers and sisters to love the Lord and to serve Him.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The job itself may be very insignificant, but if it is done by us personally, we will take personal interest in it.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>If we encourage the brothers and sisters to clean the meeting hall themselves, we will incite in the saints a heart to love the Lord and to serve Him.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>USING THE SERVICE</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>AS A MEANS FOR MUTUAL FELLOWSHIP</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Serving in practical affairs is not merely for the purpose of getting jobs done.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Through this service, the brothers and sisters find a chance to fellowship with one another.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Suppose you are cleaning the floor.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>You can take the chance to fellowship with the other brothers and sisters.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>You can ask about their names, addresses, and conditions.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>You can talk about some of your spiritual experiences, such as confession, consecration, reading the Bible, and prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Floor cleaning is a small matter, but through spiritual fellowship, this cleaning becomes a great matter.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>I hope we can all start our service with cleaning the floor.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>If we appoint others to clean the floor, we may worry that they will not want to do it.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>But if we take the lead to clean it first, no one can say anything.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>In our service we must always have spiritual feelings and spiritual fellowship.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>We must bring the brothers and sisters to climb higher in their practical service.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>THINGS TO NOTE IN OUR DECORATION</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Purchasing: There is no need to keep a detailed account of consumable items.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The tangible furniture and utensils, however, should be inventoried and registered in a book.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Specific people should be assigned to manage and maintain these items.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Every design and arrangement should be well rehearsed so that every brother and sister knows exactly what to do.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The responsible ones have to take the lead and supervise the brothers and sisters to do the same.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>I like to see the brothers and sisters serving in the meeting hall.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Anything that has the shape of a dragon or is too cheap or frivolous should be discarded.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Things that we have no use for should also be discarded.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>We should not only supervise the brothers and sisters but also should put our own hands to the work.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>In doing anything we have to be weighty; we should gain others' respect.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>If the sofa is old, we should consider getting a new one.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Every item and every corner of the meeting hall have to be thoroughly revamped.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The decor of the meeting hall should fit various occasions.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>For example, weddings, love feasts, and gospel meetings should have different kinds of banners.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>We cannot take care of anything by chance.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>We should avoid last-minute decisions.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>There must be careful planning and scheduling.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>It is inevitable that we may need last-minute arrangements sometimes.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The best way to do anything is to plan ahead.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>If any crisis happens, we can call the brothers and sisters involved and make arrangements on the spot.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The big jobs are hard, and it is not easy to neglect them.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The small jobs are easy, and it is easy to neglect them.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>But we must neglect neither the big nor the small jobs.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Any Bible or hymnal that has missing pages should be discarded.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Any copy that is torn should be mended.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>We do not want anyone to come into the meeting hall and leave with a bad impression.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>When the saints walk into the meeting hall, we want their heart, their entire being, their prayer, and their love to pour out freely in it.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>USHERING IN THE MEETINGS</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Not everyone can be an usher.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>An usher must be sober in his private life.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>He must be blameless outside the church.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Otherwise, when someone comes to the meeting and sees such a one as an usher, he may be stumbled.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>An usher must not be obsequious, but neither should he be impolite.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>He should learn to behave properly.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>In ushering one has to be gracious and warm.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>He should not be worldly but should give others the feeling of being spiritual and heavenly.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>An usher should not usher too much; he should not greet loudly and conspicuously.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Instead, he should be hidden and appear only when needed.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>An usher must mark all the new faces and give them a feeling of warmth.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>We must also learn to greet Christians from other denominations.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>We should not let them feel that we are sectarian.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>The above things seem superficial, but they are actually spiritual matters.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>We have to learn to match the outward condition of things with their inward spiritual condition.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>If we can do this, the Lord will greatly bless us and be gracious to us.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>ADDITIONAL WORDS</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Watchman Nee: On the one hand, the church has to take care of the visitation work.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>This takes care of the aspect of fellowship.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>On the other hand, the church has to preach the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>This takes care of the unbelievers.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>We have to ask God to grant us the blessing of nourishing as well as the blessing of begetting.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>The most basic work in the church is the meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>If the number of believers increases, the number of meetings will increase correspondingly.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>If we have a big number and many meetings, yet do not know how to make all the practical arrangements, we cannot meet the need of the congregation.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>If the minor affairs are neglected, the spiritual things will be wasted.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>By taking care of minor affairs properly, we help the meetings indirectly.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>Eighty percent of the so-called minor affairs are related to our meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>Therefore, our brothers and sisters must not neglect the minor affairs.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>For example, in order to deliver a message, there is the need of ushers.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>In order to preach the gospel, there is the need to sound the gong and to invite people in. Once they are in, we need ushers to lead them to their seats.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>The deacons' office is mainly for business affairs.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>Practical affairs can be headed up by the deacons' office.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>The ministers who take care of the spiritual matters are responsible for the ministry of the word, while the deacons who take care of the practical matters are responsible for the decoration, design, and arrangements of the meeting hall.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>The apostles gave themselves to prayer and the ministry of the word while the practical affairs were assigned to the seven deacons Acts 6:2-5 .</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>I hope that we will learn good lessons on the spiritual side as well as on the practical side.</S>
