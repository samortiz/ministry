	 <h2 class="head4">b. Clothed with a Garment Reaching<br />
to the Feet as a Priest</h2>
<p>Revelation 1:13 says that Christ, the Son of Man, is &ldquo;clothed with a garment reaching to the feet&rdquo; as a priest. This long garment is the priestly robe, the garment of a high priest (Exo. 28:33-35), signifying the fullness of Christ&rsquo;s divine attributes and human virtues (cf. Isa. 6:1, 3). Although the word <em>priest</em> is not mentioned in Revelation 1:13, we know by His garment that Christ is depicted here as the High Priest. Today the Son of Man, Jesus Christ, is walking in the midst of the churches, caring for them as a Priest. Among the three offices of priest, prophet, and king, the most dear, intimate, precious, and lovely office is that of the priest. The priest is so dear and lovely because he takes care of the people. In God&rsquo;s administration today, Christ is a Priest in the midst of the churches, taking care of them as lampstands for the shining of God.</p>
<p>Christ is wearing a long garment down to His feet, a perfect robe of the High Priest. In the Bible the garment signifies what a person is and what he does (Isa. 64:6; Rev. 19:8). Christ&rsquo;s long robe signifies His splendor in His virtues, which is expressed mainly in and through His humanity (Isa. 6:1). In the Old Testament a priest was not to be exposed in any part (Exo. 20:26); all parts of his body had to be clothed. Suppose the Lord&rsquo;s priestly garment was short, exposing His feet and legs. This would indicate that He lacked some virtues. However, Christ&rsquo;s wearing a perfect garment indicates that He is perfect. His long robe signifies that He is short of nothing and that this God-man has human virtues that are sufficient to cover His whole being. He has all the virtues with no shortage whatsoever. With Him, nothing is short, lacking, or needed. He is fully qualified to be a priest. He is walking in the midst of the churches as the High Priest in a perfect robe to bring the local churches into the priesthood.</p>
<h2 class="head4">c. Girded About at the Breasts with a Golden Girdle</h2>
<p>Revelation 1:13 also says that Christ, the Son of Man, is &ldquo;girded about at the breasts with a golden girdle.&rdquo; The priests in the Old Testament were girded at the loins for their ministry (Exo. 28:4). In Daniel 10:5 Christ also is girded at His loins, with fine gold. But in Revelation 1:13 Christ as our High Priest is girded about at the breasts. The breasts signify love and refer to His loving care and concern. To be girded at the loins is to be strengthened for work, whereas to be girded about at the breasts signifies care in love. Christ&rsquo;s work in producing the churches has been accomplished. He no longer needs to be girded at His loins for work. What He is doing now in the midst of the churches is to care for them in love. With respect to the work of producing the churches, the time of His labor is over. Now is the time of His loving care for the churches. This requires that He be girded about at the breasts with a golden girdle. This golden girdle signifies the divine strength. Christ is now exercising a divine care over the churches, moving among them in His humanity and caring for them with His divine strength. He is concerned for His beloved churches. What a loving care He exercises over His churches today!</p>
<p>Christ is wearing a golden girdle on His breasts. This girdle is a long piece of gold. The girdle and the gold are not two separate things. The girdle is the gold. The golden girdle is one piece of gold to become a belt. The Son of Man is in His humanity, and the golden girdle signifies His divinity becoming His energy. Christ&rsquo;s energy is totally His divinity. A piece of gold is now a girdle. The totality of Christ in His divinity has become a girdle. The golden girdle signifies Christ&rsquo;s divinity becoming His energy, and the breasts signify that this golden energy is exercised and motivated by His love. His divine energy is exercised by and with His love to nourish the churches.</p>
<p>Christ still walks in the midst of the churches. The churches are on the earth, whereas the One walking is not the earthly Jesus but the heavenly High Priest. His walking is in the atmosphere of the heavens. This is suggested by His garments. He is wearing a priestly robe and is girded at the breasts with a golden girdle. <em>Golden</em> indicates that He is divine, bearing the divine administration, whereas the girdle at the breasts indicates love. The atmosphere He brings is a divine atmosphere filled with love. We would be terrified if we saw the Lord&rsquo;s seven eyes, which are like a flame of fire. Therefore, we need to keep our gaze fixed on His breast, which is full of the divine love for us. How tender is His concern for all the churches! He even rebukes and chastises us in love. He is the loving Priest caring for His churches today.</p>
