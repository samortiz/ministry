   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>1 Two Categories of God's Doings</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>for the Called a For Him to Exist</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Prior to chapter fifteen, Abraham had experienced God as the One who protected him and provided many material things 12:16 .</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Abraham had given all the choices to Lot and had gained the victory over the four kings.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>None of these things, however, had anything to do with the fulfillment of God's purpose but were only related to Abraham's existence 12:10; 14:24 .</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>He experienced all these outwardly in his environment, not inwardly in his life.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>b For Him to Fulfill God's Purpose</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Do you know what God's purpose is?</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>God's purpose is to have a people to express Him with His image, represent Him with His dominion, and take the earth for His kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Beginning with Genesis 1:26, we see that God's eternal purpose is to have a people expressing Him in His image, representing Him with His dominion, and taking over the earth for His kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>When God came in to call Abraham He promised Abraham that he would have the blessing to express God and become a great nation so that through him God might have His kingdom on earth.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>This is God's eternal purpose today.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>But everything that had happened to Abraham prior to Genesis 15 had nothing to do with the fulfillment of God's purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>It is from chapter fifteen through chapter twenty-four that we have a record showing us how God had worked something into Abraham so that he was able to fulfill God's purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>It was no longer merely outward experiences in environment but inward experiences in life.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Most Christians today only care for their existence, not for God's eternal purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Even many among us still have not been deeply impressed with God's eternal purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Many are still hoping that the Lord will give them a better job, a good husband or wife, a good education, or an excellent promotion.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>While all of these things may enable you to exist, they have nothing to do directly with the fulfillment of God's purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Everything prior to chapter fifteen was good, helpful, and profitable for Abraham's existence, enabling him to live as a human being, but none of those things had anything to do directly with the fulfillment of God's purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Look into Abraham's situation.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Could the cattle that Abraham gained in Egypt express God?</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Could the maidservants represent God?</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Although God had given Abraham a great deal, nothing that he had was useful for the fulfillment of God's purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>To exist is one thing, and to fulfill God's purpose is another.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The principle is the same with us today.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Our education, jobs, and houses are all good for our existence, but none of them are good for the fulfilling of God's purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>2 Two Things Needed for the Fulfillment</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>of God's Purpose a The Seed</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Now we need to see the two things that were necessary for the fulfillment of God's purpose in Abraham's day.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The first item was the seed 15:1-6; see 13:16; 22:17-18; 12:2 .</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>God called Abraham with the intention of fulfilling His purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>As we have seen, His purpose is to have a people in His image to express Himself and with His dominion to represent Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>But Abraham did not have a seed.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>How could Abraham fulfill God's purpose without having a seed?</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>God needs the seed.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>He needs to have a people through the seed.</S>
