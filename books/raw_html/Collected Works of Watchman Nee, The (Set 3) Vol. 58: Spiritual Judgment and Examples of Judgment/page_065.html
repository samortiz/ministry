<h1 class="msg">CHAPTER FORTY-NINE</h1><h1 class="title">EXAMPLES OF JUDGMENT</h1><h1 class="title">(45)</h1><h1 class="scripture">Date:August 25, 1948</h1><h2 class="head1">TESTIMONY BY SISTER G. G.</h2><p>I was born into a poor family. In 1927 I accepted the Lord. Soon after, I began to confess my sins to others. I also began preaching the gospel to children. I was married at the age of eighteen. My husband was an unbelieving doctor who was involved with all kinds of evils. He loved his sins, but I loved my Lord. I began to suffer as soon as I married into his household. I have one girl and one boy, who died at the age of one month. When he died his finger was pointing toward heaven. Although my son died, I dared not look sorrowful, for fear of being criticized. I was still full of joy in my heart and was still able to sing hymns. Others thought that I was out of my mind, but they did not know me. I knew that I was the mystery of God.</p><p>Once Brother Witness Lee came to our hometown to conduct conferences. I became clear about the ground of the church and left my denomination. Everyone in my family opposed me and even beat me up. Later my mother had a stroke and was sick for four months. I took care of her all that time and learned some lessons. I prayed for a mind to suffer. The Lord's hand seemed heavy upon me all the time, and I was kept in lowly works. I have been meeting with the brothers and sisters in the church and have received the life supply from them. Gradually, I led my family to serve the Lord together in the church. Thank the Lord that my house has become a center of hospitality for the brothers and sisters. Once, I seemed to hear a voice which said, "You should be separated unto Me completely." I answered readily and said, "Lord, this is what I should do. I belong to You." I am willing to put myself in the hand of the Lord and the church and to serve the Lord together with all the brothers and sisters.</p><h2 class="head1">BROTHER NEE'S COMMENT</h2><p>Sister, you have to realize that it is not good for a person to be entirely ignorant of God's dealings, but neither is it good for him to be entirely clear about these dealings. It is wrong for a man to be completely ignorant or completely clear about God's dealings. Just as it is not good for a man to be entirely ignorant of his breathing, neither is it good for a man to be completely conscious and aware of his breathing. In the spiritual pathway, it is a wonderful thing for a man to always be in God's light and in ignorance at the same time. On the one hand, he should know everything that the Lord is doing. On the other hand, he should know nothing that the Lord is doing. Moses did not know anything about the shining on his face. Do you think his face would still have shone if he had looked into a mirror every day? No, he would have fallen into an unhealthy practice if he had done this. In our spiritual pathway, we know on the one hand, and we trust on the other hand. We have to exercise faith for at least half of the things we do. In the Christian journey, it is not a good sign if a man is totally in darkness and ignorance. However, it is equally bad if a man knows everything that God is doing in him. In God's dealings with the believers, we need to know some of His dealings, but we do not need to know others.</p><p>We have to learn to know the basic principles. Some are completely in darkness regarding the spiritual way. They are ignorant of everything that God is doing. They are totally void of light. Others know everything; they are confident about everything. This is too much. Under normal circumstances, a man should be like Paul: "For now we see...obscurely" (1 Cor. 13:12). The Christian life should strike a balance between the two extremes with regards to past knowledge and experiences. We have to maintain a blessed ignorance. There are times when we have to exercise faith in the midst of ignorance. If our sister wants to advance in spiritual things, she should not insist on knowing anything from now on. She should believe that the Lord is never wrong. If something should be known, let it be known spontaneously; she should not insist on trying to know. If a man becomes too clear of spiritual things, there is the temptation that he will become proud. When Moses' face shone, it was better for him not to know about it; it was better still for him not to look into the mirror. If he were to look at himself, it would be better for him to look when he was not shining. It is a glory to not know about one's own shining. As soon as one knows it, there is no more glory. The same principle applies to the case of Stephen's shining face. It is blessed ignorance when one does not realize that his own face is like that of an angel's. That is the time when glory shines. We cannot go to the extreme. We have to maintain a proper balance. By not knowing and not seeking to know, we do not lose any blessing. When we know too much and become too clear, it is easy for us to fall into pride, and we lose the blessing. The more ignorant we are, the easier it is for us to keep the blessing. If we can enumerate all our spiritual experiences and can clearly explain them one by one, they no longer are blessings to us. Such an action will make us proud on the one hand and chase away the blessing on the other hand. Our sister's pathway has been straight, but she has bothered herself too much with explanations and perhaps knows a little too much. You have to guard against possible pride.</p>
