   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>LIFE-STUDY OF JOB MESSAGE NINETEEN OUR UNIQUE NEED THE PROCESSED</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>AND CONSUMMATED TRIUNE GOD</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>AS THE ALL-INCLUSIVE, LIFE-GIVING SPIRIT Scripture Reading: Gal 2:20; 1 Cor 15:10; Rev 22:17</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In this message I would like to give a further word concerning the processed and consummated Triune God as the all-inclusive, life-giving Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>THE INGREDIENTS OF OUR ABUNDANTLY RICH GOD</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Our God today is no longer the "raw" God but the processed God.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>After God created man, He continued to be the "raw" God, the unprocessed God, observing, testing, and proving humanity but not yet moving or taking any action.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Then one day He began to go through a process.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Each step of this process has become an ingredient of the Spirit as the consummation of the processed and consummated Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>These ingredients include incarnation, human living, crucifixion, resurrection, ascension, and descension.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>In eternity God had the ingredient of divinity but not the ingredients of humanity and human living.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Through incarnation the ingredient of humanity was added to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>This was followed by Christ's human living and the crucial ingredient of His all-inclusive death on the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Next came the ingredient of resurrection, which is a matter of passing through death without being held by death.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Through resurrection Christ was begotten to be the firstborn Son of God Rom 8:29 , and through resurrection He also became the life-giving Spirit 1 Cor 15:45b .</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Furthermore, in the resurrection of Christ all God's chosen ones were regenerated to be the sons of God 1 Pet 1:3 .</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>In His ascension, another ingredient, Christ is transcendent.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>He is the One who is above all, and everything is now under His feet Eph 1:19-23 .</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Finally, we have the ingredient of Christ's descension as the all-inclusive Spirit to produce the church, His Body.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>As we consider all these ingredients, we can see that the processed and consummated Triune God is much richer than the "raw" God.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Of course, the unprocessed God had the divine attributes, which may be regarded as ingredients, but now He also has the ingredients of incarnation, human living, the all-inclusive death, the life-imparting and life-producing resurrection, ascension, and descension, which issue in the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>How rich our God is today!</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>He is abundantly rich, aboundingly rich.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>He is everything to us as the Spirit, who is the consummation of the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>I have sometimes been asked why we pray to the Father or to the Lord Jesus but not to the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Actually, when we pray to the Father, we pray to the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>When we pray to the Son, we pray also to the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Who is God?</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>God is the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Who is the Father?</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The Father is the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Who is Christ?</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Christ is the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The totality, the aggregate, the consummation, of the Triune God with all His ingredients is the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Therefore, in the Spirit we have the three of the Triune God the Father, the Son, and the Spirit with all the steps of God's process as the ingredients.</S>
